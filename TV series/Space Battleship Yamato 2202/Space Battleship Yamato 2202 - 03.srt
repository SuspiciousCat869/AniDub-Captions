00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,094
[REDROWZ]
Commander Hijikata,

2
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:29,472
we finally have the ships,
equipment, and crew we need.

3
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:33,476
I'd like to send them out to
investigate as soon as possible.

4
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:44,112
Ooh! Looks like you
found a nice one!

5
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:45,613
[SAITO]
I thought so!

6
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,575
I'll leave it right here
for ya, Santa. Okay?

7
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:51,119
[CHILDREN chattering, laughing]

8
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:52,620
Can't get into
the Christmas spirit

9
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,457
without a proper tree, can ya?

10
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,210
I hope it wasn't too much
trouble, Commander Saito.

11
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,464
[NAGAKURA] That old man
was maimed in the war

12
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:05,467
with Gamilas.
Lost his family, too.

13
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,926
[SAITO]
Spending time with those kids

14
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,346
gives him a reason to go on.

15
00:03:09,429 --> 00:03:11,848
So I hauled back the
biggest one I could find.

16
00:03:11,931 --> 00:03:12,974
Softy.

17
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,809
Ha. I'm just doin' my job.

18
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:16,478
Building goodwill
with the locals

19
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,147
is part of our
mission, Nagakura.

20
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,315
[NAGAKURA]
Uh?

21
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:27,739
Nobody told me we had a
bombshell at this base.

22
00:03:27,822 --> 00:03:30,158
Must've come on this
morning's transport.

23
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,243
[HIJIKATA] I understand,
Professor Redrowz.

24
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:35,163
But you need to wait until the
survey ship clears inspection--

25
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,790
then you can start.

26
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:39,542
But we're ready right now, sir!

27
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:42,420
Standard regulations. Excuse me.

28
00:03:42,504 --> 00:03:43,505
[footsteps]

29
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,423
[REDROWZ]
Wait, Commander Hijikata!

30
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:48,301
[door slides]

31
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:50,970
[REDROWZ]
We're getting nowhere!

32
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:55,684
He completely ignored my
introduction letter from HQ!

33
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,602
Damn that stubborn old fossil.

34
00:03:57,686 --> 00:04:00,271
Does he want to stay on
this rock the rest of his life?

35
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:02,107
We know that the Aquarius Ruins

36
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,567
are out there just
waiting to be explored.

37
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:07,278
So why are we wasting time?

38
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,668
[COSMODART]
So this is the outermost planet

39
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:23,128
in their system?

40
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,213
[SUBORDINATE 3A] Due to its
unusual elliptical orbit,

41
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:28,842
it's far from the ecliptic
plane. They rely on artificial

42
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,720
means to ensure the survival
of their colonists.

43
00:04:31,803 --> 00:04:35,098
[COSMODART] Then we will ensure
them a different fate.

44
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:38,768
The usual tactics
are already underway.

45
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,896
[BURRELL]
Its name is Terezart.

46
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,108
The legendary world said to
have reached the very pinnacle

47
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,527
of advanced civilization.

48
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:51,448
[BURRELL] The people of that
planet had learned to transform

49
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,575
will itself into physical power,

50
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:56,953
and bend reality
to their liking.

51
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,706
Just as there is no limit
to the imagination,

52
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:02,584
the energy that can be extracted
from the living spirit

53
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,461
has no bounds.

54
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:07,297
These people,
who wielded infinite power,

55
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,466
could have even redrawn
the constellations

56
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:11,384
if they'd desired.

57
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:13,636
[BURRELL]
At some point,

58
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,513
they transcended their
physical bodies

59
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,808
and became beings
of pure energy.

60
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:25,648
[BURRELL] Ultimately,
at the edge of a dimension

61
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,401
corporeal beings
could never reach,

62
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,905
they coalesced into
a single life form.

63
00:05:34,282 --> 00:05:36,368
[BURRELL]
That being's name is Teresa.

64
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:40,372
She is the goddess at the border
between this world and the next,

65
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:44,334
endlessly praying for
a universal peace.

66
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,463
[BURRELL] Lieutenant Kodai,
this is no fairy tale.

67
00:05:48,546 --> 00:05:51,341
Accounts attesting to
the existence of Terezart

68
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:55,929
have been found in numerous
interstellar civilizations.

69
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:59,766
All of those documented claims
are more than a millennium old.

70
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,019
But there are also records
of those she's called.

71
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,772
[gasps] "Those she's called"?

72
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:09,359
Kodai, we know the former
crew of the <i>Yamato</i>

73
00:06:09,442 --> 00:06:12,320
have experienced
a similar vision.

74
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:16,658
You each saw someone close
to you who has passed away.

75
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,703
These were the
messengers of Teresa.

76
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:22,455
[OKITA]
Kodai, board the <i>Yamato</i> .

77
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,249
[KODAI gasping]

78
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:26,334
Because she exists
on a higher dimension,

79
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:29,587
time works differently.
Teresa can see this universe

80
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:32,966
from beginning to end
all at the same time.

81
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,844
Those called by Teresa
must perform their roles

82
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:39,889
in constructing a future that
is already known to her.

83
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,163
[MORI]
Doctor.

84
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:04,956
[DR. SADO]
Hmm?

85
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,377
What do you think?
Who exactly am I?

86
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,424
Bugs you that much, huh?

87
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:18,053
That you're the only crewmember
who didn't have a vision?

88
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,602
So how's Kodai?
I've been hearin' some rumors.

89
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,188
[MORI]
All I can do is trust he's safe.

90
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:31,316
Indeed, that's a wise approach.

91
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,485
Look, Mori, in the end
it doesn't matter

92
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:35,403
who you really are
or where you came from.

93
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:39,699
We all know the person you
are right now, so who cares?

94
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:42,660
Among other things, you're
the one who believed in Kodai

95
00:07:42,744 --> 00:07:48,166
without a shred of doubt.
That's who you are. Right?

96
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:51,836
That's right.

97
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:58,385
[MORI]
So Doctor, who did you see?

98
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,889
That one's predecessor,
actually.

99
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:04,557
[meows]

100
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,311
[BURRELL] Many civilizations
have sent survey teams

101
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:11,815
to the area, but none
have found Terezart yet.

102
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:15,110
It's believed the entire planet
must be sealed away

103
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,612
through some advanced means.

104
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:20,281
These coordinates...

105
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,826
That's the same direction from
Earth as the energy waves

106
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:24,911
that made us see
the visions, isn't it?

107
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:26,246
Yes, that's right.

108
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,290
The energy waves you took
to be a distress signal.

109
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:32,002
Also, Gatlantis has been
unusually active

110
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,795
in that sector of
space recently.

111
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,839
The Gatlanteans?

112
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:38,633
[BURRELL] Despite our run-ins,
we know little about them.

113
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,094
They're warmongers
with a massive empire.

114
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,595
But the truth is,

115
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,016
we haven't even found the
location of their home world.

116
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,184
We're gravely concerned
that Gatlantis

117
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:51,730
is trying to unseal
Terezart for themselves.

118
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:55,275
And why does that
make you worry?

119
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:58,194
Why would Gatlantis want
to track down Terezart?

120
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,781
Those who unseal it can
use the power of Teresa

121
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,242
and make anything
they want come true.

122
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:07,328
At least that's what
they say in the stories.

123
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:10,081
But we believe that
it's more than a legend.

124
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:13,209
If Teresa is an entity
of a higher order,

125
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,669
then theoretically,
there should be

126
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,588
nothing in this universe
she cannot do.

127
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,548
[KODAI]
So these are just theories?

128
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,633
It's only speculation, yes.

129
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:24,763
But one fact that we do know is
you've been chosen by Teresa.

130
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,473
Chosen for what?

131
00:09:26,556 --> 00:09:30,101
[BURRELL] Not Earth,
not Gamilas, but your crew.

132
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:31,436
[KODAI gasps]

133
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,730
[BURRELL] And considering
what you accomplished,

134
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,316
I can imagine why.

135
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:41,654
Keyman, take him with you
and descend to Earth.

136
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,698
I assume you know the next stop.

137
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:44,699
Sir.

138
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,494
Go, Kodai.

139
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:51,539
It's time you see the truth
about your reclaimed world.

140
00:10:16,898 --> 00:10:19,734
What the hell is that?

141
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,912
[KEYMAN]
Our tour will last one hour.

142
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,331
That's the most
your body can take.

143
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,337
Let's go.

144
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,804
[KEYMAN] "The Reverse Syndrome."
That's what some people call it.

145
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,597
Why's that?

146
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,850
After an onslaught of
Gamilan planet bombs

147
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,060
brought your world to
the brink of destruction--

148
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:56,813
what was the system
that saved it?

149
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,982
The Cosmo Reverse.

150
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,525
[gasps]

151
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:03,236
[KEYMAN] Side effects are the
risk of any new technology.

152
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,281
But this is on a completely
different level.

153
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,832
[KEYMAN]
Without these scale cylinders,

154
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,877
a human wouldn't
last ten minutes.

155
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:36,269
[KODAI]
It's unbelievable.

156
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:41,733
[gasping]

157
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,611
[KODAI]
What is this place?

158
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:47,155
[KEYMAN]
All bright things casts shadows.

159
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,907
This is the darkness
hiding behind

160
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,284
your beautifully revived Earth.

161
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:53,495
It's a singularity
caused by the black box

162
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:56,247
you call the Cosmo
Reverse System.

163

[gasps]

164
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:08,426
[KODAI gasping]
But why?

165
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,720
Why did all of this happen?!

166
00:12:13,556 --> 00:12:14,808
[KEYMAN]
Five years to comprehend

167
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,018
the real nature of
the Reverse Syndrome.

168
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,854
Ten more years
to build the dock.

169
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:21,147
[KODAI gasping]

170
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:24,234
The time fault.

171
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:28,113
That's what those who know
the truth call this place.

172
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:31,825
[KODAI]
Time fault? How's it work?

173
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,953
[KEYMAN] For every single day
that passes on the outside,

174
00:12:35,036 --> 00:12:37,455
ten days pass in here.

175
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,499
[gasps]

176
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,710
It's from this anti-gravity
singularity

177
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:44,879
caused by the Cosmo Reverse.

178
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:49,009
That's what's distorting
time inside this cave.

179
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:51,970
You can spend 30 years building
a giant, cutting-edge

180
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:55,932
military factory, while only
three years pass outside.

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,144
[KEYMAN]
Surely you found it suspicious

182
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:02,397
how fast they churned out
the <i>Andromeda</i> ?

183
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,443
[KEYMAN] Without this place
the Wave Motion Gun Fleet

184
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:09,404
and Earth's revamp would
have been impossible.

185
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:12,991
Revamp?! That's what
you call this?

186
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:19,039
The Combined Fleet...
and the alliance...

187
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:23,418
Look... It runs even
deeper than you think.

188
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:27,714
[KODAI gasping]
Those are Gamilan ships!

189
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,634
Your global government
also sold usage rights

190
00:13:31,718 --> 00:13:33,345
for the time fault to Gamilas.

191
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,888
They what?!

192
00:13:34,971 --> 00:13:39,642
A fair price. Several colony
worlds which we had in surplus.

193
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:44,022
Including their vast natural
resources and their inhabitants.

194
00:13:45,774 --> 00:13:48,318
Gamilas can't maintain
its recent expansion.

195
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:53,782
While Earth seems eager to
try imperialism for itself.

196
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:59,537
Hmph. "Politics" and "economics"
translate in every language.

197
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:01,247
Damn it all.

198
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,333
Our voyage gave the
Earth a second chance,

199
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,835
and this is how we're using it?

200
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,214
[STARSHA]
Promise me you will be better.

201
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,674
Swear that you won't ever repeat

202
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:13,718
the same horrible
mistakes we made.

203
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,054
[OKITA]
I give you my word.

204
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:27,899
Kodai has just come
back from the moon.

205
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,612
Uh! Does that mean...?

206
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:36,908
That's right. He knows
about the time fault

207
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:39,661
and what's been
going on down there.

208
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:44,124
Once I heard he was meeting
with a Gamilan diplomat,

209
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,876
I knew that the truth
might come out.

210
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:52,132
[HIJIKATA] This new fleet is the
path Earth has chosen to take.

211
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,509
That's the reality.

212
00:14:57,721 --> 00:14:59,889
[SANADA]
Commander, I'm sorry.

213
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,933
You took a stand for us
with Earth's leadership,

214
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:04,602
and now you're paying the price.

215
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,354
[HIJIKATA]
I have to go,

216
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,858
but I hope you'll stay
and hold your ground.

217
00:15:17,741 --> 00:15:19,617
[TOKUGAWA] Now that
Hijikata's been transferred

218
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,827
it's inevitable.

219
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,912
Even if we refuse to
do the work ourselves,

220
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:26,041
they'll send another crew
who will. And if so--

221
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:29,044
That's enough!

222
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:32,172
So what then? We break
the captain's promise?

223
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:43,350
I'll refit the <i>Yamato</i>
with the Wave Motion Gun.

224
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,185
[KODAI gasping]

225
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,353
[TOKUGAWA]
Kodai, stop!

226
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,355
[MORI]
Kodai!

227
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:54,861
[TODO] I'm sorry.
After much deliberation,

228
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:59,741
we cannot authorize a voyage
to find this "Terezart."

229
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,368
Why not, Director?

230
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:05,121
After what we went through, how
can we ignore a call for help?

231
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:08,667
[KODAI]
Tell me, sir.

232
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,588
Could you have said the same
thing to Captain Okita?

233
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,632
What exactly do we stand for?

234
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,634
What about our
promise to Iscandar?

235
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,761
I know about the massive
Wave Motion Gun fleet

236
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:20,762
in the time fault.

237
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,223
[TODO]
You don't know anything!

238
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,685
[TODO] I don't care what
you think you've seen.

239
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:30,814
This decision is final.
You're dismissed.

240
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,527
[thunk]

241
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,163
Kodai.

242
00:16:48,289 --> 00:16:52,210
[KODAI] Sanada, what was
the point of it?

243
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:54,379
Our journey... Everything...

244
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:58,925
What kind of Earth were
we trying to save?

245
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,721
Three years, and we've
already forgotten.

246
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,307
[SANADA]
Not all of us.

247
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,651
Welcome back.

248
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,113
I'm sorry for not
contacting you.

249
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:21,948
We all reviewed the reports
about the time fault

250
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:25,243
that Sanada sent us,
and we agreed to meet.

251
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,454
How did you get all that intel?

252
00:17:29,706 --> 00:17:31,833
Stay on Earth in
the middle of it all.

253
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:36,963
"Hold your ground." That was
Hijikata's advice when he left.

254
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:39,215
That's why I volunteered
to refit the <i>Yamato,</i>

255
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,886
so I could gather as much
information as possible.

256
00:17:42,969 --> 00:17:46,181
But, even when I discovered
the existence of the time fault,

257
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:49,809
I couldn't stop Command from
taking the course they did.

258
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:56,900
In the end, I couldn't
stop anything.

259
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,194
[KODAI]
And what does that mean?

260
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:01,154
Orders just came down
from the brass.

261
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:03,573
Effective today, all members
of the <i>Yamato</i> crew

262
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:04,532
have been reassigned.

263
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,117
[KODAI gasps]

264
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:09,579
Don't blame yourself. It's not
because you lashed out at them.

265
00:18:09,662 --> 00:18:12,040
They didn't go
through what we did.

266
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,751
They can't possibly understand.

267
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:23,468
That voyage was supposed
to fix everything.

268
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,554
So why doesn't it feel like
the Earth has been saved?

269
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:31,434
We're on the wrong path.
This is not okay!

270
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:36,147
[KODAI]
We saw people close to us.

271
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:41,986
People we've lost, and they all
tried to tell us the same thing.

272
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,655
Somewhere out there in space

273
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:46,741
something truly catastrophic's
about to happen.

274
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,910
We know, because we
were made to feel it.

275
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:51,830
Not through words,
but through our hearts.

276
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:55,875
And the current
government of Earth

277
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,796
will never understand that.
They're never gonna see it

278
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,090
unless it's right
in front of them.

279
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:04,134
They're doing what
they think they have to,

280
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,429
to keep us alive and
protect our sovereignty.

281
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,556
But we've seen where
that road leads,

282
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,892
and we know it's
the wrong future.

283
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,811
If we stay this course...

284
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,023
This way we're headed--

285
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:22,527
how could we ever
face those who died?

286
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,739
There's a reason Teresa's
message was only sent to us,

287
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:27,949
the crew of the <i>Yamato.</i>

288
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,869
Let's go! Let's take
the ship to Terezart!

289
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,997
Come on! I can't do this alone!

290
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,344
Count me in, Kodai.
Let's board the ship.

291
00:19:47,427 --> 00:19:49,804
There's no place for us here.

292
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,808
So we'll discover the truth, and
get us back on the right course.

293
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,226
As the crew of the <i>Yamato</i>

294
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,146
it's not only what we should do,
it's what we have to do.

295
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,023
We found the right
path once before

296
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:03,068
and I think we can do it again.

gonna be like last time.

313
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:27,736
We're defying orders
and stealing a ship.

314
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,237
This is treason.

315
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,198
What's your point? You're really
telling me to stay behind?

316
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:35,785
You want every crewmember
to join you, except for me?

317
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,245
Yuki...

318
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:39,497
Because I'm the only one
who didn't see the vision,

319
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:43,376
is that it? Because I wasn't
called to Terezart?

320
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,544
Who knows why.

321
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:46,921
Maybe since that accident
took my memories

322
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,883
there was nobody in my
mind they could use.

323
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,552
[KODAI]
I don't want to put you at risk!

324
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,101
Is that right?

325
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:04,147
Then I guess we never really
understood each other, Kodai.

326
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:11,237
Yuki. Please believe me. I swear
I'll come back. Just wait--

327
00:22:12,405 --> 00:22:14,199
[KODAI]
Yuki!

328
00:22:24,668 --> 00:22:26,252
Yuki...

329
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:32,926
[CROWD screaming]

330
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:35,804
[OLD MAN 3A gasping]

331
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:36,805
[SAITO panting]

332
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,722
Hey, kid.

333
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:40,225
[BOY 3C whimpers]

334
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,377
[KODAI] I'm scared
that I might be the one

335
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,379
who gives the order to use
the Wave Motion Gun.

336
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:15,797
[SHIMA]
Was this the only way, Kodai?

337
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,798
There'll be no turning back.

338
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:18,508
[TODO]
We'll end this peacefully.

339
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:20,218
[TOKUGAWA] But we'll definitely
make the <i>Yamato</i> fly again.

340
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,929
[OKITA]
Kodai. Show your resolve.

341
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:25,140
[KODAI]
<i>Yamato</i> , take off!
