1
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,962
[ZWORDER]
Sabera. The Silver Priestess.

2
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:36,396
[ZWORDER] A unique
and irreplaceable being,

3
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,650
separate from we of Gatlantis.

4
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:45,613
To do something so unrefined
to a treasure like you.

5
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,040
[TOKO]
It is nothing.

6
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,795
[TOKO] If I can be of
service to my emperor,

7
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,840
then I don't care
what happens to me.

8
00:03:11,014 --> 00:03:13,558
[TOKO]
My name is Sabera.

9
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:17,103
The one and only.

10
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:20,982
She who pilots this
Comet City Empire.

11
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,151
Its only priestess.

12
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,652
[organ plays]

13
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:26,571
[TOKO gasps]

[TOKO gasping]

[TOKO gasps]

17
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,768
[TOKO]
The Desler Canon?

18
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:59,104
It's similar to the
Wave Motion Gun.

19
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:03,024
During our recent battle,
inside that alternate dimension,

20
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,944
we picked up readings
that matched it.

21
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:09,155
If Gatlantis has one--
a working Desler cannon.

22
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,367
[TOKO]
Wait. Why tell me?

23
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,371
[gasps]

24
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:22,043
[KEYMAN] On this ship,
what other option do I have?

25
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,342
What do you want from me?

26
00:04:29,426 --> 00:04:32,178
[KEYMAN] You're the one who
started this, remember?

27
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:34,556
If we speak openly,
we'll each become

28
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,142
the only one the
other can rely on.

29
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:41,271
You must agree that
has some value.

30
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:43,231
[TOKO]
The only one.

31
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,655
[TOKO]
I wonder about that.

32
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:07,297
[gasps]

33
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,465
Uh?

34
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:16,306
[KODAI]
Any luck?

35
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,475
[KEYMAN]
Still working on it.

36
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,603
[SHINOHARA]
Word is, the enemy knew

37
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:23,688
our exact position
in that last battle.

38
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,690
So the higher-ups think
someone on board

39
00:05:25,774 --> 00:05:28,360
is being controlled by them.
Like that Professor

40
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,445
What's-his-name
on planet Stravase.

41
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,822
Okay, but why would
they think it's one of us?

42
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:34,699
Planet Eleven, that's why.

43
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:37,327
We spent all of that
time off the <i>Yamato.</i>

44
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,455
Okay, by that logic,
what about that medic lady?

45
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:42,248
Toko Katsuragi?

46
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:43,917
[SAWAMURA] I can't believe
we have a mole hunt

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,127
just when we're about to
reach the White Comet.

48
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,504
[TSURUMI]
That's a mystery, too.

49
00:05:47,587 --> 00:05:50,423
There's no proof it's
the enemy base, right?

50
00:05:50,507 --> 00:05:51,883
Proof, huh?

51
00:05:53,176 --> 00:05:54,552
[CREW gasp]

52
00:05:55,053 --> 00:05:57,305
Still a bit choppy.
But at this distance

53
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,308
this is the best optical
data we can capture.

54
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:07,190
So that's it.
That's the White Comet.

55
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,483
[gasps]

56
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:19,452
[GOENITZ]
Desler's betrayal...

57
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:22,455
The emperor was able
to foresee it?

58
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:24,749
[SABERA]
Naturally. The eyes of Zworder

59
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,626
reach Gamilan hearts, too.

60
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,754
He knew Desler would be
misled by his emotions,

61
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:33,842
and risk his own forces in his
attempts to defeat the <i>Yamato.</i>

62
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,677
[GOENITZ]
But how shall we proceed?

63
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,346
No matter how valuable
a sample he may be,

64
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,724
now that we've lost
contact with Mil.

65
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:45,729
[ZWORDER] I care not. Let the
madman do as he pleases for now.

66
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,288
We've already absorbed
the energy we need.

67
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:06,708
Terezart has provided
for us quite well.

68
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:10,670
We will continue our plan
and set course for Earth.

69
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,965
To the home planet of the
vessel called by Teresa.

70
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:18,261
That pitiable world
predestined for destruction.

71
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:22,557
[ZWORDER]
I've grown tired of seeing it.

72
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:32,859
[glass shatters]

73
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:34,527
[TOKO]
What?

74
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,987
What?

75
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,990
[YAMAMOTO]
Katsuragi, what happened?

76
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,826
I'm just clumsy.
Do you need something?

77
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,827
Ensign...

78
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:45,038
[YAMAMOTO]
Akira Yamamoto.

79
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:49,876
That's disappointing. The enemy
mole doesn't remember my name.

80
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,544
What is that, a joke?

81
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,089
[YAMAMOTO]
Didn't sound funny to Keyman.

82
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,341
I know that you're a spy.

83
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,593
[YAMAMOTO]
Don't move.

84
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:02,097
[YAMAMOTO]
What, you're not gonna deny it?

85
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,850
If the Lieutenant says
I am, it must be so.

86
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:09,562
Because after all, we have
been open with each other.

yourselves and stay on alert.

We are closing the bulkheads.
Toko Katsuragi is on the run.

102
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:56,026
She may be working
as an enemy spy.

103
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:58,528
If you see her,
report to the bridge.

104
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:01,781
This is nuts. Could she
really be behind this?

105
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,117
And be careful.
If she's Gatlantean,

106
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,910
there's a risk
she'll self-destruct.

It's like it's

They must have some way of
controlling this super gravity.

So it's true. It's the

from that vessel.

Who are you?

My name is Sabera.

Nonsense! Sabera is my name!

I am the Arbitrator!

She who coaxes the Comet
City Empire to move!

168

I am she who realizes the
commands of the great emperor.

169
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,251
[SABERA]
I serve His Majesty.

My name is Sabera.

[GAIREN] The two Saberas
are resonating, sire.

178
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:51,946
We were careless. We have
never let this happen before.

179

in such close proximity.

They are not like us, sire.

that I follow you.

Pull the trigger.

Too late! We're being pulled in!

We're going into the center
of the White Comet!

The resonance between
the Saberas

214

has silenced the entire fleet!

Then the time has come.

You should have killed me,

Yeah, yeah, I know. It's absurd.

[TOKO]
This emotion.

225
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:50,852
I felt it with him, so long ago.

226
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:56,524
[SABERA] And it doomed
us both to suffering.

227
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,486
An anguish we could
never escape.

228
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,074
[SABERA]
Yet it felt so enticing.

229
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:07,285
A warm and beautiful pain.

[ZWORDER]
Sabera.

231
00:18:15,835 --> 00:18:19,047
[GAIREN] I fear there's nothing
more you can do, Your Majesty.

232
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,675
The two of them are
locked in this resonance.

233
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:23,927
If it continues...

234
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:26,471
[ZWORDER]
Get out.

235

[BOTH]
Uh?

236
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:32,018
[ZWORDER]
I said out! All of you!

237
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,605
[TOKO]
This feeling...

238
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:38,608
What is it?

239
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:41,611
This is love.

240
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:44,614
That force that made us suffer.

241
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,741
Zworder and me.

242
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,705
Why must you repeat it?

00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:16,521
[SABERA]
My Emperor... My Zworder.

244

[ZWORDER]
You are the Silver Priestess.

[SABERA]
I am Sifar Sabera.

246
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,118
[ZWORDER] You should know
more than other beings

247
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:34,247
that love is what leads
your species astray.

248
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,126
[SABERA]
Yes. I do know love.

249
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,210
As do you.

250
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:41,212
[ZWORDER]
No!

252
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,885
Now we can see what's
pulling down the ship.

00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,276
Roughly the size of Mars.

256
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,905
That's the core of
this comet? A planet?

257
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,740
Is that it?

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,168
[SABERA] Let us stop this.
I've told you many times before.

260
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,962
You need to confront
what's in your own heart.

261
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:24,631
Say no more.

262
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:27,342
What you seek to destroy
is not out there,

263
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,052
it is not the universe.

264
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:30,261
[ZWORDER]
Silence!

265
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,138
It is deep within yourself.

Gatlantis clearly had
the power to destroy us.

And yet for some reason,
they didn't attack.

00:21:34,868 --> 00:21:37,746
Who can say, but one
possible explanation is

277
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,750
they decided that a lone
battleship is of no consequence.

must keep moving forward.

We'll make our way to
Terezart and set it free.
