How easily people adapt
their fragile feelings,

Whether you decide to

you're going to lose something

You must not choose.

As soon as you do, you've lost.

all the same, ultimately.

to pull the trigger has not.

I see. Because I'm human?

And we have always made
the choice to shoot?

Although, there's never
been any other option.

Even if it meant
breaking our own hearts.

We've chosen to live,

And that's the way

We'll have to kill for survival.

Even if you do it right here,

That they're just electrical

like "heart" and "soul"

128

With a strength akin to gravity.

that you were not aware?

149
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:49,741
Even though we
inherit the memories,

150
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:54,454
each generation of Zworder has
differed slightly from the last.

And we from Gatlantis,

we are also humans
with individual souls.

00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:26,778
[MIL] I believe that
if we can start over,

161
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,823
if we can end a thousand
years of despair

162
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:32,742
and turn our eyes toward
a different future...

163
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,453
...we'll change things.

164
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:39,416
We'll find a way,
and I will also choose

165
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:41,376
not to pull the trigger.

[BODYGUARD 23A] Supreme Leader,
are you all right?

00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,915
[BODYGUARD 23B] The

Hurry!

00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:29,132
He's gone.

00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,010
This is such foolishness.

[TOKO crying]

[HIJIKATA]
We had a once-in-a-lifetime

180
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,361
chance at peace,

181
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:34,614
perhaps bestowed upon
us by God himself.

182
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:37,367
But in the end, it was wasted.

183
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,536
The battle will proceed.

184
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,204
What has been set into motion

185
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:44,541
can only play out
to its conclusion now.

[DR. SADO]
I...

187
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,173
[KODAI] If only we had met him
under different circumstances.

188
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:38,136
[TOKO] We cannot choose
how bonds connect us.

189
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,393
I need you to help me.

190
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:49,439
I won't speak in platitudes.

191
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:51,274
You and I both know
how this ends--

192
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,485
In one side's destruction.

193
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:56,946
[KODAI]
Even so,

194
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,406
we can try.

195
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,617
If we want to carry the
hope young Zworder gave us

forward into the next chapter,

00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,205
we must act now.

You're going, then?

199
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,181
I'm bound to this cause,

200
00:16:23,264 --> 00:16:26,726
and I will fight for
the future of humanity.

I can't sit idly by.

I implore you,
guide our people well.

Give this message to Kodai:

207
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:57,132
My <i>Neu Deusular</i>
will fight for him.

208
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,050
I swear I will
protect the <i>Yamato</i>

from the Transit Wave Motion

[DESLER]
Why did we choose to fight?

212
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:40,133
[DESLER] Why didn't we try
to love one another instead?

Hey. What's--?

What happened to you?

[SAITO]
Nothing, calm down.

I just took a relaxing
little bath, that's all.

It can't be!

[KODAI] Does this mean...
you were one of Gatlantis's...?

221
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,583
[SAITO] This is pretty much
the only way, right?

222
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:18,004
To cut a puppet's strings and
separate him from his master?

223
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,090
How long did you stay in there?

224

Greetings, Earthlings.

I have wonderful news.

234
00:18:57,085 --> 00:19:01,256
We of Gatlantis have chosen
not to destroy Earth,

235
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:04,050
in light of your
intrinsic value.

236
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:07,470
We welcome you and
your planet to be absorbed

237
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:11,558
into the glorious realm
of the Comet City Empire.

238
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,811
The time fault is wasted
on your kind, I'm afraid,

239
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,772
and it can only be used at its
full power once it has been

240
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,525
fully integrated with
the Ark of Destruction,

that only we possess.

[CITIZENS murmuring]

[GOENITZ] Never again shall
this planet bask in the light

of its star, the sun.

245
00:21:15,181 --> 00:21:18,685
Both land and sea will
dry up, and become barren,

unable to support
any form of life.

247

Therefore, the entire human
race will be sustained by

for the foreseeable future.

If you value your lives,
you will remain loyal.

[GOENITZ] And only those
who have demonstrated

allowed to live on as slaves.

Didn't they already sink?

[MAN 23E] Not yet. They weren't
listed among the sunken ships.

So, I guess they're
still afloat.

Then they're alive? Really?

That's right, as long as
we've got the <i>Yamato</i> ,

and we will die alone, too.

So why do we even meet at all?

[HIJIKATA] Kodai,
the next captain of this ship

273
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:26,683
must be you.
