[JUDGE 10A]
Enough!

9
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:45,905
You show much improvement,
Sir Noll. You fought well.

10
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,699
[NOLL gasping]

11
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,546
[GORLAND] I'm sure it's
clear from your match

12
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,840
that Noll is still
lacking something.

13
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:05,467
I'd like to help him gain it.

14
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,011
He'll soon be facing
his first real battle,

15
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:09,554
he needs to be sharp.

16
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,681
So you're taking him
Sand Dragon hunting?

17
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:13,099
That's right.

18
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:14,726
We'll go with a small party,

19
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,895
so it shouldn't affect
Terezart's defenses.

20
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:19,272
[ZURVIVAL laughs]

21
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,899
[ZURVIVAL]
I'd actually welcome not having

22
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:23,026
the mighty Gorland Fleet
hovering over my head

23
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,361
for a while.

24
00:03:24,444 --> 00:03:26,571
With you here, our Zurvival
Land Combat Division

25
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:28,573
might as well be on leave.

26
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:29,824
Have your hunt!

27
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:31,951
Take the entire fleet
with you if you like.

28
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:35,663
Our division can guard this
measly planet with men to spare.

29
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:39,668
[GORLAND chuckles]
Of course. You never change.

30
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,087
Neither do you. Times like this,

31
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,089
I can almost convince
myself I'm speaking

32
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:46,049
to the previous Lord Gorland.

33
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,551
Your predecessor was also
a man who spared nothing

34
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,971
for the growth and development
of his juvenile form.

35
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:53,264
Despite the fact that--

36
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,308
[GORLAND]
Yes. Despite the fact

37
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:57,977
that it was tantamount
to caring for oneself.

38
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,939
An act typically unthinkable
for a Gatlantean.

39
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,273
However, he understood

40
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,776
that he would eventually
be replaced by me,

41
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,446
and that I would have to inherit
the Gorland name and fleet.

42
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,281
[ZURVIVAL] Sir Noll has
inherited your form splendidly--

43
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:12,158
[GAIREN]
It's a mysterious thing.

44
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:15,537
Gatlantis has no concept of
father and son, yet they speak

45
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,707
of their successors as if
they were their children.

46
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,793
We may be artificial life,
but having been created

47
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,921
with human-like intelligence,
perhaps these instincts

48
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:28,258
are an inescapable
byproduct of our design.

49
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:30,802
If this is true, then one
is forced to wonder if--

50
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:32,887
[ZWORDER]
Silence, Gairen.

51
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:36,391
[ZWORDER] Infinite power
springs forth from Terezart,

52
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:39,686
and its source, Teresa,
is within our grasp.

53
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:43,690
Once we have her, all that
we wish for will come true.

54
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:47,819
Everything that comes before
that is a mere diversion.

55
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,780
And what of the ship
that Teresa calls?

56
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:54,659
Is this <i>Yamato</i> a mere
diversion as well?

57
00:04:56,453 --> 00:04:58,288
[GAIREN] You hoped to prove
that the "love" they claim

58
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,915
to know is no more
than self-serving desire,

59
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,085
and have them destroy themselves
along with the Gamilan fleet,

60
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,296
yet this ship managed
to escape your trap

61
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:09,007
without sacrificing
a single life.

62
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,300
[ZWORDER]
An act of chance.

63
00:05:10,383 --> 00:05:12,677
Don't give them more
credit than they deserve.

64
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,179
[GAIREN]
There is very little room

65
00:05:14,262 --> 00:05:18,016
for "acts of chance" where
Teresa's prayers are concerned.

66
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:21,394
After all, it was her prayer
that set these events in motion

67
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,774
when the <i>Yamato</i> answered
the call to come to her aid.

68
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:28,193
That a pure copy would
infiltrate the crew of

69
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:31,696
the <i>Yamato</i> is a fortunate turn
we could not have anticipated.

70
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,159
Was this an "act of chance"?
Impossible to know.

71
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:39,412
I can see the fear you hold
in the back of your mind.

72
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:43,667
But is it solely a fear of
Teresa? Or something more?

73
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:46,586
Doctor. I have the results.

74
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,296
Ah. That was quick.

75
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,840
So helpful that you had
your medical certification.

76
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:53,051
[TOKO] Just from an accelerated
course during the war,

77
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,177
but thanks.

78
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,137
Ohh...

79
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,931
[KODAI]
That bad?

80
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,308
What's that? Oh.
No, everything's fine.

81
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:01,893
Everything? You're sure?

82
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:05,313
Sorry. I think Yuki's
just worried about me.

83
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:07,649
Well, I could give you
some vitamin supplements.

84
00:06:07,732 --> 00:06:10,235
[KODAI]
No, I'm fine. Excuse me.

85
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,745
[sighs]

86
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:34,009
What exactly is
the problem here?

87
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,635
You're not seriously
having second thoughts

88
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:37,053
about this mission now, are you?

89
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:39,681
I estimate we're about a third
of the way to Terezart.

90
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,266
But if we continue
our current course,

91
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,601
we'll be crossing
paths with this...

92
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,604
[SHIMA]
...the White Comet.

93
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,106
[gasps]

94
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,524
[SANADA]
Kodai.

95
00:06:49,607 --> 00:06:51,985
The Gatlantean who was
manipulating that professor--

96
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,445
you said he indicated to you

97
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:55,989
that the White Comet
was their home planet?

98
00:06:56,072 --> 00:06:57,866
No, not exactly.

99
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,284
That's nice and vague.

100
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:00,493
[KATO]
But so's everything else,

101
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,537
even the message from
Terezart, right?

102
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,415
It was just the one weird
vision, then nothing since.

103
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:06,958
[SANADA]
Whatever the case,

104
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,668
even a small risk
of encountering

105
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:12,130
the enemy's main force on our
own is too great to ignore.

106
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,007
If we want to consider
turning back to Earth

107
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,135
to formulate a new course,
now's the time to do it.

108
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,305
[TODO]
Brave crew of the <i>Yamato,</i>

109
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:23,016
I commend you on reaching
this stage of your journey.

110
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,934
I will now inform you
of the decision

111
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,728
made by Earth Headquarters.

112
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,563
You are to maintain
your current heading

113
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:31,691
and gather as much information
on the White Comet as possible,

114
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,360
to determine whether
or not it is

115
00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,528
indeed a Gatlantean stronghold.

116
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:38,448
The discovery of and
arrival at Terezart--

117
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,326
that of course will remain
your ultimate objective.

118
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:42,702
But more immediately,

119
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:45,413
we must know what threat
this comet poses.

120
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:47,874
So you're ordering us
to go closer, sir?

121
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:49,751
[TODO]
I won't tell you how close.

122
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,587
I leave that to your discretion.

123
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:55,882
[MORI]
Kodai?

124
00:07:57,676 --> 00:07:59,135
[KODAI]
It's fine.

125
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,304
It's not like the <i>Yamato</i> 's
objective has changed.

126
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:05,141
We'll continue on,
like we always have.

127
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,352
[DR. SADO] I'm concerned
about our acting captain.

128
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:11,064
He seems exhausted,
both physically and mentally.

129
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:13,775
From the time we received
Teresa's message until now,

130
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,276
he's been under
constant pressure

131
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,237
without a moment's rest.

132
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,532
Between his conflicted feelings
about using the Wave Motion Gun,

133
00:08:20,615 --> 00:08:24,160
and the shock of encountering
the Gatlantean fleet...

134
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:28,665
You're worried he might buckle
under the stress, right?

135
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:30,458
He may put up a strong front,

136
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,169
but he's really a
sensitive man at heart.

137
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,379
Yeah.

138
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:35,130
[MORI]
Excuse me.

139
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:36,381
[BOTH]
Hm?

140
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,391
[HIJIKATA]
Don't mind us.

141
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,561
Kodai's a fighter.
He'll find his way.

142
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,815
But, he's the man you
chose to be with.

143
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:57,027
You already know that better
than anyone, don't ya.

144
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,403
Yes.

145
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:02,699
Yes.

146
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:05,827
Listen up, there's only one
landing force on this ship,

147
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,828
and that's us.

148
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:08,288
There's no one to replace us.

149
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,373
So what we lack in
numbers and firepower

150
00:09:10,457 --> 00:09:13,126
we'll have to make
up for with skill.

151
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:14,794
Huh?

152
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:17,213
What the hell is that?

153
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:18,631
[NAGAKURA]
Commander.

154
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:29,684
[YAMATO CREW A]
Never seen these before.

155
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,603
[YAMATO CREW B]
What are they?

156
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,199
[SANADA] They appear to be
some sort of life forms.

157
00:09:44,282 --> 00:09:46,576
Pending further study,
consider them dangerous.

158
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:48,578
Ensure that they're not
released from their capsules

159
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,662
aboard the ship.

160
00:09:49,746 --> 00:09:51,247
Sure are pretty to look at.

161
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:53,792
Shame we can't let 'em out
to brighten things up.

162
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,294
Hey. This is a military
ship, remember?

163
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,463
Yeah, yeah, I know.

164
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,341
Huh? I heard the XO
wanted more samples

165
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,842
so I was just bringing
these to him.

166
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:05,053
[KODA] I heard it was Chief
Intelligence Officer Niimi.

167
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,930
Hey, hold up--Niimi isn't here.

168
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:08,807
Oh. Right, she's still on Earth!

169
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,559
Where'd you even hear that
from in the first place?

170
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,357
Oh. Hey, Acting Captain.

171
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,983
Nanbu?

172
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,652
Check it out, fireflies.

173
00:10:20,735 --> 00:10:23,363
I hear we had these on Earth,
too, once upon a time.

174
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,949
Pretty aren't they? Take one.

They're so beautiful.

00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:33,748
Huh? What's all the
commotion about out here?

179

Let's show the others.

Huh. That's peculiar.

So cool. Takes me back
to when I was a kid.

184
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:53,101
I can practically taste my
Grandmother's rice cakes.

Tsubasa, Makoto.

Uh?

00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:28,887
Oh, Lieutenant Keyman.

00:11:35,518 --> 00:11:39,147
[DR. SADO grumbles]
Not good. Not good at all.

[TOKO]
What isn't?

193
00:11:40,648 --> 00:11:41,941
These fireflies.

194
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,360
[TOKO]
How so?

195
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,695
[DR. SADO] You haven't felt
anything from them?

196
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,947
No. Why, have you?

197
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:51,951
[DR. SADO] Huh? Nah,
I prefer to stick to saké.

198
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:56,748
[WOMAN]
So pretty! Just look at 'em!

00:11:57,665 --> 00:11:58,958
Ahh, heh!

200
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,585
Hey, are we sure this is safe?

201
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:03,546
They said not to let those
things loose, right?

202
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,633
[NAGAKURA] What's up with him?
He's like a zombie.

Kodai.

207
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,565
How's it feel being Lady
Luck's favorite captain?

208
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:23,733
[NAGAKURA]
Hold on, Commander.

[SAITO]
Back on Planet Eleven,

213
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,576
then on Stravase, too.

214
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,829
Dumb luck is all that saved you.

215
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:37,288
Far as I can tell,
you haven't made

216
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,499
a single smart decision yet.

217
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,084
[KODAI]
You might be right.

218
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,003
[SAITO]
Yeah, so what about next time?

219
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:45,213
Are you gonna keep puttin'
your half-assed ideals

220
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:48,133
above the lives of
everyone on this ship?

221
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,055
Then I say turn us around
and take us back to Earth!

222
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,224
Me and my people
want off the <i>Yamato.</i>

223
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:59,019
Put us on a ship that will
actually fight back!

[door opens]

225
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:04,858
I don't wanna serve
on a ship of cowards.

226
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:06,818
[KODAI]
Take that back.

227
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:11,197
Take it back!

[NAGAKURA]
There you are!

231
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,837
Chief Operations Officer Mori,
this is bad!

232
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,840
It's our Commander and
Acting Captain Kodai!

233
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:34,304
Kodai? What's wrong?

234
00:13:35,138 --> 00:13:38,266
[SAITO] Maybe you know what it's
like to lose people in battle.

235
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,185
But you have no idea
what we went through.

236
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:42,812
The hell we suffered down there.

237
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,189
Me, I was lucky.

238
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,983
Old Man Hijikata pulled
me out, saved my life.

239
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,236
For that, I owe him a
debt I can never repay.

240
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,697
But most of our people
weren't so lucky.

241
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,241
Their final moments were
spent waiting for a salvation

242
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:56,785
that would never come--

243
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,372
crawling in their own blood,
choking on the stench of death.

244
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,374
Go on, take a deep breath!

245
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:05,085
Even all the way out here
in the vacuum of space

246
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:07,253
you can still smell it!

247
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:11,841
[SAITO] All of us who survived
now carry a burden.

248
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,511
The burden of the ones who died.

We survived.

Now it's up to us to settle the
score and avenge their deaths.

and you let it go!

disrespect the <i>Yamato.</i>

Hey, it's fine. Let 'em fight.

266
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,235

'em to blow off some steam.

267
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,654
[AMAGI] That's crazy.
Somebody's gonna get hurt here.

[KURATA] Go on, Commander!
This guy's got nothin' on you!

269
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,743
Both of you, that is enough!
Stop it right now!

[alarm blares]

271
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,580
It's the engine.

272
00:15:23,663 --> 00:15:26,291
The Wave-Motion Core
is becoming unstable.

273
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:28,585
I'm detecting an abnormal
amount of backflow

274
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,504
coming from the energy
conduction tubes.

275
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:32,589
That's it.

276
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,549
Try that frequency range.

277
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,595
It's working.

278
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:40,347
So if we broadcast this
throughout the ship,

279
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,349
we can break the hypnosis.

280

[SAITO grunting]

281
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,561
What the--?

It's an emergency!
Take charge here!

Uh, yeah. Leave it to me!

00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:04,704
These things...

287
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,332
It's like they're trying
to eat our power systems.

Sanada!

Kodai! Good, you're here.

290
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,879
Now, Chief. I want you
to start diverting energy

291
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,173
from the Wave-Motion
Coils to the Engine Room.

292
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:17,008
[TOKUGAWA] That might
burn off the fireflies,

293
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:18,259
but it's still a big risk.

294
00:16:18,343 --> 00:16:19,928
If they eat through
the conduction tubes

295
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:22,847
and the pressure drops
it'll be too late. Hurry!

296
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,183
Gauge it wrong, and a
power surge like that

297
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:27,060
could blow up the ship!

298
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,480
There's no choice. Do it, Chief!

299
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:33,650
[ANALYZER] Everyone,
please hold your breath now.

300
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:49,624
Well, that was effective.

307

[DR. SADO] Well, those things
were more virus than bug,

309
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,605
but same idea. [grunts]

310
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,649
I wasn't entirely sure
that it'd work,

311
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,985
but this seemed like a
good time to test it out.

312
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:18,278
We owe you, Doctor.

313
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:19,779
[DR. SADO]
Oh, don't mention it.

314
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:21,573
Besides, you were the one
who neutralized their effects

315
00:17:21,656 --> 00:17:23,158
on our brainwaves, right?

316
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:26,286
[SANADA]
No. Actually, that was Keyman.

317
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:31,708
[TOKO]
Was your trick still intact?

318
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,878
I thought I might meet
you if I came here.

319
00:17:37,547 --> 00:17:40,633
[TOKO]
Ahh, such warmth.

320
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,427
[KEYMAN]
What are you doing?

321
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,098
[TOKO]
I'll keep quiet for you.

322
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:52,187
[GATLANTEAN SOLDIER 10A]
It's happening again!

323
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,814
Cosmo waves emanating
from Terezart!

324
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:02,322
Hey, Sanada. What's that?

325
00:18:02,405 --> 00:18:04,824
[MORI]
No objects detected on radar.

326
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:07,869
[OTA] Spatial distortion and
energy emissions increasing!

327
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:11,122
It could be...
a dimensional projection.

328
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,500
The question is from where.

329
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,878
[SHIMA]
Evasive maneuvers!

330
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,421
No, wait!

331
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:33,019
Kodai.

332
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:36,106
Time and space are no
obstacle for communication,

333
00:18:36,189 --> 00:18:40,276
but some things you cannot be
shown until you come closer.

334
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,905
You've risked much and ventured
far based on faith alone.

335
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:47,659
And as thanks, it is time
that you were offered proof.

336
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:55,917
[KODAI] Captain Okita.
I'm not good enough.

337
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,254
I've failed to unite the
crew as their commander.

338
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:03,299
I wasn't even able to keep
your promise to Starsha.

339
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:08,179
I don't know what to do.
<i>Yamato</i> deserves better.

340
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:11,891
[OKITA]
Kodai, you're doing a fine job.

341
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:13,435
[gasps]

342
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:17,814
Keep at it. You're far
stronger than you know.

343
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,736
Oh, Captain...

344
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,656
Listen to your heart--it will
tell you which course to take.

345
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,826
Wait, Captain, please don't go!

346
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:31,578
Captain Okita!

347
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:34,372
[OKITA]
Follow your heart, Kodai.

348
00:19:46,634 --> 00:19:48,720
[SANADA] So this is
what the vision meant.

349
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:50,680
This is our proof.

350
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:53,224
Teresa.

351
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,987
Beautiful.

352
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,034
Teresa.

353
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,710
[HIJIKATA]
You realize what you're asking?

354
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:24,089
What do you say, sir,
will you accept the job?

355
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:27,217
I fear I'm not
the man I once was.

356
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,848
But yes, I will join
your crew on this voyage.

357
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,726
I've seen the vision,
too, after all.

358
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,228
We all saw it, right?

359
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:39,354
[KURATA]
Yeah.

360
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,272
Me, too. A vision
of my older sister.

361
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,982
[SHINOHARA] Well I think
we can say you're not just

362
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,361
guests anymore. Welcome to
the crew of the <i>Yamato.</i>

363
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:50,240
[KATO] What about you?
Who did you have a vision of?

364
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:52,242
I, uh...

365
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:56,496
I don't really know, but I
guess I've been called, too.

366
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,249
That's right. And I'll be
counting on your help.

367
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,959
You got it.

368
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:03,253
[SANADA] You know we
still have the option

369
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:06,589
to turn back if we want to.

370
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:09,092
The orders from HQ gave us
wide enough discretion

371
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:11,553
that we could justify it.

372
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,847
Let's move forward.

373
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,391
There's someone out there
waiting to be saved.

374
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,852
All she has left is a prayer.

375
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,812
But no matter how hopeless
things may seem,

376
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:22,313
she's still holding
on to the belief

377
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:25,150
that her prayer can be answered.

378
00:21:27,193 --> 00:21:30,905
Just like humanity
not so long ago.

379
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:36,369
[KODAI] Set course for Terezart.
We warp in two hours.

380
00:21:39,706 --> 00:21:42,959
I'd expect no less from
your children, Okita.

381
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:52,297
[GOENITZ] What? We're giving
that man a fleet?

382
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,465
[RAZERA]
Yes, sir.

383
00:23:53,548 --> 00:23:55,633
By order of His
Imperial Majesty.

384
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:58,636
[GOENITZ] Why? That loser
was practically a corpse

385
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,639
when we found him
drifting through space.

386
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,026
You should know
that in Gatlantis

387
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:14,944
there is no place for
defeated generals,

388
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:17,155
and there are no second chances.

389
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:19,157
It is an exception
that one such as you

390
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,159
is being entrusted with a fleet.

391
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,036
Be grateful to His Majesty.

392
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:23,912
[ZWORDER]
Sabera.

393
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,372
[SABERA gasps]

394
00:24:25,455 --> 00:24:29,417
Show more respect to the
former ruler of a nation.

395
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:34,464
[ZWORDER]
You are here because I believe

396
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:37,008
there's something
you can show us.

397
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:40,929
Something we have no word
for in our language:

398
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,223
Vindictiveness.

399
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:49,646
[ZWORDER] To that end, I've
prepared the ideal prey for you.

400
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:54,567
What do you say,
Supreme Leader Desler?

401
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:59,114
[DESLER]
I am most grateful.

402
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,575
[SHIMA]
We're surrounded!

403
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:03,618
[KODAI] Full speed ahead!
Get us out of here!

404
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:04,828
[MORI]
We're completely surrounded!

405
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,162
[NANBU] Just how big
is this enemy fleet?

406
00:25:06,246 --> 00:25:07,580
[TOKUGAWA]
Open all intake valves!

407
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:08,998
[SANADA] The <i>Yamato</i> is
about to be destroyed!

408
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,208
[DESLER]
Watch closely.

409
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,043
You claimed that was
your job, didn't you?

410
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:15,255
I am a man who does
not forget humiliation.
