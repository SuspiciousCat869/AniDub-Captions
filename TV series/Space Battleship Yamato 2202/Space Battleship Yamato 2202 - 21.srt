When Zworder rebelled,

However, no matter how he tried,

We're under AI command?

157
00:12:58,768 --> 00:13:00,395
What is the meaning of this?

158
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,772
What exactly is this G plan?

159
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,566
Because we have the time fault,

160
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,944
we're able to create an
endless supply of weapons now.

161
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,738
But we're still human,

162
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:11,823
and we'll reach our
limits very soon.

163
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,950
So, in response,
we'll reduce crew numbers

164
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,410
by substituting AI.

165
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,121
And also, we'll use our
weapons more efficiently

166
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:19,664
by modifying the human body.

167
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:21,541
[gasps]

168
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:23,918
This is war, and if
it keeps dragging on,

169
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:25,587
then we'll resort to
desperate measures

170
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,381
to ensure the
survival of humanity.

171
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:31,801
So while we still can,
we're preserving typical DNA.

172
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,803
And if worse comes to worse...

173
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:37,015
Then we can escape from Earth
in pursuit of other frontiers.

174
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,641
That's the G Plan, isn't it?

175
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,226
How could we do that?

176
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,520
Even if we're carrying
reproductive cells,

177
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:45,857
producing human beings from
them is a complicated process.

178
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,109
And this ship isn't
equipped for that.

Right. Do you see?

That's why most of the
<i>Ginga</i> 's crew is female.

182
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:57,035
Fully mechanical production
will be possible eventually,

183
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:59,245
but it's not at present.

184
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:01,498
The last bastion of humanity.

185
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:03,792
Even if we replace
limbs with machines,

186
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,669
our bodies must remain.

187
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,338
If the human race
is to survive--

188
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,632
Do you really have to
take it to such extremes?!

this was humanity's solution.

gravitational pull
of the Comet Empire.

209
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,183
It will be difficult for the

Remaining ships,
if you can hear me,

[YAMANAMI]
As for this ship,

213
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,819
I'll approach the comet's
gravitational core,

00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:16,031
and attempt to destroy the
enemy's source of gravity.

00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:20,744
But that'd be suicide!

The <i>Andromeda</i> going in alone,
without any support?

You're right.
With the comet's ability

218
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,500
to control that much mass,

219
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,753
the <i>Andromeda</i>
can't do this alone.

[SANADA]
Captain, may I offer my opinion?

221
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:36,009
If we were to amplify the

222
00:15:36,092 --> 00:15:37,761
using the <i>Ginga</i> 's
Cosmo Reverse,

223
00:15:37,844 --> 00:15:39,304
even that would be
enough to damage

224
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:41,097
the enemy's gravity source.

225
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:46,478
[GINGA AI] Achieving the
aforementioned desired effect

226
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:49,147
would put far too much

227
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,524
We cannot afford to implement
such an unreliable plan
