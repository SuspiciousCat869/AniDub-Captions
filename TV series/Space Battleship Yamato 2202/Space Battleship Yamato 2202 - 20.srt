Situation inside
the ship is normal.

[CREWMAN 20A] Wave Motion
Engine hasn't restarted.

7
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,705
Heavy damage to the core
block may be the culprit.

They're saying they'll join

00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:30,890
the Gamilan fleet that's
already been deployed,

15
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:33,268
and make Mars our
final defensive line.

[YAMANAMI]
I swear on my life.

21
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,290
I will save the <i>Yamato</i> .

22
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:37,248
[YUKI]
Who are you? Sorry.

23
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:40,877
You're with the
UN forces. Aren't you?

24
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,463
I... I'm confused.

25
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:48,677
Hold on. Where am I?
And who are you?

26
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,644
[KODAI]
Why?

27
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:02,440
[KODAI]
Why?

28
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,986
[OKITA] While doing battle
with the Domel Fleet,

29
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,407
a Gamilan sec-ops team
infiltrated the <i>Yamato</i> .

30
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,411
Chief Operations Officer
Mori was abducted.

31
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:16,663
Lieutenant Kodai was
then ordered to rescue

32
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:19,249
Chief Operations Officer Mori.

33
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,710
Kodai carried out his
mission successfully

34
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:24,587
and returned her
safely to the <i>Yamato</i> .

35
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,091
[OKITA] After this rescue
operation was complete,

36
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,927
the <i>Yamato</i> departed
from Gamilan territory.

37
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:35,432
At that point, we set a
new course for Iscandar.

38
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:41,855
[OKITA] Crew of the <i>Yamato</i> ,
this is Captain Okita.

39
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:45,066
We have finally
reached Iscandar.

40
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,901
Take a good, long look.

41
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,529
Our destination lies before us.

42
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:51,031
As your captain, I have...

43
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:53,158
[NAGAKURA] Are you saying
that Mori's memories

44
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,576
aren't gonna come back?

45
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:57,495
[KEYMAN]
Not exactly. They have returned.

46
00:04:57,579 --> 00:05:00,373
The ones she lost in
the accident, that is.

47
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:02,334
But, in exchange...

48
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,003
[NAGAKURA]
She lost all her memories

49
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:06,963
from the last four years?

50
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:12,344
From that period on the <i>Yamato</i> ,
going to Iscandar and all that?

51
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,055
And her relationship with Kodai?

52
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:17,015
[KEYMAN sighs]

53
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,975
[NAGAKURA]
Couldn't it just be temporary?

54
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:20,727
Something could jog her
memory, and reverse it--

55
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,730
[KEYMAN] The chance of
that is close to zero.

56
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:27,942
Or, at least, that's
Doctor Sado's assessment.

57
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:29,569
Let's just focus on our work.

58
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,988
Hey, wait! You can't--

59
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:40,163
[ZEMURIAN CHILDREN laugh]

60
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,082
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A] There are
a lot of them here today.

61
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:44,376
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B] We were
able to analyze their language.

62
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:46,252
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A] They seem
fit to receive the memories

63
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:47,712
of Zemuria.

64
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:49,839
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
Let's borrow that one.

65
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:52,592
[ANALYZER]
What is this? Who are you?

66
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,764
That's no ordinary stone slab!

67
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,724
It looks like some
kind of screen!

68
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:03,853
This is Gatlantean writing, too.

69
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:05,563
[ANALYZER]
Gatlanteans!

70
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,607
[ZEMURIAN CHILDREN] Artificial
soldiers that were given nothing

71
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:11,027
but an instinct for battle
and a sense of loyalty.

72
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,862
No better than
livestock, in the form

73
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,989
of a green-skinned human.

74
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,116
Analyzer?

75
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,118
Whaddaya think's
gotten into him?

76
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,537
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A] These
Gatlanteans are the ideal pawns

77
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,122
in the game of war.

78
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:25,083
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B] No harm
will come to the Zemurians.

79
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,626
Zemuria.

80
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,170
I believe it's the
name of this planet.

81
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:33,341
From what I can tell,
it seems like a Zemurian

82
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:38,138
memory system, and I
believe that Gatlantis

83
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,473
was created on this planet.

84
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:44,602
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
But Zemuria violated a taboo.

85
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,232
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
Type-Zworder.

86
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,360
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
It was a top-of-the-line model,

87
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:55,196
which used a sympathetic
wave network.

88
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,115
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
With a complicated mental model

89
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:59,325
and vast memory capacity,

90
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:02,120
he could also handle
intelligent warfare.

91
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:05,915
He had somehow transcended
being Gatlantean.

92
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:07,959
At that point, he was...

93
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,627
[ZEMURIAN CHILDREN]
...human.

94
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,676
[ZWORDER]
Why? Why do you not awaken?

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,554
Why do you refuse to accept me?

96
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:23,641
[GAIREN] You know that the
Ark of Destruction shall

97
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,144
only awaken when it
has been determined

98
00:07:26,227 --> 00:07:29,522
that humans are an evil species.

99
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:32,567
But... this judgement has
been left for the humans

100
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,653
to decide amongst themselves.

101
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:38,615
We may have been created
in humanity's image,

102
00:07:38,698 --> 00:07:42,452
but nevertheless, our lives
are inherently artificial.

103
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:44,662
We have no right to pass
judgement upon them.

104
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:46,581
That is exactly why!

105
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:48,625
We have every right.

106
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,714
[ZWORDER]
We, who leave no descendants.

107
00:07:54,798 --> 00:07:57,425
Who are devoid of
all love or ego.

108
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,971
We were created as the purest
of all intelligent beings.

109
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,264
We are a new species,

110
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:06,685
made to help release
humanity from their karma.

111
00:08:06,768 --> 00:08:08,853
We're a noble race.

112
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:27,330
[GAIREN] Do you truly intend to
disrupt the slumber of the dead?

113
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:28,957
The Ark of Destruction
is essentially

114
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,710
the polar opposite of
the Seed-Sowing Ark.

115
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:35,005
It only heeds words that are
spoken by the human race,

116
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:37,215
so I'll offer her.

117
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:39,968
The woman whom I love the most.

118
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:45,348
[ZWORDER] An arbitrator who will
judge the fate of humanity!

119
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:52,981
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
It was punishment

120
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:56,109
for breaking the taboo.

121
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,569
Livestock that begins to think

122
00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,697
like a human cannot remain
livestock for long.

123
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,574
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
And so, Zworder rebelled,

124
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:04,325
and that is when the
war between humans

125
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:07,037
and Gatlanteans first began.

126
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,204
[NAGAKURA]
How is it?

127
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:09,914
No good.

128
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:13,084
He needs the <i>Yamato</i> , to be
connected to the main host.

129
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:14,711
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
Yes, we demand to be connected

130
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:16,087
to the main host.

131
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,505
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
This unit's meager capacity

132
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:19,966
is not sufficient to
support our consciousness.

133
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,593
Hold on, you two.

134
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:24,012
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A] We are
the storytellers of Zemuria.

135
00:09:24,095 --> 00:09:25,263
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
We are only doing our duty

136
00:09:25,347 --> 00:09:27,098
to pass on the records
of this planet to those

137
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:30,101
who possess the appropriate
level of intellect and memory.

138
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:32,062
Oh, so you're sayin' our
brains aren't big enough,

139
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,104
is that it?

140
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:34,356
These little punks
just took over

141
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,274
Analyzer without asking!

142
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,277
We can't take them
onboard the <i>Yamato</i> !

143
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,655
Yes, but, we want intel

144
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:45,867
and this planet's
precise location.

145
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,619
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
We apologize, but we do not know

146
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,372
the present coordinates
of Zemuria, either.

147
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,873
Wait, what do you mean?

148
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,042
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
The witch did it.

149
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,127
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A] Indeed,
it was the betrayer of humanity

150
00:09:56,211 --> 00:09:59,339
who chose to side with
the Gatlantean rebels.

151
00:09:59,422 --> 00:10:00,757
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
That witch assisted Zworder and,

152
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,759
together, they enveloped
all of Zemuria

153
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:05,011
in an impenetrable, white fog.

154
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:09,099
A witch? We'll take
them to the <i>Yamato</i> .

155
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,899
[ZWORDER]
Sifar Sabera.

156
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,652
Are you able to hear my voice?

157
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:46,344
I'm afraid there
isn't much time.

158
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:49,764
The substitute cells will
break down very shortly.

159
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,602
So, remember. The humans:

160
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:55,729
think of how they treated you,

161
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:59,274
a fellow being just
like themselves.

162
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,277
Do not forget what
they robbed us of.

163
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:08,950
[ZWORDER] With all of your rage,
your sadness, and despair.

164
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,453
Pass judgement upon them!

165
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:17,250
[SABERA screams]

166
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,473
[ZWORDER]
Let us end the suffering.

167
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:37,729
[ZWORDER] Humans steal from,
and kill each other for love.

168
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,647
Eradicate the
suffering from which

169
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:44,069
they can never escape,
as long as they live,

170
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:48,990
using the sole salvation
known as destruction.

171
00:11:49,074 --> 00:11:51,659
[SABERA]
No. No.

172
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,370
[TOKO gasps]

173
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,899
[BURRELL] This battle alone
will decide the fate

174
00:12:22,982 --> 00:12:26,945
of all humanoids living
throughout the universe.

175
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:29,072
For the pride of Gamilas,

176
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:31,741
we will defend the
planet together.

177
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,287
[BURRELL]
The rise or fall of humanity

178
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,832
depends upon this battle!

179
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,299
[BERGER]
This isn't the time to bring up

180
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:50,677
political ideology,
so I will help.

181
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,721
But can we really win?

182
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,683
I'm not sure. It could
all be futile.

183
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,028
Ichinose! Faster hands!

184
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,654
[gasps] Sir!

185
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:10,905
[SHIMA] The trim lever
must be used within

186
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,116
two tenths of a
second when turning.

187
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,327
[ICHINOSE]
Yes, sir. Two tenths, got it.

188
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,291
[ICHINOSE]
These hands are so useless.

189
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,085
I'm going to swap them out soon.

190
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:25,754
Swap them?

191
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:27,964
[ICHINOSE] They've recently
started making high-performance

192
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:31,426
prosthetic limbs
in the time fault.

193
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,179
They're normally reserved
for the wounded.

194
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,389
I could volunteer.

195
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:46,941
Gatlantis's gravity.

196
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:51,154
Recalculate the source, and then
reset the limit for approach.

197
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,416
[SAIJO] This is your seat,
Mori. Remember?

198
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,505
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

199
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:12,425
Eh. It's fine. You will soon.

200
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,343
Huh?

201
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:18,598
[SAIJO]
That's Captain Juzo Okita.

202
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:20,850
[YUKI]
I know that name, at least.

203
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:23,603
He fell in battle on
this ship, didn't he?

204
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:42,789
What are you hoping
to accomplish here?

205
00:14:42,872 --> 00:14:45,792
I don't recall asking
anyone for help.

206
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:49,462
[TOKO] I wish they
would have let me die.

207
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,177
[TOKO]
You saved me against my will

208
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,471
and then expect my gratitude?

209
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:01,307
[KODAI]
Something's been bothering me.

210
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:06,187
All Gatlanteans mock love and
try to deny that it has value.

211
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:09,858
[KODAI]
I wonder.

212
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:11,484
Could that be proof
that they experience it

213
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,403
and recognize its
power, like us?

214
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:15,238
[TOKO gasps]

215
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,865
[KODAI]
Maybe they were hurt by love

216
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,616
and made to suffer
because of it.

217
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,494
Is that the real reason
they hate it so much?

218
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,376
We've learned something.

219
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,046
The <i>Yamato</i> 's on a
planet called Zemuria.

220
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,301
[KODAI]
You know it, right?

221
00:15:36,384 --> 00:15:40,597
You're aware that this was
the home planet of Gatlantis.

222
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,434
It used to be green
and bountiful.

223
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:48,897
In fact, once upon a time,
it looked a lot like Earth.

224
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,691
But that was more
than 1,000 years ago.

225
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,489
[KODAI]
And you saw it.

226
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,743
[TOKO gasps]

227
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,081
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
The last human from Zemuria.

228
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,749
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B] She may
be a copy of the traitor,

229
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:10,877
but, nevertheless, pure Zemurian
blood runs in her veins.

230
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,337
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
Thus, she's the obvious heir

231
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,588
to this archive.

232
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,590
We give all the records
of this planet to her,

233
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,467
the last Zemurian.

234
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,930
[ZWORDER] We, unlike
you humans, do not have

235
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:26,017
the ability to produce
biological children of our own.

236
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:30,772
However, this child
will eventually be me.

237
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,732
He is my future.

238
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,154
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B] Because
Gatlanteans are not swayed

239
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:40,240
by feelings of love,
they are pure,

240
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:44,035
and therefore able to create
a truly just society.

241
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,662
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
However, even Zworder,

242
00:16:45,745 --> 00:16:47,288
who preached these philosophies,

243
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:49,582
couldn't escape love,
in the end.

244
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,337
[ZEMURIAN 20A]
Who could have imagined that

245
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:57,215
the King of Gatlantis would
have a wife and child?

246
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:59,467
[ZEMURIAN 20B] The traitor
was playing house, was she?

247
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,804
Acting like a mother
to an infant clone?

248
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,889
[ZEMURIAN 20C]
Now, if you value the lives

249
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:07,100
of this woman and
child, you'll talk!

250
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:11,646
Tell us where your forces
will gather, or else!

251
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,024
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B] It was a
shameful act, but the Zemurians

252
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,276
had grown desperate.

253
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,610
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
With those whom he loved

254
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:21,239
held hostage, Zworder made
a difficult decision.

255
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,992
Made a decision...

256
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,002
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
Zworder's decision was

257
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,046
ultimately meaningless.

258
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:37,297
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
Using the information that

259
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,341
they had obtained from
interrogating Zworder,

260
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,967
the Zemurians were
able to put down

261
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,929
the Gatlantean rebellion
with very little effort.

262
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,890
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B] And then,
they turned their blades

263
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,976
on Zworder. They
broke their word.

264
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,353
And as for his wife and child...

265
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,063
[TOKO gasps]

266
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:14,084
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
But, somehow, Zworder survived.

267
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,377
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
He found the remaining

268
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,047
Gatlantean soldiers,
and they all left Zemuria.

269
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,718
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A] But that
was far from the end of it.

270
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,763
Zworder had established
a new objective.

271
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,015
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20B]
The legacy of the ancient

272
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,601
Aquarian civilization,
rumored to lie, sleeping,

273
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:34,479
on the edge of a starless void.

274
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:38,858
Zworder's new ambition was to
wake the Ark of Destruction.

275
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,819
Please, no.

276
00:18:50,453 --> 00:18:51,913
Why?

277
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,790
[SABERA]
This darkness.

278
00:18:53,873 --> 00:18:56,751
It has taken root
within your heart.

279
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,295
You don't need to
destroy the universe.

280
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,840
Only the hate in your heart.

281
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,633
Please, Sabera.

282
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm begging you.

283
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,264
You cannot do this.

284
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:32,537
The final judgment
has already been made.

285
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,372
It is the ultimate
result of a search

286
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:38,460
that persisted for 100 years.
Further pursuit is useless.

287
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,794
We have to accept it--

288
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,921
[ZWORDER]
I refuse.

289
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:44,382
We still have
the data, after all.

290
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:46,259
We can reproduce Sabera,
but this time

291
00:19:46,343 --> 00:19:49,679
with certain restrictions
imposed on her memories.

292
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:52,098
Then she can awaken
the Ark of Destruction.

293
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:56,770
That's the only way our
pursuit can possibly end.

294
00:19:56,853 --> 00:20:00,398
If any problems arise,
do it again until it works.

295
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:03,651
We can produce as many
copies as we need.

296
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,238
Humans were a faulty species
from the beginning.

297
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:11,659
Their pitiful existence is
cursed with the burden of love.

298
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:32,889
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
Zemuria was destroyed,

299
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:36,267
and everything was covered
in a pallid darkness.

300
00:20:46,236 --> 00:20:49,489
[ZWORDER] As long as humans
remain the way they are,

301
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:52,701
they will never escape
the karma of love.

302
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:58,373
[ZWORDER] What being could
have created them like this?

303
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:01,668
Who infested the universe
with such a plague?

304
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,338
[ZWORDER] The ancient
Aquarians' experiment

305
00:21:05,422 --> 00:21:08,091
was a miserable failure.

306
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:11,594
This evil species
must be eradicated.

307
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:19,269
[ZWORDER] And then, we will
await the rise of a new species.

308
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:22,147
One that brings peace
and order to every corner

309
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,648
of the known universe.

310
00:21:23,732 --> 00:21:26,359
A new form of intelligent life!

311
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:29,863
[ZWORDER]
The Great Comet City Empire,

312
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:32,490
with the Ark of
Destruction at its core,

313
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,868
will burn away all suffering!

314
00:21:34,951 --> 00:21:38,371
This is the true
embodiment of love!

315
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,251
[ZWORDER]
Sabera!

316
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,432
[KANZAKI] Warp interference
field has disappeared.

317
00:21:57,515 --> 00:22:00,935
Gravity gradient surrounding
Gatlantis is rising.

318
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,064
This is consistent
with prediction B-7.

319
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:06,608
The White Comet has
begun to travel.

320
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,443
[SAKI]
Finally.

321
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:12,072
All ships, secure the area
to the withdrawing limit!

322
00:22:19,621 --> 00:22:21,790
[KANZAKI]
Incoming gravitational waves!

323
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,418
Contact Mars Defense Fleet!

324
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:28,213
The Comet City is leaving
the space around Saturn!

325
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,924
There's a high probability
that it's warping to Mars!

326
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,676
Remain on alert!

327
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:51,499
[ZEMURIAN CHILD 20A]
The one that will play

328
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,876
the tune of destruction.

329
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,669
[ZEMURIAN CHILDREN]
It has a name: "Golem."

330
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,129
[KEYMAN]
You have to tell us where it is!

331
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,589
[YAMANAMI]
The killing will not stop.

332
00:25:57,672 --> 00:25:58,923
It will go on forever.

333
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,468
[SAKI] This ship belongs
to us, to all of humanity!

334
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:03,053
Raise the ship, now!
