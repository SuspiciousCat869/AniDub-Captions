Hey, honey. Are you okay?

00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,903
Yeah. I'm all right.

5
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:26,154
Glad to hear.

6
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:27,989
But I can't find my brother.

00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:29,157
Huh?

Or my dad.

10
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:39,459
Don't worry. I bet they went
down to the mine already.

11
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,795
I'll help you look
for them later, okay?

12
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:42,921
You will?

13
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:44,798
Yeah, of course.

[HIJIKATA] We still have
the means to fight,

31
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,295
and a number of ways we
could make this hard for you.

32
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:51,883
But we don't want to increase
casualties on either side.

33
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,635
We'll surrender.

34
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:57,138
Surrender? That word
does not translate.

35
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,516
We admit our defeat and
will lay down our weapons

36
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:01,685
to end this fighting.
In exchange--

37
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:06,439
You wish to bring this combat
to an end? Then die.

38

[COSMODART]
Fight until you die. All of you.

[ALL gasping]

43
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:32,257
[SAITO] "Fight until you die"?
That works for me!

44
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,885
But I can't let these civies
get caught up in a war.

45
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:39,889
That there's our escape plan.

46
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:44,561
One ship? There's no way
we'll all fit in that.

47
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:47,188
Maybe you could
send the children.

48
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:49,357
But they've already
set up a blockade.

49
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,901
You can't do the kind of flying
it would take to slip past

50
00:06:51,985 --> 00:06:53,403
if kids are on board.

51
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:58,074
Exactly. We'll have to put
all our chips on you.

52
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:02,328
Huh? Now wait just a minute.
Why'd you pick me?

53
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,254
Don't tell me. This is because
I'm a woman, isn't it?

54
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,673
[SAITO] We're in a lake of fire
and someone needs to bring back

Heh.

58
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:52,962

[NAGAKURA] I'm not abandoning
them. It's a rescue mission.

63
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,923
[NAGAKURA]
I'll bring back a ship.

64
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:41,261
[NAGAKURA]
I swear it.

65
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:12,917
[SHIMA] This is the enemy fleet,
as captured by

Master Sergeant Nagakura
before she entered warp.

67
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:19,591
[KEYMAN]
Gatlanteans.

68
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:22,469
If they're this far down our
throat in our own system,

69
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,346
how did we not notice?

70
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,930
Hang on. During the war

71
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:29,184
Gamilas had a supply base on
Planet Eleven, didn't they?

72
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,436
That's right. Since
it's on the far outskirts

73
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,147
of your system we had to
set up an artificial sun.

74
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,691
Since the truce,
the world's been colonized.

75
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,610
Do we know how many people?

76
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:42,280
Over the last three years a lot
of civilians have settled there.

77
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,907
Apparently it's been
more than 40 hours

78
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,617
since the Gatlanteans ambushed.

The comm channels
are still down.

Oh man. Then what
about the survivors?

[SHIMA grunts]

[TODO]
It's a dire situation.

83
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,504
We never expected that
Gatlantis would advance

84
00:09:57,587 --> 00:10:00,006
into our solar system
this rapidly.

85
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,091
[KODAI]
All right.

86
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,176
Then why are you telling
us to stay away?

87
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:05,220
[TODO]
It's a significant enemy force.

88
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:08,973
The Yamato could never face them
alone. It's not your fight.

89
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:12,185
You are to continue your mission
to Terezart as planned.

90
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,812
But we're the closest!

91
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:15,814
Uh?

92
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:18,817
What's the plan for rescuing
the survivors down there?

93
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,903
Trust me. We'll do
everything in our power

94
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:24,698
Once we've coordinated
with the Gamilan military

95
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,658
we will set out to
retake Planet Eleven

96
00:10:26,741 --> 00:10:28,785
and hope we're not too late.

97
00:10:35,792 --> 00:10:39,045
[SHINOHARA] We'll just pass by?
We're not gonna rescue them?

98
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,298
[KATO] Yeah.
That's the word from the top.

99
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:44,759
[SHINOHARA sighs]

100
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:47,053
[KATO] You know I heard this
Terezart mission was allowed

101
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:49,806
because Gamilas has been
pushing hard for it.

102
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,726
You think that's why the brass
doesn't want us to stop?

103
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:54,227
I doubt that.

104
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,772
There's a Gammie onboard.
Maybe he's calling the shots.

105
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,360
[SHIMA] Based on our
current coordinates,

106
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:05,697
this is our shortest route going
full speed ahead from here.

107
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,742
[SHIMA] We've calculated
the origin point of the signal

108
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:11,870
that caused the visions, and
if we warp every 16 hours

109
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:15,623
the <i>Yamato</i> can get
there in 29 days.

110
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:19,544
[KEYMAN] As you can see, Planet
Eleven is a long way off course.

111
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,379
Remember your objective:

112
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,299
Responding to Teresa's call
as soon as possible.

113
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:26,009
And finding the truth
behind her message.

114
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:28,219
[YAMAMOTO]
Her message was a distress call.

115
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,389
The <i>Yamato</i> 's objective is
to answer a cry for help.

116
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:33,475
That's my understanding.

117
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,726
Uh. Hey!

118
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:37,312
And if we are rescuers,
isn't it contradictory

119
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,856
to simply watch while
our own people drown?

120
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,775
It's not right.

121
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,986
I know you, don't I?

122
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,071
[YAMAMOTO]
Yes, I'm the pilot

123
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,948
whose life you saved,
Lieutenant.

124
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,993
[KEYMAN] Why are you here? This
is for high-ranking officers--

125
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:54,496
I thought Gamilans and
Earthlings had the same rule.

126
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,332
We don't abandon our own
in times of need.

127
00:11:57,415 --> 00:12:00,502
This may sound cruel,
but it's too late for them.

128
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:02,671
By now they're probably dead.

129
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,215
We can't know for sure
unless we go there!

130
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:07,008
We already found one survivor!

131
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:09,052
[KEYMAN] This argument
is a waste of time.

132
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:12,389
I'd like to hear the acting
captain's decision.

133
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:17,852
[KODAI]
Anyone would tell you

134
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:21,189
charging through their line
would be suicide.

135
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:25,235
But compared to what we faced
at Balun, it's nothing.

136
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:26,611
[BOTH]
Mm...

137
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,572
We're gonna learn from
Captain Okita's tactics.

138
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:31,241
Kodai.

139
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,285
[KODAI] We'll warp out
between the artificial sun

140
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:35,704
and the surface.

141
00:12:35,787 --> 00:12:37,497
It's too risky!

142
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,250
If we force the <i>Yamato</i> to warp
out that close to the planet,

143
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,168
the damage from the
gravitational forces

144
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,504
will knock the Wave
Motion Engine offline.

145
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:46,464
We'd need two hours to fix it.

146
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,509
Same for shock cannons
and Wave Motion Shields.

147
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:51,052
I understand that, Chief.

148
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:54,931
[KEYMAN] Very bold.
Certainly Okita's style.

149
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:57,183
But are you certain
this is the right choice?

150
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,185
Should the <i>Yamato</i>
take on this much risk

151
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,646
just to collect dead bodies?

152
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,190
Those colonists made a gamble
when they sent her up--

153
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,860
betting that she could break
through the blockade.

154
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,695
Right.

155
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:11,281
[KODAI] But they made
an even bigger bet.

156
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:14,492
That they could survive until
she brought back help.

157
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:17,746
And if they could believe
in that, then so will we.

158
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:25,045
All crew, report to battle
stations and prepare for warp!

159
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:29,215
Begin rescue mission!
We're going to Planet Eleven!

160
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:38,058
[KODAI] If we can't save people
drowning right in front of us,

161
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:41,394
how could we hope to
help save the universe?

162
00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:44,606
[KEYMAN] That's not exactly
what Yamamoto said.

163
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:47,734
Well that's what it sounded
like to me and everyone else.

164
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,235
I'm sure.

165
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,363
Do people become deaf to reason

166
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,365
when they see a
vision from Teresa?

167
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:57,702
Maybe so. Or maybe...

168
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,413
...it's because
we're on the <i>Yamato.</i>

169
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:04,250
The <i>Yamato</i> as it is now
has a major weakness.

170
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,753
This isn't like your first trip.

171
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,259
[KEYMAN]
I think you know what I mean.

172
00:14:13,343 --> 00:14:15,345
[door closes]

173
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:19,182
[KATO]
Say what?

174
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:20,517
[KEYMAN]
As your advisor,

175
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,936
I can at least try
to mediate the risk.

176
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,437
Huh...?

177
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:27,190
[KEYMAN] I already have approval
from your acting captain.

178
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,901
[sighs] You heard the man.

179
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:32,654
Everyone update your call
signs for this mission.

180
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,406
I don't want anyone
accidentally shooting

181
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:36,449
Mr. Gamilas from behind.

182
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:37,826
[CREW]
Sir!

183
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:39,744
What are you planning to do?

184
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,663
Since we've decided to do this,

185
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:45,834
let's get it done quickly
so we can all move on.

186
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:53,008
[SAIJO]
Warping in 10... 9...

187
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,050
...8... 7...

188
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,177
[NAGAKURA]
Hang in there, Captain.

189
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:59,931
And everyone else.
I'm bringing back the <i>Yamato.</i>

190
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:00,598
[SAIJO]
...1.

191
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,474
Warp.

192
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,851
Warping!

193
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,071
[SAITO grunts]

194
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,917
Well, well.

195
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:31,212
Thought for sure I was dead.

196
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:32,297
[TOKO]
Commander!

197
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,631
[SAITO grunts]

198
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,352
[SAITO]
This way!

199
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,523
Commander, look!

200
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,294
Hey, where's the <i>Yamato</i> ?

201
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:14,839
My brother said it's the best.
He said if it comes

202
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:18,134
it could take out
these monsters in no time!

203
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:23,139
It'll come. I am sure of it.

204
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:34,776
[gasps]

205
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:37,737
[GATLANTEAN SOLDIER 6A]
Gravitational interference waves

206
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:40,323
detected. Something
may have warped out.

207
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:42,575
It's still a little too soon
for the Eighth Mobile Fleet

208
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,828
to have arrived. Show me.

209
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:46,746
[GATLANTEAN SOLDIER 6A] We can't
determine exact location

210
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,498
inside planet's gravity field.

211
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:52,168
Order all deployed forces
to search the ground! Hurry!

212
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,677
Survivors are confirmed.
Eliminating the enemy now.

213
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:11,396
Ha. They came! They really came!

214
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,357
<i>Yamato</i> ...

215
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,615
[KODAI] Shima, can we hover
over that bridge?

216
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,077
There's some strong wind. We'll
need to use the rocket anchors.

217
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,996
Okay, do it. Nanbu!

218
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,539
Sir.

219
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:31,416
[KODAI] I want you to coordinate
with the soldier down there

220
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:34,711
to evacuate those survivors.
Bring 'em in fast.

221
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:36,046
Aye-aye!

222
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,928
Over here! Hurry!

223
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:49,517
Enemy fleet approaching
from four o'clock, sir!

224
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,646
Here they come... Kato!
Cut off those ships!

225
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,191
[KATO]
Just a few little crabs, sir.

226
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:21,383
[KEYMAN]
Gotcha.

227
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:28,348
That Gammie's not half bad.

228
00:18:28,431 --> 00:18:29,391
[SHINOHARA]
Commander!

229
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:30,517
[KATO]
What's wrong?

230
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,185
[SHINOHARA]
Sorry, one slipped past!

231
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:33,561
[KATO]
All right, I'm coming.

232
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:34,938
[YAMAMOTO]
I've got it.

233
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:47,033
[YAMAMOTO gasps]

234
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:54,624
[SAIJO] Enemy destroyer
approaching from your six!

235
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,835
All of the evacuees
have boarded, sir.

236
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,421
[KODAI]
Retract the rocket anchors!

237
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:01,631
Let's get out of here, now!

238
00:19:19,315 --> 00:19:21,234
Damn it. I can't stop it!

239
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:23,111
[SURVIVORS chattering]

240
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,279
[SAITO grunts]

241
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,868
What's wrong? Feels like they've
got the <i>Yamato</i> on the run!

242
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:37,542
Surface-to-Air Missiles! Fire!

243
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:43,923
Type Three... Fire!

244
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:35,058
[SAIJO] Uh. I'm picking up
something strange in orbit.

245
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:37,394
There's a large-scale
fold in phase, sir.

246
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:38,728
What?

247
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,403
[GOENITZ] Almighty Emperor,
ruler of us all,

248
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:50,407
I come before you with great
humility, to make my report.

249
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,783
As you ordered,

250
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,744
the Eighth Mobile Fleet
has reached the Zol System.

251
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,413
[KEYMAN]
No...

252
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:24,000
[YAMAMOTO gasps]
What the...?

253
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,807
No. The <i>Yamato</i> !

254
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,627
[KODAI]
How can there be that many?

255
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,629
[SAIJO]
Current total exceeds 15,000.

256
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,423
[SANADA]
That shape. Don't tell me...

257
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,008
[NANBU]
They'll cause a supernova?

258
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:19,175
[KODAI]
I've tried to do these things

259
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,678
that shouldn't even
be in question.

260
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,848
[SAITO]
Kodai! Fire the Wave Motion Gun!
