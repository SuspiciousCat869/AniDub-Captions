Hm. Interesting.

That suggests she's
not Gatlantean,

and I think it's
also safe to say

she's not a revenant made
from a human corpse.

She's allowing us to
hold her prisoner.

00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,709
If she were a Gatlantean

Once the strike team

just to the rear
of the rock layer.

So the rock shields us
from the missile fleet

00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,518
and buys us time to regroup.

destroy the rock layer,

on the same side. Why?

What about the <i>Yamato</i> ?

Patience, Noll.
The key to any victory

197
00:13:25,462 --> 00:13:28,173
is meticulous preparation.

Whatever this is,

it's interacting with
Terezart's gravitational field,

214
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,247
and creating some
sort of turbulence!

Good! Finish the hunt!

[NOLL] Shouldn't we deploy the

If we're concentrated like this,

00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,377
when the <i>Yamato</i>
fires her cannon--

225
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,630
There's no way for them to aim
it, not in that turbulence.

If we leave now,

The irrational human emotion

on the surface.

316
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:38,640
We should prepare for the
threat before we proceed.

317
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:42,310
Agreed. Coordinate with
the Space Cavalry.

318
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:46,272
Develop a plan for deploying the
Wave Motion Excavator Missiles.

319
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:47,857
Sir!

320
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,672
[ZWORDER] What is it that
drives them to go so far?

321
00:25:15,755 --> 00:25:17,632
[SAITO]
The real star is here now, huh.

322
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,843
[NANBU] Did they steal the
technology from Gamilas?

323
00:25:19,926 --> 00:25:21,302
[SAIJO]
It's dangerous! Evacuate!

324
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,387
[SANADA]
Just a little more.

325
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,888
[KEYMAN]
Believe in Kodai and the others.

326
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,808
[KODAI] We will now
descend to Terezarium.
