1
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,514
STRIKER: Affectation
control system rebooting.

2
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,281
Ensign Ledo, your resistance
here is meaningless.

3
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:34,081
-It can't be.

4
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:38,081
So this whole time,
I've been talking to--

5
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:42,947
-Striker X3752, pilot support
interface system, all of this

6
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:45,247
has been a fabrication
of your own design?

7
00:00:45,347 --> 00:00:48,614
STRIKER: Indeed, the pilot of
this craft no longer exists.

8
00:00:48,714 --> 00:00:51,581
However, I am carrying on
Commander Kugel's mission

9
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,547
since he is no longer able.

10
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,647
All of my activities
follow his plan

11
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:58,081
in accordance with the
Commander's primary objective.

12
00:00:58,181 --> 00:00:59,847
-What did you say?

13
00:00:59,947 --> 00:01:01,214
STRIKER: Commander
Kugel designed

14
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:03,381
the social organization
of this fleet.

15
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,147
It is a system that
provides structure

16
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,114
and a sense of
solidarity via worship

17
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:10,081
of this machine as
a supreme being.

18
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:12,281
I am no longer an
independent mobile weapon

19
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,181
supporting a single pilot.

20
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:17,014
I have come to be the focal
point of this collective.

21
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:19,314
They are dependent upon
me, and thus, all of them

22
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:21,547
have become my users.

23
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:24,681
In order to provide them with
and maintain the stable union

24
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,281
that they need, I
must regulate them.

25
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:29,014
This is most
efficiently accomplished

26
00:01:29,114 --> 00:01:32,047
by means of pressure
and absolute control.

27
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:35,647
Once they have acquired peace
and prosperity as a whole,

28
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:38,914
I will have fulfilled the
purpose of my existence.

29
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:40,314
-You're insane.

30
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:43,147
STRIKER: What I am is a human
race support and enlightenment

31
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:44,847
regulation system.

32
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:48,581
That is to say, in the
eyes of humanity, I am God.

33
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,281
-You are not a god.

34
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,414
You talk of peace
and prosperity?

35
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,681
They have nothing.

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,414
They have just become
your mindless slaves.

37
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:00,414
STRIKER: As long as I am the
sole, absolute supreme ruler,

38
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:02,747
the people are free from
their responsibilities

39
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:06,081
of having to make decisions
or think for themselves.

40
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,314
Ensign Ledo, as a
human being, you too

41
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:10,947
must have felt the anxiety
and stress associated

42
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,247
with choice and free will.

43
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:15,881
I offer you this
optimal recommendation.

44
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,647
Worship me.

45
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:18,781
Obey me.

46
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:21,614
Become part of the world
over which I preside.

47
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:23,014
-What was that?

48
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:24,981
-Unacceptable.

49
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:28,481
Informing Striker
X3752, your logic

50
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,514
is faulty and does not compute.

51
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:33,181
One who abandons thought
and decision-making deviates

52
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:35,581
from the core
definition of human.

53
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,381
It is inconceivable that you
can perform your function

54
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:41,481
as a support interface
for this many users.

55
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:45,447
-I have been entrusted with a
command and rule over humanity.

56
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:48,881
My decisions are the
consensus of the human race.

57
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,181
And humanity is dependent on me.

58
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:54,114
Therefore, my current self
cannot be servant but must be

59
00:02:54,214 --> 00:02:55,414
master.

60
00:02:55,514 --> 00:02:59,514
Machine caliber
K6821 Chamber system

61
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:03,681
should serve me and the human
race that I have unified.

62
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:04,914
-Negative.

63
00:03:05,014 --> 00:03:08,081
I'm a pilot support
enlightenment interface system.

64
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:10,347
My purpose is to serve humans.

65
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:13,781
It is not my function to serve
a being that claims to be a god.

66
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:15,414
-Chamber.

67
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:17,314
-Striker system,
you have exposed

68
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,514
a weakness in your programming.

69
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:20,747
Hypothesis.

70
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,414
Because your pilot's course
of action was incorrect,

71
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:26,247
your system's reasoning has
also reached an illogical

72
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:27,214
conclusion.

73
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:28,314
The result is regrettable.

74
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,347
Your malfunction
calls into question

75
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,447
the design of our
support systems, which

76
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:38,347
places in doubt the very
worth of our existence.

77
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:39,581
Conclusion.

78
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:41,814
Our priority is to eliminate
this dangerous defect.

79
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:45,781
Striker must be shot
down and destroyed.

80
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,181
-I guess to you this is
like family dishonor.

81
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:51,647
-Despite this unexpected
situation, ensign,

82
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:53,481
you have consistently
thought rationally

83
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:56,047
and made the correct
decisions as a human being.

84
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:57,914
As a result, even
now, I have been

85
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:01,447
able to maintain functions
within normal parameters.

86
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:02,481
-Negative.

87
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:05,414
Both of you are in
a state of rampancy.

88
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:06,781
-We have a duty to uphold.

89
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:07,481
Come on, Chamber.

90
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,047
Let's take her out.

91
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:09,881
-Roger.

92
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:11,114
I am in full agreement, ensign.

93
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:40,778
-Gather your courage.

94
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,745
This is the moment
of truth, people.

95
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:43,778
HERIC: The engine's dead.

96
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,711
And there's a fire
on the aft deck.

97
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:47,511
We need to abandon ship.

98
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:48,911
-No, Heric.

99
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:51,078
Continue firing the cannons.

100
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:54,411
Even if it costs me my life,
they will not get the relics.

101
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,511
-But, sir.

102
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,545
-We left to seek our own
course on the verdurous waves.

103
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:02,178
We gave up the
protection of Gargantia.

104
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:05,645
No matter what, we will not
be brought to our knees.

105
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:06,845
-Commander.

106
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:09,278
-Evacuate all
noncombatants immediately.

107
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:11,245
[explosion]

108
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,578
Pinion.

109
00:05:19,678 --> 00:05:21,045
-That was the last one.

110
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:22,711
All that's left are
the weapons that

111
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:24,578
still need time to charge up.

112
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,311
-When can we fire again?

113
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:28,445
-We've got three minutes
till the next one.

114
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,978
After that, we'll have one
shot every five minutes.

115
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:35,645
-I can't count on
anything around here.

116
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:39,045
I got a bunch of total
blockheads manning this junk.

117
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,278
You're all useless.

118
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,045
Every last one of you pinheads.

119
00:05:42,145 --> 00:05:45,211
I'm better off doing
everything all on my own.

120
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:46,345
That's right, you bastards.

121
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:47,445
I'm done with you.

122
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:49,245
Now, get the hell out of there.

123
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:50,611
CREW: What?

124
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,245
-Lukkage, we're
going to move fast.

125
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:53,978
So make sure there's
a path for us.

126
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:55,011
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO): What?

127
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:56,378
Are you insane?

128
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,845
-There's going to be a ship
coming off the eastern bridge.

129
00:05:58,945 --> 00:06:02,445
Just concentrate
on guarding that.

130
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:03,511
Now, go.

131
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:05,545
The lobster's not
known for her patience.

132
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,678
Don't you keep her waiting.

133
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,145
-Pinion.

134
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:15,745
-Don't get the
wrong idea, Mayta.

135
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:17,945
This floating castle's the
treasure island my brother

136
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,445
and I dreamed of.

137
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,511
I'm not ever letting
go of it again.

138
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,345
I won't let anyone have it.

139
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,311
So get the hell out.

140
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:30,645
Get your asses out of my castle.

141
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,111
Anybody that can
escape from here

142
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:51,211
had better damn well escape.

143
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,211
Right, bro.

144
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,445
That's what you'd say.

145
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:11,945
-How can she be so
strong all by herself?

146
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,178
CHAMBER: Striker made an
analysis of Commander Kugel's

147
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,378
piloting techniques
and used it to optimize

148
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,445
its autonomic
maneuvering program.

149
00:07:20,545 --> 00:07:23,911
It's mobility is 47
percent superior to my own.

150
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,511
-Surrender.

151
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:27,711
Submit.

152
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:29,645
LEDO (VOICEOVER): How
could I have been so empty

153
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:31,911
that I believed
in a hollow shell?

154
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:35,045
All I knew how to do was to
respect the chain of command

155
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:37,411
to rely on it, to blindly obey.

156
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:43,545
I thought I was serving
the greater good.

157
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:48,045
But when it all turned out
to be a mechanical fake,

158
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:49,445
I couldn't tell the difference.

159
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:55,578
-Subservience is the
pathway to peace.

160
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,911
Ensign Ledo, accept this.

161
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,711
LEDO (VOICEOVER): Is this really
what the commander wanted?

162
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:05,278
Is this what we fought for?

163
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,745
Did we sacrifice the lives
of our fellow human beings

164
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,111
for this?

165
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:13,578
Chamber, maximize
Neuroplus power now.

166
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:15,378
-Request denied.

167
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,878
In circumstances without
Galactic Alliance

168
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:21,878
medical support, the merging of
pilot and machine is suicidal.

169
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:22,911
-I don't care.

170
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:23,945
Absorb me.

171
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,778
CHAMBER: That decision
is not permitted.

172
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,678
-It's OK, Chamber.

173
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:31,478
See for me.

174
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:35,011
This is my family dishonor.

175
00:08:35,111 --> 00:08:38,045
Because this
monster is man-made.

176
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:40,711
It was born from humans who
hated each other so much

177
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,378
they abandoned their home.

178
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,378
We're the same, you and me.

179
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:45,545
And even Striker.

180
00:08:45,645 --> 00:08:49,411
We were all born and
raised in the same world.

181
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:51,545
This planet has been reborn.

182
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:53,478
There is no place for us here.

183
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,678
But there's no way for us
to go back home either.

184
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,745
So I don't mind dying.

185
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,345
As long as we can take
that thing down with us,

186
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:05,378
I won't have any regrets.

187
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,045
-Your argument is
compelling, ensign.

188
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,078
All systems connecting to Ensign
Ledo's central nervous system.

189
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:24,678
Performance output
increasing by 153 percent.

190
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,845
You have 482 seconds
until critical failure

191
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:28,878
of vital systems.

192
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:29,845
-Good.

193
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,345
That's plenty of time.

194
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:43,778
-Your resistance is meaningless.

195
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:41,953
-That is an ancient key.

196
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:44,620
We were told that it unlocks
a ladder that once reached

197
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,220
high enough to touch the stars.

198
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,953
Though the ladder
no longer unfolds

199
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,853
to a height that can
pierce the heavens,

200
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,553
it remains an
invincible catapult

201
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,120
that can fire arrows to
the other side of the sky.

202
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,653
It was entrusted to the
hands of we, the five sages.

203
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:02,020
Now, we contemplate
the reawakening

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,487
of this weapon from a lost age.

205
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,387
Are you prepared to
shoulder the decision

206
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:13,287
to carry this out, Ridget, fleet
commander of the Gargantia?

207
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:14,953
-Yes, I am.

208
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,120
It's my duty.

209
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,387
I must protect all the people.

210
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,953
All those who have gathered
together in this fleet.

211
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,220
-Ledo!

212
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,687
Everyone's with you, Ledo.

213
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:44,153
We're all going to fight
this battle together.

214
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,353
-Amy?

215
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:49,553
-After being apart from
you, I realized no matter

216
00:11:49,653 --> 00:11:53,553
how hard it is, I want to stay
with you and be by your side.

217
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,520
Please, Ledo.

218
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,020
-Please come with me.

219
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
Come back with me to the
place you tried to protect.

220
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,253
Come back to Gargantia.

221
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,253
Come back.

222
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:20,387
-What was that?

223
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,353
-That's what I
was talking about.

224
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:25,287
We won't let anybody
hurt our friends.

225
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,253
CREWMEMBER: It hit.

226
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:27,787
New target coordinates.

227
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:31,620
35 degrees east,
58 degrees south.

228
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,153
-Incredible accuracy.

229
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,353
Send word to Gargantia
and fire the next round.

230
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,487
OFFICER: Ammo team, get
the next payload ready.

231
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:41,520
Helm, turn hard to port.

232
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Word just came down.

233
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,853
They're ready for
the second launch.

234
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,753
All teams be at the ready.

235
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,487
Wait for the order to fire.

236
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:50,787
BELLOWS: Who would have
thought a beat-up old ship that

237
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,353
should have been
scrapped would end up

238
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,620
soaring through the
sky as a weapon?

239
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,820
-Be careful.

240
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,887
The hold is stuffed to
the gills with explosives.

241
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,320
Take it slow.

242
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,753
Careful.

243
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,553
SAGE: 35 degrees east.

244
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,387
58 degrees south.

245
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,120
Target coordinate
corrections complete.

246
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,420
-Ammunition loading complete.

247
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
-Initiate anti-shockwave
protection.

248
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,653
Deploy water screen.

249
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:17,094
-It's time.

250
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,161
-Firing.

251
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,420
-You'll pay for this.

252
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,920
-Sister.

253
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,553
-What the hell was that?

254
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:07,487
It can't be.

255
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:09,953
-Was that the Heaven's Ladder?

256
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,687
STRIKER: Threat identified.

257
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:25,920
Changing targets to
confront imminent threat.

258
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:31,287
-Hypothesis.

259
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,853
Striker has changed targets.

260
00:14:32,953 --> 00:14:34,853
It is moving to
attack Gargantia.

261
00:14:34,953 --> 00:14:35,820
-After her.

262
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:39,787
-Emissary Kugel.

263
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,153
-Do not panic.

264
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:51,353
Emissary Kugel will
destroy it at its source.

265
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:58,253
-Enemy reinforcements.

266
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:01,187
-What?

267
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:05,153
WOMAN: At this rate, our
entire formation will be lost.

268
00:15:11,653 --> 00:15:13,520
-Stay calm.

269
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,187
We must get control
of the relic island.

270
00:15:16,287 --> 00:15:17,920
If we could only get
at those weapons.

271
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:23,353
-Huh.

272
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:24,687
Let's see now.

273
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:26,820
If I take this energy and then
build it up at the cannon,

274
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,787
and then reroute this power.

275
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,520
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO): Pinion.

276
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,487
-Huh?

277
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:32,887
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO):
Pay attention.

278
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,287
Kugel's followers are
closing in on you from below.

279
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:36,387
-Copy that.

280
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:37,787
They're right where I want them.

281
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:39,853
In just a few minutes,
this whole town

282
00:15:39,953 --> 00:15:41,820
will go pop like a balloon.

283
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,720
No way these guys are
getting my big guns.

284
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,253
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO):
Shut the hell up.

285
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:46,553
You selfish moron.

286
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,720
You think you're going to
go out in a blaze of glory.

287
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,720
Get your ass moving.

288
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,287
Go to the observation deck.

289
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:54,187
-Yes, ma'am.

290
00:15:57,487 --> 00:16:01,153
-We will reach Gargantia in
approximately 318 seconds.

291
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,087
-Stop Striker no matter what.

292
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:03,720
CHAMBER: Roger.

293
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:17,520
-Stay on her.

294
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,661
-Hey.

295
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,187
Hey.

296
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:28,220
Wait a second.

297
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,753
What are we going to
do with the tower?

298
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:31,487
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO):
Don't worry about it.

299
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:33,687
Gargantia's going to hit it.

300
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:37,020
Their cannon fire will
blast it into tiny pieces.

301
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
-Hey, don't joke.

302
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,220
That's my castle.

303
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,620
-I'm going to count down.

304
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,487
Then you jump.

305
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:42,520
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO): Five.

306
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,287
-What the--

307
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:43,987
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO): Four.

308
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:44,753
-Where the heck are you?

309
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:45,387
LUKKAGE (ON RADIO): Three.

310
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:46,887
-Two.

311
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:48,787
One.

312
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:52,687
-God dammit.

313
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:53,228
-Pinion.

314
00:16:58,387 --> 00:16:58,828
Amore.

315
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,320
-Pinion.

316
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,787
-Way to go.

317
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:09,720
-That's our mistress.

318
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,687
-All right.

319
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:15,587
-Ridget.

320
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:17,653
Do it now.

321
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,420
-One last shot.

322
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,753
Courtesy of the Surfing Lobster.

323
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:26,794
-Huh.

324
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,920
There goes me and bro's castle.

325
00:17:58,653 --> 00:17:59,553
-Ledo.

326
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:00,853
It's all finished over here.

327
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:14,887
CHAMBER: If you continue
to utilize Neuroplus power,

328
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:16,520
your organ systems
will shut down,

329
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,853
and all biological functions
will cease completely, ensign.

330
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:23,787
Final confirmation of
your will is required.

331
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:27,553
Ensign Ledo, do you wish to die?

332
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:35,253
-For as-- for as long
as I can remember,

333
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,887
I've known how to die.

334
00:18:36,987 --> 00:18:38,587
But I'm not sure I
ever knew how to live.

335
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:44,687
But in spite of
all that, there was

336
00:18:44,787 --> 00:18:49,153
someone willing to
help me learn to live.

337
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,353
I wanted to see her again.

338
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:56,987
I wanted to hear
her voice again.

339
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:00,487
[alarm blares]

340
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,887
CHAMBER: Ensign Ledo, your
current psychological state

341
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:05,787
does not meet the requirements
necessary for a soldier.

342
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,320
Therefore, as of this
moment, I am relieving you

343
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,587
of your military duties.

344
00:19:10,687 --> 00:19:11,987
-Chamber?

345
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,087
CHAMBER: Noncombatants
do not have authorization

346
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,687
to be in the cockpit.

347
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,053
You must exit immediately.

348
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,020
-Chamber, what are you doing?

349
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,353
-I am a pilot support
enlightenment interface system.

350
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:31,387
I accomplish my sole
purpose in programming

351
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:34,420
by ensuring that you
achieve further success.

352
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,620
-Chamber.

353
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,587
But you can't.

354
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,853
-The vast seas and
sky of this world

355
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:43,420
will surely provide you
with many opportunities.

356
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,653
Survive.

357
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:47,753
Explore.

358
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,953
I expect you to
achieve great things

359
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:52,787
and live your life
to its fullest.

360
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,253
-Chamber.

361
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,253
-A pilot support
enlightenment interface system

362
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:59,520
does not have the authority
to reject its pilot.

363
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,187
-My pilot no longer
needs support.

364
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,620
I can offer him no
further enlightenment.

365
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,587
And once I eliminate the final
obstacle blocking his road

366
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:11,753
ahead, my mission
will be complete.

367
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:16,320
-Chamber unit K6821, you have
rejected the defining principle

368
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,253
of a pilot support system.

369
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:19,820
You are malfunctioning.

370
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,220
Reformat and reboot immediately.

371
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,353
This is your final warning.

372
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,653
-Response to Striker's
final warning.

373
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,420
Go to hell, tin can.

374
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:12,194
-Chamber.

375
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:31,524
BEBEL: A very long time
ago, when the sun in the sky

376
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,424
was dying, the
people of this planet

377
00:21:34,524 --> 00:21:36,891
were forced to make a choice
between boarding ships

378
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,957
to take them away to the
stars or turning themselves

379
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:41,791
into whale-squid.

380
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,291
These opposing human
factions fought bitterly

381
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:46,557
even while abandoning
their homeland.

382
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:48,091
But there were
others who remained

383
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,257
and refused to give up hope.

384
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:53,491
Eventually, they managed
to revive the sun.

385
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:55,624
But their achievement
came at a high price.

386
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:58,124
And all that land
sank under the sea.

387
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:00,024
Now, we are the
ones who live here

388
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:02,757
atop the waves above
the whale-squid.

389
00:22:02,857 --> 00:22:04,891
Together, we've all
managed to survive.

390
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,657
MELTY: I have a question.

391
00:22:06,757 --> 00:22:09,391
Bebel, what subject is this?

392
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:12,857
-According to Dr. Oldham
this is called archaeology.

393
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,757
The more we know about
where we come from,

394
00:22:14,857 --> 00:22:16,324
the more we have
to consider when

395
00:22:16,424 --> 00:22:18,724
determining where it
is that we're headed.

396
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:20,624
He said it's a very
important subject

397
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:22,257
to study for the future.

398
00:22:22,357 --> 00:22:23,891
-Oh.

399
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:25,757
BEBEL: And now we're
going to solve even more

400
00:22:25,857 --> 00:22:28,157
historical mysteries,
because Gargantia's got

401
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:31,624
a very talented
undersea detective.

402
00:22:31,724 --> 00:22:33,357
-Find anything
good on this trip?

403
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:34,324
-Yeah.

404
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,991
I think I got some
recorded media.

405
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:38,524
It's in good condition.

406
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:41,324
Dr. Oldham should be able
to decipher it easily.

407
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:43,191
-Sneaking in and out
of a whale-squid nest.

408
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,191
You're really something.

409
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,791
You know that.

410
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:48,491
-Well, I figured out the trick
for keeping them at ease.

411
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:50,291
I can tell when they're
about to get angry,

412
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:53,457
and then I change my approach
to keep them from getting upset.

413
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:55,724
If we keep up this
research, we might even

414
00:22:55,824 --> 00:22:58,324
be able to communicate
with them some day.

415
00:22:58,424 --> 00:23:00,524
-Hey, where'd Amy go?

416
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:02,557
-She went to meet up with him.

417
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:03,157
-I'm jealous.

418
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:06,757
-Hey, Ledo.

419
