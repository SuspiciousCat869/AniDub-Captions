Let's adjust the suspension.

OFFICER RIDGET:
Now it's official.

The interlocking of

-You're a lifesaver.

And I gotta say, your
fleet is incredible.

OFFICER RIDGET: Thank you.

9
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,061
We appreciate the information
regarding the pirates.

Were very grateful.

We'd be lost without your help.

drove the pirates away.

destruction of the hanger

00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,104
is a separate incident entirely.

68
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:13,804
-You can't hold him
responsible for that.

69
00:04:13,904 --> 00:04:14,770
He just got here.

70
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,204
He doesn't know anything.

71
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,770
-Well he's been made exempt
from the fees for electricity

and water use.

73

What's more, we've
waived the freight charge

74

for oversized cargo.

75

He's not being charged
for us hauling this.

But I suppose it
functions as a meditation.

hot it is, they're

I gotta say Ledo, it sounds

is pretty rough.

He's a smart kid.

199
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:40,737
It's just that his body
is weak so he can't just

Are you really from
outer space Ledo?

Oh, I've always wondered
what's up there.

What is life like in space.

I'm real curious
to know about it.

The behavioral objective

enemy, the Hideauze.

you truly believe,

498
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:37,951
then why did you make this?

499
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:40,384
-That is just--

500
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,551
BEBEL: Sis told me you
made it but that you didn't

501
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:45,384
know what it was or
what its use might be.

502
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:48,718
I think it's some kind of flute.

503
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:51,118
It's not necessary
for war at all.

504
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,818
LEDO: A flute.

505
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,851
-Mhm.

506
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:55,784
Blowing air into it
produces a sound.

507
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:15,151
-What's wrong?

508
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,151
You're crying.

509
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:20,184
Are you alright?

510
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:21,018
-What is--

511
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:21,884
-I'm so sorry.

512
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,751
Did I say something wrong?

513
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:28,818
-I do not know why--

514
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:32,684
BEBEL: Perhaps you suddenly
remembered something sad.

515
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,751
LEDO: Is that it?

516
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:36,584
Bebel.

517
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:37,284
BEBEL: Yes?

518
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:37,984
-Please.

519
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:40,051
I would like that again.

520
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:40,592
-Of course.

521
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,218
I made teas for you boys.

522
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:51,718
It's Saaya's recommendation.

523
00:21:51,818 --> 00:21:53,184
She says it's good.

524
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:54,184
Smells great.

525
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,618
LEDO: Chamber,
what's your progress

526
00:22:01,718 --> 00:22:03,318
in finding our coordinates?

527
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,118
-Lack of observational data.

528
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:06,651
More time will be required.

529
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:09,118
-I see.

530
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:12,484
In that case, I'll need to
learn more about this planet.

531
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:14,084
CHAMBER: That is unnecessary.

532
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:18,084
Eventually you will return and
rejoin the main unit Ensign.

533
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,284
-Yes.

534
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:21,151
I know.

535
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:27,246
[ending song]
