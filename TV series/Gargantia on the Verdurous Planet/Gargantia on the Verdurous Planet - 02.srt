00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:41,571
-Hi!

166
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:45,371
Sorry, I'm so late.

167
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:46,838
-Hey, are you OK?

168
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:48,705
I heard someone
took you hostage.

169
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:49,905
-Yeah, he did.

170
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:51,538
But I'm fine.

171
00:08:51,638 --> 00:08:53,738
I'm so lucky he
wasn't a bad guy.

172
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:55,571
It seems his name is Ledo.

173
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:56,271
-Ledo?

174
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,838
So what's this guy like?

175
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:58,671
-I don't know.

176
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,005
I'd guess he's about my age.

177
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,205
He's got pretty slim
arms, so he really

178
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:03,638
doesn't look at that manly.

179
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:05,038
-Oh?

180
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:08,438
-And there's another one who's
still inside the huge Yunboro.

181
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:09,971
He can speak our language.

182
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:11,805
Enough to understand him anyway.

183
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:14,071
-It'd be good if they could
talk things over with them

184
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:15,371
and become friends, right?

185
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,505
-Exactly!

186
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:21,638
That's what I've been
thinking, too, but-- oh.

187
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:23,605
I brought you something.

188
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:24,146
-Huh?

189
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:29,046
Hah!

190
00:09:29,105 --> 00:09:30,705
Thank you!

191
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:31,671
AMY: Can you use it?

192
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,212
-Mm-hm.

193
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:39,505
Ha-ha!

194
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:41,471
A perfect fit!

195
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:42,905
Thanks a lot, Amy!

196
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:43,971
-[giggles]

197
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,838
I'm glad.

198
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,671
-You know, I wish I
could talk to Ledo, too.

199
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,905
-Hm?

200
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:53,038
-I mean, after all, he might
have come from the sky.

201
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:54,038
-Huh?

202
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:55,538
-From the sky?

203
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:56,538
Ledo?

204
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,371
-Yeah.

205
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,971
You know all the legends, right?

206
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,138
About the people who
escaped to the stars way

207
00:10:01,238 --> 00:10:02,638
back when the Earth
became frozen?

208
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,105
-Aw, come on!

209
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:05,338
It's just a fairytale.

210
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,471
And besides, that
Yunboro was brought up

211
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:08,738
from the bottom of the ocean.

212
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,405
-Mm-mm.

213
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:13,571
I'll bet you anything that
they came down here from space.

214
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:18,538
The people that escaped so long
ago have finally come home.

215
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:19,771
-Space, huh?

216
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,305
I don't know why they
bother coming all this way.

217
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:26,471
-Dr. Oldham once told me that
if a ship could travel straight

218
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:30,071
up in the sky, it would reach
space in just half a day.

219
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:30,612
-Oh?

220
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:41,371
CHAMBER: Someone is approaching.

221
00:11:03,187 --> 00:11:04,487
PINION: I don't know about this.

222
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:06,887
RIDGET: The fleet commander
said that we shouldn't provoke

223
00:11:06,987 --> 00:11:09,253
him, which is perfectly
understandable.

224
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:11,187
But we can't just sit here.

225
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,620
-And so you chose her?

226
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,687
-We had no other volunteers.

227
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:15,987
Would you like to?

228
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:17,887
-Yeah, right.

229
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:19,187
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

230
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,653
The threat level is minimum.

231
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:25,220
It is possible that she
has been sent as an envoy.

232
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,087
-Envoy?

233
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,187
But she's a kid.

234
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:28,487
CHAMBER: Shall I intercept her?

235
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,320
-No, not necessary.

236
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,187
CHAMBER: Roger.

237
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:31,728
-Uh.

238
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:56,020
CHAMBER: It is the corpse
of an aquatic organism.

239
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,561
-Corpse?

240
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:16,653
-Hm.

241
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,353
-Ugh, what is it she wants?

242
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:19,287
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

243
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:20,087
It is edible.

244
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,420
-So she wants me to eat it?

245
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

246
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,987
It is a friendship ritual.

247
00:12:24,087 --> 00:12:24,787
-Um.

248
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:25,953
But it's a corpse.

249

decision to you, Ensign.

her name is Amy.

00:13:01,353 --> 00:13:03,287
She would like to know
from where you originated.

260

262
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,853
So you two are
soldiers, and you're

263
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,487
fighting in a war against
those Hideauze thingies?

264

CHAMBER: Correct.

265
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,420
-Then are you
stronger than them?

266
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,187
-Super strong.

267
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,153
-Oh, you're really from space?

[squeals]

We were taught that it was
once a giant lump of ice.

300
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,187
But then one day, it melted
and became a water planet.

Long ago, there were
supposedly places called land.

But I really don't get that.

303

Anyway, everyone in the world
lives on ships like this.

All grouped together.

305
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,553
We find ancient
ships and materials

that are at the
bottom of the sea,

and we hoist them all
out, like Gargantia.

Uh, that's the
name of this fleet.

331
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:54,020
AMY: It's a glowing path
that runs through the sea.

332
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,653
None of us would be able
to survive without it.

333
00:15:56,753 --> 00:16:00,820
So the ships all forge
ahead, staying on that path.

334
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,087
But there's no guarantee that
the path will go on forever.

335
00:16:04,187 --> 00:16:06,853
And when it disappears, we
search for a new sea galaxy

336
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:09,120
and switch over to that path.

337
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,353
-Uh.

338
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:14,553
-Lightbugs are what
makes sea galaxies glow.

339
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:18,220
They're swarms of tiny organisms
that accumulate electricity.

340
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,420
We get all the electricity we
need from this band of light.

341
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:23,961
-Uh!

-What?

346
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,553
-What is the analysis of
our present coordinates?

347
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,387
-Due to the existence
of an atmosphere,

348
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,453
lack of information,
and the limitations

349
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,820
of optical analysis,
further observation

350
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,553
is required to derive
our current coordinates.

351
00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:54,987
-Uh.

352
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:55,528
-Hm.

353
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,820
I'm telling you, it's true!

354
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,120
I think.

355
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,220
-You'd think they'd come up
with a better lie than that.

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,820
-If that really is
a talking machine.

-It is!

358
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:12,887
-Honestly.

359
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:15,520
Even if it's true, a
war with an alien race?

360
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,353
-It's unlikely.

361
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,487
But that aside, I say
we should find out

362
00:17:19,587 --> 00:17:22,053
for sure if it can talk
or not by taking it apart.

Then throw the kid overboard!

He's in trouble and
has nowhere else to go.

Everyone should listen
to what Ledo has to say.

-Having undue contact
with an outsider

368

together and do this!

All we can do is
wait for our troops

to notice our distress signal.
