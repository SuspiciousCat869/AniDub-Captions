1
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:39,757
-Reverse all stops.

2
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,757
-Where the hell are we?

3
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:50,490
-For now it doesn't look
like there's any danger.

4
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,990
-But are we really going
to be OK after this?

5
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,157
Yeah, the tin can massacred
all the whalesquid.

6
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,657
I'm sure of it.

7
00:00:58,757 --> 00:00:59,990
-Uhh.

8
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:08,824
-Don't tell me that's-- Hey,
tin can Ledo, welcome back.

9
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:12,257
How'd it go?

10
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:14,924
-Confirm, all Hideauze
inhabiting this sector

11
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:17,024
have been exterminated.

12
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:17,890
-Ha, ha.

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,390
Fantastic.

14
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,157
Go, get the Yunburos ready.

15
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:23,924
The legendary treasure of the
whalesquid is ours to take.

16
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:24,465
-Yeah.

17
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:27,972
-Whoo.

18
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:44,980
-Oh.

19
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,947
[MUSIC - "SKY AND YOUR MESSAGE,"
CHOUCHO]

20
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:30,224
-All right, stop.

21
00:03:30,324 --> 00:03:33,691
The shaft is this way.

22
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,691
Go ahead.

23
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,191
Nice and easy now.

24
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,491
All right, that's good.

25
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:40,191
-Nice.

26
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,991
Looking good over there.

27
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,657
-Pinion, come here a sec.

28
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,198
-Sure.

29
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,132
-Looks promising, doesn't it?

30
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:54,673
-Yeah.

31
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,473
-Ah.

32
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:10,506
Ahh.

33
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,973
Oh.

34
00:04:13,073 --> 00:04:13,514
Huh?

35
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:20,447
Oh, oh.

36
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:46,188
Ooh.

37
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:02,688
-Big, Bro, I wanted to
drink this with you.

38
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,321
-Pinion.

39
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:14,988
-Pretty awesome isn't it?

40
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:16,888
And this is just the beginning.

41
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:21,088
-So this is the grand
legacy of our ancestors.

42
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,521
-Yep.

43
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,088
And there's even
more amazing treasure

44
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:27,355
waiting deep inside
the whalesquid nest.

45
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,655
It's just like my
big brother told me.

46
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:30,621
There's no rust.

47
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,255
It's not rotted
out and down there,

48
00:05:32,355 --> 00:05:33,888
there's an unlimited supply.

49
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:36,688
-Yes, this treasure could
bring back civilization

50
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:38,688
and restore the world.

51
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,655
-Bring back civilization?

52
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,255
We're the ones who found it.

53
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,421
The treasure belongs
to us and no one else.

54
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:46,321
-What are you talking about?

55
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,021
I only left Gargantia
because I thought

56
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:50,321
we were going to use all this
to enrich people's lives?

57
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:51,988
-Who cares about
saving the world.

58
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:53,788
Let's enrich own lives first!

59
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,621
-If we hoard it,
others will come

60
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,355
and try to steal it from us.

61
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:59,555
-We've got tons of
weapons and ammo to spare.

62
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,121
There ain't nothing
to be afraid of.

63
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,521
-That is not the issue, Pinion.

64
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:05,488
-We'll sink anyone
that even gets close.

65
00:06:05,588 --> 00:06:06,688
Hey, send out a message.

66
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:08,421
I want it blasted
on all frequencies.

67
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:10,788
The whalesquid are dead,
and we've got the treasure.

68
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:12,055
-No.

69
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:13,621
It could stir up trouble
with other ships in the area.

70
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,955
-It'll warn them to
stay the hell away.

71
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:17,021
Boost the signal strength.

72
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,088
I want to broadcast
as far as we can.

73
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:24,688
I have a message for every
ship that can here this, so

74
00:06:24,788 --> 00:06:26,355
listen up.

75
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:27,888
We annihilated the
whalesquid that

76
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,188
were living in the Sea of Mist.

77
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,988
Wiped them out completely.

78
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:34,021
All the pods, all the
nests, everything.

79
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:35,355
And it was all thanks to me.

80
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:38,621
From now on, I'll be known
as Pinion of the Sea of Mist.

81
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,688
If any of you bastards out
there had your own sights set

82
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,355
on the whalesquid
treasure, forget it.

83
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,821
But don't go thinking you can
steal it out from under us.

84
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:48,755
The treasure belongs to us.

85
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:49,588
It's ours.

86
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:50,688
All of it.

87
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,055
So I hereby issue a
warning to all ships.

88
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:56,521
Any vessel that comes close
to us will be sunk on sight.

89
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:01,255
-Pinion might be onto something.

90
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,455
-Not you, too.

91
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,655
-That being said, pirates
will be targeting us.

92
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,255
We'll need to prepare for when
they arrive and attack us.

93
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:08,888
-Why must we assume the worst?

94
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,788
Will we have to fight?

95
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,055
-Commander Flange.

96
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:14,555
I have a delivery for you.

97
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:15,288
-Bring it here.

98
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:21,655
-Thank you, Commander Flange.

99
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:27,888
-Is there something else?

100
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,755
-I heard that Ledo killed
all the whalesquid.

101
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:32,921
Do you know if that's true?

102
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,121
-Yes.

103
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,255
It's true.

104
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,321
-I'm worried.

105
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,455
Do you think we're
going to be all right?

106
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:39,121
-I don't know.

107
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:40,721
I wish I did.

108
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,555
-Are you really
OK with everything

109
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:43,821
that's going on around here?

110
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,421
-That's enough.

111
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:45,221
-How could I be?

112
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,055
Thanks to Ledo and
Chamber, we were

113
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,521
able to scavenge deep
inside the whalesquid nest,

114
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:57,355
and I was eager to do it.

115
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,321
But with not sharing,
or even trading

116
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,488
the treasure we found
with anyone else,

117
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:03,755
and with Pinion spotting
threats over the radio,

118
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,288
I'm not so sure anymore.

119
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,955
-Can't you stop him, Commander?

120
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,721
If you don't, we could
end up being outcasts.

121
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:12,688
-The ship masters who followed
me when we left the Gargantia

122
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:14,488
began to follow Pinion.

123
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,221
-Oh.

124
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,788
-Pinion continues to be
someone the fleet needs.

125
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:20,521
His skills as a
repairman are required

126
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,321
to make use of the salvage.

127
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,021
There's little that can
be done to stop him.

128
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:25,588
-Oh, no.

129
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:49,796
-Ensign.

130
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:54,896
-Why aren't you helping?

131
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:56,329
Come give us a hand.

132
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,229
-You can take care of
the salvage yourselves.

133
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,529
You don't need me.

134
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,829
-But the treasure is
clogging the shaft.

135
00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:04,262
I need the tin can to help
bring up all the stuff.

136
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:05,729
-Forget it.

137
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:07,762
-What's gotten into
you all of a sudden?

138
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:10,262
You scared of a
little hard work?

139
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:12,462
-You think I'm scared?

140
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:15,029
You go to hell.

141
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,762
I destroyed the Hideauze.

142
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,162
I fear nothing.

143
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:18,703
Nothing.

144
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,137
-Hey, Joe, let's hang it
up for the day, all right?

145
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:34,903
-Sounds good.

146
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:48,803
-Fleet Commander, has the
new fleet configuration

147
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:50,403
been finalized?

148
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:51,537
-Yes.

149
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:53,803
The ship masters were
all very cooperative.

150
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:56,537
Now all we need to do is
reset the ship interlocks.

151
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,670
No simple task, but
we will get it done.

152
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,637
-Fleet Commander, have you
heard Pinion's broadcast

153
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,770
from the Sea of Mist?

154
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,570
-Yes, I've heard it.

155
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,937
-Frankly speaking, what
do you think of it?

156
00:10:08,037 --> 00:10:10,937
-Until there's factual
evidence to back up his claims,

157
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:13,237
I don't think
anything of it at all.

158
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:16,970
However, did the rest of the
fleet hear the broadcast?

159
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,270
-Everyone heard it
or knows about it.

160
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,970
-I see.

161
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,803
If the ship masters
believe it, some of them

162
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:26,737
may wish to leave to
seek their own treasure.

163
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:29,170
-And if they do?

164
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:33,570
I'll respect their
wishes and let them go.

165
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,370
-Dr. Olton, is it true?

166
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,070
Did Ledo destroy
the whalesquid nest?

167
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,270
-Yes, at least
that's what Pinion

168
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,670
said on the radio broadcast.

169
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,703
-How sad.

170
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:47,870
-It was very foolish.

171
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,337
How could he do such a thing?

172
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:07,370
-I swore that I'd get
revenge for my big brother.

173
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,403
-You said that it was
only a dream, remember?

174
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,737
-Amy?

175
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:24,170
I wonder how Mayta is doing?

176
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,437
She must be OK.

177
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:29,170
Pinion said they'd be all right.

178
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,270
Hey, Amy.

179
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,803
-I don't know if
she's all right, OK?

180
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:34,803
I don't know anything.

181
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,737
Ledo.

182
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,278
Why?

183
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,434
-Do they look like
they're going to give up?

184
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:05,867
-I don't think so.

185
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,401
-But they're
probably out of ammo.

186
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,701
-Continue firing.

187
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:09,834
-Are you serious?

188
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:10,801
Why not?

189
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:14,401
We've got plenty
of ammunition left.

190
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,667
Besides, they started it.

191
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,867
They attacked us.

192
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,067
-But that would sink them.

193
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:21,601
-Unless they put
both hands up first.

194
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,034
Repairs on the treasure
should be done by now.

195
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:27,201
I think we should
fire a test shot.

196
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:27,734
-All right.

197
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:28,667
Keep going.

198
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,634
Keep going.

199
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,034
A little more.

200
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:32,667
There.

201
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:33,967
That should do it.

202
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,401
-Locked and loaded.

203
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,701
-Yes.

204
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,242
Fire!

205
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:43,875
-Fire, he tells me.

206
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,208
But how do I do that?

207
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,108
This one, or maybe that one.

208
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,208
-Dammit.

209
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:58,908
What kind of aim is that?

210
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:01,142
-They're radioing to give up.

211
00:13:01,242 --> 00:13:02,508
-It took you long
enough, morons.

212
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,375
You guys sure took your time.

213
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,108
You've got some nerve
picking a fight with us.

214
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:16,775
You were warned.

215
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,342
-Please, spare us.

216
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:21,742
Let us join up with your crew.

217
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,575
-Huh?

218
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:23,842
-We'll give you all our cargo.

219
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,608
Just please let us
join your fleet.

220
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,642
-What?

221
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,208
We can't just take
every groveling dog

222
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,242
that says "please."

223
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,875
This fleet would get
huge pretty quick.

224
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,142
Wait a sec.

225
00:13:33,242 --> 00:13:35,242
If the fleet did get huge,
no one would challenge us.

226
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:37,408
We'd be unstoppable.

227
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:40,575
There'd be no end to
the treasure we'd haul.

228
00:13:40,675 --> 00:13:41,775
OK.

229
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,742
Anyone that wants to jump
ship, welcome aboard.

230
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:45,242
-Yes, thank you.

231
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:46,042
-Hear that?

232
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:48,275
Seems your crew is mine now.

233
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,575
-Uh-huh.

234
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:51,375
-Hey, let's lock this
guy up somewhere.

235
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:04,483
Ledo.

236
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:09,783
About this stuff we salvaged.

237
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,316
I, uh, well, I'd really like the
tin can to check it out for us.

238
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,149
Will you do it?

239
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,083
The ensign's permission
is required for me

240
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:25,883
to participate in any activity
outside of military service.

241
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:26,816
-So how about it?

242
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,816
Can he help?

243
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,849
-Do what you want.

244
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,116
-Great, then we're good to go.

245
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:33,083
Get up, kid.

246
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,683
You're coming with me.

247
00:14:34,783 --> 00:14:37,483
We can't start the party
without our big hero.

248
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,749
Follow us, all right, tin can?

249
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:39,616
Come on, let's go.

250
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:46,124
-Huh?

251
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,057
-To our victory.

252
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:52,990
Drink.

253
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,557
-You should have
seen this one guy.

254
00:14:54,657 --> 00:14:55,098
Huh?

255
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:01,998
-We won today.

256
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,365
Great job everyone.

257
00:15:03,465 --> 00:15:06,931
Pirates picked a fight with
us, but we kicked their asses.

258
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,131
-Yay.

259
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:10,665
-Has Lady Luck been
on our side ever

260
00:15:10,765 --> 00:15:12,265
since we struck out on our own?

261
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:13,598
You betcha.

262
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:15,231
But none of this
would've been possible

263
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,765
without Ledo and Chamber.

264
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:20,131
So to say thanks, let's all kiss
the tin can's joint metal ass.

265
00:15:23,731 --> 00:15:24,172
-Play.

266
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:40,639
-What is this?

267
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,106
What am I doing?

268
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,739
What am I doing it all for?

269
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,272
Who am I doing it all for?

270
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:54,006
When did it start?

271
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:55,872
Was it when I first
regained consciousness

272
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,806
on this strange planet?

273
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,139
Or was it earlier,
like the first time

274
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,506
I got inside Chamber?

275
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:04,406
Inside a Machine Caliber.

276
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:07,672
Or did it start at the very
beginning when I was born?

277
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,406
-Well then?

278
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:19,906
-It is a primitive
electromagnetic weapon.

279
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:20,772
-A what?

280
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:22,839
What the hell is that?

281
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,006
-This weapon's basic
structure is essentially

282
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:28,072
the same as the electronic beam
armor that I am equipped with.

283
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,839
-Seriously?

284
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,406
-However, I estimate
its maximum power output

285
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:34,772
to be 150th the
strength of my own.

286
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,906
-Even 150th the strength in
your power is a big deal.

287
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,872
-Compared to current
Earth technologies,

288
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,472
power output is approximately
76 times greater

289
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:43,939
than that of this entire fleet.

290
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,539
-Yeah, yeah, that's great.

291
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,672
But the question is
could we get to work?

292
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:51,372
-It appears possible to restore
basic functions via repairs.

293
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:53,439
However, a vast
amount of electricity

294
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:55,306
would be required for operation.

295
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,339
-Electricity?

296
00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:00,339
Hey, would it work if we could
harness enough light bugs?

297
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,306
-Further investigation
is required.

298
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:03,406
-Then investigate.

299
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:04,939
I'll find Ledo and
tell him the news.

300
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,506
-I have uncovered evidence
supporting the information

301
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,039
in the Hideauze
digital recording.

302
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,272
It is the light bugs.

303
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,672
Light bugs are nano machines
that actually comprise

304
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,672
the material that the adult
Hideauze shell is made of.

305
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:50,439
They absorb
electromagnetic waves

306
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:53,606
and convert them into highly
efficient chemical energy.

307
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,772
While synthesizing this
energy the light bugs

308
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,539
are also self-replicating and
through carbon bonding function

309
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:01,039
as a durable exoskeleton.

310
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:03,939
This symbiosis indicates
origins and intelligent life.

311
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,739
Conclusion.

312
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,172
Hideauze evolve from humans.

313
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:08,906
-You.

314
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,139
How can you tell me this?

315
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,272
It goes against everything.

316
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,739
Everything the
alliance taught me.

317
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,306
Everything that I've
been fighting for.

318
00:18:16,406 --> 00:18:18,372
-I recognize significant
errors and omissions

319
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,306
in your knowledge base.

320
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,306
-Can I fight the Hideauze if
they're evolved from humans?

321
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,006
Is it right to be fighting them?

322
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,106
What's the reason?

323
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,439
Is there a point to all of this?

324
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,506
If not, I can't-- I
can't keep fighting.

325
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:36,906
Those living creatures.

326
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:39,806
I can't murder them.

327
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:41,439
-That is unacceptable.

328
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,172
Your realization
is the antithesis

329
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:44,306
of the Alliance Mission.

330
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,706
It refutes the purpose
of our existence.

331
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,339
-You saw them, didn't you?

332
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:52,006
The newborn whalesquid,
what they all looked like?

333
00:18:52,106 --> 00:18:54,839
We're all humans, and we're
just killing each other.

334
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,006
Admit it.

335
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:57,439
That's what this war
we're fighting really is.

336
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:59,339
-Even with this
additional information,

337
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,139
there is no compelling
reason to forgo

338
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:04,572
the eradication of
the Hideauze house.

339
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:06,639
-Maybe for you.

340
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:09,406
But not me.

341
00:19:09,506 --> 00:19:10,672
-That is unacceptable.

342
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:13,172
The Hideauze pose a threat
to fundamental destruction

343
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:14,372
to the human race.

344
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:16,406
Preventing that destruction
is your sole mission

345
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:18,272
and the reason for existence.

346
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:20,406
-But we're all one human race.

347
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:21,306
Be quiet, Chamber.

348
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:23,872
I've heard enough propaganda.

349
00:19:23,972 --> 00:19:25,206
-You are incorrect.

350
00:19:25,306 --> 00:19:27,572
The link between myself and
the Alliance has been lost.

351
00:19:27,672 --> 00:19:29,272
This is not their dogma.

352
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:31,906
I have arrived at this
conclusion independently based

353
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:34,506
on the analysis of
current information.

354
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,439
-What?

355
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,239
-Reconciliation between the
human race and the Hideauze

356
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:40,472
is impossible.

357
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,172
The reason being, because
the Hideauze have rejected

358
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:46,106
civilization in its entirety.

359
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:48,439
-What does that mean?

360
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,539
If instead of flesh
and bone, human beings

361
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:52,006
were equipped with
strong versatile

362
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:54,572
bodies like the Hideauze,
then the development

363
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,106
of advanced Machine
Calibers like

364
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:58,872
myself would not
have been necessary.

365
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,572
My system is the culmination
of the superior intelligence

366
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:05,372
of the human race, but Machine
Calibers are also necessary

367
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,239
for human survival
in order to offset

368
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,572
the fragility of human form.

369
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:10,939
Conclusion.

370
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,506
The reason humans developed
their intellectual capabilities

371
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:15,639
and built complex
civilizations was in order

372
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,972
to overcome their
bodily limitations.

373
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:19,739
The existence of
advanced civilizations

374
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,739
is what separates the human
race from all other primates.

375
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:26,339
Unlike humans, the
Hideauze, having discarded

376
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:29,739
their feeble bodies, no longer
have physical limitations.

377
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,206
Further, as their instinctual
desires drive them only

378
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:33,839
to seek out food
and reproduction,

379
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:36,372
it has not been necessary
for them to retain or develop

380
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,506
a superior intellect.

381
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:41,772
Machine Calibers are the apex of
what human beings can and would

382
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:43,872
create to promote self-reliance.

383
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:46,172
In other words, we are
the greatest realization

384
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,839
of pure intellect
born to civilization.

385
00:20:48,939 --> 00:20:51,906
By negating the essentiality
of this pure intellect,

386
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:54,406
the Hideauze, in effect,
have reached the sublimation

387
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,406
of one form of existence.

388
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,272
-Are you saying that
they're an ultimate life

389
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:01,606
form, the Hideauze?

390
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:02,539
-Affirmative.

391
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,439
Hence, you and I
must battle them.

392
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,739
Both the dignity and the
survival of the human race

393
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,572
hang in the balance.

394
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:14,639
In a war against a species that
shares the same genetic origins

395
00:21:14,739 --> 00:21:17,906
as you, failure means
certain extinction.

396
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:22,139
One side seeks civilization,
the other abandons it.

397
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,506
The war between the Hideauze
and the Galactic Alliance

398
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,106
of humankind is a
conflict between two very

399
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:29,606
different survival
strategies, a conflict

400
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,139
in which the losing
side will be culled.

401
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,506
-Be culled?

402
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:37,006
-As long as you desire
to continue existing,

403
00:21:37,106 --> 00:21:38,339
you do not have a choice.

404
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:39,672
-So I have to fight.

405
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:41,706
Is that a command?

406
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:45,372
You, a machine, are
commanding a human?

407
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,772
-I am a pilot support
enlightenment interface

408
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,439
system, Ensign Ledo.

409
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,472
I accomplish my
purpose of existence

410
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:54,172
by insuring you achieve further
success and increasingly

411
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,072
greater results.

412
00:22:01,372 --> 00:22:02,572
Receiving.

413
00:22:02,672 --> 00:22:05,472
A polarized photon sequence
Galactic Alliance standard

414
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:07,472
encrypted communication wave.

415
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:09,272
-What did you say?

416
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,239
Identified as an allied craft.

417
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:11,939
-An allied craft?

418
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:41,139
That's Commander Kugel.

419
00:22:50,361 --> 00:22:55,994
