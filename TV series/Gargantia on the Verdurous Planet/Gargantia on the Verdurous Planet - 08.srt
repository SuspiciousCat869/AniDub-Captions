00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,233
Where's Ridget?

3
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:27,566
-I'm here, Fleet Commander.

4
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,866
Take this.

5
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,407
-Huh?

6
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:38,800
-Oh.

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,966
-This is--

8
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,566
-Take care of the fleet.

9
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,933
-Don't say that,
Commander Fairlock.

10
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,900
The Garantia Fleet
needs you, not me.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
-In your hands, I'm not worried.

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,666
-But Commander, I can't.

13
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,900
-You're a fine officer.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,266
When I see your
father, I will give him

15
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,566
a glowing report
of your service.

16
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,533
-No, Commander!

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,166
-Hmm.

18
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:26,000
-No.

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,541
No.

20
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:31,907

21

00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,200

CHAMBER: Galactic
alliance inner coordinates

24
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,866
in its current
position confirmed.

25
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,033
-Does that mean you
know where we are?

26
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,066
We can go?

27
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,133
CHAMBER: Negative.

28
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:55,033
A subspace guidance
method is necessary.

29
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:57,500
I am not capable of
navigating without it.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,500
-What?

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,533
What about an SOS?

32
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:04,133
CHAMBER: SOS, emergency landing
on Earth signal has been sent.

33
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:08,700
Estimated time to arrival,
approximately 6,582 years,

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,133
16 hours, 20 minutes.

35
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:12,133
-Impossible.

36
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,600
It can't be.

37
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,633
CHAMBER: Returning to the
main force at this time

38
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:16,500
is not feasible.

39
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,000
-I can't go back.

MINORI CHIHARA]

42
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:05,343
-Ridget?

43
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,343
Are you serious?

44
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:07,876
That little girl?

45
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:11,609
-The Commander appointed her
himself on his death bed.

46
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,909
Maybe I should be getting
out of here with Flange, too.

47
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,309
-Ship Masters, there you are.

48
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,476
I'm glad I caught
you altogether.

49
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:20,443
Flange's departure is imminent.

50
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,543
I must consult with you.

51
00:04:21,643 --> 00:04:22,443
It cannot wait.

52
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:23,543
-Hey, come on.

53
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,009
-Now ain't the time for that.

54
00:04:25,109 --> 00:04:27,709
-Today is Fleet Commander
Fairlock's funeral.

55
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,876
-Yes, but my first
priority is the fleet.

56
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:32,143
-You were like a
daughter to Fairlock.

57
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:34,676
How could you not attend
the man's memorial?

58
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:36,443
-The man raised you, didn't he?

59
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,076
He took you in
when Chevron died.

60
00:04:41,443 --> 00:04:43,476
-What are you doing?

61
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,909
You're supposed to assemble
at the bow of the flag ship.

62
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,276
-Yes, we're on our way.

63
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:48,243
-Let's go.

64
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,976
-Change is never easy.

65
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:03,343
-Yes, I realize that.

66
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,176
-So you can't go home?

67
00:05:05,276 --> 00:05:06,676
-No.

68
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:07,576
-That's a shame, kid.

69
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:10,209
I feel for you.

70
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:13,076
But, you know, if you
have to be stuck here,

71
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:15,209
you should make the best of it.

72
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,243
You really want to kill
some whalesquid, right?

73
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:21,076
-Killing them is my
primary objective.

74
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:23,243
-Then I may be able to help.

75
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:25,109
I know where their nest is.

76
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:25,809
-What?

77
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:26,843
They have a nest?

78
00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:28,443
-Easy now.

79
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:31,809
Attacking a whalesquid now
ain't no simple feat, kid.

80
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:33,509
But there's treasure.

81
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:35,809
-I don't care about money.

82
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,743
-No problem.

83
00:05:36,843 --> 00:05:38,176
You kill the
whalesquid, and I'll

84
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:40,676
salvage the treasure
after you're done.

85
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:41,976
Sound good?

86
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,376
-As long as I can
kill the Hideauze.

87
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:48,176
-Then it sounds
like we have a deal.

88
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:50,343
-Release all the ships
that want to leave,

89
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:53,043
30 interlocks have
to be unfastened.

90
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,909
Be careful, work fast.

91
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:57,043
Let's do this.

92
00:05:57,143 --> 00:05:59,209
-Flange, please reconsider.

93
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,643
Don't leave Gargantia.

94
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,109
-My mind is made up, Ridget.

95
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,543
A fleet lacking in
strong central leadership

96
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:08,009
is a ripe target for pirates.

97
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,209
-But Flange.

98
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:12,043
-There is also the treasure
Pinion talks about.

99
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:15,909
It's a legacy from the past that
could be the key to our future.

100
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,609
But I'm doing this for the
citizens who came to me

101
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:21,176
and said that they
wanted to leave.

102
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,743
My duty is to them.

103
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:25,309
I've sworn to protect
the people on my ship,

104
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,009
and that is what I intend to do.

105
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,143
-Thanks for the package.

106
00:06:32,243 --> 00:06:34,876
-You're welcome, bye.

107
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,809
-Melty.

108
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:37,776
-Saaya.

109
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,243
Amy.

110
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:41,443
-Melty, are you
really leaving us?

111
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,476
-Yep.

112
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,143
-Do you have to go
with Flange's ship?

113
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:45,509
Can't you stay here?

114
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:48,743
-I'd stay if I could, but
I can't leave Grandpa.

115
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,176
-I see.

116
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,343
-I never imagined our ship
would leave Gargantia.

117
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,209
I thought we'd always be here.

118
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:57,943
But things change, so I'm going.

119
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,909
But I'm actually
looking forward to it.

120
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,243
One upside is that I may get
to meet some cute new guys.

121
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,443
-Rich ones?

122
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:06,576
-Definitely.

123
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,709
Plus, it looks like the
hottie is coming, too.

124
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,576
-He is?

125
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:12,409
-Pinion's telling
everyone in the fleet.

126
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,543
He says that with
Ledo's flying Yunboro,

127
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:17,809
we'll all be safe
from the whalesquids.

128
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:18,409
-I understand.

129
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:51,143
-Fairlock should have chosen you
to be the next Fleet Commander,

130
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:52,876
Crown, not her.

131
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:55,376
-I don't have much
time left myself.

132
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:58,876
I must guide the next
generation to go on without me.

133
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:02,509
-Train her as much as you
possibly can, my friend.

134
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:06,076
Fleet Commander, we have had
fair winds and flowing seas,

135
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:09,709
but now our voyage
together has ended.

136
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,409
May all the blessings of
the virtuous waves be yours.

137
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,350
-Huh?

138
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,976
-Don't you need to wear
black to a funeral?

139
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:15,209
-Pinion.

140
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:17,609
-Sign the release for
the departing ships.

141
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,209
-How many times do
I have to tell you?

142
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,309
No.

143
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,909
-Prove to me it will
be worthwhile to stay,

144
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,109
and I won't go.

145
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,143
Just give me what I want.

146
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:25,476
-You know, I can't.

147
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:28,109
-Then you got no
business stopping me.

148
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,743
You ain't got the balls
to command this fleet.

149
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:32,409
See you around.

150
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:25,776
[squeak]

151
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,676
-What's wrong?

152
00:10:27,776 --> 00:10:30,743
-Oh, Saaya.

153
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,876
Nothing, I'm fine.

154
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:34,943
-You're thinking
about Ledo leaving.

155
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:36,576
-No, it's not that at all.

156
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:38,576
-It's OK.

157
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:41,876
You should go with him
if that's what you want.

158
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:42,743
Leave with Flange.

159
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,576
OK?

160
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,676
You'd get to be with Melty, too.

161
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,076
-With Melty?

162
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:49,509
Of course, I'll miss
you both like crazy.

163
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:53,043
But it's better than
seeing you look like that.

164
00:10:53,143 --> 00:10:56,909
Judging by your look, you'd
think the world was ending.

165
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,876
But maybe that's what it's like
for you since he's going away.

166
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,543
-There isn't anything
between us yet.

167
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,376
-Huh?

168
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:06,909
Then--

169
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:08,076
-I can't go.

170
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,543
I have to stay here.

171
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:11,376
-How come?

172
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,476
My brother needs Dr. Olton.

173
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:16,109
He's the only one
who can treat Bebel.

174
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,343
And I couldn't leave Bebel,
not for anything in this world.

175
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:22,343
-I see.

176
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:29,843
I'm glad then.

177
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:34,743
It's selfish, but I'd
be real lonely with you.

178
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,209
-Yeah, me, too.

179
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:54,676
-Got your hands full, huh?

180
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,509
-It's nothing I can't handle.

181
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:58,709
-OK, but you still need
a break now and then.

182
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,409
-I know that, but
I can't stop now.

183
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:01,509
I have to set an example.

184
00:12:04,943 --> 00:12:06,176
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:06,276 --> 00:12:07,776
-Don't worry about it.

186
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:09,843
-With Commander
Fairlock gone, I have

187
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:11,943
to keep it together
no matter what.

188
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,143
-Don't beat yourself up.

189
00:12:13,243 --> 00:12:14,409
You're working hard.

190
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:16,243
You've done enough.

191
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:20,443
-If it were enough, they
wouldn't be leaving.

192
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:23,776
-Enough and perfect
aren't the same.

193
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,009
I've been there.

194
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,076
I know what it's like to
be suddenly running it all.

195
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,409
-Huh?

196
00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:30,776
-Back when the Chief first
left me the salvage business,

197
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,409
I was eager to do
everything myself

198
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:34,343
to prove that I
could go it alone.

199
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,609
One day I found a huge treasure.

200
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:38,809
I was determined to show
off and be the big hero.

201
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:41,043
But a current swept
up my Yunburo,

202
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,309
and I ended up pinned
under my big find.

203
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,309
I thought I was going to die.

204
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,809
Afterwards, Pinion
laughed his ass off.

205
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,776
Called me a stupid little girl.

206
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:52,976
I was so eager to be
as good as the boys,

207
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,543
I forgot to work with them.

208
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:57,609
Trying to do it by
yourself is the same

209
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:58,976
as not trusting your friends.

210
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,109
Ask for help.

211
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:02,909
-But Commander Fairlock
did it all by himself.

212
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:03,609
-No, he didn't.

213
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:04,576
He relied on you.

214
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,709
Did you forget?

215
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:08,709
Ask yourself who
you can count on.

216
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,509
Think about who's
reliable, and who

217
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,909
you know you can trust
and let them help you.

218
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,309
-Like who?

219
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,643
-Like yourself.

220
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:19,009
You make sure everything I
salvage gets put to good use.

221
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:20,809
Someone I can work
with who only wants

222
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,243
what's best for the fleet.

223
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,443
That's who I'd want in charge.

224
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,676
-I'm back.

225
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:26,876
-Welcome home, Sis.

226
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:28,176
-Sorry I'm late.

227
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:29,709
I'll hurry up and
get dinner started.

228
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,643
-Hey, is it true that
Ledo was leaving?

229
00:13:43,743 --> 00:13:44,509
-Oh, you know?

230
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:46,376
But how?

231
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:50,709
-The neighbors said Pinion
was telling everybody.

232
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:52,009
-He is.

233
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,909
Too bad, huh?

234
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,976
And here I though he and
I were getting along,

235
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,043
but I guess it was wrong.

236
00:14:00,776 --> 00:14:05,376
-I wonder why he wants to
do something so dangerous?

237
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:12,143
-Seriously, that jerk.

238
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:14,009
-Amy.

239
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,543
-What happened to him?

240
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,009
Why doesn't he care
about anything?

241
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:21,509
When we were at the festival
together, he was laughing.

242
00:14:21,609 --> 00:14:23,576
He was smiling.

243
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:28,676
Now, it seems like he's
more tormented than ever.

244
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:32,109
I know the boy I went to the
festival with is the real Ledo.

245
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:28,644
-There are some who
decided to stay.

246
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,144
Fleet Commander,
what about the boy?

247
00:15:30,244 --> 00:15:32,644
How do you intend
to deal with him?

248
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:35,377
-I'm going to let you
decide what to do.

249
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,377
-He let me decide.

250
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,710
-Bebel.

251
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,944
-Are you really going?

252
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:58,110
-Correct.

253
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,110
I am.

254
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,110
-Do you have to?

255
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,110
Isn't there another way?

256
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,477
-There's not.

257
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:14,377
-But Ledo, is leaving
us what you really want?

258
00:16:14,477 --> 00:16:17,477
-I have to protect humans
and protect Amy also.

259
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,177
-But she doesn't want
you to protect her.

260
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:20,177
She wants you to stay.

261
00:16:26,844 --> 00:16:29,477
-Bebel, I want you have this.

262
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:32,044
-Huh?

263
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:36,010
But I thought this
one was special.

264
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,210
-A child who looked like me
made it and then gave it to me.

265
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,644
-He looked like you?

266
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:46,210
-It is possible that he
was my younger brother.

267
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,010
-Uh, Ledo.

268
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,110
-In the Galactic Alliance, one
who cannot fight cannot live.

269
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,477
The Hideauze are to blame.

270
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:56,710
They threaten the existence of
the human race and our enemies.

271
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,110
-But Ledo.

272
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,710
-Earth Hideauze, too.

273
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,710
If their domain expands, they
will wage war on more humans.

274
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,577
I'm certain of it.

275
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:07,477
-But whalesquid wouldn't.

276
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:09,644
-Yes, they would.

277
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,710
If Earth becomes
like the Alliance,

278
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,244
then you would be killed.

279
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:18,377
For Amy's sake, too, I cannot
let her lose someone that she

280
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:19,310
loves.

281
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,010
-You're wrong.

282
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,410
You're wrong, Ledo.

283
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,344
No one's going to die.

284
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:23,177
Don't go.

285
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,644
-I do not want Amy to suffer.

286
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:28,044
I must destroy the
Hideauze completely.

287
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,677
-Wait, please.

288
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,218
-Hmm?

289
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:00,918
-Hmm.

290
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,477
I'm sorry.

291
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:10,477
I know I'm late.

292
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,177
Thank you so very much.

293
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:02,610
Listen to me.

294
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,210
I have something
to say to you all.

295
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,077
-What?

296
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:14,110
-Fairlock has left us, And
he has left Gargantia to me.

297
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,077
My predecessor cared for
this fleet and its people

298
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:18,710
until he drew his last breath.

299
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,744
And I pledge to do
the very same thing.

300
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,177
The Commander dearly
loved this fleet

301
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:32,444
and gave his entire life to it.

302
00:19:32,544 --> 00:19:34,444
I promise to do nothing less.

303
00:19:34,544 --> 00:19:36,877
I will give you
everything that I have.

304
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:38,610
But that isn't enough.

305
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,844
I couldn't stop all those
people who wanted to leave.

306
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:42,644
They didn't believe
I could protect them,

307
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:43,977
and they were right.

308
00:19:44,077 --> 00:19:46,644
By myself, I can't.

309
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:53,244
I need you.

310
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:55,377
I need you all to
lend me your strength.

311
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:58,977
If you want to
protect this fleet,

312
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,144
if you want to
protect Gargantia,

313
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:03,744
this fortress that we
live on, this place

314
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:08,610
which is our home, then please,
I really need your help.

315
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:33,644
-We're all old salts
who know the ropes.

316
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:35,510
We got your back, kid.

317
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,777
-That's right.

318
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:39,444
When you need someone to
count on, you can count on us.

319
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:41,610
-There's no point in crying
over the jerks who left.

320
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,210
Buck up and move on.

321
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,844
-With you at its
heart as Commander,

322
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:48,244
we'll build a new fleet
around you better than ever.

323
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:49,877
-Well done.

324
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:50,744
-You'll be fine.

325
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,177
-Everyone, I thank you.

326
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,744
-Oh.

327
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:17,110
-Hi.

328
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,344
What are you doing down there?

329
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,677
Come up.

330
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,610
-I am leaving soon.

331
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,610
-I know.

332
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,944
-Ledo, you're really going?

333
00:21:29,044 --> 00:21:30,710
-Yes.

334
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,644
-OK, well then, I'll
hold on to this for you.

335
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:37,644
You can come back at
any time and get it.

336
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:39,310
-Thank you for everything.

337
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,377
May all the blessings of
the virtuous ways be yours.

338
00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:11,344
-They've made up their minds.

339
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:15,210
Once that happened, there was
nothing we could do about it.

340
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,910
They're idiots.

341
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,877
Every last one of them.

342
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:30,057
