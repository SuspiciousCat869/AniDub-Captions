1
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:16,709
-So this is the
fabled Sea of Mist.

2
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,043
WOMAN: Is it true that nobody's
ever come out of it alive?

3
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:21,409
MAN: Everyone knows that story.

-[grunts]

6
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,743
Here they come.

7
00:00:34,843 --> 00:00:37,009
This is going to be a big haul.

8
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:38,943
All vessels to full stop!

9
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,009
PINION (ON RADIO): All
right, boss of the tin can.

10
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,809
You're on!

11
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,543
-I'm commencing
aggressive maneuvers.

12
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:55,309
CHAMBER: Entering within
range of Hideauze colony.

13
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:57,609
LEDO: In terms of numbers,
they're overwhelming.

14
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:58,509
CHAMBER: Affirmative.

15
00:00:58,609 --> 00:00:59,909
Hypothesis.

16
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,609
With regard to the subject of
fighting power, I am superior.

17
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:03,543
Suggestion.

18
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:04,943
Commence solo mission.

19
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:06,176
-That was always my intention.

20
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:13,876
All right!

21
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:15,776
CHAMBER: Preparing fuselage.

22
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:18,609
-That will save us
a lot of effort.

23
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:19,576
Too slow!

24
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,576
Looks like killing
them all will be easy.

25
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:28,576
CHAMBER: Affirmative.

26
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,443
It appears the
Earth-type Hideauze

27
00:01:30,543 --> 00:01:33,443
are much weaker than those
we encounter in space.

28
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:37,109
Their combat efficiency
is 1/120th of mine.

29
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:39,443
With current armaments, we
can continue the assault

30
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,009
until they withdraw.

31
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:46,209
-No, I'm going to
destroy them all!

32
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:50,209
[theme music]

33
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:23,531
-All right.

34
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:26,931
Maintain current course and keep
your eye on the depth gauge.

35
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,798
-He's absolutely
sure it's this way?

36
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,431
-I don't want to get
lost in the middle

37
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:31,631
of a bunch of whalesquids.

38
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:34,031
-They're supposed to have
a curse on them, too.

39
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:34,865
-Cut it out!

40
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:35,831
PINION: Leave it to me!

41
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,165
-Huh?

42
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:41,198
-If we stick to the plan,
there's nothing to worry about.

43
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:43,465
I'll never be careless
again as long as I live.

44
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:00,398
This is seriously bad, bro.

45
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:02,598
I've never seen this
many whalesquid before.

46
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:04,065
BROTHER (ON RADIO):
Keep your cool.

47
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:06,198
As long as we don't agitate
them, we'll be fine.

48
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,765
Just veer towards 10 o'clock.

49
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:08,898
-Veer towards 10 o'clock.

50
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,439
Roger.

51
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,539
Wait a minute.

52
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,272
Bro, that's--

53
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,172
BROTHER (ON RADIO):
Yeah, like we thought.

54
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:30,206
A genuine Treasure Island.

55
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:33,006
PINION: Did humans really
create something as incredible

56
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,472
as this?

57
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:35,772
-I'll go check it out.

58
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:37,706
Stay here and keep watch.

59
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,039
-Be careful, bro.

60
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:39,806
-Oh, please!

61
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:40,639
I'll be right back.

62
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:48,672
I'm inside.

63
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,972
There are gigantic
machines all around me.

64
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:52,539
It's not just living quarters.

65
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,739
It's an industrial facility.

66
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,506
-[gasps] It's a whale squid!

67
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:59,006
BROTHER (ON RADIO):
This is amazing!

68
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:01,572
I'm not talking spare
parts, but the genuine

69
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:03,139
remains of a past civilization!

70
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,106
-Hey, bro.

71
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:07,906
Come on out!

72
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:09,106
I think you've seen enough.

73
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:11,339
Either way, the two of us
can't bring it up alone.

74
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,139
BROTHER (ON RADIO):
In case we come back,

75
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,639
I need to get a rough
idea of the area.

76
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:19,139
I'm heading for the door.

77
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,906
What's this huge thing?

78
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:21,672
Oh, no!

79
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:22,606
This is a whalesquid nest!

80
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:23,572
-Hey, bro!

81
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:24,572
What's happening?

[yells]

00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:37,539
Damn it!

00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,639
You bastards!

85
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,639
BROTHER (ON RADIO):
Pinion, you get away!

86
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:44,147
PINION: Bro!

87
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:51,680
Brother, come back.

88
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,347
Whoa!

89
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,780
[chuckles]

90
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,321
-Yeah!

91
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:08,621
CHAMBER: Warning.

92
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:13,288
Due to current maximizing, 23%
of my energy has been consumed.

93
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:15,721
Underwater operation
is inefficient.

94
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,254
-Yes, I know.

95
00:06:17,354 --> 00:06:18,954
That's why I'm using
the handheld weapon.

96
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:28,354
Uh!

97
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:29,388
What the--

00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:30,621
[beeps]

99
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:31,754
The main force?

100
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:34,021
CHAMBER: Preparing and
firing proximity fuse.

101
00:06:34,121 --> 00:06:34,562
-Roger!

102
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:46,795
-I'll be damned!

103
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:47,895
So they can be killed.

104
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:50,229
-They're not demons
or anything like that.

105
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,162
-What did I tell you, huh?

106
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:54,329
-Ledo, how are you
doing down there?

107
00:06:54,429 --> 00:06:55,495
-No problem.

108
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:56,862
-Great.

109
00:06:56,962 --> 00:06:58,895
Then keep at it and lure those
bastards out of their nest.

110
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:01,562
Give us five minutes, and
we'll be ready to start.

111
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,103
-Understood.

112
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:11,903
It's up ahead.

113
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,303
CHAMBER: Warning.

114
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,070
Density of enemy
signature is increasing.

115

-Uh!

116
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,877
CHAMBER: Number of simultaneous
targets is excessive.

117
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:41,577
I recommend withdrawing.

00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:42,611
-Hm.

119
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:43,677
PINION (ON RADIO):
We're ready up here.

120
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:44,344
Send them over.

121
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:44,885
-Understood.

122
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:51,052
Now, deploy!

123
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:51,593
-Right!

124
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:52,593
Drop off!

-67% of the enemy's offensive
capability has been eliminated.

130
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:23,859
It continues to decrease.

131
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,400
-Good.

132
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,067
-OK.

133
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:35,334
Once you're done there, move
on to the next spot as planned.

134
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:36,967
It's working perfectly!

135
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,534
Keep tossing them in.

136
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:39,467
MEN: Yeah!

137
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,434
-Yeah, that's great.

138
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,600
But is the Yunoboro
going to be OK?

139
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,800
-It's going to be fine.

140
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,634
That tin can ain't your
average Yunoboro, you know.

141
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,334
-Great!

142
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:48,100
Then I won't hold back.

143
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,134
-Look at those lightbugs.

144
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,900
That water spray was glowing.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,034
-Even the fish can't live here
if there are whalesquid, huh?

146
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,734
-Where do we go to next?

147
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:05,767
CHAMBER: Inference.

148
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,467
It seems the enemy
force has retreated.

149
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,567
In all likelihood,
to defend their base.

150
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,334
-The base.

151
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,834
And as Pinion mentioned--

152
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,867
CHAMBER: Echolocation
analysis complete.

153

Overall fatigue
level nearing limit.

159
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,000
Recommendation.

160
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,367
Temporary retreat.

161
00:09:59,467 --> 00:10:01,934
Commence attack
later at full power.

00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:18,716
-What?

171
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,016
CHAMBER: Anti-shock barrier.

172
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:31,749
-What is that?

173
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:33,349
-Don't tell me it's the curse!

174
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:34,349
-This is Pinion.

175
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:36,649
Ledo, what's going on?

176
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:37,482
[static]

177
00:10:37,582 --> 00:10:38,349
Hey, Ledo!

178
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,416
Hey, tin can!

179
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:40,349
Answer me!

180
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:41,949
What's wrong?

181
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:45,882
[static]

182
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:47,216
LEDO (ON RADIO): Ledo here.

183
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:48,616
-So you're all right?

184
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,316
[cheers]

185
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,482
Then let's keep it
going here, too!

186
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:53,023
MEN: Yeah!

187
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,523
-[sighs] I let my guard down.

188
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:03,757
But still, contrary to their
looks, they're pretty fragile.

189
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:04,857
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

190
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:07,023
Our lack of enemies has
caused de-evolution.

191
00:11:07,123 --> 00:11:07,990
-Analyze it later.

192
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,290
How much energy do we have?

193
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,790
CHAMBER: 53%.

194
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,331
-Good.

195
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:20,364
-All right!

196
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,664
Ledo and the tin can
took care of all of them!

197
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,431
Now, we can take all
the treasure we want!

198
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:25,564
MEN: Yeah!

199
00:11:25,664 --> 00:11:27,131
-Everyone, prepare for landing!

200
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:33,898
I hope you're watching, brother.

201
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:38,831
-Oh.

202
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,298
-See anything?

203
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,298
-No, not a thing.

204
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,264
The fog's too thick.

205
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:44,964
I hope the hottie's OK.

206
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:46,898
Pinion is in charge, after all.

207
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:53,898
-The very least he could do is
broadcast a progress report.

208
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:56,098
-All we can do now is
put our faith in Pinion.

209
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:06,464
-What are--

210
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:07,598
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

211
00:12:07,698 --> 00:12:09,798
They are Hideauze in the
process of maturation.

212
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:12,431
-You mean, these are
Hideauze children?

213
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,764
CHAMBER: Much is unknown
about the Hideauze life cycle.

214
00:12:15,864 --> 00:12:17,031
This is valuable data.

215
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:28,131
-Oh, they are Hideauze?

216
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:30,864
CHAMBER: Individual organism
response analysis complete.

217
00:12:30,964 --> 00:12:32,931
All patterns match the Hideauze.

218
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:37,498
Henceforth, I will refer
to them as Hideauze larvae.

219
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:38,964
-[grunts]

220
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,431
A spawning ground.

221
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:50,764
CHAMBER: Continuing the mission.

222
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:01,631
-What was that?

223
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:02,631
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

224
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,331
The facilities
administration block.

225
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:13,798
LEDO: And that?

226
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,064
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

227
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:18,331
A type of storage medium
used in extreme environments.

228
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:22,031
-Can the data stored on
the medium be salvaged?

229
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:23,498
CHAMBER: Successfully accessed.

230
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:26,831
Now, searching for data
standard decryption key.

231
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,631
Approximate standard discovered.

232
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:30,298
Reasoning engine activated.

233
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:33,964
Attempting restoration
and translation.

234
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,998
Restoration complete.

235
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:36,631
-Good.

236
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:38,131
Open it up, then.

237
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,864
CHAMBER: Cannot disclose data.

238
00:13:39,964 --> 00:13:41,598
-Why not?

239
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:43,098
CHAMBER: Present
location determined

240
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,098
to be a research facility
from the ancient civilization.

241
00:13:46,198 --> 00:13:48,698
However, this material
is considered classified

242
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:50,831
by the Galactic
Alliance of Humankind.

243
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,198
-Classified?

244
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:54,464
Ugh!

245
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:57,031
What's the point of that
at a time like this?

246
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,431
CHAMBER: It is protocol.

247
00:13:58,531 --> 00:13:59,998
-Look at where we are.

248
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:02,098
When contact with the
main unit is interrupted,

249
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:05,364
the highest ranking officer on
site has the right to command.

250
00:14:05,464 --> 00:14:06,798
Am I right?

251
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,231
CHAMBER: Affirmative.

252
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:11,498
-And who is the highest
ranking person here?

253
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,064
CHAMBER: Ensign Ledo.

254
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:16,164
-Then Ensign Ledo orders Pilot
Support Enlightenment Interface

255
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:19,131
System Chamber to release the
classified information to him

256
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,798
immediately.

257
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:21,598
CHAMBER: Roger.

258
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:22,898
The order will be executed.

259
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,466
PINION: Now, don't be hasty.

260
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:45,100
We need to scout it out first.

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,766
Make sure of your
sounding and footing.

262
00:14:46,866 --> 00:14:49,833
-Yeah, we know, boss.

263
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:51,100
-I'm counting on you, Ledo.

264
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,266
-The time has come
for the human race

265
00:14:58,366 --> 00:15:00,400
to start walking on
its own two legs.

266
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,833
And the person who
has volunteered

267
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:05,400
to take that first
step is Ryan Masurato.

268
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,400
It's safe to say that this
mission is a dangerous one.

269
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,433
-Well, it's never
been attempted before.

270
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,266
However, we're backed
up by a wonderful staff.

271
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,633
So with their help,
this mission should go--

272
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,900
[applause]

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,866
-Now, with the Fifth
Ice Age almost upon us,

274
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:28,433
the necessity of our research
has reached a critical level.

275
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:32,533
However, history shows us
that these-- these scientific

276
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:35,666
developments could sometimes
destroy old traditions

277
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:37,566
and ruin people's happiness.

278
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,900
Many of you fear that this
is the case right now.

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,566
But actually, the
mission and traditions

280
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,466
change along with
scientific advances.

281
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,700
And because of our
continuous research,

282
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,966
happiness may be attainable
for the very first time.

283
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:53,966
So I take this
opportunity to announce

284
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,400
the birth of an unrestricted
free citadel of science.

285
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,666
REPORTER: The activities of
the self-evolving movement,

286
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:02,566
nicknamed the Evolvers, are
drawing various protests

287
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,833
from all of the
world, are they not?

288
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:08,000
-It's a very unfortunate
circumstance we're in.

289
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,800
-What about doubts over the
human genome manipulation

290
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,400
which could violate
our treaties?

291
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,033
-Solving this problem requires
a far more flexible response.

292
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,533
Our protocols are
no longer working.

293
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:21,400
I would have to say that current
international regulations are

294
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:21,941
obsolete.

295
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:27,574
REPORTER: As a response to the
increasing problem of Earth's

296
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:30,074
extreme global cooling,
there are rising calls

297
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:33,141
for the immediate
development of space.

298
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,174
Right now, in the
Continental Union,

299
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:37,807
development of a space station
and interest on the immigration

300
00:16:37,907 --> 00:16:41,574
ship is proceeding
at a rapid pace.

301
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:43,341
This space
development technology

302
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:45,907
is essential to our
species' survival.

303
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:49,941
But we can't say that
it's perfect in any way.

304
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,141
You see, it won't
just be machines

305
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,941
we're sending into space.

306
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,841
It will be humans
like you and me.

307
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:04,241
-Since last week's shocking
leak of inside information

308
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:07,774
became public, the worldwide
opposition movement

309
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:11,407
against the Evolvers
has stepped up.

310
00:17:11,507 --> 00:17:13,307
REPORTER: The
Continental Union didn't

311
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,341
wait for a United
Nations resolution

312
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,141
before dispatching a
multinational fleet.

313
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,774
Meanwhile, there
are a great number

314
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:22,174
of countries that
stand by the Evolvers.

315
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,941
The situation is
expected to escalate.

316
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:39,341
-It soon became clear
that the immigrant search

317
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,607
for a habitable new
planet would likely

318
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:45,407
require decades,
perhaps even centuries.

319
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,774
The only solution to this
problem was bioengineering.

320
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,174
The careful application
of mechanical engineering

321
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,107
to living organisms.

322
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,941
By evolving the human
body via bioengineering,

323
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,741
we adapted to the
vacuum of space,

324
00:17:57,841 --> 00:17:59,841
to the great
astronomical distances,

325
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:02,474
and to the vast passages
of time that are required.

326
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:11,007
-The symbiont is a
marvelous invention.

327
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:13,774
It can breathe oxygen
underwater and withstand

328
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:16,074
the water pressure
of the deep sea.

329
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:19,874
Eventually, I'm sure it will
adapt to an absolute vacuum.

330
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,707
It gets nutritional support from
the symbiotic nano machines.

331
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:26,841
It's similar to photosynthesis
but is even more efficient.

332
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:29,741
GIRL: Papa!

333
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,207
-[chuckles]

334
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:34,107
-Papa!

335
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:36,141
-We have to say bye-bye now.

336
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,074
-Papa is going away?

337
00:18:38,174 --> 00:18:38,841
-No, dear.

338
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:39,841
We'll be--

339
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:41,674
-Last week, the
controversial Evolvers

340
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,574
were under fire again when
internal information regarding

341
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,774
their recruitment leaked.

342
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,674
It then became
clear that a number

343
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:50,407
of atrocious human experiments
violating international law

344
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:52,407
had been conducted.

345
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,874
-[gasps]

346
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:16,607
-While Earth's inhabitable
land mass is rapidly

347
00:19:16,707 --> 00:19:19,274
decreasing due to
global cooling,

348
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,174
the war between the
Continental Union

349
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:26,374
and the Evolvers over the
exodus from Earth is escalating.

350
00:19:26,474 --> 00:19:28,041
Currently, the
chief battlefields

351
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,674
are in orbit and in
floating launch facilities.

352
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:35,841
But it's thought that the war
front will continue to expand.

353
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,307
EVOLVER: We've discovered
that the Continental Union is

354
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:41,107
working on building a
large-scale wormhole interface

355
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:42,407
drive.

356
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,974
The facility includes
a self-destruct system.

357
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,374
After completion,
they'll simultaneously

358
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:51,674
destroy it and escape the solar
system, stranding us on Earth.

359
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,607
But now, we know their plan.

360
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:56,007
This is our chance!

361
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,807
By attacking and seizing the
wormhole drive for ourselves,

362
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,207
we Evolvers will be able to
spread the domain of the living

363
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:05,374
to unknown galaxies.

364
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:07,941
The Evolvers will
dwell in infinite space

365
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,707
and achieve eternal prosperity.

366
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:33,041
CHAMBER: That ends
the accessible

367
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:34,941
recorded information.

368
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,841
Several points of contradiction
with official Alliance records

369
00:20:37,941 --> 00:20:39,341
have been noted.

370
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:41,474
Its credibility
is extremely low.

371
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,141
-Really?

372
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,541
What was that, then?

373
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:44,907
Who the hell made
that recording?

374
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,774
And what was its purpose?

375
00:20:47,874 --> 00:20:49,141
-Hypothesis.

376
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:52,307
It is possible the enemy created
it to manipulate the viewer.

377
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:53,107
-What?

378
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:54,707
What enemy?

379
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:56,207
I was always taught
my whole life

380
00:20:56,307 --> 00:20:58,007
that the Hideauze were
a lower life form.

-Send all equipment-related
stuff to starboard.

388
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:36,723
What the hell?

389
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:37,756
What is he doing?

Hm.
