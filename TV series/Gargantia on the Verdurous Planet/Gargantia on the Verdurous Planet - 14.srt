00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:38,466
AMY: If you're using
this route, there's

4
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,433
a shortcut you can take that
will save you some time.

5
00:00:41,533 --> 00:00:45,200
But remember, you can't cross
here or here without a kite.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,733
So when you don't
have a kite, you'll

7
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,600
have to take this
extra detour here.

8
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,200
-And this area here is where
all the handsome boys hang out

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,333
all the time.

10
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,433
-Above all, be careful.

11
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:55,833
There's lots of
dangers on that route.

12
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:58,333
-There are lots of small ships
all crammed together here.

13
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,966
And the connecting
bridges between them

14
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,466
are all narrow too.

15
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:04,566
So watch where you step
and don't fall overboard.

16
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,366
-But Amy, if this
is so dangerous,

17
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:09,466
is it OK for children to do?

18
00:01:09,566 --> 00:01:12,100
-That's why we're
here helping them.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,133
-Will it not be difficult?

20
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:16,933
-Oh, Ledo, don't you remember
when you started working?

21
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:19,000
Wasn't it hard at first?

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,200
-Yes.

23
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,166
-Everyone makes a few
mistakes in the beginning,

24
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:24,800
and that's why when they make
the first couple of deliveries,

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,433
we'll be going
along to help out.

26
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,466
-But even with help, what
if they mess up and packages

27
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:30,466
cannot be delivered?

28
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,033
-That's a good question.

29
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,400
Let's say, that some
Yunboro schematics that

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,400
were supposed to be
delivered got lost.

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,300
It'd be impossible
to maintain Yunboros.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,500
-And what's worse, if all the
Yunboros couldn't be properly

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,633
maintained, they'd
just shut down.

34
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,833
-Then, everyone's work
would be affected.

35
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:49,300
MELTY: No matter what they do.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,533
We work with just about
everyone in the fleet.

37
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,033
So we have to do our jobs right.

38
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,600
SAAYA: We'd all be
in serious trouble

39
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,266
if we couldn't get
food or supplies.

40
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,966
-Nobody would be
able to survive.

41
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:01,466
-There have been cases where
that's actually happened.

42
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:04,866
All the people on a lone ship
or even a small fleet died off,

43
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,233
and it just became abandoned.

44
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,833
LEDO: Abadoned ship?

45
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:08,933
-Yep.

46
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:10,766
A ship that has become
just an empty shell.

47
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:13,366
It floats along aimlessly, and
the people who once lived on it

48
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,900
are all gone.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,233
Some people call
it a ghost ship.

50
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,233
-That's scary.

51
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,700
-I'm afraid of ghosts.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
-I want to go home.

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,466
-Yeah.

54
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:26,000
And I know a true story
about a real life ghost ship.

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,800
Once upon a time,
there was this ship

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,633
interlocked with
a certain fleet.

57
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,233
And there was a
messenger girl, who

58
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,100
had to deliver a package there.

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,800
So she went to that
ship all by herself.

60
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,166
AMY (VOICEOVER): However,
once the girl got to the ship,

61
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,500
there was nobody on board.

62
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,866
All the doors and
hatches were left open.

63
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:44,333
And there were
half-eaten meals left

64
00:02:44,433 --> 00:02:47,333
on tables that looked like
they'd been there for a while.

65
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,600
The girl was very nervous,
and she thought to herself,

66
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,433
could this be one
of those abandoned

67
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:54,733
ships I've heard about,
where there's not

68
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,933
a living soul on board?

69
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,833
SAAYA (VOICEOVER): So
then what happened?

70
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,766
AMY (VOICEOVER): I don't
think it's a good idea

71
00:03:00,866 --> 00:03:02,200
to stay here any
longer, the girl

72
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,500
thought as she turned to go.

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,900
But then, out of the corner
of her eye, she saw something.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,933
She thought, there can't
be anyone left aboard.

75
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:14,633
Maybe it's a ghost.

76
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:15,933
Suddenly, she felt--

77
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:18,133
-Chamber, define
the term "ghost."

78
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,833
CHAMBER: A word
for ghost does not

79
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,933
exist in the standard lexicon
of the Galactic Alliance.

80
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:24,200
-It does not exist?

81
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,033
Does that mean it
is something that

82
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,633
only exists on this planet?

83
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,833
CHAMBER: Insufficient
data to answer that.

84
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,100
However, given the
information offered here,

85
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,766
one might infer it is
a type of life form.

86
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:35,866
-A life form?

87
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,700
AMY (VOICEOVER): A trail
of bloody footprints

88
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,833
that came up to
right behind her.

89
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,133
The girl was so scared.

90
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,933
She couldn't move a muscle.

91
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,833
And then she heard, boom, boom.

92
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:46,866
[knocking]

93
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,500
A strange knocking
sound at the window.

94
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,333
She turned around
without thinking.

95
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:53,266
And there she saw--

96
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:02,100
[alarm blaring]

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,066
-The alarm.

98
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,366
-Ridget, ghost ship.

99
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,933
-I understand.

100
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,733
Talk about bad timing.

101
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,733
[theme music]

102
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,863
Pretty big, isn't it?

103
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:52,429
-Looks to me like
more of an abandoned

104
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:54,496
fleet than an abandoned ship.

105
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,063
-Standard procedure
dictates that we

106
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,463
dispatch a reconnaissance team.

107
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,229
We'll search for any
remaining survivors

108
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,763
and determine the reason
for the abandonment.

109
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,296
-Let's ask for volunteers
for the reconnaissance team.

110
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:07,663
Ten from the escort ships.

111
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,196
And perhaps a few
other should be

112
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:10,663
enough to canvas
a fleet that size.

113
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:11,729
-Hey, I'll go.

114
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,096
-You can count me in too.

115
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,363
-Ledo, you should
come along with us.

116
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,896
-Me?

117
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,863
-We might find a huge haul
of treasure over there.

118
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,629
Then, we'd need the tin can.

119
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:25,929
Ridget, is that cool?

120
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:26,470
-Fine.

121
00:06:26,529 --> 00:06:27,963
Go ahead.

122
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:28,929
-Ah.

123
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,929
The hottie's going to go too.

124
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,470
-Lucky.

125
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:56,796
-We all tagged along.

126
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:59,329
-Girls, honestly.

127
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,029
-Sorry.

128
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,029
Please let us help too.

129
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,129
-We won't be in the way.

130
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,363
Promise.

131
00:07:04,463 --> 00:07:05,496
-Maybe we should stay here.

132
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:06,263
OK.

133
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:08,196
BOTH: Huh?

134
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:11,029
-I-- I mean just that
someone needs to keep an eye

135
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,196
on the ship we took
to get here, right?

136
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:14,129
What?

137
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:16,229
The ship is gone?

138
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,463
-The escort ship went to
search the fleet's perimeter.

139
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:20,963
-Oh no.

140
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:23,396
-Well, this place is
bigger than we thought.

141
00:07:23,496 --> 00:07:24,663
We could sure use them.

142
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:25,629
-All right, Bellows.

143
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:26,729
They can help.

144
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,096
BOTH: All right.

145
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:28,637
-What?

146
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,096
Hey, is anybody in here?

147
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:24,096
I don't know.

148
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:26,329
You try.

149
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:27,563
-Anyone.

150
00:08:27,663 --> 00:08:29,229
Is anybody in here?

151
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,263
Was that OK?

152
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:36,829
-Mm-hm.

153
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,296
-If we call, will a
ghost answer to that too?

154
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:41,929
-We-- we don't want
to see any ghost.

155
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:42,696
All right.

156
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:45,763
-These ghosts are enemies?

157
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:46,896
Should I go fight them?

158
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:47,663
-No.

159
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:49,229
Don't do anything to them.

160
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:49,770
-Understood.

161
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,529
Amy, it could be a survivor.

162
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,963
-But it's--

163
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:03,763
-Do not worry.

164
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:04,496
I am here.

165
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:16,763
-What is in there?

166
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,696
-What the hell?

167
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:24,363
There ain't nothing on
this old piece of junk.

168
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,663
So disappointing.

169
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:26,796
-You're telling me, bub.

170
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:30,063
Why do I always get
stuck teamed up with you?

171
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:32,429
-If you really don't like
it, we could always split up.

172
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:33,796
-Uh, no.

173
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:34,829
-Then quit grumbling.

174
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:36,096
It is what it is.

175
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,496
-But Pinion.

176
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:38,196
-OK.

177
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:39,263
Want to try something?

178
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:40,596
BOTH: Huh?

179
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:43,429
-Let's play a trick
on our friends.

180
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,229
-Huh?

181
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,596
-What do you mean a trick?

182
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,163
-We'll dress up as ghosts.

183
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,829
Then, when Ledo and Amy
come by, we'll scare them.

184
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:54,729
BOTH: We're in.

185
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:02,829
-Who is here?

186
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:03,563
Show yourself.

187
00:10:14,729 --> 00:10:17,596
The door just closed on its own.

188
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:18,829
Is anyone here?

189
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:21,696
Come out.

190
00:10:21,796 --> 00:10:22,237
-Ahh!

191
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:28,363
-Hold your fire.

192
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:30,329
LEDO: Pinion?

193
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,663
-It was a joke.

194
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,196
Don't shoot me.

195
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,663
-Pinion's a moron.

196
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:37,763
He made the hottie snuggle
up even more with Amy.

197
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,129
It's not fair.

198
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:39,729
-No kidding.

199
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:51,563
AMY: Don't do stuff like that.

200
00:10:51,663 --> 00:10:52,729
You scared me half to death.

201
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:54,563
MELTY: What are you
complaining about?

202
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:57,496
-I wish those guys would
take this seriously.

203
00:10:57,596 --> 00:10:59,563
Right, Ridget.

204
00:10:59,663 --> 00:11:00,263
What's wrong.

205
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:01,096
Did you find something?

206
00:11:09,729 --> 00:11:11,929
The sickbay.

207
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,029
What is?

208
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,063
Is there something on
this ship after all?

209
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:27,163
-Bellows, I think
I know this fleet.

210
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:47,377
Gargantia has had contact
with this fleet once before.

211
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:49,310
It was about seven years ago.

212
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,277
-This is very important now.

213
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:01,744
So pay close attention.

214
00:12:01,844 --> 00:12:02,744
Right here.

215
00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:04,244
This is the main winch.

216
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:06,210
You have to make
sure it's oiled.

217
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,210
STORIA: Hey, Ridget.

218
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,710
-Hm?

219
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,410
-You know this fleet sure has
a weird way of interlocking.

220
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,844
Don't you think?

221
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:14,944
-Their fleet does it that
way, because their ships

222
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:17,144
are designed
differently than ours.

223
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,344
Their interlock ships have
arms already attached,

224
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:21,477
so they don't have
to use Yunboros.

225
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:22,744
STORIA: Huh.

226
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:24,777
You sure do you know a lot
about this stuff, Rigdet.

227
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,344
Wow.

228
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,977
Look at that.

229
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:28,777
--Storia, don't point like that.

230
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:30,044
Remember.

231
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:32,377
We're here as representatives
of the Gargantia fleet.

232
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:33,444
-Sorry.

233
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,310
But it's not everyday
we get the chance

234
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,544
to check out another
fleet up close.

235
00:12:37,644 --> 00:12:38,644
-I guess.

236
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,410
Even though they say
this is for our benefit.

237
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,510
I just don't see
the point of having

238
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,910
us perform
interlocking manually.

239
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,044
-I know.

240
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:50,077
But I've had fun meeting
so many new people here.

241
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:51,744
Like Ritona, who's
the one teaching us

242
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:52,910
the interlocking today.

243
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,810
He's the head of the
entire interlocking guild.

244
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,244
He's definitely a lot younger
than any guild masters

245
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,277
on Gargantia.

246
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:00,310
-I admit.

247
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,644
He does appear to
be a competent man.

248
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:03,844
-You up there.

249
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:04,777
Stop daydreaming.

250
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:05,510
It's dangerous.

251
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,110
-I'm sorry, sir.

252
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,644
-May I say something?

253
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,044
-What is it?

254
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:15,110
-I do not feel that this kind
of training is beneficial, sir.

255
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,577
-Your name is Ridget
if I'm not mistaken.

256
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:21,310
Are you saying that a future
candidate for fleet commander

257
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,910
doesn't need to learn
the interlocking

258
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,044
methods of other fleets
she may encounter?

259
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,444
-Well, to speak frankly, sir.

260
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:28,610
I don't.

261
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,710
-Oh.

262
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,510
OK.

263
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,344
Then, can you do me a favor?

264
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,044
Be a dear and take
that group down there

265
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,577
through the
interlocking process.

266
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:37,077
-Huh?

267
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:38,544
-Hey, guys up here.

268
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:40,610
You've got a new teacher
for the rest of the day.

269
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,444
So pay attention.

270
00:13:42,544 --> 00:13:44,644
-Hey, wait a second.

271
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:45,677
-What's wrong?

272
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:46,977
You know all there
is to know already.

273
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,277
Don't you?

274
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:51,010
Show them your excellent
Gargantia style interlocking

275
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,577
technique.

276
00:13:51,677 --> 00:13:54,810
-But I can't.

277
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,477
-If you can't teach someone
else how to do something,

278
00:13:57,577 --> 00:13:59,410
it means that you still
have a lot of things

279
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,410
left you need to learn to do.

280
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,110
Am I wrong?

281
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,344
If you come to bear a
great responsibility,

282
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:08,577
experience will be crucial.

283
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,177
Even if how you do
things on your fleet

284
00:14:10,277 --> 00:14:12,077
is different than
how we do them here,

285
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:13,844
learning something new
really is important.

286
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:17,444
-I'm sorry, sir.

287
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,177
-Right.

288
00:14:26,277 --> 00:14:27,110
OK, kids.

289
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,477
Were you paying
attention before.

290
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,544
Show me what you learned.

291
00:14:29,644 --> 00:14:31,310
KIDS: Yes, sir.

292
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:31,851
-Ridget.

293
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,477
Ridget!

294
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:18,410
Somebody get a stretcher.

295
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,710
-I, uh--

296
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:26,510
-Dammit, girl.

297
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,344
I told you it was dangerous.

298
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,944
Are you injured?

299
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:32,644
-No, sir.

300
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:33,210
-I see.

301
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,410
Thank God.

302
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:41,177
-Stay still now.

303
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:42,110
-Ritona!

304
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,344
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Are you all right?

305
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:44,044
-Don't worry.

306
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,544
I'm fine.

307
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,277
-You're not fine.

308
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:48,244
You're bleeding a lot.

309
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:50,044
Hurry up and get
stretcher already.

310
00:15:50,144 --> 00:15:51,410
Call the medic STAT.

311
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes, ma'am.

312
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,051
Right away.

313
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,677
Let's go.

314
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:54,377
MALE SPEAKER: Go.

315
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:54,910
Hurry.

316
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,364
Come on.

317
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:13,844
STORIA: Ridget.

318
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:16,477
Did you come down here
to pay Ritona a visit?

319
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:17,577
-No.

320
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:20,510
I was just going to
leave him some-- Storia,

321
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,077
have you been down
here this whole time?

322
00:16:23,177 --> 00:16:24,277
-Come on in, Ridget.

323
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,744
-Wait.

324
00:16:40,844 --> 00:16:42,344
STORIA: Ritona, look.

325
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:45,177
Ridget came to see you.

326
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:45,810
-Um.

327
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,077
I-- I don't, uh--

328
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,844
-Thanks for coming to visit me.

329
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:51,385
-Sure.

330
00:16:55,644 --> 00:16:56,477
-Oh.

331
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:58,944
Don't worry about that.

332
00:16:59,044 --> 00:16:59,977
Come have a seat.

333
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:08,044
Sorry about what I said.

334
00:17:08,144 --> 00:17:09,077
-It's not your fault.

335
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:11,877
You didn't do anything.

336
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:14,110
I was being careless,
and you got really

337
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,477
hurt all because of me.

338
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,177
I'm sorry.

339
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:18,644
It's my fault.

340
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:19,877
-Don't worry about it, Ridget.

341
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:28,344
-Hey, is that a camera that
you're working on there?

342
00:17:28,444 --> 00:17:29,177
-Oh.

343
00:17:29,277 --> 00:17:30,944
I'm surprised you know that.

344
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,144
Yeah.

345
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:34,244
I recreated it from
ancient blueprints I found.

346
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,344
-I saw a camera once
when I was a little girl.

347
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:40,410
I am amazed you were able
to make one from scratch.

348
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,877
-And it works too.

349
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,144
Hold still.

350
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,344
-Oh.

351
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:49,344
-Here we go.

353
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,277
STORIA: Sorry for
just dropping by.

354
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:02,644
RIDGET: You're always welcome.

355
00:18:02,744 --> 00:18:03,277
Tell me.

356
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:05,944
Is anything wrong?

357
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,310
-Well, it's Ritona
asked me if I would

358
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,710
come with him when they leave.

359
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,410
-I see.

360
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,944
STORIA: But just the idea
of leaving Gargantia-- I

361
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:20,444
mean I've never thought
about it before.

362
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:22,810
Obviously, since
I have no family

363
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,677
that wouldn't be a problem.

364
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:29,277
But I have friends,
like you, Ridget.

365
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:31,844
So I don't know
if I could do it.

366
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,844
How could I leave
people I care about?

367
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:40,477
-Storia, how do you
really feel about Ritona?

368
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:43,877
Be honest.

369
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:47,444
You're in love with him, right?

370
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:48,277
Then go.

371
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,177
Don't worry about anything else.

372
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:53,044
-Ridget, I don't want to
completely abandon you.

373
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:58,244
-You could visit.

374
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:01,410
You can always come back to
Gargantia whenever you want.

375
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,177
Over there, you'll
meet new people

376
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,544
and make more friends,
especially now

377
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,377
that you've forged a new bond.

378
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:10,777
-A new bond.

379
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:16,077
-Storia, I know you'll be OK.

380
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,077
-Oh, Ridget.

381
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:12,610
-Huh?

382
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:13,177
This is--

383
00:20:18,777 --> 00:20:19,477
-Ahh!

384
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:20,644
-What is it?

385
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:22,244
-It's the main ship's
power generator.

386
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:23,910
-Wow.

387
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,277
I've never seen one before.

388
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,277
-Now, I get it.

389
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,577
-Did you figure something out?

390
00:20:32,677 --> 00:20:35,644
-Looks like the light bugs did
a real number on this thing.

391
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:37,210
-The light bugs?

392
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,010
-Why?

393
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,944
-Light bugs multiply
continuously,

394
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:43,544
and they're small enough to
get into just about anything.

395
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:44,977
When enough of
them get together,

396
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,644
they crystallize and
get as hard as a rock.

397
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:50,277
If we can see them eating away
at the outside of this thing,

398
00:20:50,377 --> 00:20:52,610
then the inside of the engine
must be completely encased

399
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,944
in light bugs.

400
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,410
This fleet must have been
dependant on this power source.

401
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,744
And they had a lot of ships
that either couldn't produce

402
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:02,744
any power or couldn't produce
enough on their own to leave.

403
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,844
Most likely, those
ships were the only ones

404
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,477
that were left here.

405
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:08,877
I think it's safe to assume
that all the people on board

406
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,810
got on the ships that
did have their own power

407
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,277
and just took off.

408
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:15,210
-That's a relief.

409
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,544
-Then there aren't any
ghosts here after all.

410
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,610
-Does that mean that the
ghosts escaped as well?

411
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,410
-Sure.

412
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,744
We can say that if you want.

413
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:30,510
RIDGET: Roger, thank
you for investigating.

414
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,444
The fleet commander's journal
supports Pinion's explanation.

415
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,077
-Then are we done searching?

416
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:36,877
-Yes.

417
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:38,977
Let's go back to Gargantia.

418
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,077
-Uh.

419
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,677
At the end of the day,
no treasure at all.

420
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:43,644
BELLOWS: That's
not entirely true.

421
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:44,577
-Huh?

422
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:45,744
-Huh?

423
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:46,285
-Hm.

424
00:21:49,344 --> 00:21:50,210
-That's right.

425
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,344
-What the hell, Bellows?

426
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,910
You found something valuable.

427
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,844
-That's my secret.

428
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,344
-Come on, you tight-lipped cow.

Don't be a hard ass.

00:21:59,410 --> 00:21:59,851
