But you see, our message
to them by resisting

is that there is no
profit in attacking us.

00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:15,900
It's them.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,300
It's the pirates!

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,933
MAN: Commander Warren,
incoming message

166
00:09:20,033 --> 00:09:22,067
from the cargo ship "Etui."

167
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,533
They've got a large pirate
fleet approaching them.

168
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,633
-They're here.

169
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,300
-They're requesting
permission to interlock

170
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,833
with our fleet for
emergency shelter.

171
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:35,633
-He reported that there
are at least 30 ships

172
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,500
in the pirate fleet
that's approaching.

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,100
-They've got 30 ships!

174
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,567
That's almost all of the
pirates in this area.

175
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:44,233
-Moreover, he said they
saw a lobster insignia

176
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,733
in some of the ships.

177
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,000
-That's the great
pirate Lukkage.

178
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,600
-What's their course?

179
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,167
-They were spotted
right around here.

180
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,800
At the time, it looked like they
were headed east by southeast.

181
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,367
It's safe to say their
objective is our fleet.

182
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,633
-They'll be on top
of us by nightfall.

183
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,767
Let's change course.

184
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:07,933
-That's useless.

185
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,967
We don't have the
speed to get away.

186
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,833
-But, sir, we're talking
about 30 pirate ships

187
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:15,733
loaded to the gills
with firepower.

188
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,800
Even including the
small patrol boats,

189
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,867
our escort fleet
has just 15 ships.

190
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,467
There's no way they
could protect us.

191
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,467
-What about trying to
negotiate with them?

192
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,600
-They're coming because
they want revenge.

193
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,667
Only bloodshed
will appease them.

194
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:47,067
-Fleet commander, why don't we
just ask that kid to help us?

195
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,233
-Huh?

196
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500

you require assistance?

heading this way.

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,333
We'll have to tangle with
them by this evening.

201
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,633
LEDO (ON RADIO): I have
already acquired targeting data

202

on the approaching fleet.

203
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:07,900
I am prepared to assist you.

204

Is that your wish?

205
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:12,300
-Fleet Commander, won't
you try talking to him?

206
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,300
-Ridiculous!

207
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,900
We're in this situation
because of him!

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,267
-Regardless!

209
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:21,000
If we can use that Yunoboro,
it will give us the advantage.

210
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,167
-Do it, Ridget.

211
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,300
-Yes, sir.

This is Ridget.

213
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,667
I'll speak to you on behalf of
the fleet commander, all right?

214
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,100
-No objections.

215
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,533
RIDGET (ON RADIO):
Let me confirm.

216
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,367
You say that you'll help
us against the pirates.

217
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,367
But do you understand
that it's your fault

218
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,767
we're in this
dangerous situation.

219
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,767
LEDO (ON RADIO): Yes, I
understand the circumstances.

220
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:46,800
And I apologize for
killing the pirates.

221
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,833
-Then I have a question.

222
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,700
With your weaponry,
it's possible

223
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,867
that you could destroy us
if you wanted to, correct?

224
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,133
LEDO (ON RADIO): Affirmative.

225
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:59,467
This machine alone can
annihilate this entire fleet.

226
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,900
-Then I'm very curious
as to why you would even

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,433
offer to help defend
weaklings like us.

228
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,133
LEDO (ON RADIO): I
desire an arrangement.

229
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,567
RIDGET (ON RADIO):
An arrangement?

230
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,667
-Bellows told me
that your people

231
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:13,833
say "Give fresh water to the
one who catches the fish."

232
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,533
She also informed
me that the pirates

233
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:17,300
don't abide by the
spirit of those words.

234
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,667
That's why I decided it would
be more beneficial to make

235
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,567
an arrangement with you
than with the pirates.

00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:34,233
I'll need aid to do so.

239
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,067
-Fleet Commander, I think
it's in our best interest

240
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,700
that we accept the deal
the boy has just proposed.

-You-- you're not serious?

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,167
-I agree with Ridget.

243
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,200
We mustn't neglect
to give fresh water

244
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,200
to the one who catches the fish.

245

-Confirmation requested.

247
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,852
The mission of this machine
is only to divert the pirates.

248

Is that correct?

All you have to do is
get their attention.

00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:45,834
CAPTAIN: Light it up!

324
00:17:02,734 --> 00:17:04,134
-We're attacked!

325
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:08,567
-Citizens, evacuate
to starboard!

326
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:09,108
-Fire!

327
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:17,008
-Hoover, Yunoboros on, too!

328
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:18,008
We're under attack!

329
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:22,175
CHAMBER: Warning.

330
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:25,108
Gargantia is being invaded
by armored enemy troops.

331
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,241
-When did they get here?

332
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:34,808
-You are not the only
one fighting this battle

333
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,641
with a special Yunoboroid.

334
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:38,541
-The empress is on the attack!

335
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:43,975
-I haven't Empress Lukkage's
lobster in a really long time!

336
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:45,941
-The surfing lobster.

337
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,741
It's heading straight
for Gargantia.

338
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,075
-Call nearby heavy Yunoboros.

339
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:50,008
Fire on the lobster!

340
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,941
She's broken through!

341
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:03,875
Damn it!

342
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,341
-[snickers]

343
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:13,275
[grunts]

344
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,208
-What's happening?

345
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,741
-Rockets just crashed
into the superstructure!

346
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:40,308
-She what?

347
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,675
She's climbing!

348
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:57,641
-Deploy the garrison
to superstructure 1.

349
00:18:57,741 --> 00:18:59,641
-Everyone, evacuate!

350
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:01,641
I'm the one that Lukkage wants.

351
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,408
-Fleet Commander, no.

352
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:06,075
LUKKAGE: I wonder where
Fleet Commander Fairlock is.

353
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:14,608
I want to crush him
like a tiny bug.

354
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,808
Ugh.

355
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:21,175
My, my, suddenly embracing
a lady from behind, eh?

356
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:27,041
But not too worry, I kind
of like aggressive men.

357
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:29,008
-Uh!

358
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:32,908
What is she trying to do?

359
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,875
-Gung ho!

360
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,341
-Semper fidelis.

361
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:38,841
BOTH: Sorry to keep you waiting!

362
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,075
LUKKAGE: It seems you're good
at flying around in the sky.

363
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:58,841
But how do you think
you'll do in water?

364
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,775
-Wha-- ugh!

365
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,741
-I don't believe this!

366
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:09,741
LUKKAGE: Uh, this can't be!

367
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,475
CHAMBER: Warning to
the invading enemy.

368
00:20:11,575 --> 00:20:13,075
Surrender immediately.

369
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,308
-Surrender?

370
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:16,075
Who do you think I am?

371
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,275
-It's no use fighting.

372
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,275
CHAMBER: Repeat.

373
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,241
Surrender.

374
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:22,708
[women shriek]

375
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:25,675
CHAMBER: The safety of your
lives will be guaranteed.

376
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,041
-What a bore!

377
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:29,608
No matter how many times
you say it, I'll-- ugh!

378
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:34,075
CHAMBER: Surrender.

379
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,075
Surrender.

380
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:37,041
Surrender immediately.

381
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:38,041
Repeat.

382
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:39,041
Surrender.

383
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:41,508
-You can just go to hell!

384
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,975
I'll never surrender.

385
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,975
Even if it kills me!

386
00:20:57,975 --> 00:20:58,841
-Oh, crap!

387
00:20:58,941 --> 00:20:59,382
Pull out!

388
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:00,416
-Yeah!

389
00:21:00,516 --> 00:21:01,482
-Wait for me!

390
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,949
[cheers]

391
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,449
-He did it.

392
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,949
That kid did it.

393
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:19,949
MEN: Thank you!

394
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,449
Thank you!

395
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,449
[cheers]

396
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:30,149
-They all keep saying that word.

397
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,249
-It is a phrase
denoting gratitude.

398
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:35,149
-Gratitude.

399
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:35,690
Oh.

400
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,157
-Yes, I see.

401
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:42,923
He did quite well.

402
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:44,857
-Fleet Commander,
what about the boy?

403
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,257
How do you intend
to deal with him?

404
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:51,923
-I-- I just wonder what
Chevron would have done.

405
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,857
-Uh, my father?

406
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,890
-I'm going to let you
decide what to do.

407
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,090
AMY: Good job!

408
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,457
I'll cook you a
special dinner tonight.

409
00:22:12,057 --> 00:22:16,623
-Uh, Tuh-- thanguh-- thanguh--

410
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:18,557
-Hm?

411
00:22:18,657 --> 00:22:20,023
-Thank you, Amy.
