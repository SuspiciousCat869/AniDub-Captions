1
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:33,368
NARRATOR: The long age of
drifting finally came to an end

2
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:37,068
and what remained of humanity
obtained a new home deep

3
00:00:37,168 --> 00:00:39,935
in the wide reaches
of the galaxy.

4
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:44,602
We named it Avalon,
the beautiful paradise.

5
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:48,135
Behold, our paradise built
from our enduring spirit

6
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,302
and scientific prowess.

7
00:00:50,402 --> 00:00:53,868
This is your homeland,
noble brothers.

8
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:58,968
All 470 million of its citizens
hail your unbending dedication.

9
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:01,268
They have engraved your
names on to their hearts

10
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:03,102
as honored soldiers.

11
00:01:03,202 --> 00:01:06,268
All hail the Galactic
Alliance of humankind,

12
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,802
and it's brilliant
eternal future,

13
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,902
for it is here, in this place,
humanity's endless challenge

14
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,535
begins.

15
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,935
But, brothers, you must
never allow yourselves

16
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,268
to forget that a
terrible merciless,

17
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:23,368
evil lurks deep in the depths
of this cold cruel universe.

18
00:01:23,468 --> 00:01:25,368
We must dedicate
ourselves to stopping

19
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:27,435
the ever present threat
of the Hideauze, who

20
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:30,535
try to hinder our
onward journey.

21
00:01:30,635 --> 00:01:33,435
We must not allow these
lower lifeforms to hold back

22
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:35,135
humanity's race to the future.

23
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:42,768
Heroes, gather your
courage in this time

24
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,668
of our greatest trial.

25
00:01:44,768 --> 00:01:46,502
Do not forget the
countless lives

26
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:49,435
lost in sacrifice nor
our future comrades

27
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:52,202
still facing the
shadow of grave danger.

28
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:03,908
CHAMBER: CC REM
education for all crew.

29
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:08,442
Pilot of unit number
K6821, Ensign Ledo,

30
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:11,108
is to awaken immediately.

31
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:14,142
Measuring brain waves,
basic rhythms normal,

32
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:18,842
blood lactate levels normal,
adrenaline output level normal,

33
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,075
awakening process complete.

34
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:26,108
-Where's the enemy?

35
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:30,608
-Attention, Kugel squad, REM
enlightenment time is now over.

36
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,708
I trust everyone is
fully awake and alert.

37
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,042
-We haven't started yet.

38
00:02:35,142 --> 00:02:38,108
-At 300 seconds, the
entire battle fleet

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,508
will be entering the Argos
sphere of the wormhole.

40
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:41,942
We'll be swinging
out to a position

41
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:44,508
right next to a Hideauze's nest.

42
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,275
This is to be a surprise
attack using everything

43
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,008
the Alliance has
to throw at them.

44
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:50,142
This is our only chance.

45
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:53,675
Failure is not an option.

46
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,575
CHAMBER: Notice,
as of this moment,

47
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,408
your time spent in
military service

48
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:00,675
has exceeded 145,000 hours.

49
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:03,208
Ensign Ledo, should you
survive this operation,

50
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,775
once it is complete, you will
be given limited citizenship

51
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,475
privileges and the right to
visit Avalon for four weeks.

52
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:09,142
-Oh, really?

53
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:10,842
Is that so?

54
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:13,108
CHAMBER: No change
in adrenaline levels.

55
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:16,575
Your response fails to
meet expected parameters.

56
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:18,142
-Avalon, huh?

57
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,742
I did want to see it
with my own eyes one day,

58
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,775
but now that I have the
chance, I'm not so sure.

59
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,375
What is a homeland anyway?

60
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:27,242
CHAMBER: A place where
the rights of citizens

61
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,708
are guaranteed.

62
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,575
You will be granted full
rights to sleep, eat, drink,

63
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:34,675
and reproduce
however you see fit.

64
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:36,542
-I don't know.

65
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,975
Is that supposed
to be a good thing?

66
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:42,208
CHAMBER: You have proven to be
superior example of humanity,

67
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:45,308
resourceful, fit to
survive and reproduce.

68
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,108
This is an honor,
an accomplishment

69
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,475
to be celebrated.

70
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:50,608
-Does it make you
happy, Chamber?

71
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,842
CHAMBER: That is irrelevant.

72
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:55,108
I am a pilot support
enlightenment interface system.

73
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,242
I accomplish my
purpose in programming

74
00:03:57,342 --> 00:04:00,175
by ensuring that you
achieve further success.

75
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:01,742
-I appreciate it, Chamber.

76
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:02,908
You do work hard.

77
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:04,142
I'll give you that.

78
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:06,742
-That's enough unnecessary
chatter, Ensign Ledo.

79
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:08,575
You should focus on
the task at hand.

80
00:04:08,675 --> 00:04:10,508
-Roger, Commander Kugel.

81
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,475
-All units prepare for shock.

82
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,675
As soon as the telemothy
swing is complete,

83
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:15,575
we launch the attack.

84
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:19,808
Good luck and good hunting.

85
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:22,942
All ships, prepare for swing.

86
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,975
Initiating telemothy swing.

87
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:25,842
Swing in.

88
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:56,242
The fleet has successfully
passed through the wormhole.

89
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:59,775
All carriers proceed with the
launch of your assault support

90
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,075
craft.

91
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,842
-Assault support craft are
to proceed to the designated

92
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:05,142
coordinates.

93
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,275
-Launch closing pass quantum
dimensional nuclear weapon

94
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:07,975
deployment squad.

95
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,208
Once the Blossom is sighted,
assault ships at the vanguard

96
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,375
are to begin a full
barrage of fire

97
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:19,342
targeting the enemy's
special canon.

98
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:25,308
-The Blossom cell
fortress special canon

99
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,475
is showing rising energy levels.

100
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:28,775
-Prepare on board canons.

101
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,316
Fire.

102
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,449
-Hit confirmed.

103
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:38,383
We struck the canon emitter.

104
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,083
The forward line
has been destroyed.

105
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:47,283
The remaining ships
look for heavy damage.

106
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:49,483
Fire, the rear
ships have struck.

107
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:53,883
We've destroyed
the canon emitter.

108
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:57,349
-Enemy fortress canon
has been destroyed.

109
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:58,483
-Good.

110
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:02,249
Hexelena fleet, prepare
to fire the Dimenstruim.

111
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:04,983
Machine caliber squads launch.

112
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,916
The Hideauze's nest is on the
other side of the hot Jupiter

113
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:09,049
class planets.

114
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:11,316
They are using the
star's radiation pressure

115
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,183
to fuel it's defense
platforms, the Blossom's sail,

116
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:15,916
making it an
impregnable fortress.

117
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,549
The stars powerful
radiation prohibits approach

118
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,416
from the side facing the sun.

119
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:23,549
Therefore, we must attack the
nest from the planet's shadow.

120
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,249
Fire the Dimenstruim.

121
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:26,790
-Fire.

122
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,990
-We will use our new
weapon, the Dimenstruim,

123
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,990
to destroy the fortress
blossom sail and the canon that

124
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,857
protects the planet's shadow.

125
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:41,857
With the nest fully exposed,
we can effectively attack it.

126
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:44,057
Our machine caliber
squad will escort a group

127
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,824
planting a closer pass quantum
dimensional nuclear bomb

128
00:06:46,924 --> 00:06:49,457
on the base and
eliminate anything

129
00:06:49,557 --> 00:06:52,190
that might try to
get in the way.

130
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,057
Front line troops, fire.

131
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:58,290
Phalanx squad, focus all of
your fire on the enemy front.

132
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,257
-Multiple attack
carrier class fighters

133
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,124
have launched from
the enemy nest.

134
00:07:02,224 --> 00:07:02,657
More inbound.

135
00:07:08,124 --> 00:07:11,890
-When was the last
time I felt afraid?

136
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,657
By throwing away
everything nonessential,

137
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:18,190
I become a complete soldier.

138
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,790
Like the victory I'm to achieve,
everything is perfectly clear.

139
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,757
I have no need to waiver.

140
00:07:25,857 --> 00:07:27,557
Everything that I
seek, everything

141
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:30,957
that is desired of
me is all right here.

142
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:32,590
-Closer pass deployment
squad advancing.

143
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,157
Closing in on the
Hideauze's nest.

144
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:37,657
-Multi-core canon squad
commit to attack position.

145
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:50,624
The Blossom Sail is
regenerating too quickly.

146
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,257
-Is the Dimenstruim
ready to fire again?

147
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,024
It's still recharging, sir.

148
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:54,957
We won't make it.

149
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,498
-Damn it.

150
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:03,665
The enemy's fortresses
special canon has fired

151
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,798
and it's struck the main fleet.

152
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:07,931
Fuel escort ships
have been wiped out.

153
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,898
The Dimenstruim formation
has been destroyed.

154
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:10,865
Abort the mission.

155
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:13,798
All ships retreat.

156
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:17,598
-We attack with all of these
ships, and we still can't win?

157
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,698
STRIKER: Commander
Kugel, the stabilizer

158
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:22,665
will cease supplying exotic
matter in four minutes

159
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:23,865
and the wormhole will close.

160
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:26,131
The closer pass
deployment squad is

161
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:29,165
to return the carrier
Lamorak immediately.

162
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:31,231
-All right, everyone,
you heard her.

163
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,198
Abandon the closer
pass now and retreat

164
00:08:33,298 --> 00:08:34,898
or you'll be left behind.

165
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,265
-Yes, sir.

166
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:38,665
All Tilter Company units get
off the closer pass immediately

167
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:42,065
or leave the whole quantum
dimensional bomb behind.

168
00:08:42,165 --> 00:08:44,498
-Obey Commander Kugel's
orders and withdraw.

169
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:45,039
Come on.

170
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:45,588
Go!

171
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:46,129
Go!

172
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,495
Go!

173
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,262
-Set the closer pass quantum
dimensional bomb to mine mode.

174
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,129
Pull out the safety key
and get out of there.

175
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,462
-Wait a minute.

176
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:57,529
Aren't they gonna eat the
closer pass energy core and all?

177
00:08:57,629 --> 00:08:58,495
-Ledo.

178
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:00,395
-I'll take care of
this, Commander.

179
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:01,529
-You'll what?

180
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:04,295
OK, just hold out
for 200 seconds.

181
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:05,795
Don't do anything stupid.

182
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:06,695
-Roger.

183
00:09:06,795 --> 00:09:07,795
Release all emitters.

184
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:08,829
Maximize.

185
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,095
I don't care if we burnout.

186
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:10,729
CHAMBER: Roger.

187
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:43,262
-We need back up.

188
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,229
-We're caught.

189
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:45,229
We can't escape.

190
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:46,695
-We need assistance.

191
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,262
-Roger.

192
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:49,695
I'm on my way.

193
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:50,695
Just hold on.

194
00:10:04,162 --> 00:10:06,429
KUGEL: We're
running out of time.

195
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:07,962
-Commander Kugel, I--

196
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:08,729
KUGEL: Forget it.

197
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:09,495
I'm done for.

198
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,295
Give it up.

199
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,429
Don't waste any more energy.

200
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,429
-Requesting backup.

201
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,429
We're completely surrounded.

202
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,162
The enemy is devouring
the quantum energy

203
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:18,929
core and the closer pass.

204
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,895
We're not gonna last here.

205
00:10:21,995 --> 00:10:23,929
CHAMBER: Ending maximize
limiter release protocol

206
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,062
to preserve on the functionality
avoiding all further combat.

207
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,329
-Maintaining corridor
connection interface.

208
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,595
Initiating telemothy swing.

209
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,429
-40 seconds to Lamorak
telemothy swing.

210
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,895
39.

211
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,329
38.

212
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,762
37.

213
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,229
36.

214
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:42,429
-Damn it.

215
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:43,829
We can't afford to bring
the Hideauze back with us

216
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:44,929
or we'll all dead.

217
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,329
Ledo, you go on ahead
and join the others.

218
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,395
I'll stay back and
slow them down.

219
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:52,529
-Commander Kugel, that
violates military regulation.

220
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,929
-You're still a young man.

221
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,095
You have more time to
kill enemies than me.

222
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:59,129
This is my decision
as a soldier.

223
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:02,595
Glory to the Galactic
Alliance of humankind.

224
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:06,529
See ya, kid.

225
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:07,070
-Commander!

226
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:19,836
CHAMBER: Guidance
beacon received.

227
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:21,003
Commencing landing sequence.

228
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,770
-Damned Hideauze.

229
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:27,795
-Sorry.

230
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:44,161
Wow.

231
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,161
It's huge.

232
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,161
Hey, Bellows!

233
00:12:58,261 --> 00:12:59,128
-Hey, Amy.

234
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,995
-I've got a message from Ridget.

235
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:02,895
She said if you're
willing to be responsible,

236
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:04,761
you can use this place
until tomorrow night.

237
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:06,461
And she said to sign this.

238
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:07,295
-Jeez.

239
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,161
She's such a stickler for rules.

240
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,528
-So what the heck is this thing?

241
00:13:11,628 --> 00:13:14,728
-If we knew, we wouldn't be
having a problem with it.

242
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,361
Forget getting it open.

243
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:17,861
We've tried to
take the armor off.

244
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:20,195
We couldn't even scratch it.

245
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:23,061
I can't even imagine how
they put this thing together.

246
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,961
Oh, and check this out.

247
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:25,895
-What?

248
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,661
-I've never seen
letters like this.

249
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,328
Of course, we're not even
sure these are letters.

250
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,595
-You know, I've had a strange
feeling about this thing

251
00:13:32,695 --> 00:13:34,295
ever since we
found it out there.

252
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,761
I mean, it wasn't
degraded or even rusted,

253
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:39,028
unlike the treasures
we usually drag up.

254
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:40,695
-Yeah, well, it's not
much of a treasure

255
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:42,061
if we can't even take it apart.

256
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,461
-Regardless of
that, you're still

257
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,995
going to buy it at the price
you promised me, Pinion.

258
00:13:46,095 --> 00:13:48,428
You're the one who said you'd
take anything off our hands

259
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,461
that we dredged up.

260
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:50,861
-You gotta be kidding.

261
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:54,328
-It looks like it could start
moving any second, doesn't it?

262
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:55,028
-No way.

263
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,161
It's broken for sure.

264
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:58,661
No matter what we tried,
it won't even budge.

265
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,661
Ah.

266
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,628
-Still, you requested to use
this area way out on the edge

267
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:04,961
just to be safe, right?

268
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,761
If something happens, I suppose
we could just cut you off.

269
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,561
-You idiot, this is my home.

270
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:11,595
You can't just cut
us off that easy.

271
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:14,195
-Right, right, I'll tell Ridget.

272
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,261
-So as you can see,
Amy, there ain't

273
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,328
gonna be much to see
here for a while.

274
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,661
You should probably get
back to your deliveries.

275
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:24,428
-All right, then I'll come
again tomorrow morning.

276
00:14:24,528 --> 00:14:27,528
Make sure you've taken
off a parts by then.

277
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:30,395
-Will do, if we can.

278
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,228
But I got no clue how.

279
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:34,595
CHAMBER: Measuring brain waves.

280
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,595
No abnormalities
in basic rhythms.

281
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,828
Ensign Ledo,
awakening confirmed.

282
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,861
Revival successful.

283
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,995
In accordance with
emergency protocols,

284
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:48,795
I preserved your biological
functions via cryostasis.

285
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:53,095
266,815 minutes have passed.

286
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,861
My system functionality
was in stasis as well,

287
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,495
but I rebooted 12 minutes ago
in response to external stimuli.

288
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:00,795
-Huh?

289
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:03,228
Are you saying that we've
been asleep for six months?

290
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:04,895
CHAMBER: The current
situation we are in

291
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,328
requires the judgment
of the pilot.

292
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:10,428
Thus, I initiated your
awakening process.

293
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,261
-[gibberish]

294
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,061
-Who are all these people?

295
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:15,761
And what are they speaking?

296
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,695
CHAMBER: An unknown language.

297
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:20,828
It is similar to several
ancient languages.

298
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,328
I am analyzing but
lack sufficient data.

299
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:25,495
-So they're not in
the Galactic Alliance?

300
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:29,428
Are they a wandering tribe
that hasn't joined yet?

301
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,895
It looks like they've never
seen a machine caliber.

302
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:34,328
CHAMBER: It appears
as though they

303
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:38,295
are trying to damage the craft,
but have no means of doing so.

304
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,128
Preliminary analysis
indicates they

305
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:42,561
are a very primitive group.

306
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:45,161
-They won't be able to open
the hatch from the looks of it.

307
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:46,628
Where are we?

308
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,228
CHAMBER: It is
impossible at this time

309
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,728
to pinpoint our coordinates.

310
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,528
We lack a point of reference.

311
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:52,728
-What?

312
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,895
CHAMBER: I have developed
a working hypothesis.

313
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,028
During the carrier
Lamorak's telemothy swing,

314
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:00,461
we were caught up in the vortex
of the changing space time

315
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:03,428
metric and later re-synchronized
with normal space time

316
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:06,061
at a set of arbitrary
coordinates.

317
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:07,795
-This isn't good.

318
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,195
CHAMBER: While I was maintaining
your biological functions

319
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:13,261
in cryostasis, I began
sending out a distress signal,

320
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,695
but the situation is quickly
approaching a critical point

321
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:16,895
that requires intervention.

322
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,528
Please advise.

323
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:21,328
-I-- I don't know.

324
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:24,328
Judging from their appearance
alone, they look like humans,

325
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:27,861
but until we know who they are,
I can't make any decisions.

326
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:29,395
CHAMBER: The bulkheads
of this vessel

327
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:32,395
are likely to be extremely
fragile in construction.

328
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:33,961
Even with our
current power output,

329
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:36,661
it is possible to
destroy them and escape.

330
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:37,761
-No.

331
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:39,895
It's probably a vacuum
outside these walls,

332
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:43,128
and they're not wearing
airtight space suits.

333
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:46,028
Besides that, I need to
know what's going on.

334
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:48,761
I'd like to investigate the
surroundings here, but--

335
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:00,036
-Hm.

336
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,936
Damn it!

337
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,902
-The gravity is exactly 1G, huh?

338
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,569
For a primitive
wandering tribe, they

339
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,602
have things tuned pretty well.

340
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:34,836
What about the air?

341
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:37,436
CHAMBER: Primary components
are nitrogen, oxygen,

342
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:38,702
and carbon dioxide.

343
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:40,869
The ratio is ideal for life.

344
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,336
There are other minor components
present, but none of them

345
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,802
are harmful to breathe.

346
00:17:44,902 --> 00:17:46,869
Wow, if it's breathable
air, I'll breath it.

347
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:48,836
I'd like to save up as
much oxygen as possible.

348
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:52,469
What is that smell?

349
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:56,336
What is this place?

350
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:59,369
There should be limits to how
outdated something can be.

351
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,736
Who are these people?

352

00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:07,136
-Look, I know you said you'd
come again this morning,

354
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:10,502
but it's not even dawn yet.

355
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:12,736
-I was thinking about it
so much, I couldn't sleep.

356
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,502
-Yeah, I didn't get
any sleep at all.

357
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,136
-Sorry I had to wake
you up, but you're

358
00:18:17,236 --> 00:18:18,902
the only one who
can unlock the door.

359

-We're crossing between
galaxies right now,

360
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:25,169
Ridget will get pissed
if I waste electricity.

361
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:26,236
What's wrong?

362
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,669
It's not going to
suddenly start moving.

363
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:31,077
Huh?

364
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,543
Amy, get away from
that thing quick.

365
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:42,343
Get over here.

366
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:43,710
Hurry!

367
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,251
-OK.

[alarm]

382

CHAMBER: I cannot find any
logic in your actions, Ensign.

383
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,233
-If I take the hostage, they
won't attack me on sight.

At least, I hope not.

-First, we need to
know the layout here.

much ground as possible.

-Have you been able to figure
out their language yet?

00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:52,466
CHAMBER: Analysis estimated
to be 40% complete.

00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,833
More vocabulary
samples are needed.

-All right, you heard him.

-Ridget, there's an intruder.

401
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:06,700
He's got some weird kind of
gun and he's kidnapped Amy.

402
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,366
-An intruder?

403
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,333
By how?

404
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,433
Where did he come from?

-[gibberish]

408
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,700
CHAMBER: Those were
statements regarding

409
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,733
the active intercourse
with one's mother,

410
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:27,066
as well as an exclamation
about sanctified excrement.

411
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,033
-Just as I thought,
they're savages.

412
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,133
This is the problem
with wandering tribes.

413
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,366
CHAMBER: Statement of doubt.

414
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,533
We cannot assume these
people are a wandering tribe.

415
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,866
-Why do you say that, Chamber?

416
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,400
CHAMBER: None of
the recorded footage

417
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,733
I've analyzed thus far show
any displays of caution taken

418
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,366
for unexpected gravity
fluctuations, radiation

419
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,433
exposure, or air loss.

420
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:48,500
The obvious conclusion
is that this facility

421
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,866
must have been constructed
without any concern for vacuum

422
00:20:50,966 --> 00:20:53,300
safety or zero gravity events.

423
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
-No way.

424
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,666
That's impossible.

425
00:20:55,766 --> 00:20:58,400
CHAMBER: Agreed, but there
is one historical example

426
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,300
in the database that
would fit those criteria.

Now, Chamber!

Chamber, can you tell
me what's going on here?

434
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:18,966
CHAMBER: It appears we have
somehow found ourselves

435
00:22:19,066 --> 00:22:20,900
on the surface of a
planet where restoration

436

of the natural
atmosphere is possible.

No way.

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,766
CHAMBER: Matching data with
observed celestial bodies.

Confirmed.

441
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,700
There is only one set
of data that matches,

the third planet of
the sol system, Earth.

443
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,366
Records suggests
of its existence,

444
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:40,266
but until now, there
has been no proof.

445

This is the planet
of humanity's origin.
