00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:41,756
-But wait.

2
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:43,522
What happens when the
Hideauze are defeated?

3
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:46,822
What would the Galactic
Alliance do then?

4
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,289
What would you do Ledo?

5
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:55,089
-Chamber, do a search.

6
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,622
Determine what kind of
work I could do here.

7
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:59,956
CHAMBER: Search complete.

8
00:01:00,056 --> 00:01:02,722
No results.

9
00:01:02,822 --> 00:01:05,689
Due to a lack of data regarding
Gargantia's employment

10
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:06,922
opportunities.

11
00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:07,956
-You have work.

12
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,489
Why isn't there any for me?

13
00:01:09,589 --> 00:01:10,789
There's nothing?

14
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,622
-It is erroneous to compare
yourself to this machine.

15
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:16,422
Non-battle duties that would be
appropriate for your skill set

16
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:18,356
are nonexistent.

17
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:20,889
I recommend continuing
your current status.

18
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:23,422
-In other words, I'm just
suited for standing by, huh.

19
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,522
-Ledo.

20
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,956
Good morning.

21
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,022
-Good morning

22
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:32,822
CHAMBER: Agreement.

23
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:34,322
It is early in the morning.

24
00:01:34,422 --> 00:01:35,556
-Hi Chamber.

25
00:01:35,656 --> 00:01:36,922
I just saw you sitting here.

26
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:38,389
What is it you're working on?

27
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:41,089
CHAMBER: A component of the
hull interlocking devices.

28
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,222
AMY: [chuckle] They're
really putting you to work.

29
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:44,989
Hey.

30
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:46,356
You're making another one.

31
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:48,889
I heard from Bebel that those
were actually flutes, right.

32
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:49,856
Lemme see.

33
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:50,822
Lemme see.

34
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,189
It's not done yet?

35
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,522
There's no sound.

36
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:03,222
-Even if sound comes
out, is not useful.

37
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:04,322
-Oh come on.

38
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:06,522
You've spent all this
time working on it.

39
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:08,289
-It is not useful.

40
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,756
NO meaning.

41
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:10,297
-Hmm.

42
00:02:17,156 --> 00:02:17,989
Here you go.

43
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,356
-What is it?

44
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:22,656
-That's your pay for
moving all that cargo.

45
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:23,322
Use it wisely.

46
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,556
Don't you have any money
out there in space?

47
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:30,156
CHAMBER: The Galactic
Alliance does not

48
00:02:30,256 --> 00:02:32,289
permit any personal
possessions during the time

49
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:33,489
of military service.

50
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:34,822
-Wow.

51
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:38,122
Not a lot of
incentive, is there?

52
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:40,922
-Amy, I want to work myself.

53
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:41,489
Hmm.

54
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:42,856
Not a bad idea.

55
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,056
Let's go for it.

56
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,689
-What kind of work is there?

57
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,189
-Hmm.

58
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,889
For example, I do deliveries.

59
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,022
It would be a pain if
everyone had to hand deliver

60
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:54,222
letters and small
packages, right?

61
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,722
So instead, I get paid for
carrying them all around

62
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,656
and delivering them
to the right people.

63
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,689
That's how we support
each other here.

64
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:02,889
-Support.

65
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:04,522
I support someone too?

66
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:05,889
-That;s right.

67
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,122
So I think to begin with,
you should think about what

68
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:10,289
you would want
someone to do for you.

69
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:12,356
-Someone do for me?

70
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,089
Can't think of anything.

71
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:16,422
-It might take a little time.

72
00:03:16,522 --> 00:03:19,022
You're still brand
new to our way of life

73
00:03:19,122 --> 00:03:21,289
-Amy, please tell
me what I can do.

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,987
I've been waiting for that.

80
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:16,687
-Here.

81
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:17,987
Please sign on the line.

82
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:19,320
-Sure thing.

83
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,187
-Would you happen to need
someone to help in your shop?

84
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,287
-Huh?

85
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:25,787
-He said he wants to
do some kind of work.

86
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,287
-So you are this space boy
everyone's talking about.

87
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:29,620
Nice to meet ya.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
A worker here did
retire last month.

But I already hired that
kid to take his place.

-Oh.

91
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,420
It'll be fine.

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,754
There's always enough room
for one more fisherman.

-Huh?

94
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:44,887
Not a chance.

95
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:46,654
Just look at 'em.

96
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:50,787
Ever since we lost the current,
things have been pretty slow.

97
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:53,287
I'll let you know when
we get busy again.

98
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,454
-OK.

99
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:58,354
-As you can see,
I'm swamped trying

100
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,254
to organize these invoices.

101

a place in mind.

But it'll take us another
three days to get there.

I'm really sorry I
got your hopes up.

107
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,020
-Fine.

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,387
-Well, it's about time for
me to do my deliveries.

109
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,154

do ship maintenance

170
00:08:58,054 --> 00:09:00,087
on calm days like this.

171
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,787
We take the fleet
off of the Milky Way

172
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:05,087
and turn off the whole power
grid so that everyone aboard,

173
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:08,954
except the repair technicians,
get to take a breather.

174
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,120
-Is that so?

175
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,520
AMY: Bebel, are you okay?

176
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,854
-Yeah.

177
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,187
Whoa.

178
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:18,620
PINION: Quite a sight, right?

179
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,420
Not a lot of people
know about this place.

180
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,287
AMY: It's beautiful

is what the sea's

182
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,620
like when there's no wind.

183

00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:35,128

00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:52,987
That spot looks pretty
inviting, right?

-But I--

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,987
SAAYA: It'll feel good.

00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,420

You don't know what I went
through to get this fine meat.

It's gonna be delicious.

We've still got
all the power off.

Hey, can't you get your tin
can to do something about this?

-Hey Ledo.

235
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,787
I've got a little job I'd
like you to handle for me.

00:11:39,887 --> 00:11:41,020
-Is it work?

237
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
-Yes it is.

238
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,554
I need something from
the old iron smith.

239
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:46,754
And you're most
suited for the job.

240
00:11:46,854 --> 00:11:48,620
It's work that only you can do.

241
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,420
-Wait a second.

242
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,887
You're making Ledo go there?

243
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:52,054
Are you sure?

244
00:11:52,154 --> 00:11:52,887
-Hey.

245
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:53,954
He ruined a whole bunch of meat.

246
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:56,520
So yeah, of course I am.

247
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,720

00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:32,002
-Huh?

260
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:34,069
-If I eat a bunch of
meat and stuff here

261
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,769
I'll probably gain weight again.

-What do you mean again?

You've got absolutely
nothing to worry about Melty.

-Yeah, well everyone's
got their own norm, right?

-I never worry about it.

If a boy wants me, he'll just
have to accept me as I am.

-Huh?

-You keep thinking like that
and you'll never get a date.

-Hmm.

Ah.

00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:59,069

though the power's back on.

298
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,302
Why are they so focused on
maintaining their weight even

299
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:43,469
as they seek to eat
great quantities.

-Yeah.

301
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:46,502
Well, that's just the
way some girls think.

302
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:48,569
-That simply does not compute.

303
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,602

Hey, tin can.

307
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,469
You're made out of
metal aren't you?

-Is this the correct place?

-Are you by yourself?

310
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:22,369
You've got a cute face you know.

311
00:14:22,469 --> 00:14:24,535
And a very juicy body.

312

-Ooh.

313
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,702
What was that?

of the crane tower.

-OK.

317
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:37,702
Got it.

318
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:41,702
-Get ready.

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,710
Go!

321
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,902
Don't fly so recklessly.

-Query.

323
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,169
What is the necessity
of this action?

324
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,469
-Don't move.

-Pinion.

326
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:09,935
So, ah, what happened to
fixing the winch on my boat?

327
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,469
-I'm gonna do it.

-Isn't right now supposed
to be your busiest time?

-Hey.

330
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:16,569
Don't sweat the details.

331
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,069
Stick around and
get some barbecue.

in a little bit.

00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,269
Chamber!

339
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,035
-Ensign Ledo is in trouble.

340
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,735
-I told you not to move.

341
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,369
He'll learn some useful
things about our society.

342
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:40,369
-Understood.

343
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:43,002
-Pinion?

344
00:15:43,102 --> 00:15:44,735
What are you doing over here?

345
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:45,735
-Who are you?

346
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:49,802
Ridget!

347
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,369
Why are you in that outfit?

348
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,669
OFFICER RIDGET: I was overseeing
inspection and repairs

349
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:54,769
at the bottom of the ship.

350
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:55,310
-Oh.

351
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:56,602
I see.

352
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:59,402
Hey, when's the power going
to go back on in this area?

353
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:01,402
-We're taking longer
than expected.

354
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,269
So it'll be off 'til tonight.

355
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:05,769
Let's take a break.

356
00:16:05,869 --> 00:16:07,969
You haven't started yet?

357
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,802
-No.

358
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:10,002
-Oh.

359
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:10,869
May I join you?

360
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,002
-Sure.

361
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,569
-Is something wrong?

362
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,569
-No.

363
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:18,469
It's just-- your
swimsuit is pretty hot.

364
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:19,102
-Oh.

365
00:16:19,202 --> 00:16:19,643
Really?

366
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:20,148
You think?

367
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:24,435
-Don't worry.

368
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:27,269
New workers don't have
a quota or anything.

369
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,235
Wait.

370
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,735
-What is all this?

371
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:31,202
What did I do to them?

372
00:16:31,302 --> 00:16:32,669
-Looks like I'm gonna win this.

373
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:33,635
-It's not over yet.

374
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:36,602
-I'm not gonna lose.

375
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:38,069
-Huh?

376
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:40,535
-You'd have a good chance at
becoming our club's number one

377
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:42,002
employee.

378
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,202
-What's for dinner?
[creepy chuckle]

379
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:44,969
-Wow.

380
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:46,335
You have such a nice butt.

381
00:16:46,435 --> 00:16:49,002
-You're so fresh, with
lots of stamina too.

382
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:56,502
-Amy.

383
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:58,002
-Are you okay?

384
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:58,702
-Oh?

385
00:16:58,802 --> 00:16:59,969
Why is it always Amy?

386
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,735
-Yeah?

387
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,469
Well, we're still racing.

388
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:03,010
-Hey!

389
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:05,969
Wait!

390
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,969
-Ah.

391
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,969
Hang on tight.

392
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:19,476
-Ah.

393
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:19,976
Uh oh.

394
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:24,902
-I did it!

395
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,902
I'm first.

396
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:47,169
That should do it.

397
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,935
But that was a close call.

398
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,735
What were you doing up there
on those stairs any way?

399
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:53,869
-I do not really know.

400
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:55,635
-Hmm.

401
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:59,869
Well in any case, thanks
for your hard work.

402
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:00,835
-Huh?

403
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:01,835
-Hmm?

404
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:02,802
-There it is.

405
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:03,802
-Watch this.

406
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:21,110
-Yay!

407
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:34,902
-I will return to work now.

408
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:42,802
-Huh?

409
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,302
-What the--

410
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,269
-The street you want
is straight ahead.

411
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,202
[transvestites yelling]

412
00:19:06,202 --> 00:19:07,102
-This is it.

413
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:10,869
-Yeah.

414
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:12,035
That was some good exercise.

415
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,302
-I know.

416
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,502
And now we can eat a lot
without have to worry about it.

417
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:17,502
-Query.

418
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:18,469
What is the necessity
of this action?

419
00:19:18,569 --> 00:19:19,169
Query.

420
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:19,835
What is the necessity--

421
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,535
-I said don't move!

422
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:29,269
Good.

423
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,202
It's almost time.

424
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:35,969
LEDO: This place--

425
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:45,269
-Young one, what is it that
you intend to do with this?

426
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:47,469
-Hmm?

427
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:48,335
-Hmm.

428
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,135
All right.

429
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:50,235
Fine.

430
00:19:50,335 --> 00:19:52,969
Take it if this will
finally settle things.

431
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,269
[groan]

432
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:54,810
-Shh.

433
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:05,802
-Are there parts in here?

434
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:11,169
Do I have to back through there?

435
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:22,069
What's going on here?

436
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,535
-Darn. it.

437
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,002
I wonder who blabbed to
everyone about the party.

438
00:20:40,702 --> 00:20:42,402
-Welcome back Ledo.

439
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:43,269
-All right.

440
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:45,202
Way to go space boy.

441
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:46,635
Got back just in time.

442
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:48,835
Just putting salt on
meat ain't enough.

443
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:49,835
-OK now.

444
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:50,802
Who wants some?

445
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:51,343
-Me!

446
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:00,435
--[chuckles] That granny sauce
is the best thing in the whole

447
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:00,976
world.

448
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:02,035
-Ledo.

449
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,102
If you don't get some
now, it'll be gone.

450
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:05,669
-OK

451
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:06,235
-There you go.

452
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,202
-Is it good?

453
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,035
Now, with the sauce you
worked so hard to get.

454
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:18,835
-Try this.

455
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:23,169
-This is so--

456
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:39,543
-Oh.

457
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:41,469
The wind.

458
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,869
-Well, better get back to work.

459
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,702
-Did you get enough to eat?

460
00:21:45,802 --> 00:21:46,535
-Yes.

461
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:47,335
Maybe.

462
00:21:47,435 --> 00:21:48,169
-I see.

463
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:50,369
Well you did come in a bit late.

464
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:51,769
Sorry about that.

465
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:54,102
Even though the
party was for you.

466
00:21:54,202 --> 00:21:55,035
Huh?

467
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,435
You mean you didn't know?

468
00:21:56,535 --> 00:21:58,802
Pinion heard that you
couldn't find a job.

469
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:02,035
So he through this big barbecue
to try and cheer you up.

470
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:02,602
-Oh.

471
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:03,835
He really did?

472
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:05,935
-And you worked hard
for everyone too.

473
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:07,902
Thanks for that.

474
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:10,469
-I did for everyone?

475
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,402
-Sure.

476
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:13,302
I mean, Thanks to
you we were all

477
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:16,835
able to eat some really
delicious barbecue.

478
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:17,376
Come on.

479
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,335
Let's go.

480
00:22:18,435 --> 00:22:20,269
I'll try to help
you find work again.

481
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,635
-I wonder what kind of
work he'd be suited for.

482
00:22:22,735 --> 00:22:25,369
-Probably some kind
of physical labor?

483
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,469
-No cows.

484
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:28,402
-What's that mean?

485
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:30,369
MAYTA: Ah, Pinion.

486
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:32,502
MAN: So this is where
you've been slacking off.

487
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,502
PINION: Wait.

488
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,502
Thi-- this is
legitimate work here.

489
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:38,135
Oh, I'm sorry.

490
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:39,135
-Query.

491
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:40,902
What is the necessity
of this action?

492
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:41,869
Query.

What is the necessity
