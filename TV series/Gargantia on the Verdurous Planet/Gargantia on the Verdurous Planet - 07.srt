This is outrageous.

-People have regarded the
whale-squid as sacred creatures

since ancient times.

And it's beginning
to spread quickly.

-Rumors are even
going around that this

will bring about
some sort of curse.

-Because he's the one

Will do.

58
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,375
However, the probability
is low that the results

No.

It can't be.

70
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:08,242
-Ensign, it is possible to
do a biological analysis

71
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,909
but not to obtain information
on their invasion strategy.

72
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:13,642
-Then I'll gather
information from the fleet.

I need to know their numbers
and range of activities.

That sounds good.

00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:34,965
So how are you feeling?

80
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:37,198
Are you having any issues?

-No.

-Go easy on your
official duties.

And take a vacation
once in awhile.

-Hm?

00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:58,398
-I can't walk anymore.

91
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,565
But I can assure you,
doctor, these legs

92
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:04,265
remember just how
big this fleet is.

93
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,665
My eyes and ears remember
exactly what kind of people

94
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,398
are living on board.

95
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,265
I want to keep on protecting
the beautiful smiles

96
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:15,598
and voices of the
people who live here.

97
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:20,298
You see doctor, that's
the proof that I lived.

98
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:22,798
-Can't argue with that.

99
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:26,098
But at a time when you should
be trying to slow down,

100
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:28,032
it seems the fleet
has gotten involved

101
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:29,532
with a whale-squid problem.

102
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:31,065
Honestly.

-No matter how old
I get, there always

and experiences.

you're not afraid?

-No matter what the
reality of the situation

00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:45,032
is, accepting it as a privilege
for those who are alive.

-It's a privilege?

109

-Of course, if we can see
it through to the end,

110
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:54,432
we must entrust it to
the next generation.

111
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:57,865
-You're right old friend.

112

-You guys must have
heard about it too.

113
00:07:00,232 --> 00:07:01,898
There's treasure in
whale-squid territory

114
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:04,098
that no one else has
even tried to look for.

00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,632
No one is ever dared
to dive into the middle

If nobody's ever been brave
enough to dive down there,

123
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,132
how do we know there's treasure?

124
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:26,965
-I knew somebody who saw
it with his own two eyes.

125
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:30,798
He told me all about
it before he died.

with a whale-squid?

-I'll tell you who.

The one who owns that tin can.

133
00:07:42,298 --> 00:07:44,598
With him on our side,
it'll be a piece of cake.

-What?

135
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,465
Wait a minute.

136
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:47,932
Are you telling me they're
already on board with this?

137
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:50,765
-For that I need a little time.

-What the hell.

You haven't even made
the arrangements yet?

-I'll listen to you
once you've actually

got space boy and tin
can all lined up, OK.

You were with him.

145
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:06,998
How could you let him
attack a whale-squid?

[sigh]

147
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,032
All the ship owners
are concerned

148
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:13,432
that their ships are now
going to be attacked.

149
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,965
Look at all the
requests I've gotten

150
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:17,165
demanding that
measures be taken.

151
00:08:17,265 --> 00:08:18,765
-I won't make excuses.

152
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:22,198
It's my fault for not properly
warning him beforehand.

153
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:26,632
-And so, are you saying more
of them exist out there?

154
00:08:26,732 --> 00:08:30,198
In that case, I will
continue my primary mission

155
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:31,732
and kill them all.

156

-Do you know exactly
what you're saying?

-Hideauze [non-english speech].

CHAMBER: The
Hideauze are a threat

to the existence
of the human race.

160
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,565
A war of extermination
is the only option.

161
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:45,332
-Yes, well, that's
only what you say.

162
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:47,732
We don't have even the
smallest reason whatsoever

163
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:49,798
to attack the whale-squids.

-Where do you think
you are right now?

168
00:08:58,265 --> 00:08:59,932
You are on Gargantia.

169

[gasp]

170
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,932
-The fleet commander has
requested a detailed briefing

171
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:04,865
from you.

172
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:05,932
-Good timing.

173
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,132
They're here too.

174
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:09,665
-Do you intend on having
the fleet commander listen

175
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,465
to all that arguing?

176
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:13,032
-No.

177
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:14,032
You're right.

178
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:16,265
I'll report alone.

179
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:17,432
You two may go now.

180
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:35,232
-Hm?

181
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:35,773
-Psst.

182
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:36,306
Hey.

183
00:09:36,406 --> 00:09:37,739
Hey Flange.

184
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,906
--Hm?

185
00:09:40,006 --> 00:09:40,473
What?

186
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:43,139
PINION: Shhh!

187
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,680
-Uh.

188
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,021
-Hm?

189
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:54,562
Uh.

190
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,162
Ledo.

191
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:04,962
-Hideauze-- whale-squids,
tell me about them please.

192
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,629
How many of them
are around here?

193
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,129
What are their weaknesses?

194
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,796
What is their combat strength?

195
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:11,462
-Whoa!

196
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:13,696
Wait a second Ledo.

197
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,296
-So you're still
gonna attack them?

198
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:17,129
You absolutely can't.

199
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,096
-The whale-squid are
terrifying creatures

200
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,496
if you start
something with them.

201
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:23,696
But they've never been
known to attack unprovoked.

202
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:24,796
-That's right.

203
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:26,929
Wouldn't you feel bad
about killing them?

204
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,296
-Impossible.

205
00:10:28,396 --> 00:10:30,096
They are enemies that
need to be wiped out.

206
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,929
Can't you understand?

207
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,862
-Did you come all the
way down here to Earth

208
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:35,696
just so you could
continue your war?

209
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:38,462
Your conflict has
nothing to do with us.

210
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:42,996
-Right now your civilization
[non-english speech].

-I have no idea what
you've just said.

212
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,362
CHAMBER: Presently
your civilization

213
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:51,696
is being ignored by the Hideauze
because of your simplicity.

of time before they strike.

216
00:10:55,396 --> 00:10:59,862
When that happens, how will your
people respond to the threat?

217
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:00,862
-I don't know.

220
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,596
at the far fewer people
even have a vision on how

221
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:07,462
to development
your civilization?

222
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:09,396
Instead of thinking
about, you fight

223
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,429
amongst yourselves against
your fellow humans.

224
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,729
-Once the enemy
attacks, it is too late.

225
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,962
I will attack
before that happens.

226
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:22,729
-Ledo.

227
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:25,762
-And that's that?

228
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:28,062
-Understand, I
live to kill them.

229
00:11:28,162 --> 00:11:29,896
It is my mission.

230
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:32,096
-But you don't have
to do that Ledo.

231
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,162
You're your own person.

232
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:47,362
BELLOWS: Pinion, if you've got
some twisted idea in your head,

233
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:48,529
forget about it.

234
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:49,829
PINION: What do you mean?

235
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:51,962
-You want to use
Ledo and Chamber

236
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,629
to go into whale-squid
territory and salvage, right?

237
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,429
[chuckle]

238
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:58,029
-What's so wrong with that?

239
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,229
I mean he's able to fight
them effectively, right?

240
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:01,896
If there's treasure
down there, I

241
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,629
can just swoop down and grab it.

242
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:06,296
-Even if it means putting
the fleet in danger?

243
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:07,729
No matter what you
dredge up, it's

244
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:09,862
meaningless if it doesn't
benefit Gargantia.

245
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,996
-Of course it'll be beneficial.

246
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:14,562
I'm talking about vast
unexplored regions,

247
00:12:14,662 --> 00:12:17,929
a once in a lifetime chance
to find unheard-of treasures.

248
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:18,829
What do you think?

00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,262
Join up with us.

250
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,029
It's going to be a
salvager's dream.

251
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:24,929
-Sorry but I'm not
interested in being

252
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:27,529
part of a childish expedition.

253
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:28,829
-What was that?

254
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,729
-All you want to do
is bring stuff up

255
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,229
for the sake of
your two-bit pride,

256
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,096
so you can brag about it.

257
00:12:34,196 --> 00:12:37,029
You can't dive yourself so
you just use other people.

258
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,962
And you're satisfied
with that, huh.

259
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,162
-Bellows you jerk!

[teeth grinding]

00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:02,562
I swore that I'd get
revenge for my big brother.

262
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:07,396
-But that's just a dream too.

263
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,896
LEDO: Have you heard
from the Alliance yet?

264
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,196
-There is still no response.

265
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:14,362
-What about our coordinates?

266
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:15,762
-Analysis.

267
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,362
Further parallax observation of
this planets orbit is required.

268
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:21,196
-Darn it.

269
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:23,829
CHAMBER: Analysis of the
biological sample is complete.

[gasp]

271
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,029
-What's the result?

272
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,862
-Although the composition
of the exoskeleton

273
00:13:27,962 --> 00:13:30,062
has adapted to the
environment, there

274
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,896
is no difference between
the genetic makeup

275
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:34,462
of this sample and the Hideauze.

276
00:13:34,562 --> 00:13:36,429
They are identical species.

277
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:38,029
-I knew it!

278
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:41,029
The Alliance policy of
destruction isn't wrong.

279
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:44,162
It is necessary for the
humans of Earth too.

280
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:46,729
Why can't they all
understand that?

281
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:47,962
CHAMBER: Hypothesis.

282
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,462
According to language
analysis and comparison,

283
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,229
the definition of
survival strategy

284
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:54,462
for the humans of
Earth greatly differs

285
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:56,429
from that of the Alliance.

286
00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,129
-How is it defined?

287
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,129
-The answer cannot be found in
any standard Galactic Alliance

289

However, it exists in

00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:17,986
Raise it!

331
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,786
-This is all because we
let that alien on board.

332
00:16:20,886 --> 00:16:21,319
Darn it!

333
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,286
-Oh please.

334
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,753
Please have mercy.

335
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:24,753
-Spare us please.

336
00:16:32,886 --> 00:16:34,119
OFFICER RIDGET: Fleet Commander!

337
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:42,653
-Turn that off.

338
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,519
-Yes Sir!

339
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:47,786
-I'll be taking command.

340
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:48,953
You mind?

341
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:49,686
-No Sir.

342
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:51,386
Of course not.

343
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,719
But I--

344
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:54,686
-Attention.

345
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,719
This is Fleet
Commander Fairlock.

346
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,953
I want you all to listen.

347
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:02,419
A pod of whale-squid is
approaching the fleet.

348
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,386
There is a substantial
number of them.

349
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:07,953
But as long as we are careful,
there will be no danger.

350
00:17:08,053 --> 00:17:11,819
Do nothing that could
stimulate the pot.

351
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,086
Gargantia is going to
power down completely.

352
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:20,886
Now Ridget, relay
this instruction

353
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:22,419
to all of the ships.

354
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:25,619
Shut down all the
lights and sounds.

355
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,286
-Yes Sir.

356
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,519
FLEET COMMANDER FAIRLOCK (ON
INTERCOM): After we power down,

357
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:39,719
all citizens stay still where
you are, no unnecessary noise.

358
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:55,619
-Oh please, have mer--

359
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:56,919
-Shh!

360
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,686
FLEET COMMANDER FAIRLOCK (ON
INTERCOM): Main power off.

361
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:06,386
[engines shutting down]

362
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:08,419
-Get out of my way.

363
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,319
-No.

364
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,053
-I have no choice.

365
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:18,019
-No, please!

366
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:18,986
Don't go!

367
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:20,419
Please don't go.

368
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,853
-Amy, let go!

369
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:24,853
You said my battle has
nothing to do with all of you,

370
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:25,986
did you not?

371
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,253
-But it does.

372
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,119
-Do you mean the fleet?

373
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:31,119
Then I will make
no trouble for you.

374
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:32,453
I will leave here.

375
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:33,819
I will fight them alone.

376
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:34,853
-That's not it.

377
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,319
I just don't want
you to do something

378
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,319
this dangerous because
I-- [footsteps] Uh.

379
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:42,927
It's Ridget.

380
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,294
-I warned you before.

381
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,560
You must comply
with our policies.

382
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,894
-I refuse.

383
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:53,127
-I can't allow this.

384
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,827
If the whale-squid pod
decides to attack the fleet,

385
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,794
you can do whatever you like.

386
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:03,094
But unless they do, I cannot
allow you to take action.

-Don't touch me.

403
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,294
As long as I am here, I
cannot carry out my mission.

404
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,194
I am a soldier.

PINION: I want Ledo and
Chamber to work for me.

409
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,094
If we team up, I'll
be able to salvage

410
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:14,994
from whale-squid territory.

411
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:16,160
-Seriously?

412
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,927
You have got to be kidding.

413
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,227
-I would never joke about this.

414
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,594
This is everyone who's
agreed to join me.

415
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:26,260
We're all gonna be
leaving Gargantia.

416
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
So sign it.

417
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:33,827
-Fleet Commander, I
also seek permission

418
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:35,094
to escort them with my ships.

419
00:21:39,727 --> 00:21:40,860
-But Flange--

420
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,027
-You too?

421
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:43,227
But why?

422
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:45,827
-If a major ship master
like you leaves the fleet,

423
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,260
our defensive capability
will be weakened.

424
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,594
-The legacy of a once
great age is just

425
00:21:50,694 --> 00:21:53,027
lying down there
on the ocean floor.

426
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:56,860
If we can manage to reclaim
even a small part of it--

427
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,160
I hope there are
no hard feelings.

428
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,960
-Unbelievable.

429
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,327
-Never.

430
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:04,927
I will not allow the
narrow interests of a few

431
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:07,394
to jeopardize all the
people of Gargantia.

432
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,294
