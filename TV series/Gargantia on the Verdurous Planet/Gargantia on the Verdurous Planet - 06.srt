there's no money in space.

Well, it's perfect timing.

When that happens, the
fish can't get out.

00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:18,730
Nice work today.

172
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,030
You did a great job at sinking.

173
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,130
-No problem.

174
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,763
Chamber is working in my place.

175
00:08:23,863 --> 00:08:24,463
-Aw.

176
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:25,763
Don't sulk like that.

177
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:29,230
Come on, hang out
with me for a while.

178
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,263
So, I hear you don't know
how to spend your money.

179
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:33,396
Let me show you then.

180
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,196
And just for today, I'll
even pick up the tab.

181
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:38,863
We'll call this lesson one.

182
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:41,863
Hey waitress, over here!

183
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:43,630
So what will it be?

184
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,996
-Seaweed bread.

185
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,963
-Huh?

186
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:49,930
Waitress, two special
dinners with everything.

187
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,896
-Got it.

188
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:54,496
Two special dinners
coming right up.

189
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:56,330
-Tell me kid, what's your deal?

190
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,063
You home sick?

191
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:58,196
You miss space?

192
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,530
-I have no map.

193
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,130
Going back is not possible.

194
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,696
-Well, I guess
you're stuck then.

195
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:04,796
What about life here?

196
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:06,330
You like it?

197
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,463
-Not bad.

198
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,863
But, people are distant.

199
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,730
-Of course they are, you nut.

200
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,730
You don't need anything
but seaweed bread.

201
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,796
-People do not
like seaweed bread?

202
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:17,463
-Not that.

203
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,896
People can't see
who you really are.

204
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:24,063
-They cannot see me?

205
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,996
[cheering]

206
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,230
-Woohoohoo.

207
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,496
Look, what do you want?

208
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:35,996
You must be interested
in something.

209
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,196
-I want to return to the
Alliance battlefront.

210
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:41,896
-No.

211
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,663
Not that soldier boy.

212
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,096
I mean something
here on this ship.

213
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:46,930
LEDO: I do not know.

214
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,830
[sigh]

215
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,630
-How's a guy supposed to be
trusted when he doesn't even

216
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,796
know what the heck he wants?

217
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:57,930
-It's good.

218
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:09,763
-Why not team up
with me and salvage.

219
00:10:09,863 --> 00:10:10,930
-Salvage.

220
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,930
Is that work?

221
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,930
Oh, yeah!

222
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,096
With that super
tin can of yours,

223
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,730
we can score some big stuff.

224
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,263
-But more money is too much.

225
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,963
-Trust me kid, it
won't be too much.

226
00:10:24,063 --> 00:10:25,930
Besides, when you
make more money,

227
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,763
you can eat more tasty things
or get yourself a nice boat.

228
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:30,463
Spend it.

229
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,496
Learn what you like.

230
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:33,296
Find out what your
heart desires.

231
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:36,530
-What my heart, desires.

232
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,430
-Hm.

233
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,430
-Not so fast, Bub.

234
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,296
No way you're stealing the kid.

235
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:42,763
-Stealing what?

236
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,796
If he's gonna team up with
anyone, it's going to be me.

237
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:51,230
I can train you to be a
first-class salvager kid.

238
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,396
What do you say?

239
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:54,596
-Salvager.

240
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,730
I do not understand.

241
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,796
-I'll teach you.

242
00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,930
It's real easy to pick up.

243
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,763
If there's ever anything
you can't do, ask me how

244
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,363
and I'll tell you.

245
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,463
Or just watch me
and do what I do.

246
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:08,096
Piece of cake.

247
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:09,830
-Don't listen to Bellows kid.

248
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,563
Stick with me and I'll get
the best food in the fleet.

249
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,030
-I can teach you to
read tides and currents.

250
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,396
You're smart so you'll
pick it up quickly.

251
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,530
Booze kid.

252
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,796
All you can drink.

253
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:23,863
-Yeah, sure.

254
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,096
But don't you want
to learn how to swim.

255
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:28,096
-I'll get you all the
ass you can handle.

256
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,530
-Pinion!

257
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,296
That's sleazy.

258
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,596
Don't be such a creep.

259
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,563
-Oh shut up turtle shell ass.

260
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,330
-Who are you calling
turtle shell ass?

261
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:38,996
You can't even swim.

262
00:11:39,096 --> 00:11:39,730
PINION: I can swim.

263
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,663
I just can't dive.

264
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:50,996
-Sorry it took so long.

265
00:11:51,096 --> 00:11:52,396
Thanks for your patience.

266
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:54,230
Here's your main dish.

267
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:54,963
-Oh, yeah.

The main event.

Calm down.

-Mm If this little
thing freaks you out,

284
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,863
you don't ever want to
run into a whale-squid.

285
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:52,230
You might lose it
completely and pass out.

you thinking, eh?

00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:41,456
You should practice more.

341
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:44,123
-Practice the flute?

342
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:45,689
Like Amy practice dancing?

343
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:46,656
-Ah.

344
00:17:46,756 --> 00:17:48,056
[chuckle]

345
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:55,223
-I want to see Amy dance.

346
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:56,956
[chuckle]

347
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:57,723
-OK.

348
00:17:57,823 --> 00:18:01,623
As thanks for earlier.

349
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:02,223
-As thanks?

350
00:19:20,956 --> 00:19:23,823
-Bebel, I brought you a present.

351
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:25,023
-Welcome home Amy.

352
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,323
-Hello.

353
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:27,356
-Hi, Doctor Oldham.

354
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,689
Did you two have fun
while I was gone?

355
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,589
BEBEL: Ledo.

356
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:35,456
-I brought a gift.

357
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:37,856
[vibrating]

358
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:38,723
-Thanks Ledo.

359
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:40,189
It's great.

360
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,156
-With money, I can get
things for others, presents

361
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,556
and good food to eat.

362
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:48,256
-The pay you received
is not just a reward.

363
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:51,589
It signifies that you
gave aid and support.

364
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:55,123
-I gave aid and support?

365
00:19:55,223 --> 00:19:56,789
So that is working.

366
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,956
I was invited to
do some more work.

367
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:04,989
-Doing what?

368
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:08,989
-Salvage work with
Chamber down below.

369
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:09,723
-Wow.

370
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,056
How cool.

371
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,489
LEDO: It will be cold?

372
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:16,123
-I mean how exciting to get to
see all the things down there.

373
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:17,956
You can find all sorts
of great treasure

374
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:19,689
and see what the
Earth used to be like.

375
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,189
-I want to work on salvage.

376
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:42,456
[sigh]

377
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,056
-You're a big help Ledo.

378
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:50,856
I'm glad you're here.

379
00:20:50,956 --> 00:20:52,623
I really thought
Pinion had talked you

380
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:54,923
into partnering with him.

381
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:58,889
-I want you to teach me Bellows
and to learn much from you.

382
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,023
BELLOWS: Thanks.

383
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:01,823
But so long as you have
that high-tech yunburo,

384
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:02,889
you'll forget it all.

385
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,823
Nothing I'd tell you
will stick for long.

386
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:06,423
-I wish to learn.

387
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:07,323
I will remember.

388
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:11,356
FEMALE YUNBURO PILOT: Yes!

389
00:21:11,456 --> 00:21:15,656
Looks like another
treasure trove.

390
00:21:15,756 --> 00:21:16,823
-Be gentle with it.

391
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:17,723
It's valuable.

392
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,523
[chuckle]

393
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:36,423
[alarm sounding]

394
00:21:41,923 --> 00:21:42,364
-Ah.

395
00:21:45,397 --> 00:21:47,464
-Ah.

396
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:48,464
[scream]

397
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,064
-Enemy signature identified.

398
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:55,364
Interceptor type.

399
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,330
LEDO: Confirm identification.

400
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,497
-Characteristic response
analysis complete.

401
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:04,430
Probability 99.97%
subject is Hideauze.

402
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,497
-Engage.

403
00:22:05,597 --> 00:22:06,964
Annihilate the Hideauze.

404
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:07,597
CHAMBER: Roger.

405
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:27,771
