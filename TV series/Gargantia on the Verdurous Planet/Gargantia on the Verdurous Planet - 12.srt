00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:15,048
-We've been gathering what
we believe to be weapons

4
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,148
from among the sacred
relics that have already

5
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:18,448
been brought to the surface.

-Oh-- oh, wow!

7
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:21,048
A mountain of treasure!

8
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:24,682
-Your sacred duty will be
to restore these relics.

00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:26,948
-That's a lot easier
said than done.

00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,648
I don't even know what's
inside half these things.

Huh?

12
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:31,982

I can see through the metal!

Whoa, this thing is awesome!

17
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:40,615
-We desire only the
items that are weapons.

18
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,115
Do as you wish with the rest.

19
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:43,082

20
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:45,048
Uh-- fine.

21
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:46,048
I'll do that!

00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:47,348
You can count on me.

23
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:48,148
-Hm.

24
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,848
We'll leave you to it, then.

00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:04,482
Did you say something?

32
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:07,848
-I was remarking on how
easily you sold out.

33
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:09,115
-Huh?

34
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:11,348
-You're as easy to placate
as a child with a new toy.

35
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,182
I thought you were a
man with more backbone,

36
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,815

you getting at?

-Yeah.

00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,648
What about it?

42

power, if you catch my drift.

-I don't see where
you're going with this.

-I've grown rather tired of
this fleet and its methods.

45
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,515
I think it's about
time for a change.

-Huh?

47
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,182
What--

48
00:01:36,282 --> 00:01:39,682
-I've decided to return
to piracy just as soon

49
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:42,382
as this fleet's resting
on the ocean floor.

52
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:03,448
Sir, about the Gargantia,
would you cancel the attack?

53
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:04,748
-Why?

54
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:06,115
-Well--

55
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,315
-If you feel an affinity
towards them, all the more

56
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,315
reason to enlighten them
as quickly as possible,

57
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:11,548
don't you think?

58
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:13,182
-Oh!

59
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,382
-To increase the
prosperity of humankind,

60
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:18,282
we both need superior
people and resources.

61
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,515
-But sir!

62
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,848
-Ledo, our mission is
to bring a new sense

63
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:25,082
of order and stability
to this world.

64
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:26,482
-I understand.

65
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:28,282
Just like in the Alliance.

66
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,348
-Since we can't return
to the front lines,

67
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:36,315
we'll make this Earth into
our Utopia, a second Avalon.

68
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:38,682
Our ultimate objective
remains the same.

69
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:39,615
Don't waver now.

70
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:43,915

you have a guest.

That's fine.

What do you want?

00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:17,657
-They went through all
my packages, you know.

83
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:21,090
They're hassling everyone else,
but suddenly you're a VIP?

-Do you have any
idea what the devil's

105
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,390
wrong with these people?

106
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,557
-Huh?

107
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:28,790
-It's like the people of
this fleet are all ghosts.

108
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,790
-Their eyes are glazed over, and
they've got this weird stare.

109
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,490
It's creepy.

110
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,124
-Yeah, I've noticed.

111
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:36,424
-It's like a disease.

112
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:38,757
And before long, I'm sure
everyone from my fleet

113
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:40,924
will also be infected by it.

114
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:42,457
I'm starting to
wonder why we ever

115
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:44,824
left Gargantia in
the first place.

116
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:47,124
Are you OK with the way
things are turning out?

117
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,690
-Someone I know has plans
to start a rebellion.

118
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,390
-They do?

119

-Really?

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,824
-Remember the red Lobster
that came to pick me up?

pirate Lukkage?

-Great!

123
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:01,090
Let's work with
the lobster then.

124
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,424
What's the problem?

125

-She's counting on getting
help from the tin can.

126
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:07,990
But I don't think Ledo's
going to go for it.

127
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,257
-Mm.

128
00:05:09,357 --> 00:05:14,190

phenomenon called rain.

We have observed it before.

Those were people!

170
00:07:34,957 --> 00:07:38,857
-I can't-- I can't
believe what I just saw.

171
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:40,357
I didn't come here to see this.

172
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,457
-These guys are insane.

173
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:48,357
LUKKAGE: You're right.

174
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,724
They are, indeed.

175
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:52,224
And do you want to take a guess
where this insane fleet is

176
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,957
going to go next?

177
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,590
Gargantia.

178
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,131
-What?

179
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:04,424
Yeah, this ain't for me.

180
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:04,965
No way!

181
00:08:08,824 --> 00:08:11,957
-The reason I left Gargantia
was to protect everyone

182
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:18,890
from the Hideauze--
Amy, Bebel, all of them.

183
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,390
I just wanted to protect them.

184
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,357
But I--

185
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,057
[footsteps]

186
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:03,557
CHAMBER: Incoming message
from Commander Kugel.

187
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:05,090
It reads as follows.

188
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,290
"Ensign Ledo, Board your
machine Caliber and assume

189
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,090
battle command."

190
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,624
I await your decision, Ensign.

191
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:19,424
-My decision.

192
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:22,290
I make the decisions
and you carry them out.

193
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,157
That's how it's been.

194
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:31,424
But really, I don't
think I decided anything.

195
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,290
I never made a choice
in my whole life.

196
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:38,057
-The meaning of your
utterance is unclear.

197
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,357
Response to Commander's order--

198
00:09:39,457 --> 00:09:43,990
-Chamber, how do you
compare against Striker?

199
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,824
-Insufficient data
to answer that.

200
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:49,390
And I cannot comprehend the
logic behind your question.

201
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,624
[sighs heavily]

202
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,290
-What if I asked you
to take on Striker?

203
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:58,157
Can you?

204
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:01,424
-The current actions
of Striker X3752

205
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,290
would not be classified
as part of Alliance

206
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,857
military operations.

207
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:08,190
Therefore, it is possible to
authorize engagement in battle.

208
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,257
-I see.

209
00:10:09,357 --> 00:10:13,124
In that case, tell
me-- can I fight Kugel?

210
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,057
Chamber!

211
00:10:18,157 --> 00:10:21,024
-The answer to that question is
beyond my function as a Pilot

212
00:10:21,124 --> 00:10:23,290
Support Enlightenment
Interface System.

213
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,457
Combat policy formulation
is entirely in your hands.

214
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:29,190
Whether you can fight Commander
Kugel or not is up to you.

215
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,657
-Uh?

216
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,124
Huh?

217
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:36,665
-Hm.

218
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:59,257
-Melty, a radio warning
will just be intercepted.

219
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,657
The only way is to go over
and tell them directly.

220
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,057
Please, Melty, there's no time.

221
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:07,090
-But Ledo, I don't know if I
can do something so important.

222
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,224
LEDO: Yes you can.

223
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:10,557
You're the only one who
can fly to Gargantia.

224
00:11:10,657 --> 00:11:11,457
Melty.

225
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:12,524
Please, save everyone!

226
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,457
-OK.

227
00:11:16,557 --> 00:11:19,857
But you owe me.

228
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:20,398
Mm.

Ah, there it is, Gargan-- tia.

-Huh?

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,276
-So it was you, after all!

239
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,710
-Amy.

240
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,676
Amy!

241
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:51,076
Gargantia's gonna be attacked!

242
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:53,976
-Melty!

243
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,710
-She pushed herself
way too much.

244
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,443
She flew all the way here
by herself on a surf kite.

245
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,743
-Mm.

246

-S-- Saaya.

Amy.

250
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,743
RIDGET: To ensure the
safety of Gargantia,

251
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:15,210
we have no choice but
to do as Melty say.

252
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,410
We must change
course and evacuate.

253
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,543
From where things stand now,
I think that we should all--

254
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:22,976
AMY: Wait!

255
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,043

--[panting] Melty told
me something else.

257
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,276
She said that Ledo's going
to fight so that we might all

258
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,043
be able to escape.

259
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:33,410
-[gasp]

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,376
-What did you say?

261
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:36,676
-I said Ledo's going
to fight for us,

262
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,476
and he's doing it all alone.

263
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:40,910
He's even going to turn
against one of his own,

264
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,876
just to give us a chance.

265
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:45,776
And we're just gonna let
him while we run away?

266
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:49,710
Are you really OK with that?

267
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,476
-It's just--

268
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,943
DR. OLDHAM: If that's what
Ledo has chosen to do,

269
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:02,310
then we have to make
a choice, as well.

270
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,576
-What do you mean, Doctor?

271
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:08,943

time has come to use that key.

As Gargantia's resident
sage, it is my responsibility

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,910
to offer counsel to
the fleet commander.

279
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,176
The time has come.

280
00:14:27,276 --> 00:14:30,376
Amy, I will require
your assistance.

281

-Uh?

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:31,851
Mm.

shall be made aware of my grand
design and the great power

of Almighty God.

I declare this the beginning
of a new holy crusade.

287
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:47,043
We will bring absolute
order to this planet.

288
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:51,243
We will create a peaceful
and glorious Utopia here.

289
00:14:51,343 --> 00:14:53,610
We will reshape this
world for the better,

290
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,243
and we will be victorious.

291

Follow me, my fellow citizens,
on the only path that

will lead to eternal
happiness and salvation.

[squeaking]

Ensign Ledo, what kind
of madness is this?

-You're the one
that's mad, Kugel.

-Is that any way for a soldier
of the Alliance to talk?

-This is Earth.

302
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,543
It's not the Galactic Alliance.

303
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,810
-The human race
resides on this planet.

304
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,276
That means the responsibility
for their fate is in our hands.

You have no right to destroy it.

remains the same.

-Ready?

335
00:17:31,276 --> 00:17:32,110
Here's two.

336
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:32,651
-Hm!

337
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:38,517
-Go!

338
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:39,476
Kill him!

-Attention all citizens
not involved in the fight.

344
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,243
Take shelter behind
the bulkheads.

345
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,643
Prepare the lifeboats.

346
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:57,543
This ship is the
flagship of our fleet.

347
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,876
It will likely be
their primary target.

348
00:17:59,976 --> 00:18:01,410
-How dare they?

349
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,743
No one stands against us.

350
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:04,243
Insurrection will
not be tolerated!

351

[gasp] It's her!

-Sorry.

354
00:18:34,776 --> 00:18:36,476
This is not going
to be ladylike!

[screaming]

356
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,743
You're more of a
man than I thought.

357
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:01,810
You do have balls.

358
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,176
-Oh, knock it off!

359
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:05,310
Just take out those
guys and get over here!

00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:05,910

00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,743
Suggestion-- employ
hit-and-run tactics.

364
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:36,510
Concentrate your attacks on the
enemy Machine Caliber's head.

maneuverability is superior.

(ON COMM): The weak

serve and support the strong,
and the strong, in turn,

371
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,043
protect the weak.

372
00:19:53,143 --> 00:19:55,376
This rationale is
what makes humans.

Am I wrong?

how would you like to

-I've reached his cockpit.

Input emergency release code.

It won't be so hard,
