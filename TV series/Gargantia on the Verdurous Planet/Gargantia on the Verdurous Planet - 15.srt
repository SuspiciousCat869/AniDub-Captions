We can't afford to bring
the Hideauze back with us

and join the others.

slow them down.

-Commander Kugel, that
violates military regulations.

-You're still a young man.

9

You have more time to
kill enemies than me.

10

This is my decision
as a soldier.

Should I enter the

27

in the solar system.

please send me your strength.

31

-She's pretty agile for such a
weakling, I'll give her that.

32
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:37,713
-Maybe she got her
stubbornness from father.

33
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,094
-A surprise attack?

34

agree to obey us,

we promise that we'll
forgive you little sister.

do something so foolish?

his youngest daughter.

She doesn't even worship to
Sea God like a normal pirate.

Linaria, it doesn't look
like the god of the sky

42
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:05,774
is going to swoop
down and save you.

43
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,147
-Yes, he will.

44

45
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,563
Hear my prayer.

47
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:33,235
-Is that really an
angel from the heavens?

48
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:34,572
It can't be.

49

-Did Linaria summon it?

50
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:39,883
-Shoot it out of the sky.

-Onderia, wait.

52
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:42,956
-Maybe we should
retreat for now.

53
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,095
-The sky god is
just a superstition.

54
00:03:45,195 --> 00:03:47,533
Now shoot Linaria and
that thing along with her.

suppress their attack,

minimum of force.

counterattack is complete.

-They were so fragile.

68
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:42,020
STRIKER: Correct but
there were no fatalities.

69

00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:42,883
because you had a dispute
with your older half-sisters.

113
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,721
To avoid fighting
with them, you're

having me pretend to
be god's emissary.

In exchange, you said
you would provide me

I swear.

don't mean steal it, do you?

-Yes, we steal.

-Sister, should we be doing
this directly below the fleet.

-There's nothing to worry about.

149

It'll be all right.

recognized as Hideauze.

165
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:34,528
-Now that we have found the
enemy, let's destroy it.

166
00:10:34,628 --> 00:10:35,162
STRIKER: Roger.

167
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,378
-What is this?

168
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:45,452
Are these things
really Hideauze?

169
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:46,855
They're too weak.

170
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:52,700
Are you injured?

171
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:04,460
-We are sorry.

172
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,700
We shall worship you from now
on oh mighty emissary of the sky

173
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,243
god.

174
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,117
-Did these people worship
the Hideauze as gods?

175
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:18,224
Did the humans who were
left behind on Earth

176
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:19,794
lose their dignity?

177
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:21,664
How could this happen?

178
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:29,181
All right, then, fine.

179
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,618
I will be their leader.

180
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:46,686
-Great Striker's search
capability's truly amazing.

181
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,958
It's incredible how
she can locate relics

182
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:52,031
with such precision, even
in these deep waters.

183
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:54,270
-Mistress Linaria.

184
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,138
-Yes?

185
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:57,377
-A new fleet has
been discovered.

186
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:59,682
Let's absorb it
into the main fleet.

187
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:02,789
-Yes, sir, understood.

188
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,728
The emissary has issued
a divine proclamation.

189
00:12:13,177 --> 00:12:14,214
STRIKER: Recommendation.

190
00:12:14,314 --> 00:12:16,552
Owing to the acquisition
of individuals

191
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,628
with some expertise, the fleet's
total productivity has gone up.

192
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,500
However, at the same time, the
suffering of common residents

193
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,003
has increased as well.

194
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:27,342
Patients infected with
communicable diseases

195
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:28,645
are on the rise.

196
00:12:28,746 --> 00:12:30,950
-Endemic diseases were
an unforeseen problem.

197
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,253
We're dealing with it.

198
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:36,563
STRIKER: 76% of the infected
have a weak constitution.

199
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,132
-What are you saying?

200
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:39,569
STRIKER: In the
Galactic Alliance,

201
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,576
it is a fundamental rule to
dispose of personnel who's

202
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:46,952
physical condition is
below a specified value.

203
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:48,990
-The Alliance, huh?

204
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,025
But this is Earth.

205
00:12:50,126 --> 00:12:51,862
Those people are
part of this fleet.

206
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:53,466
We're here to help them.

207
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,337
STRIKER: In order to
maintain the collective,

208
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:59,479
efficiency must be
the highest priority.

209
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,217
-Circumstances are
different here.

210
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:02,987
The Alliance's
rules don't apply.

211
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:04,891
They are meaningless.

212
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,363
If your observational
data is correct,

213
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:11,272
we will never be able to return
to Galactic Alliance territory.

214
00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:14,579
And since we can't communicate
with the main force,

215
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,383
I have the right to
command as the highest

216
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:18,922
ranking officer on site.

217
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:23,532
I am going to lead the humans
of this planet as I see fit.

218
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:27,942
You will not argue with me.

219
00:13:28,042 --> 00:13:29,679
[coughing]

220
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,222
Linaria.

221
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:36,828
Linaria.

222
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:38,399
Are you all right?

223
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,819
-Emissary Kugel.

224
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,591
-You just need to rest.

225
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:53,164
-Emissary Kugel,
may I ask a favor?

226
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:53,966
-Anything.

227
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,104
-Please.

228
00:13:56,204 --> 00:14:02,184
Will you please help me to die?

229
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:03,988
I am sick.

230
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:08,330
And I will never be able to
rise from this bed again.

231
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,834
So please.

232
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:12,840
-Don't be ridiculous.

233
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:16,548
-Thanks to you, this fleet
was able to prosper again

234
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,289
as it did in the days of old.

235
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,529
I am a Priestess.

236
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,638
I have a role to play and
duty to my people as well.

237
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:28,542
-Leave all of that
to me for now.

238
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:31,682
-You're the emissary
from the god of the sky.

239
00:14:31,782 --> 00:14:35,056
You should be a presence feared
and worshipped from afar.

240
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:37,762
It's my role to announce
your divine proclamations

241
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:39,666
and see that
they're carried out.

242
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:43,475
But now, I'm too weak, and
I can't perform my duties

243
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:44,945
any longer.

244
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:46,982
-So you cannot be the
Priestess anymore.

245
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,653
Why does that mean
you have to die?

246
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,924
-It is for the greater
good of the fleet

247
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,795
and for everyone's happiness.

248
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:55,167
-What do you mean?

249
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:58,274
-I have devoted my entire
life to this fleet,

250
00:14:58,374 --> 00:15:02,416
and to you, emissary Kugel.

251
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:06,626
Now that I am incapacitated
with sickness, all I can do,

252
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:09,966
my last act as a Priestess to
prevent discord and confusion,

253
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:16,146
is to pass from this world
as quickly as possible.

254
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,186
The fleet will continue
to prosper once I am gone.

255
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:20,757
-What do you mean?

256
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:24,665
You deserve to be happy, too.

257
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:26,737
-But you see, I am happy.

258
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:29,175
I'm happy I was
able to meet you,

259
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,014
and to have finally
had a purpose.

260
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,852
-I am indebted to you.

261
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:37,794
I am alive today
because of you, Linaria.

262
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:38,729
-I'm honored.

263
00:15:42,104 --> 00:15:43,073
Emissary Kugel?

264
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,642
-What is it?

265
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:45,879
-Can you help?

266
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,851
I want to go look at
the fleet one last time.

267
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:55,199
-We're here.

268
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:01,346
Can you see it?

269
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:08,235
-Yes.

270
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:14,115
Beautiful.

271
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:19,594
-Linaria.

272
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:28,706
Striker, is her
heart still beating?

273
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,276
STRIKER: She has no pulse.

274
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:31,044
-Defibrillate her.

275
00:16:35,053 --> 00:16:36,323
STRIKER: No response.

276
00:16:36,423 --> 00:16:37,558
-Then do it again.

277
00:16:37,659 --> 00:16:39,797
STRIKER: Chance of
survival unlikely.

278
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:40,966
-Damn.

279
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:41,508
Why?

280
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:51,423
I've led all these people.

281
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:54,830
I've been worshipped as
an emissary from god.

282
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,502
But I can't even save one girl?

283
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,406
STRIKER: Even on this
planet, your duties

284
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,812
as a commander require
you to continue--

285
00:17:01,912 --> 00:17:02,547
-Enough.

286
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:03,616
You don't understand.

287
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:09,362
-I am a Priestess.

288
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,899
I have a role to play.

289
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,237
And a duty to my people as well.

290
00:17:13,337 --> 00:17:14,574
-Striker.

291
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:17,914
Now that I am incapacitated
with sickness, all I can do,

292
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:21,021
my last act as a Priestess
to prevent confusion,

293
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:24,128
is to pass from this world
as quickly as possible.

294
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,834
The fleet will continue
to prosper once I am gone.

295
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,978
STRIKER: Lainaria's words on
the happiness and betterment

296
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:35,820
of the human race do not diverge
from the guidelines established

297
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,725
by the Galactic Alliance.

298
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:38,693
Conclusion.

299
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:40,363
Whether in space
or on Earth, what

300
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:43,337
is best for the happiness and
prosperity of the human race

301
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,174
remains the same.

302
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,945
-I have devoted my
life to this fleet,

303
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,216
and to you, Emissary Kugel.

304
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:51,721
I am happy.

305
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:52,590
-Stop it.

306
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,068
-Emissary Kugel.

307
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:14,872
-What do you want?

308
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,545
-My little sister is dead.

309
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:21,687
She died a most honorable
death for a Priestess.

310
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:23,157
-What do you really want?

311
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:26,465
-My sister selflessly
laid down her life

312
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,572
for you and for
everyone in this fleet.

313
00:18:29,672 --> 00:18:33,413
I wish to follow in
my sister's footsteps.

314
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:37,155
It would be a great honor to
give my life for the emissary.

315
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:38,892
And for the people
of this fleet,

316
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,032
I wish only to serve you.

317
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:42,633
-All right.

318
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:44,036
You have a point.

319
00:18:44,137 --> 00:18:46,776
The fleet does certainly
need a new Priestess.

320
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,847
I leave it to you.

321
00:18:48,947 --> 00:18:50,184
-Thank you, Emissary.

322
00:18:56,698 --> 00:18:58,335
-You can die as a Priestess.

323
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:11,296
I have disposed of an agitator.

324
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:14,771
Tolerating weakness and descent
will not help these people.

325
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:16,408
I must take drastic measures.

326
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,621
I am the emissary of god.

327
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:25,728
I, and I alone, shall
bring peace and prosperity

328
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:26,697
to this fleet.

329
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:31,407
-Priestess Linaria.

330
00:19:31,508 --> 00:19:32,844
-It's the Priestess.

331
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:36,486
For the happiness of everyone
in this fleet, I must act.

332
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:39,826
It is my duty as the
Priestess to fulfill my role

333
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:42,331
and do what is best.

334
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:42,900
-Linaria.

335
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,303
What's going on?

336
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:47,075
-Now that I have been
incapacitated with sickness,

337
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,180
the only thing I
can do, my last act

338
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,652
as Priestess for this
fleet and its people,

339
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:54,591
is to pass from this world
as quickly as possible.

340
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:59,035
The fleet will prosper
because of my sacrifice.

341
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:03,578
I'm honored to finally
have a purpose.

342
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:04,748
And I'm very happy.

343
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,293
-Priestess.

344
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:27,798
-Priestess Linaria.

345
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,437
-My little sister is dead.

346
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:34,513
Her death was an honorable
one as a Priestess' should be.

347
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:37,385
I, too, was to follow
in her footsteps.

348
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,422
-She's not--

349
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:39,825
-Big Sister.

350
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:42,396
-It would be an
honor to give my life

351
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:46,606
for the sake of this fleet,
and for the sake of its people.

352
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:47,148
-Stop!

353
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:47,649
Don't!

354
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:48,150
-No.

355
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,641
-It is the duty of all
citizens to serve me.

356
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,547
To be useful is
the greatest honor.

357
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,454
The weak will become
strong, and the strong

358
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:11,961
will become even stronger.

359
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:16,138
These two Priestesses gave their
lives and souls for this fleet.

360
00:21:16,238 --> 00:21:18,376
Their sacrifice
will not be in vain.

361
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:22,819
I promise you, this fleet will
have peace and prosperity.

362
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,460
Even the weak, shall be of
use and be happy as they, too,

363
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,730
will sacrifice themselves.

364
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:35,380
-Emissary, please pass all your
teachings on to me as well.

365
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,451
-Please allow us to serve you.

366
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:40,759
Let us take the place of our
eldest and youngest sisters.

367
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:41,794
-Very well.

368
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:44,433
I expect you to work
hard to serve me.

369
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:57,214
That's right.

370
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:02,205
I will lead the humans on this
planet to peace and prosperity.

371
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:05,772
That's my new mission as
commander of this planet.

372
00:22:05,872 --> 00:22:08,405
No, that is my mission as god.

373
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:17,172
Isn't that right, Striker?

374
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:21,372
