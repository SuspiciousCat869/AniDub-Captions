1
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,129
-Bellows.

2
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:16,063
I have a delivery for you.

3
00:00:16,163 --> 00:00:17,463
-OK, thanks.

4
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:18,296
Good work, Amy.

5
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,229
-Thank you.

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:22,363
-You seem a bit cheerier.

7
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,296
-Well, I can't go on
being sad forever.

8
00:00:25,396 --> 00:00:26,763
It looks like Flange
and the others

9
00:00:26,863 --> 00:00:28,863
are staying in the Sea of Mist.

10
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,963
The Milky Way curves
that direction.

11
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,229
Our current course will
take us right by them.

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,096
Maybe we can check up on them.

13
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:38,396
-I just hope that Pinion hasn't
made a complete mess of things.

14
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,463
-As long as everyone's
safe, nothing else matters.

15
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:41,004
Bye.

16
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,263
-Hey, what is that?

17
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:55,229
-Hmm?

18
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,696
-That's huge.

19
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:58,696
Don't tell me they're pirates.

20
00:00:58,796 --> 00:01:01,063
-Fleet Commander,
sound the alarm.

21
00:01:01,163 --> 00:01:04,096
I want all ships in the
fleet to be on highest alert.

22
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,063
-Let's err on the
side of caution.

23
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:10,229
Order Pinion to--
No, I'll do it.

24
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,463
-Ledo.

25
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:17,829
-Commander Kugel.

26
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:20,463
Commander, is that really you?

27
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:21,829
-Long time, no see.

28
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:25,596
But I'm glad you're
alive and well.

29
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:27,996
-You, too, Commander.

30
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:31,029
I picked up the distress signal
your Machine Caliber sent out,

31
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,129
but I was on the other
side of the planet

32
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,729
and unable to get to you.

33
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,863
-You should have sent a signal.

34
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,229
I would have come
to you, Commander.

35
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:41,829
-It was necessary to
maintain radio silence.

36
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:44,196
Can you come here
and join me, Ensign?

37
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:44,863
-Yes.

38
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:46,296
I mean, yes, sir.

39
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,996
Ensign Ledo ready
to rejoin command.

40
00:01:49,096 --> 00:01:51,529
-What is that?

41
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,829
-I've never seen
pilots that big.

42
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,096
-This is bad, very bad.

43
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:58,329
-Maybe we'd be better
off running away.

44
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:59,896
-You want us to runaway?

45
00:01:59,996 --> 00:02:00,863
Run where?

46
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:02,063
Don't worry, OK?

47
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,396
We've got the cannon, plus
the tin can's with us.

48
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:08,329
Let's fire a shot off the
port bow to say hello.

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,196
-Uh.

50
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:10,737
-Aye.

51
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:17,696
-Television angle six.

52
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:20,829
-Ready to fire on command.

53
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,163
-Fire!

54
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:22,704
-Firing!

55
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:31,929
-Heh, heh.

56
00:02:32,029 --> 00:02:33,329
Take that.

57
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:33,870
Hmm?

58
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,263
What the--

59
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:52,629
-What was that?

60
00:02:52,729 --> 00:02:54,363
-That looked like
a lightning bolt.

61
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,996
-What the hell do you think
you're doing to my treasure?

62
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,029
What's that?

63
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,263
A tin can?

64
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:04,463
No, it's different.

65
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,929
Hey, Ledo.

66
00:03:06,029 --> 00:03:07,296
Ledo, where are you?

67
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,163
-This is Ensign Ledo.

68
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:11,363
I'm returning to active duty
at the Galactic Alliance

69
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,929
Army of Humankind.

70
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,029
-What?

71
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:15,996
Ledo, what the hell
are you talking about?

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,063
Ledo, take 10.

73
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:33,496
[MUSIC - "THIS WORLD HAS
BEEN WAITING FOR US," MINORI CHIHARA]

74
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,253
-Guide signal received.

75
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,420
Preparing to land.

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,953
-What are they doing?

77
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:13,887
-Unknown.

78
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:15,120
Hypothesis.

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,953
Collective action indicates
military proficiency.

80
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:20,287
You mean these people are
living under military command?

81
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:32,120
-Welcome, envoy from the sky.

82

Giant Clad and Lightning.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,887
We are humbled to
be in your presence.

84
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:39,887
In the name of Providence, we
wish you peace and prosperity.

85
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,720
-What is she talking about?

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,953
-Speculation.

87
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:44,553
She is using an
idiomatic expression

88
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:47,420
to refer to a Machine
Caliber and pilot.

89
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,020
-Where is Commander Kugel?

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,953
Take me to him.

91
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:50,687
-This way, please.

92
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,920
Please enter.

93
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:27,253
The Commander will be
with you in a moment.

94
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:40,653
-Apologies for the holograph.

95
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,287
-Commander Kugel.

96
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:46,053
I never imagined I'd see you
again, alive and well, no less.

97
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:49,153
-I may be alive, but
I have not been well.

98
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:52,987
I have a disease and must
remain in my sterile cockpit.

99
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:54,020
How is your health?

100
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,253
-I haven't been ill.

101
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:56,920
-I see.

102
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
You're lucky.

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,853
Issuing orders from
here hasn't been easy.

104
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,853
-I can imagine.

105
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:04,120
-It won't be so hard
now that you're here.

106
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,720
Are you willing to
follow my command again?

107
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,353
-Of course, I'll follow
you Commander Chamber

108
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:15,987
K6821 to Striker
X3752, please respond.

109
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:19,487
Request for all information
on Commander Kugel's disease.

110
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:25,887
Striker X3752 to Chamber
K6821, request granted.

111
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:31,387
Transmitting information
on specified disease now.

112
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:33,453
-Wow, it looks like
we're surrounded.

113
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,653
This doesn't look too good.

114
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:36,087
-We've got the treasure.

115
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:37,153
We'll be fine.

116
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:38,620
-You sure about that?

117
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,753
-Don't panic.

118
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:41,887
If things get bad, we've
still got the tin can.

119
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:44,353
-Didn't it leave a
little while ago?

120
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:45,220
-Uh.

121
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,587
-We're screwed.

122
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,153
-OK, calm down.

123
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,453
They might not want to kill us.

124
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:50,853
We don't even know
what they want.

125
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,553
-They want all the treasure
we brought up you big moron.

126
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,187
-How would they know about it?

127
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:58,620
-Because you broadcast it.

128
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,887
Any bright ideas?

129
00:07:59,987 --> 00:08:02,920
-Well, I, uh--

130
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,253
-Why are you standing around?

131
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,453
-Stay out of this old man.

132
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:07,953
-Look around at what's going on.

133
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,653
Everyone returned your
posts immediately.

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,487
-Thanks for bailing me out.

135
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:20,353
I heard the owner of that weapon
is Ledo's friend another space

136
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:21,653
man who fell to Earth.

137
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:22,953
-Yeah.

138
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:24,853
-Apparently this planet has
had more than one visitor

139
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:26,320
from the sky.

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,387
The question is now
that he, too, is here,

141
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:33,653
what does this person
intend to do with us?

142
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:35,453
-Urgent delivery.

143
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:37,520
We just received a message
addressed to the fleet.

144
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,220
-Flange, here.

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,253
Go ahead.

146
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:43,553
MESSENGER ON RADIO:
They're demanding

147
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,420
to see a representative
from our fleet.

148
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,687
-What do they want?

149
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:49,387
MESSENGER ON RADIO:
They didn't say.

150
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,853
-They must want the relics.

151
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,087
I'll go.

152
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,053
-Hold on a second.

153
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:54,953
I'm the reason
that they're here.

154
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:56,353
I should talk to them.

155
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,620
-Don't be ridiculous.

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,987
You're not qualified to conduct
diplomatic negotiations.

157
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,820
MESSENGER ON RADIO:
Well, actually,

158
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,120
they specifically requested
that Pinion of the Sea of Mist

159
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,320
be the representative.

160
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:08,987
-See?

161
00:09:09,087 --> 00:09:10,520
My time to shine.

162
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,787
-Don't be stupid.

163
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:15,253
But Flange, if you become
their hostage, then

164
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,720
who's going to keep
the fleet together?

165
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,687
-Good point.

166
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:19,720
Still--

167
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,353
-Don't worry about me.

168
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:23,553
No one's going to want
to follow me after this.

169
00:09:23,653 --> 00:09:25,387
Besides, I got us
into this mess.

170
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:26,920
I should be the
one to get us out.

171
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,920
If I can't, I'm just
getting what I deserve.

172
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,287
-Very well.

173
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,620
Just be careful at every step.

174
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
-Sure thing.

175
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,320
Well, I guess I'm off then.

176
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:45,928
-Pinion.

177
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:46,443
-Huh?

178
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:46,987
Melty?

179
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,087
-They said to wait.

180
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,453
They're going to send
a boat over for you.

181
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:52,020
-Oh, really?

182
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,387
-I got us into this mess.

183
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:55,687
No one's going to want
to follow me anymore.

184
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:56,453
-Oh, shut up.

185
00:09:56,553 --> 00:09:57,453
-You're wrong, you know.

186
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,153
People won't give up on you.

187
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,553
-Oh, yeah?

188
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,820
-You've always been
a screw-up, Pinion,

189
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,153
but everyone knows that.

190
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,153
They're not going
to count you out.

191
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,187
-Thanks for the pep talk.

192
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,153
-Oh, look.

193
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:12,928
What?

194
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,287
No way.

195
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:15,653
-It couldn't be.

196
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:17,053
The Surfing Monster.

197
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,987
-I'm here to escort
Pinion of the Sea Mist.

198
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,987
That's you, isn't it?

199
00:10:34,087 --> 00:10:36,087
-Yeah, and I gotta tell you.

200
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:39,453
I never thought I'd get to meet
the great pirate Lukkage here.

201
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:40,653
-Don't be so formal.

202
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:42,720
Just call me Lukkage.

203
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,887
However--

204
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:45,220
-Huh?

205
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,020
-For now, I'd watch my tongue
if I were you, understand?

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,561
-OK.

207
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,687
Huh?

208
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,253
Everybody looks depressed.

209
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:10,920
Aren't they getting
enough to eat around here?

210
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,453
-The weak exist to
serve the strong.

211
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:17,053
That is divine Providence
apparently, or so I'm told.

212
00:11:19,953 --> 00:11:23,787
-So is that their
god over there?

213
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:25,353
-That is a lightning giant.

214
00:11:25,453 --> 00:11:30,187
Supposedly they're divine envoys
that deliver holy judgment.

215
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:31,753
-Even as the humans
of this planet

216
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,220
are blessed was an environment
of non-extreme temperatures

217
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,087
and breathable air, they
are overrun with Hideauze.

218
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:40,120
It is, therefore, our duty
to teach these humans how

219
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,687
to fight, and enlighten
them as to the dignity

220
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:44,453
of the human race.

221
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:47,287
-Well, about that, Commander.

222
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:54,220
The Hideauze, Commander,
they are human.

223
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,820
-You mean were human.

224
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,120
-Huh?

225
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,387
Commander Kugel, you
knew the truth all along?

226
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,853
Amongst the command higher-ups,
it was tacitly understood.

227
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:05,720
But for front line
soldiers in the field,

228
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,087
the information was
deemed unnecessary.

229
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,920
-Unnecessary?

230
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,153
The Hideauze lived by
instinct and reproduced

231
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,720
however they desired.

232
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,587
They are not human beings.

233
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:17,820
-Yes, sir.

234
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,687
-The weak serve and
support the strong.

235
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:22,720
And the strong, in
turn, protect the weak.

236
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,920
Both groups know their
roles in society.

237
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,687
They understand their place.

238
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,853
This rationale is
what makes us humans.

239
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:31,720
-That may be true, sir, but--

240
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,953
-Since my arrival, I've
brought order to this fleet.

241
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:37,420
As a result of the
system I put in place,

242
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,820
there's been a
marked improvement

243
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,887
in the level of citizens'
happiness across the board.

244
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,287
-Request.

245
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,820
Please clarify the definition
of happiness in this context.

246
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,553
According to Galactic
Alliance, philosophy,

247
00:12:48,653 --> 00:12:51,120
happiness is the
realization of circumstance

248
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,653
in which individuals
service to the entire group

249
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:56,953
makes the cost benefit
ratio most efficient.

250
00:12:57,053 --> 00:12:59,553
Therefore, happiness is
commensurate with the degree

251
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,353
of command stability.

252
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,687
Definition and
conclusion are valid.

253
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:07,820
-Is that true?

254
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
-Now, Ledo, how would you like
to help me change this world?

255
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,591
-Sit over there.

256
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:32,491
Ah, but nobody's here.

257
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:38,799
Hmm?

258
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:44,958
What the hell is it?

259
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:03,858
Huh, this thing is cool.

260
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,491
This goes like this.

261
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:09,025
And that one here.

262
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,058
And voila.

263
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,125
-Greetings, Pinion
of the Sea of Mist.

264
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:15,058
I bid you welcome as a
most distinguished guest.

265
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:15,758
-What the hell?

266
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:17,191
A com device.

267
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,225
The humans remaining
on Earth require

268
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,425
improvement in
technical proficiency.

269
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,891
This was a test to measure
your mechanical engineering

270
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,258
capabilities and
problem solving skills.

271
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:28,191
Conclusion.

272
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,625
You are proficient
in these areas.

273
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:33,291
-I've heard that fancy
pants way of talking before.

274
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:35,991
You wouldn't, by chance, be
a relative of the tin can?

275
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:43,758
I am a pilot support
enlightenment interface system.

276
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:46,691
Striker X3752.

277
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,325
-And what does the
all powerful Striker

278
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,958
want with someone like me?

279
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,025
-Your ability to
repair weapons that

280
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,425
have been recovered from the
ocean floor is most admirable.

281
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,791
However you only
restore basic functions

282
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:00,858
due to insufficient knowledge
of operating principles.

283
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,791
-Hey, my fault,
like I'm supposed

284
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:05,491
to know how machines were
put together way back when?

285
00:15:05,591 --> 00:15:07,725
-I can provide you with
information regarding

286
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:11,625
construction of these ancient
devices, including schematics.

287
00:15:11,725 --> 00:15:12,758
-No way.

288
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,525
With your aptitude, you
need not limit yourself

289
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,858
to repairing weapons.

290
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,625
You will be capable of designing
and producing new weapons

291
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,291
as well.

292
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:22,758
You're giving me
way too much credit.

293
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,391
-Incorrect self-assessment.

294
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,691
You are capable
of such learning.

295
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:30,091
It is my request that you become
an engineering officer, Pinion

296
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,725
of the Sea of Mist.

297
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:33,825
-An officer?

298
00:15:33,925 --> 00:15:35,725
I ain't no soldier boy.

299
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:36,825
Wait a sec.

300
00:15:36,925 --> 00:15:37,658
What about my fleet?

301
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:39,625
Can you guarantee its safety?

302
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:42,125
Your fleet's humans
are a valid resource.

303
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,625
Rest assured they
will not be wasted.

304
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,625
-Not wasted?

305
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:47,925
Never mind.

306
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,125
Promise everyone stays safe
and I'll do what you want.

307
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:51,891
-I have high hopes
for your development.

308
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:56,232
-Huh?

309
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,258
Whoa.

310
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:08,058
Hmm?

311
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:11,358
-If you would before you die.

312
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,758
Do as you're told, and
it will go quickly.

313
00:16:13,858 --> 00:16:16,025
-Fine, but do you have to
act so stuck up about it?

314
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,058
Hey.

315
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:18,891
-If you desire to
be finished quickly,

316
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,058
I suggest you hold still.

317
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:25,325
-Friends, this is Pinion
of the Sea of Mist.

318
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:27,191
Commitment and cooperation
are at the heart

319
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,325
of what makes
human beings human.

320
00:16:29,425 --> 00:16:32,191
By joining the Flange and
Kugel fleets together,

321
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,991
you have the chance to attain
peace and greater prosperity

322
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,958
for all citizens.

323
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:38,758
This is the wisest
course of action

324
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:40,858
for all humans concerned.

325
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,491
It is what it says.

326
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,858
-It's a polite demand
for our surrender.

327
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,858
-Fleet Commander.

328
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,658
-I know.

329
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:48,558
We must surrender.

330
00:16:48,658 --> 00:16:49,425
There's no choice.

331
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,391
-Am I addressing Fleet
Commander Flange?

332
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,258
-Indeed, you are.

333
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,791
-We respect you for this
choice, Fleet Commander.

334
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:19,125
It was wise.

335
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,391
-I would like to believe
it was the right one.

336
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,458
What do you intend
to do with all of us?

337
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:24,491
-I can guess.

338
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,158
These guys want to
split up our fleet.

339
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:27,691
-Is that true?

340
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,025
-Each of your ships will
be requisitioned separately

341
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,458
according to its use.

342
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,525
-I'm afraid that
will be a problem.

343
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,291
This fleet is like a family.

344
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,991
It won't work unless
we are all together.

345
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:40,458
-From this day forward,
you will all be of service

346
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:43,025
and work together in
an even bigger family.

347
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,425
-But we--

348
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:48,191
-Those who comply with the
divine shall be blessed.

349
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,258
However, those who
go against that will

350
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:52,325
shall be crushed by
the hammer of god.

351
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:58,258
-Understood.

352
00:17:58,358 --> 00:17:59,991
-Kneel then, Fleet
Commander, so that you

353
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:01,158
may receive the benediction.

354
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:07,258
I declare the a servant of
Kugel in the blessed name

355
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:08,691
of divine Providence.

356
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,358
You shall henceforth devote
yourself body and soul

357
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:15,358
to the furtherance
of the great cause.

358
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,925
-This place is totally different
from what I saw before.

359
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:20,958
The guys who live here must
be making the big bucks.

360
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,358
-This fleet has no
form of currency.

361
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,025
-No money?

362
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,291
How does that work?

363
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:27,758
-The fleet issues appropriate
rations in accordance

364
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:29,491
with the duties one performs.

365
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:32,191
It's an extremely fair
way of doing things.

366
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,691
-Oh, it's fair, huh?

367
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,791
-This is your residential area.

368
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,625
I'll show you to
your side quarters.

369
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:44,932
-Huh?

370
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:51,625
What's with them?

371
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:52,725
Where's my crew?

372
00:18:52,825 --> 00:18:54,491
-Right about now, each
part of your fleet

373
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,758
should be getting
requisitioned and reassigned.

374
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,025
-Each part?

375
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,091
-Yes.

376
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:00,691
You didn't really
think this fleet would

377
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,525
allow the consolidation of the
potential insurgency, did you?

378
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:04,925
-Why'd you bring
us in if you were

379
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:08,058
worried about
rebellion breaking out?

380
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:09,425
-Take my advice.

381
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,625
You're better off not having
any contact with your friends

382
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:12,525
right now.

383
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,358
Trust me.

384
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:16,791
-Fine then.

385
00:19:26,725 --> 00:19:29,225
-Virus data analysis complete.

386
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:31,758
Running physical evaluation
on Ensign Ledo now.

387
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,325
Evaluation complete.

388
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:40,025
No abnormalities detected.

389
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,658
-All this time, the Commander's
been leading this huge fleet

390
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:45,758
while confined to
such a crap space.

391
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:47,825
I couldn't do that.

392
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,025
-Hypothesis.

393
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,258
Commander Kugel has
withdrawn into his cockpit

394
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,725
because he wishes to
exist as a symbol.

395
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,591
He desires to instill both
awe and fear in all those

396
00:19:56,691 --> 00:19:57,658
around him.

397
00:19:57,758 --> 00:19:58,725
Speculation.

398
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:00,658
Stronger and more
overarching leadership

399
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:02,825
is possible because
of this tactic.

400
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:06,391
-So it's scarier if he
can't be seen, right?

401
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,825
Still, is it a good idea
to rule through terror

402
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:10,425
and superstition?

403
00:20:10,525 --> 00:20:12,825
-Coping with fear is one of
the fundamental behaviors

404
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,091
of all living things.

405
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:17,058
A show of strength
can cause one's enemy

406
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:19,325
to be afraid while
at the same time

407
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,891
inspire feelings of safety
and obedience in those one

408
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:22,658
is protecting.

409
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:25,791
- I suppose that's true.

410
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,958
-Conclusion.

411
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,825
As a countermeasure
against a powerful enemy,

412
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:31,191
such as the Hideauze,
a display of force

413
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,291
is a valid means to
optimize leadership.

414
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,758
It mobilizes
individuals collectively

415
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,191
and is connected
to the maintenance

416
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,858
of a high degree of
community functionality.

417
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:41,591
In addition--

418
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:44,225
-I've heard enough.

419
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:49,258
Maybe I-- maybe I shouldn't
have left this cockpit either.

420
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:03,291
-Welcome back, Mistress,
I hope all went well.

421
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:04,258
Thanks for your effort.

422
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:07,458
Mean It's good to be home.

423
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,858
-I was wondering what the
man called, Pinion, was like.

424
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:11,891
-He knows his way around.

425
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:13,358
-Oh.

426
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,258
-Will you get rid of him then?

427
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,525
-It's still early for that.

428
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,558
In his own way, he
does seem capable.

429
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:23,858
But honestly, I'm getting
bored with all this free time

430
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:24,399
on my hands.

431
00:21:28,825 --> 00:21:30,091
-Awakening process complete.

432
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,225
Incoming communication
from Commander Kugel.

433
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:42,425
-How are you feeling?

434
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:43,825
-I am well.

435
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:46,758
-I require your assistance
for an urgent matter.

436
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:48,325
-Is it the Hideauze?

437
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:49,558
-No.

438
00:21:49,658 --> 00:21:51,791
It is a new awareness
program for the inhabitants

439
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:52,958
of this planet.

440
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:54,758
-I am at your command, sir.

441
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:56,091
-I like that answer.

442
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,658
With your arrival, we now
have two Machine Calibers

443
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,058
at our disposal.

444
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:02,691
So I'd like to use this chance
to carry out a major awareness

445
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,591
strategy I've had in mind.

446
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,491
This is the target.

447
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:08,825
-Ah.

448
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:19,125
That's-- that's Gargantia.

449
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:29,791
