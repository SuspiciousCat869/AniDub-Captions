To beat the dark monsters,

Yes. Ryukenden will ensure it.

That base Legend of a Villain

will never be allowed to darken
the doors of the BooDooKan.

The song played by the Holy Ark

of this dark sun god will become
an equally holy thunderbolt

to brainwash you.

wasn't enough?

Slimy? No need to flatter me.

care of my precious guitar

my technique to perfection.

done in this situation?

is to share the music

of the Far East with people,
that they may know its beauty.

136
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,125
It is crucial, that
we perform our music

from the very depths
of our hearts.

138

Authenticity is the only key.

No matter what catastrophe
looms before us,

if we remember that key,

any such threat handily.

I profoundly regret having
misunderstood you.

I must apologize as well.

144

All is forgiven.

In the long run, it doesn't
change your unwavering

devotion to me or my teachings.

Use that as encouragement,

so you may continue to
stand firm with me here.
