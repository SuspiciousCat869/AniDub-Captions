00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,375
[AION]
"An ant killing an elephant"

2
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,541
is an apropos phrase
for this scenario.

3
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:08,041
To think that a god-like black
monster such as I would be

4
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:12,166
worried about the insect-like
pebble that entered his shoe.

5
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,000
[AION] Additionally, a chunk
of this long, unruly hair

6
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:25,125
is pointing up at the sky as if
it is somehow being summoned

7
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,166
back home from above.

8
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,625
[AION]
This is the worst.

9
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,083
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Dark monsters have been known

10
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,666
to take advantage of
darkness in people's hearts.

11
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,000
The darkness in their hearts?
And what does that mean?

12
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,250
[STRAWBERRY HEART] Oh, you know,
like in Yokai Street.

13
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,416
Little Tsugihagi turned
into a monster, remember?

14
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,458
If you put the pieces
together, it all makes sense.

15
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,375
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Listen to me, little sister.

16
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,375
That Dagger gives me
a dirty, dirty feelin!

17
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,083
I see.

18
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,583
Then I guess we need to
be extra careful too, huh?

19
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:09,458
Also, you've started talking
even more strangely than usual.

20
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,708
Awesome, y'all!

21
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,833
Seems like all that's left to do
is practice this song even more

22
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,583
and then it'll be
completely ours.

23
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,000
[ALL giggle]

24
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey, what do you
think, Mister Berry?

25
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,833
Again?

26
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,208
Is he sleeping?

27
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,750
I don't think so.

28
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:38,041
For a while now, it seem like
his spirit leaves sometimes.

29
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,958
But lately, it's been
happening more and more,

30
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,291
and I don't know why.

31
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,000
Goodness, how strange.

32
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,541
Well, whatever the case,

33
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,166
we're actually playing
the Grateful Rock Festival.

34
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,500
It's unbelievable,
like a dream come true.

35
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,791
But... what happens if we
don't leave a good impression?

36
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:57,166
[MAPLE]
Oh, no! Terrible news!

37
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,208
Well, about that "terrible
news" you mentioned?

38
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,375
[MAPLE]
Uh!

39
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,000
Unfortunately, from
what I've gathered,

40
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,125
it looks like Plasmagica
won't be able to perform

41
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,125
at the festival!

42
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:08,875
[ALL gasp]

43
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,500
We can't? Why not?

44
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,041
[MAPLE]
I filled out the application,

45
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,458
just like you're
supposed to,

46
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,916
and included a demo of the
song you'll be performing,

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,416
"Falling Star Dreamline."

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,041
Thankfully, the song
passed muster.

49
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,875
But then, there's this.

50
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,333
This!

51
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,875
What's that all about?
A "Live Point"?

52
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,333
We have to have played
a live show before?

53
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:31,208
Well, that sucks. We haven't
done a proper concert as of yet.

54
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,833
So, does that mean
we can't perform?

55
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,916
Wait, what about Shingan?
Are they ineligible, too?

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,083
[MAPLE]
Nope.

57
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,708
Remember when they
opened for Trichronika?

58
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,375
Even though it wasn't
a headlining show,

59
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,583
it still counts.

60
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,708
So, they passed
with flying colors.

61
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,708
[ROM] It's not something
we're proud of, though.

62
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,000
[ALL gasp]

63
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,333
Yo, Plasmagica,

64
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,708
how long are you gonna
drag out your rehearsal?

65
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,291
My Red Tomahawk is
anxious to come out,

66
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,666
plug in, and totally
rock your world!

67
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,250
Sorry 'bout that.

68
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,916
You can't be in that much of a
hurry. You're not all here yet.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,041
What?

70
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:03,958
Uh.

71
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:04,958
It's true.

72
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,166
I thought he'd be
meeting us here,

73
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,708
but I don't see Aion anywhere.

74
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,833
You didn't notice
until just now?

75
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,500
Wonder what excuse he'll have
for not being here on time.

76
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,083
He'll prob'ly be like,

77
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,541
"The sun god of darkness has
low blood pressure right now."

78
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,416
Or some stupid crap like that!

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,958
If he spouts out a lame excuse

80
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,291
like what a nine-to-fiver
would say, like "traffic,"

81
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,708
he's gonna regret it!

82
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,166
Anyway, back to us
and the festival.

83
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,541
We've come this far. We can't be
disqualified on a technicality.

84
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,666
Let's do whatever it takes
to make this happen.

85
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,333
[MAPLE] I have an idea
or two about just that.

86
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,958
I'll tell you more
about it at the café.

87
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,958
[MAPLE] You should
play in an even bigger

88
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,291
and concert-worthy
battle of the bands!

89
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,750
Are you serious? Another one?

90
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,083
Wait a sec.

91
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,166
You don't mean a rematch
with Criticrista, do you?

92
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,041
[MAPLE] I knew you'd be the
first to catch my drift, Chuchu.

93
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,416
What? But Cri-Cri is
on a roll right now!

94
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,041
They're super popular!

95
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,833
It would be so embarrassing
to lose to them again.

96
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,916
But right now, it's not an
issue of winning or losing.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,750
We just need to play
a high-profile show

98
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,833
to count as a concert.

99
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,333
With that new song of ours,

100
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,958
I think we actually
stand a chance

101
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,458
of beating them this time.

102
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,958
[ALL gasp]

103
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,208
If we win this, and bring
that momentum to the festival,

104
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,125
then... we'd definitely
be the number one band

105
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,041
to watch out for.

106
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,666
Well, that might be true,

107
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,291
but it's not something
to get worked up about.

108
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,541
Right, yeah, I suppose not.

109
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,833
But would they
even be up for it?

110
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
Will they accept our challenge?

111
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,416
[MAPLE] That's where the might
of your powerful president

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,833
comes in!

113
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,791
I'll call Ogasawara. Uh...

114
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,583
Right now. Yep. Any second.

115
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,791
I can't do it! Oh, the pressure!

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
[ANGELICA] Hello? This is
Banded Rocking Records.

117
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,458
Yes.

118
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,458
I was calling to ask for a
battle of the bands rematch

119
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,458
with our artist Plasmagica.

120

Yes.

00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,708
I see. Excellent to hear.

00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,208
We look forward to
working with you again.

It's all set. We're ready to go.

And how.

126
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:23,583
[ANGELICA]
However,

127
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,166
their appearance and performance
schedule is pretty booked,

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,125
so it has to go
down next weekend.

Next weekend?

130
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,416
That doesn't give
us a lot of time.

131
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,916
Look, it's been decided,
okay. We need to practice.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,916
Let's do it.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,250
But wait, we can't.

134
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,458
Right now Shingan
is using the studio.

Uh.

Oh yeah, I forgot.

Hey. Let's call it a day, 'kay?

Mh-hm.

And that means, snack time.

time all night long.

Uh?

[DAGGER] I accepted, of
course. But will you do it?

Yes. It's just what we wanted.

Is that so? Excellent.

to keep her cuteness up.

[TSUKINO]
I wonder what's wrong with her.

158

She's way serious about it.

Hey!

Oh!

Ah! I'm tired of waiting!

We've been sitting

You're so late the strings

It's because you called Aion's

[CHUCHU]
Let me get this straight, Yaiba.

227
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:31,875
The perpetually gloomy Aion was
1.6 times gloomier than usual?

228
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,916
That just barely made sense.

Hey, remember what happened to
Tsugihahi from Shinimonogurui?

230
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,750
Mister Berry said that
sometimes dark monsters come

231
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,041
and latch onto the gloom
in Myumon's hearts

232
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,791
so they can influence
their minds and bodies.

00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,041
You mean that--?

234
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,125
Maybe the same thing
happened to Aion.

If that's the case, shouldn't
you be out looking for him?

it was no big deal at all.

We'll just go out and
look for him without you.

might not be himself.

Shuzo. That guy over

[KAI] Why is he up
there on the roof top?

00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:55,875
[RIKU] Whoa. He's putting
off a really negative aura.

277
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:02,708
[ROM] He may be a shut-in
with a communication disorder.

He can't talk to anyone
unless he poses.

But no one in the band would
argue that he's the most

musically talented and the
biggest fan of music among us.

281
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,750
That's why hearing him say
he was quitting the band

282
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,375

thought would happen.

Yeah, and that Crow.

He's always dogging on Aion
and saying mean things,

286
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,708
but he's the one who
recognizes his talent the most.

287
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,583
The songs filled with
soul that Aion writes

288
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:36,291
combined with the passionate
lyrics that Crow adds to them,

289

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,708
[gasps]

318
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,000
Damn you, Shu.

319
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,708
You might try the Shibu
Valley Center Building.

320
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,708
[ROM]
Uh.

321
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,125
Buh-bye now!

322
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,833
Rom.

323
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,583
Yeah, right, let's go.

324
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,125
[SHUZO] What's with the
doom and gloom, you two?

325
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:21,166
Got something on your
mind that's bothering you?

326
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,458
Well, uh...

327
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,541
You see.

328
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,916
We were wondering

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,541
about that drummer Rom
you were talking to earlier.

330
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,750
Did you know him before the gig?

331
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,916
I mean it seemed like you
were old friends or something.

332
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,916
[SHUZO] Once, there were
band mates who shared a dream.

333
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,500
The goal of one of these friends

334
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,541
was to make that dream of
theirs a reality someday.

335
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,166
He valued that above
everything else.

336
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,166
Truth be told, however,
the other friend also wished

337
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,208
to receive blessings
from that dream.

338
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,125
Even though the dreams they
chased were one in the same,

339
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,416
in time, they found they could
not walk together anymore.

340
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,416
They broke their chains and
went their separate ways.

341
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,166
I'll tie him up and drag
him back if I have to.

342
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,958
That was my intention
from the start.

343
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,833
Hey, Aion!

344
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:27,750
[ROM]
Idiot!

345
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,625
What're you doing
in a place like this?

346
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,708
[AION] The god has already
announced his departure

347
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,666
from SHINGANCRIMSONZ.

348
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,041
What I do up here all by myself
is none of your concern.

349
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,291
Aion!

350
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,458
You bastard!

351
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,250
Don't spout anymore
of that nonsense

352
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,375
about you quitting
and leaving us!

353
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,500
[AION]
Someone like me.

354
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,708
[ROM]
Huh?

355
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,625
Even if... I wasn't
there, you'd--

356
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,791
Are you still saying that crap?

357
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:03,416
Rom!

358
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,125
Enough, you idiot!

359
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,500
[ROM yells]

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,208
[ROM]
Crow.

361
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,458
[CROW] Sorry, but I can't
allow you to leave us.

362
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,916
It's not gonna happen.

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,625
And even more than that, I can't
allow you to make this guy sad.

364
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,375
[CROW] He was crying
'cause you left him.

365
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,333
Now listen up, Aion!

366
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,541
You haven't quit SHINGANCRIMSONZ
yet, understand me?

367
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,916
None of us has officially
accepted your resignation!

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,166
So there!

369
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:56,125
And, well, maybe... I might've
mouthed off too much, too.

370
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,666
But don't say annoying and
stupid things like "I quit"!

371
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,791
I'll only say this once,
so pay attention!

372
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,750
[CROW]
I will never allow a band member

373
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,166
who wrote such beautiful and
soulful songs to leave us!

374
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,916
We need that muse
more than oxygen!

375
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,750
Can't you see
they're our lifeblood?

376
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,208
We can live our
lives passionately

377
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,333
because of your music!

378
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:41,833
This god made the
mistake of a lifetime.

379
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,583
I can't believe
it took the wisdom

380
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,625
of this under-sized
rodent to save my soul.

381
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,458
Oh, shut your talk-hole.

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,750
[AION]
Uh.

383
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,541
My eyes. Are these tears?

384
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,041
I thought they had
dried up long ago.

385
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,500
Through rain, fire,
flood, whatever.

386
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,125
When the four of
us are together,

387
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:16,375
there's nothing the world can
throw at us we can't overcome.

388
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,125
Even if a monstrous
wall blocks our way,

389
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,791
when we work as a team, we'll
find a way to bust through it!

390
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,833
[CROW]
Damn straight! Because we are...

391
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,583
[ALL]
SHINGANCRIMSONZ!

392
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,333
What's that? You found him?

393
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,958
Oh, thank goodness!

394
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,166
[ROSIA] Well hello,
fanboys and fangirls!

395
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,708
Rosia from Criticrista here

396
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,250
with a totes important
announcement for you.

397
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,875
Very, very soon,

398
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:55,125
we'll be competing in another
battle of the bands.

399
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,791
This one will be a rematch
with the defeated Plasmagica.

400
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,208
They don't stand a chance.
Are you watching, Cyan?

401
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,583
[gasps]

402
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,791
This time around, I'll
flatten you like a pancake.

403
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,083
Just kidding!

404
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,416
[giggles]

405
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,041
We'll see you then!
Don't forget to vote, 'kay?

406
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,333
[SHIBARIN]
It's finally time

407
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,208
for the Grateful Rock
Festival, y'all.

408
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,041
[POKOE] There's gonna be a whole
buncha popular bands there.

409
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,500
[HAKKUN] I wanna go to Midi
City. I wanna see 'em play.

410
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,291
[SHIBARIN] You gotta
fight to get some tickets!

411
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,291
[POKOE] We could check
out some online auctions.

412
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,833
[SHIBARIN] They're really
expensive, though.

413
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,791
High schoolers like us don't
stand a chance of winnin'.

414
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,250
[POKOE]
Didja hear about Cri-Cri?

415
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,166
They're doin' another
battle of the bands.

416
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,208
[SHIBARIN] What band are they
dukin' it out with this time?

417
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,583
[POKOE] Plas-- Uh.
Plasmagica? Or something?

418
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,458
[SHIBARIN]
Who the heck is that?

419
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,791
[KITTSUN] Sorry! That dang
math class is the pits!

420
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,833
Huh? What's wrong guys?

421
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,958
[POKOE, HAKKUN]
We wanna go to Midi City!

422
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,291
[KITTSUN]
Oh! Midi City's great! Let's go!

423
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,166
We should make gettin' some
new trendy clothes there

424
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,458
our first priority.

425
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,208
[POKOE, HAKKUN]
Huh? Clothes come first?

426
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,458
[SHIBARIN]
Who's this Plasma-thingamajig?

427
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,541
[KITTSUN]
Wait, what are we gonna do

428
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,166
about the school festival?

429
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,625
[HAKKUN] Come on, don't
drag me back to reality!

430
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:14,875
[SHIBARIN] I said, who's
this Plasma-deeleebopper?

431
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,291
[MAPLE] Today, we have
Rosia from Cri-Cri.

432
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,708
Let's cut to the chase.
What's your favorite hobby?

433
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,291
[ROSIA]
Shopping, doi.

434
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,125
Like, trying on cute clothes,
looking at myself in the mirror,

435
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,416
and then the clerk says,
"That looks so fetch."

436
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,083
It's the best thing
ever. I love it.

437
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,791
[MAPLE]
OMG, me too!

438
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:01,583
What'd I just say?
