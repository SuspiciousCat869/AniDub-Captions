1
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,500
[CHUCHU]
So, what do you think, Cyan?

2
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,583
Huh? I'm not really sure.
Wait! I've got an idea!

3
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,208
What do you think
about this progression?

4
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,833
[CHUCHU]
Yeah, that could work!

5
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,041
They may have lost
the Battle of the Bands,

6
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,208
but they seem to be headed
in the right direction now.

7
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,750
Look how driven they are!

8
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,041
[MAPLE chuckles]
You can say that again!

9
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,250
Things are slowly but
surely moving along.

10
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,916
And the girls seem to be
growing closer, as well.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,041
Nice one!

12
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,541
All right, why don't
we call it a day?

13
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,250
Let's work on our own
parts at home and then

14
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,166
put 'em all together again
at practice tomorrow!

15
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,208
[CYAN]
Sounds good to me!

16
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,166
[MOA]
Okay! Let's do it!

17
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,666
Excuse me, I--

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,708
[CYAN, MOA, CHUCHU]
Huh?

19
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,083
So, after tomorrow's practice,

20
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,833
maybe we...

21
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:38,750
What is it? Go on.

22
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:44,375

you wanted to join me.

23

Mabo-roshi no An?

25
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,750
I know the font's weird,

26
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,583
but it's "Tsurezurenaru
Ayatsuri Mugenan"!

27
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,625
"Tsurezure"?

28
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,125
So, yeah. If you're interested,

29
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,166
I thought maybe we
could all go together

30
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,541
and see their concert.

31
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,958
I've heard of them! They're
super popular right now.

32
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,083
Of course I'm
interested! Thank you!

[whimpering]

34

[MOA] I'm so stoked to go
to a Tsurezure concert

I see. So she's at BRR?

38
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,083
[OGASAWARA]
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,208
[DAGGER]
Has Maple noticed as of yet?

40
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,458
[OGASAWARA] No, sir. Thus far,
it doesn't appear so.

41
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,666
[DAGGER]
And?

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,333
[OGASAWARA]
Well, Plasmagica wasn't bad.

43
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,875
They sounded all right.

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,666
But, honestly, they don't even
hold a candle to Criticris--

45
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,041
[DAGGER]
I don't care about the band!

46
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,083
I want to know more
about the new girl.

47
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,250
The guitar player.

48
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,041
[OGASAWARA]
Of course! Forgive me, sir!

49
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,458
The rumors are true.

50
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,083
I don't know what it is,
but there's definitely something

51
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,583
about that girl named Cyan.

52
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,791
[DAGGER]
I see.

53
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,833
It appears my hunch
about her was correct.

54
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,750
Cyan, huh?

55
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:05,166
One way or another, someday
soon, she'll end up here.

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,041
I must have her lead the
best band in Sound World

57
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,458
and stand at the very top.

58
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,541
[OGASAWARA]
So, what should I do about her?

59
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,958
[DAGGER] Let her swim
along a little longer.

60
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,583
The higher she raises
her musical skills,

61
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:23,208
the better it will be for us.
Keep a watchful eye.

62
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,375
[OGASAWARA]
Yes, sir!

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,916
[gasping] It's almost time for
the Tsurezure awesome-show!

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,041
Wow, Moa, you like
'em that much?

65

I'm gonna explode!

66
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,625
While we're having
fun at their concert,

67
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,541
might as well try to find out
the secret to their popularity.

68
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,250
Wow, I guess they
really are well-known,

69
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,083
aren't they? What kind of
music do they play anyway?

70
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,333
No way!

71
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,208
Cyan, do you really not
know who Tsurezure are?

72
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,958
[gasps] Uh...

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,875
No...

74
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,291
[CHUCHU] Cyan. Where you're
from is still a mystery,

75
00:04:57,375 --> 00:05:00,458
and you'd never heard of Saint
Midi Girls' Academy, either.

76
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,333
What have you been doing
with your life up till now?

77
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,875
[A]
All right.

78
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,833
Let's use today's performance
to continue our training.

79
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,333
[UN]
For sure!

80
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,500
After all, spreading music from
the Far East to Midi City

81
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,458
is the perfect opportunity
to do so, right?

82
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:20,583
[DARUDAYU]
Yes, girls. That's the spirit.

[A]
Master!

84
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,875
It must have been fate
that led us to meet a master

85
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,750
such as you. One from the
Far East of our birth.

86
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,833
To think we're able to
study under the tutelage

87
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,208
of someone as virtuous
as you, Master!

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,916
We're so very grateful!

While I appreciate the praise,

91
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,500
you girls are not that
much younger than I.

92
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:42,666
You should not depend on me
to the extent that you do.

93
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,166
Please, Master.
You are far too humble.

94
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,250
With your virtue and skill
at playing the drum,

95
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,458
surely you can teach us
what music really is.

96
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,958
We eagerly await your
continued guidance.

first time we performed

157
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,083
here in Shibu Valley?

158
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,125
[A]
Yes, Master.

159
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,541
We can safely assume,

160
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,791
there's a high probability
the audience merely found

161
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,791
Far Eastern music curious.

162
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,750
[BOTH gasp]

163
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,500
If you mistake such enthusiasm

164
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,666
for our own abilities,
then you've simply proven

165
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,250
your level of inexperience.

166
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes! Obviously!

167
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,500
We were so blind.

168
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,625
We have not trained
nearly enough.

169
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,791
You must be ever diligent
to walk the path

170
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,500
of the performing arts.

171
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,000
Work hard! Don't give up!

172
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,250
[BOTH]
Master!

173
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,666
I'm pleased you see
how things are.

174
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,875
Now, then.

175
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,708
Since we came all the
way to Shibu Valley,

176
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,541
the town of young people...

177
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,875
[A]
Yes?

178
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,291
[DARUDAYU] Why don't we
enjoy ourselves a little?

179
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,375
[A, UN]
We were hoping for that!

180
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,916
It's so yummy!

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,666
Tsurezure really have a lot
of spirit, don't they?

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,000
Sure do!

183
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,250
Their costumes, their
performance, their songs--

184
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,333
Everything was just
bursting with uniqueness!

185
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,333
[MOA sighs]

186
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,625
You okay?

187
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,083
[MOA]
Oh! Uh.

188
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,291
[laughs] They were
amazing is all!

189
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,750
Looks like you
were so blown away

190
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,416
that everything's just
goin' in one ear

191
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,708
and out the other one, huh?

192
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,041
[MOA]
Heh, maybe.

193
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:08,791
Hey, those girls are our rivals!

194
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,666
You can't just think of 'em
with a fan's point of view.

195
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,958
That's a good point, Retoree.

196
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,416
No time to sit back
and bask in their glow.

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,208
We need to figure out
a way to raise the bar

198
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,541
of our performances
up to their level.

199
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:24,791
[sighs] Maybe, people like
their originality.

200
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,666
You might be on
to something there.

201
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Heh. Although, the giant
Dharma Doll was a tad much,

202
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,583
dontcha think?

203

Chuchu, hey, what's wrong?

205
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,333
Uh--!

206
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,583
[MOA, CYAN]
Huh?

207
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,625
[ALL yelp]

208
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,458
So it looks like they
have those "pancakes"

209
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,333
everyone's been
talking about here.

210
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:44,916
[A]
Yum.

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,958
I can't decide if I want that
or everything else on the menu!

212
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,541
[UN giggles]
I know! Me, either!

213
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,041
What should we do?
What should we do?

214
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,375
[MOA, CYAN, CHUCHU gasp]

215

[whispering] Retoree, wait!
What are you doing?

216
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,791
I wanted...

217
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,125
[DARUDAYU]
Hm?

218
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,416
[gasps] She's not gonna
make a rival declaration?

219
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,916
We're not ready for
something like that!

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,166
Retoree! Don't do it!

221
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,208
I just... wanna say...

222
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,708
[RETOREE]
I am such a huge fan!

223
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,083
[ALL]
Huh?

224
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,958
Why, thank you, it's so very
nice of you to say that!

225
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,833
Thank you! I support
everything you do!

226
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
Um. Excuse me!

227
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:32,375
Yes, dear?

00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,583
Moa?

00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,333
Huh?

00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,166
Wha--?

231
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,416
Your lyrics based
on the Far East...

232
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,791
They've touched me in
ways I can't describe!

233
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:43,833
Is that so?

234
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,333
Are you far from
your home, as well?

235
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,666
[yelps]

236
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,916
[DARUDAYU chuckles]
It's no wonder.

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Your hometown is something
carved into your heart.

238
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,208
You carry it with you forever.

you are or where it is.

[DARUDAYU]
Don't tell me...

245
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,833
[CYAN]
Our originality?

246
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,166
That's right.

247
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,333
I suppose we should start
with the way we look.

248
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,458
You really think so?

Just what are you getting at?

250
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,291
We should wear our originality.

[CYAN, CHUCHU, MOA]
Huh?

252
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,958
Or, to put it another way,

253
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,666
I think we should
all wear battle armor.

254
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,166
Muah! How's this, sugar?

255
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,916
I dunno. It might be
a little too much?

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,458
So. Whatcha think?

257
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,041

Meh. Kinda cliché.

That doesn't go with our songs.

Not so much.

a serious talk, Moa. And no.

[CHUCHU]
We are so getting nowhere.

268
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,958
It's hard to choose.

269

Which one do you guys
think works best?

Oh, we weren't looking!

00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,541
What are you talking about?

273
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,250
[CHUCHU] I was asking about
our performance outfits.

274
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,666
[CROW]
How should I know?

275
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,666
[YAIBA] As for myself,
even if you were clad in rags

276
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,541
from head to toe,
my Ryukenden would remain

277
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,958
true and pure. Hence--

278
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,583
[AION] It is proof you
are ignorant people

279
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,500
who go against god if your
hearts are wicked enough

280
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,458
to be tempted by
costumes like that.

281
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,166
If you have reached
the divine realm of god,

282
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,375
even if you were not wearing
a thread of clothing,

283
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,708
you would be able to reach
the hearts of the audience!

What are you bozos doing?

timing, as always!

I was hopin' you could tell us
your opinion on somethin'.

today, for real.

You got it.

00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,875
We wanted to try showcasing

and creativity on stage
by wearing a uniform.

294

But we're having trouble
choosing, so which one

295
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,125
do you think best suits us?

misunderstanding something.

[CHUCHU]
Huh?

300
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,791
What kinda clothes you
wear doesn't determine

301
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,458
if your band is any good.

good fight and bare your soul

with everything you've got.

I know, but yesterday,
we all went to see

305
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,750
this unique band in
concert who's recently

306
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,375
become really popular.

307
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,416
And we've been thinkin' that
maybe it'd help our popularity

308
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
if we showed more--

309
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,625
It's not just about
being popular!

00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,291
to get married?

[MAPLE] What? Wow,
that would be a problem!

476
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,916
What should I do?
What should I do?

477
