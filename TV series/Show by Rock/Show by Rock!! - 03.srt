1
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,541
[RETOREE]
Battle of the Bands?

2
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:55,958
[MAPLE]
Yes.

3
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,625
I recently bumped into an
old business acquaintance

4
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:59,958
named Ogasawara.

5
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,458
He was bragging that his agency

6
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,958
is heavily promoting
an all-girl band.

7
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,333
[OGASAWARA]
How about it?

8
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:09,250
Wanna pit your Plasmagica
against our Criticrista?

9
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,250
Could be pretty interesting.

10
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,208
[MAPLE]
He said it all smug, too.

11
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,500
As if some pack of
bubblegum that only just

12
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,958
hit the scene would be
any competition for you!

13
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,208
So I said yes to the battle of
the bands coming up at S-River!

14
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,125
Are you certain you
weren't a bit too hasty

15
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,833
in accepting that
challenge, Maple?

16
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,958
He's got a reputation
for being shady

17
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,333
in his business dealings.

18
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,125
[MAPLE grumbles]

19
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,083
[CHUCHU]
I reckon yes!

20
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:32,916
[MAPLE]
What?

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,458
As the brand new Plasmagica,

22
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,125
I think we should all jump
straight into this pool!

23
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't you agree with me, ladies?

24
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,083
We've only ever played with
Cyan during band rehearsals,

25
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,250
and besides, we did say
we wanted to level up,

26
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,000
so this'll be the
perfect opportunity

27
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,208
for us to shine bright!

28
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,250
Yeah, you're right!
Let's totally go for it!

29
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,750
I'm down with that, too.

30
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,625
I'm so in, pyuru!

31
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:57,041
Very well then. As long
as everyone agrees.

32
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,083
[MAPLE]
Now that we've settled that.

33
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,541
Here you go, gals, dig in!

34
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,875
[CYAN]
Finally, my first concert!

35
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,750
It's really happening!

36
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,375
[giggles]

37
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:14,333
Let's see, Criticrista...
Wait, listen to this.

38
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,458
It says they're special
students in the Show Business

39
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,750
course at Saint Midi
Girls' Academy.

40
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,125
[MOA, CHUCHU gasp]

41
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,083
Is that a big deal or something?

42
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,125
You mean you've never
heard of it, honey?

43
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,958
Sorry. I haven't.

44
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,500
[CHUCHU]
For those who wanna make it

45
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,000
in the music industry, this
particular school is essentially

46
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,458
the golden ticket to
success, no foolin'!

47
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,791
[RETOREE]
It says they're all friends

48
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:38,541
from the student council.
They seem really tight.

49
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,875
So, hey, Rosia.

50
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,583
How was that Plasmagica
band you saw?

51
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,291
I'm so dying to know.

52
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,083
How were they?
Dunno what'cha mean.

53
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:47,916
I mean what kind of
band were they?

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,708
Sparkly and fun like pop?

55
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,416
Or like, did they like,
drop that bass. Y'know.

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,750
How do they rock it, girl?

57
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,250
Oh.

58
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,416
I haven't heard their music yet,
so I can't really tell you

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,833
for sure, but they
seemed decent.

60
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,166
Does that mean
we should be like,

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,375
a little bit scared?

62
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,083
Oh, please! As if.

63
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,250
We can whip 'em even
with our eyes closed!

64
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,250
[CHUCHU] So, you know the
concert hall in S-River

65
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,041
where the Battle of
the Bands will be held?

66
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,291
[CYAN]
Yeah?

67
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,958
It's funny, that was the
place I first realized

68
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,291
that I wanted to be
a pro musician someday.

69
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,041
[CYAN]
Really?

70
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,541
I didn't know that!

71
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,291
The concert that night.

72
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,666
Well, it left a mighty deep
impression on my heart,

73
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,916
and I never forgot it.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,416
When I close my eyes,

75
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,000
I can still see and hear
the dazzling guitar playing

76
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,500
of Grateful King.

77
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:45,333
Until then, music was
just something I liked.

78
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,375
But at that show,
it became something

79
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:50,750
I also had to play myself.
I couldn't deny the feeling.

80
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,875
That's when I knew that
music was my calling.

81
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:55,416
My true destiny. And I
haven't looked back since!

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,458
[giggles] So what we
could say is...

83
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,208
S-River is your
musical birthplace!

84
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,083
Wow!

85
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,708
Now that we know your story.

86
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,875
This gig is an even bigger
deal than we thought it was!

87
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,375
Hey, y'all, I'll be countin'
on you for this one.

88
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,583
[CHUCHU]
Night-night, my sugars!

89
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,958
[sighs] Oh, I can't
wait! Concert!

90
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,625
[STRAWBERRY HEART] D'ya even
know the real bass line

91
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,166
on this battle, sister?

92
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,416
Ah-ha!

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
You're gettin' psyched
and you got no idea why.

94
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,000
[laughs nervously]

95
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,166
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Truth in advertisin', baby.

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,166
It's a battle between bands!

97
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,750
Like a fight?

98
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,125
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
It's concert warfare where

99
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,041
your songs are your weapons!

100
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,166
[CYAN]
But that sounds scary!

101
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,916
[STRAWBERRY HEART] Two bands
duke it out to the coda

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,125
in a stadium, and the audience
judges who's more awesome.

103
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,666
It's fist-pumping,
heart-thumping crazy!

104
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,916
All the rock fans in town

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,333
watch the jammin' action
on TV and on the web,

106
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,291
and they get to put
their two notes in, too.

107
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:56,208
The more the fans love it,
the more points for the players,

108
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,708
and the winning band's
Melodisian stones evolve.

109
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,333
These go to eleven!

110
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,625
Really?

111
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,708
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
And, dig this:

112
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:05,583
The winners get cold,
hard Sound Cash.

113
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,583
Aw, cool!

114
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,708
I see.

115
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,958
Then, I swear, I'll work
harder than I ever have and do

116
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,416
whatever it takes to rock my
first concert with Plasmagica!

117
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,125
Which means, Mister Berry.
I'll need you!

118
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,541
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
That's not my name!

119
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,708
It takes me forever to say
"Stra-Strawberry Heart."

120
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,166
Plus I stutter it.

121
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,541
[STRAWBERRY HEART grumbles]
If it tunes your axe.

122
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,875
[CYAN giggles]

123
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:32,666
[keyboard tapping]

124
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,166
[sighs]

125
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,875
Only two weeks left
until the show.

126
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,416
No way is that enough time.

127
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,458
[RETOREE]
I finally got to join a band.

128
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:52,708
[RETOREE] I shouldn't complain.
It's something I always wanted.

129
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,583
[CROW]
Listen up, cattle!

130
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,541
[CROWD cheering]

131
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,375
We will polish our crimson souls

132
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,291
and stand at the
top of Midi City!

133
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,916
We will rule like
the kings we are!

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,833
[RETOREE]
But, more importantly,

135
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,916
what'd make me really
happy was having friends

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,708
to play music with.

137
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,750
[MAPLE]
Do you like the rock music?

138
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,000

[RETOREE yelps]

141
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,333
[MAPLE]
Hi.

142
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,041
U-Uh...

00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,791
[MAPLE]
Here's my card, take a gander.

144
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,541
It says you're from
Banded Rocking Records.

145
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,583
[MAPLE]
Look over there.

146
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:32,083
Those guys are also
with my agency.

descends, foolish mortal!

00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,708
[gasps]

149
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,875
[MAPLE] I'm planning on
putting together a girl band

150
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,291
to round things out.

151
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,875
And I'm looking for
members right now.

152
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:43,833
For real?

153
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,208
[MAPLE]
How 'bout it?

154
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,958
Will ya play me a few lines
on that bass of yours?

155
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,750
Yeah, sure, but, I'm not a...

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,500
[RETOREE] That's why, when
the president scouted me,

157
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,541
I thought it would be a
chance to make some friends.

158
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,833
[CHUCHU]
My name's Chuchu.

159
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,791
It's a real pleasure

[SHIBARIN]
How d'ya mean?

465
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,458
[POKOE] Like we won't make it
unless we're in Midi City.

466
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:39,708
[SHIBARIN]
That's not true!

467
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,375
Music's a lot like the sun.

468
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,333
It shines all over
everythin' equally,

469
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,416
so we can all feel
its warm rays!

470
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,750
Right, Hakkun?

471
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:51,166
[HAKKUN] Uh-- Yeah. But I
wanna go to Midi City.

472
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,250
[door scrapes]

473
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,416
[KITTSUN]
Sorry!

474
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,041
That dang literature
class is the pitts!

475
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,125
Huh? What's wrong, guys?

476
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,416
[SHIBARIN, POKOE, HAKKUN]
We wanna go to Midi City!

477
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,208
[KITTSUN]
Oh, Midi City's great! Let's go!

478
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:06,458
Anyway, there's a major
hot band there right now!

479
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,000
[POKOE]
Huh? What band?

480
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,583
[KITTSUN]
Lookit.

481
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:14,750
Tsurezurenaru Ayatsuri Mugenan!
They're practically music gods!

482
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,291
[MOA] How exciting,
traveling around the world

483
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,291
to share your own
music with everyone!

484
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,000
I wanna do that so badly!

485
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,916
[MAPLE]
Ah, yes, traveling's great.

486
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,916
Hot springs, mountain
streams, stewed giblets,

487
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,833
grilling some fish with
warm sake on the side.

488
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:01,416
Where you goin'?
