[RETOREE] Hey, Cyan, you said
something a while back.

319
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,500
That when you're
with your band mates,

320
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,583
you can speak more clearly
with music than with words.

321
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,083
You're right. It's true.

[gasps]

323
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:49,625
I understand that.
And I can accept it.

00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,291
I mean, I do!

Why are you making fun of us?

This is serious, y'know.

What should I do, pyuru?

It's too late to tell
'em the truth now!

Don't be crazy, Moa!

[MOA]
Oh, no.

343

Why are you over there?

344
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,375
Because there's something

345
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,791
that I've kept hidden
from everybody, too!

346

[RETOREE, CHUCHU, CYAN gasp]

I, Moa, am about to send
an important transmission!

All right, sweetie.

349

We're here listening to you!

350
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:54,708
Very well then. The whole
truth about me is...

351
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,708
I'm an alien
from another planet!

352
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,875
I was sent to
investigate this one!

353
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,500
And I started with you!

[RETOREE]
Wait, hold up.

There're only four
people in this band.

357
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,833
Isn't it kind of lame and
gimmicky for two of the members

358
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,666
to be aliens from
different worlds?

359
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,375
[CHUCHU]
I think it's Moa's sweet attempt

360
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,000
at making Cyan feel better.

Thanks, Moa!

It's okay, you don't
have to do that anymore!

Hold your horses! Lightbulb!

Can we use this?
It would totally work!

We could have a whole
outer space theme!

Oh!

Then you and I have
to think of an idea

for a gimmick, too, Chuchu!

the song we just sang?

a terrific team.
