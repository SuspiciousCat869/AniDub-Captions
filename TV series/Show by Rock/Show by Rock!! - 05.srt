There is no need
for worry, I will heal.

160
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,958
Maybe so, but please
don't push yourself

161
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,041
too hard right now.

162
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,500
Tell me.

163
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,125
I have to know, who was
behind that grand apparition?

164
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,791
Let's just say...

165
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,416
Look at the world as full
of paths that all people

166
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,166
walk upon throughout their life.

167
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,250
A straight, safe path
will eventually

168
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,250
become dull and tedious
to those who have

169
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,291
walked it long enough,
and they will grow impatient.

170
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,208
When that inevitably happens,

171
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
they will seek out a different
path with twists and turns

172
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,208
to find change and excitement.

173
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,541
However, evil lies
in wait for them

174
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,041
behind every bend of that path.

175
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,333
And this is the reason
that monsters are now

176
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:44,708
appearing in Midi City
as of late. Do you see?

177
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,250
After peace continues
for hundreds of years,

178
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:51,000
something will always come to
wantonly destroy it in kind.

179
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,583
That is just how
the world works.

180
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,416
But, Master, you speak
as if you yourself

181
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,875
have experienced such
things personally.

182
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,375
[DARUDAYU chuckles]
Of course not.

183
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,125
It is just what I've
always been told.

184
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,000
[DARUDAYU]
The poor young girl.

185
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,708
Will she succeed,
or will she suffer?

186
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,666
[CYAN]
Yay, I had so much fun!

187
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,500
That's the most I've
ever heard Retoree say

188
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,083
at one time! Meow!

189
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:21,708
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Hey!

190
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,208
[CYAN screams]

191
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,416
[STRAWBERRY HEART] Set break
is over. Get off your duff!

192
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,625
Sling your guns on
and start practicing!

193
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,750
Jeez, what got under
your strings?

194
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,666
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Wake up! It's mission go-time!

195
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,416
What mission?

196
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,041
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Come on, baby!

197
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,916
Don't you even remember
why you got rocked

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,916
into this world?

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Um, I--

200
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,250
I have to play guitar
so I can beat down

201
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,916
the bad monsters, that right?

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,416
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Bam!

203
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,166
And the only way, is to amp up
your skills to ace level.

204
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,416
Yeah, yeah, I know that.

205
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,166
But I promise I've been
working super hard

206
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,083
with the other girls in
the band to make it happen,

207
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,250
Mister Berry.

208
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,500
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Talk is cheap, sister!

209
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,000
Practice first! Second!

210
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,875
Third, et cetera! You pickin'
up what I'm puttin' down?

211
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,458
Yep, that's a man
in there, but who?

212
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,791
Okay, if another
dark monster shows up

213
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,916
somewhere else, then do I have
to go fight it all by myself?

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,708
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
You have an axe, use it.

215
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,000
That's a lot of
stuff to take on.

216
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,125
I'm not so sure I
can handle it all.

217
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,291
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
That's exactly why

218
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,000
you gotta practice!

219
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,666
Yeah, but, don't you think
it seems a bit sudden?

220
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,041
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Yup, because now

221
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,833
it's a do-or-die anthem.

222
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,166
Besides, don't you wanna burn
up the fast-track back home?

223
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,958
[gasps] Well, I guess
so, but I also...

224
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,083
[STRAWBERRY HEART] Also what?
You singin' the blues?

225
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,458
What? No.

226
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,583
I'm okay. Really,
I promise. I'm fine!

227
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,083
Anyway, don't worry.

228
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,625
I swear I'll do the mission
right. I won't let you down.

229
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,416
[CHUCHU gasps]
She's yappin' with her guitar?

230
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,708
How on earth?
That takes the cake!

231
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,666
[CYAN] Okay, if another
dark monster shows up

232
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,541
somewhere else, then do I have
to go fight it all by myself?

233
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,416
[STRAWBERRY HEART] Besides,
don't you wanna burn up

234
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,375
the fast-track back home?

235
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,625
[CHUCHU]
What's the skinny, here?

236
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,875
Whereabouts were you
living before, anyway?

237
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,875
Huh? Everywhere.
Kinda moved around a lot.

238
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,458
Are you, like, a runaway?

239
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,708
Let's see, Criticrista.

240
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,416
Wait. Listen to this--

241
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,791
it says they're students at
Saint Midi Girls' Academy.

242
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,291
S'that a big deal or something?

243
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,583
[gasps] You mean you've
never heard of it, honey?

244
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,916
I know the font's weird,

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,583
but it's "Tsurezurenaru
Ayatsuri Mugenan"!

246
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,166
"Tsurezure"?

247
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,416
[CHUCHU]
Come to think of it,

248
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
a lot of things've been
strange about her.

249
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,958
That does it.

250
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,916
I'll get it straight from
the horse's mouth! I gotta!

251
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,041
Our best one yet!

252
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,416
Yeah, we nailed it!

253
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,041
Perfect, pyuru!

254
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,416
Ha. Yep, you bet.

255
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,166
Oh! Chuchu, weren't
you asking me

256
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,791
about a new
arrangement yesterday?

257
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,333
Yeah, what's up?

258
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,875
Hey, is something wrong?

259
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,875
Oh, no. It's all peachy.

260
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,291
[CHUCHU] How am I supposed
to bring this up?

261
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,375
[CHUCHU gasps]

262
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,166
[CYAN]
Hm?

263
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,333
[CHUCHU] If what I think
is actually true,

264
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,291
how can she act like
nothin's going on?

265
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:26,250
No matter what, I have to find
out the real story from her.

266
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,375
Cyan. I, uh--

267
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,958
I know, you guys!

268
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,583
I have the ultimate final idea!

269
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,708
It's gonna completely
blow your minds!

270
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,083
What if we sell tons of
new merch at the concert?

271
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,666
It'll keep the cattle happy
and coming back for more!

272
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,791
Genius, right?

273
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,791
[YAIBA]
Merch?

274
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,791
Surely you're not...

275
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,708
I'm sorry, Chuchu.
You were saying?

276
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:51,000
It's nothing. Pay it
no mind, sweetie.

277
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,583
I knew the situation
was serious.

278
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,208
But apparently, it's even
worse than we thought it was.

279
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:02,750
[MAPLE] Mm. We need to
plan our next move.

280
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,708
Ah! We found it.

281
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,750
[CYAN]
"Shizuku Secret Mind."

282
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,125
[CHUCHU] It looks like
we're sharing a room.

283
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,708
[gasps]

284
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,541

Splash, splash!

00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,875
[CORRIENTE laughing]
Ooh, it's so cold!

286
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,041
[CORRIENTE, WENDY laughing]

287
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:29,791
[WENDY]
Hey!

288
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,041
[CHUCHU]
Uh, pardon me.

289
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,125
[WENDY, CORRIENTE]
Uh?

290
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,666
Oh! Are you the
girls from Plasmagica?

291
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,041
My name's Corriente.

292
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,916
I play guitar in
Shizuku Secret Mind.

293
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,208
I'm Wendy, the lead singer.

294
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,625
Hi.

295
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:45,166
We look forward to performing
with you girls today.

296
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,791
[CORRIENTE] Here. Would you
like a bottle of this?

297
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,000
[RETOREE]
"Too Delicious Water"?

298
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,291
We always buy it cheap

299
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,000
with our employee discount
and bring some bottles

300
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,250
with us to shows.

301
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,500
Wait, what?

302
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,291
You have a job and you
have enough extra time

303
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,000
to play in a rock band?

304
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,500
Let me explain.

305
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,000
We're from Venicillin, also
called "the city of water."

306
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,125
So, because we've got
connections there,

307
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,958
we also sell mineral
water on the side

308
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,208
to make some extra money.

309
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,291
[CYAN]
Good idea!

310
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,458
Corriente is our
number one salesgirl.

311
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,875
She's killin' it!

312
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,708
[CORRIENTE giggles]

313
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,916
How cool!

314
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
[CORRIENTE]

Retoree!

Uh?

00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,541
