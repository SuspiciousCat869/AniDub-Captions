what will be our

161
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,416
Legend of Catchphrase.

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,791
Like for example:

163
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,125
"When pursuing the
cries of savage dragons

164
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,541
born of the ancient
flames of purgatory."

165
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,750
"Hence, we--!"

166
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,333
You're talking about
your Ryukenden, right?

167
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,833
You're so predictable.

168
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,583
[AION] How about:
"Spun from the dark evil,

169
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,083
but holy psalms."

170
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,208
[CROW] Black Monster, right?
You're just as bad as he is!

171
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,708
Ah! I don't know
why I brought it up

172
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,666
to you nitwits in
the first place.

173
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,958
Hey, Rom! You got
any ideas, man?

174
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,208
I'm busy organizing
receipts right now.

175
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,333
Don't talk to me.

176
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,291
Oh. The receipt thing?

177
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,541
Rom works for some company.

178
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,375
[CYAN]
He has a full-time job?

179
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,416
[MOA]
Yep! He wears two hats!

180
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,833
Wow.

181
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,625
Come on, Rom!
Blow that off for now.

182
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
Let's think of something
cool that'll blow

[ROM]
Shut up!

185
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,125
[groans]

186
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,875
Don't say that moron's
name around me!

187
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,416
What's your problem, Rom?

188
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,375
How many times do I have to
tell you never to touch my face?

189
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,750
Keep your trap shut!

190
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:48,833
Geez, Rom.

191
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,416
Your Legend of Violence
appears to be

192
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,875
even worse than usual.

193
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,041
This is ridiculous!

194
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,750
Who cares about catchphrases?

195
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,958
Who cares about dream
galaxy idol? It's all crap!

196
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,166
Isn't our way of
living our catchphrase?

197
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
Ever think about that?

198
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:06,416
[groans] Oh, Rom. I'm sorry
I ever doubted you.

199
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,375
You're the absolute best.

Hello? Yes, speaking.

Yes. Uh-huh. Yes. Yeah.

Yes! Yes! A million times yes!

Good news, SHINGANCRIMSONZ!

205
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:27,625
I found work for you
fine young gentlemen!

206
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,666
[CROW] Really? Awesome!
What kind of work?

207
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,500
[AION] Depending on what
this "work" may be,

the god may not
deign to descend.

True.

210
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,250
We shouldn't agree without
careful consideration.

211
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:36,791
Hence--

[CROW groans]

Come on! Don't leave
us hangin' here!

00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,875
Tell us about the job, Prez!

215
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,958
[MAPLE] You'll be the
opening act for Trichronika

00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,833
at tomorrow's concert
in Shibu Valley!

217
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,583
Isn't that wonderful?

218
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:47,666
Uh--

219
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,000
We're going to be
their opening act?

220
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,166
[MAPLE]
I was told the band

221
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,875
that was supposed
to go on all came down

222
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,416
with some kind of tummy-bug.

223
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,791
Too bad for them, but that means
that the job of pinch hitter

224
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,125
has suddenly fallen
into your laps!

225
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,541
Ha! I'm not interested
in being the opening act

226
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,708
for a bunch of
idol nimrods. Later.

[ANGELICA]
Oh, Rom!

228
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,000
Work is work.

229
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,666
You have to take everything one
step at a time in these matters.

230
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,291
Don't you agree?

231
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,291
All right! Fine! Whatever!
We'll do it! Are you happy?

00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,583
Yes. Good boy.

Now that that's settled,

let's make sure we go all out!
Show those boys a thing or two!

Overboard if you ask me.

Nothing out of the ordinary.

[MAPLE]
Oh! By the way, Cyan.

240
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:33,041
I was wondering...
Where exactly do you live?

00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,583
Where I live? Well, uh...

242

[MAPLE grunts]

243
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,916
All the rest of us
live in the dorm

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,333
in this lovely building.
It's totally fun!

245
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,416
If you wanted, you could
move in here too, Cyan!

246
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,125
Sound good?

247
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,500
That's a great idea!

248
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,625
Wow! You mean it?

00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,125
Yes, I'd love to,
if it's no trouble.

[CYAN sighs]
Yes! I'm saved.

251
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,500
Whereabouts were you
living before, anyway?

252
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,500
Huh? Everywhere.
Kinda moved around a lot.

253
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,875
Are you, like, a runaway?

254
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,666
No, it's nothing like that.

255
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,666
[CHUCHU] She doesn't seem
to wanna talk about it.

256
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,625
We shouldn't pry. It's
probably sad and complicated.

257
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,291
[MOA] Maybe she can't
reveal her true identity.

258
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:13,958
Could she be like me?

[RETOREE]
Dat awkward face, though.

[CHUCHU] Okay, Cyan.
This'll be your room.

261
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,791
You should mention
something to the president

00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,875
about getting more
furniture in here for you.

to join their band.

[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Sorry about leaving you alone

Yeah, you could say that.

I've felt alone plenty
of times in my life.

But it's different here.

about this crazy place, so...

00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,791
in Sound World, and
it's called, Midi City.

00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,833
Midi City?

296
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,375
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
A chaotic and cool music city.

297
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,958
This is where Myumons,
musical beings like us, live.

298
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,375
Everything in this place

299
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,541
revolves around music,
and all Myumons love music.

300
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,291
[CYAN]
Oh, really?

301
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,333
Um, I was also wondering why
I have these things on me.

302
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,208
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Because you've become a Myumon!

303
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,583
Huh?

304
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,916
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Don't worry.

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,500
It's just your temporary
form while in this world.

306
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,791
When it's time for Myumons

307
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,958
to perform, they can
transform into bodies

308
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:24,083
designed for that
specific purpose.

309
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,791
[CYAN gasps]

310
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,333
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Dig it: the stone that shines

311
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:31,208
in your chest? That is what is
known as a Melodisian stone.

312
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:34,708
It contains the sound energy
hidden within all living beings

313
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,666
in this world.

314
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,166
With excellent music,

315
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,250
it resonates with the
audience and becomes

316
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,208
a crystal of high fidelity.

317
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,291

[KAI, RIKU]
You bet, Shuzo! Let's go!

473
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,916
[laughs] Didja see that?

474
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,875
Those cattle are
ready to be shipped!

475
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,041
Hey, SHINGAN!

476
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,791
Thanks so much for
being our opening act!

477
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
We appreciate you!

478
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,458
What did you say?

479
00:20:56,541 --> 00:21:00,250
After that glorious crescendo,
you think you can just--

480
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,250
Hey, Rom! Take it easy!
Don't do anything stupid!

481
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,916
[SHUZO]
Hm?

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,500
We warmed up the
crowd for ya, buddy.

483
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,500
[AION]
That we did.

484
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,958
Hence.

485
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,208
Kai, Riku, let's go!

486
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,625
[KAI, RIKU]
Sure thing!

487
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:31,416
[CROWD shouting]

488
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,791
[MAPLE]
Oh, goodness me!

489
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,041
That was wonderful work, boys!

490
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,500
I believe I was the
popular one today.

491
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,041
[AION] Bantam dwarf, the stares
aimed in your direction

492
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,708
were little more than
dust compared to those

493
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,875
lauded at me, the black monster.

494
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,541
[YAIBA] There was no
greater applause tonight

495
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,208
than that which was for
my Ryukenden Dragon Sword.

496
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,791
[CYAN]
Hey, everyone!

497
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,208
Uh.

498
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,666
I wanted to say, when you
asked me to join the band,

499
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,041
I, uh, it made me
really happy. So, uh...

500
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,541
Thank you all so very much!

501
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,250
[ROSIA]
Hmmm.

502
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,291
So that's Plasmagica?

503
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,416
[MAPLE] That band is
making its appearance

504
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,666
in the next episode!

505
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,125
[CHUCHU] Huh? What do
you mean, "that band"?

506
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:52,375
[MAPLE]
An MG band!

507
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,166
You know, Middle
school Girls! Yay!

508
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,958
[CHUCHU] President, you're
a little too excited

509
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,875
about this and it's creepy.

510
00:23:58,958 --> 00:23:59,958
[MAPLE laughing]

511
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,208
[CHUCHU]
Ugh.
