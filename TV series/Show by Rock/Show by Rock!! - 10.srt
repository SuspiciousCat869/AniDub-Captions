this is just the starting line;
we've got a long way to go.

Yup, that's my one-and-only
target. No... bulls-eye.

I will do anything
to achieve that,

and I mean anything.
No matter what it costs.

Even if it means using my

That's right.
Nothing will stop me.

I won't hesitate.

That being the case,

[STRAWBERRY HEART]
And... If my hunch is correct,

82
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,416
he'll take advantage
of the confusion

83

and turn the Melodisians of
the audience into dark stones.

I've already told you, remember?

There's only one way to
completely defeat Dagger

for good. And that
is through music.

of Unicorn Virtual Music,

organizers of the festival.

In fact, he's been involved
from the very beginning.

95

His plan has always
been to use the festival

as a means to further
his own ambition.

[STRAWBERRY HEART] The real
goal Dagger has in all of this

is to gather the top musicians
and bring them over to his side.

There's a new dilemma
with his contract.

him to write a new song

for the upcoming festival.

Up until now,

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,250
Yes. There's a reason
Dagger has his eye on her.

159
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
She's a threat to him.

160
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,250
Her Melodisian is quickly
growing stronger.

161
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,291
Even so, when it
comes down to it,

162
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,000
she still may not be successful,

163
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,333
not against a song
by Grateful King.

164
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,708
[DARUDAYU] So then,
in summary, you'd like me

165
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,666
to lend my strength
to assist in this matter?

166
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,958
Yes.

167
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,833
Initially, I wanted to go
with the flow of this world,

168
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,875
to embrace the tide and let
whatever happens to simply be.

[sighs] But I cannot
overlook these circumstances.

170
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,458
Those who defy tyranny
should not go at it alone.

171
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:27,000
A! Un! Gather up what is
needed and follow me.

172
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,000
Of course, Master.
Without question.

We will stand by your
side wherever you go.

What happened?
Something's wrong.

This is not how
it's supposed to be.

Hey, Grateful King.

What did I do wrong?

00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,625
Won't you please tell me?

Sorry, girls. Like I said.

It's something
I can't reschedule,

so I'll just have
to miss practice.

you out of the blue.

you stood out and
shone remarkably.

[DAGGER] Welcome to Unicorn
Virtual Music, Miss Chuchu.

213
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,041
[DAGGER] Your performance during
the concert the other day

214
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,333
was quite wonderful.

215

And that's not all.

216
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,125
From what I see,
you have more ambition

217
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,041
than anyone else in this world.

[DAGGER chuckles] You want to
outshine everyone, don't you?

221
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,125
You want the audience to
look only at you, don't you?

It's not true, I--!

[DAGGER]
Come work for me, immediately.

224
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:38,583
If you do, you will be the
center of everyone's attention.

225
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,583
You're wasting so
much effort, Chuchu.

226
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,916
Why on earth are you so
hung up about that band?

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,291
[CHUCHU gasps]

228
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:51,125
Plasmagica is nothing more
than a stepping stone.

But--!

Look! There it is!

233
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,416
[CHUCHU]
I remember the first time

234
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,708
I went to S-River concert hall.

235
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,791
I watched a performance
by The Great,

236
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,750
a band as incredible
as their name implied.

237
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,541
[CHUCHU] I can recall
the concert I experienced

238
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,500
as clearly as if
it were yesterday.

00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,041
[CROWD]
Grateful King! Grateful King!

240
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,541
[CHUCHU] The amazing performance
that stole everyone's hearts

241
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,958
and refused to let go.

242
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,083
All those eyes,
focused solely on him,

243
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,791
chanting his name.

244
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,375
[CHUCHU] If I could give
a performance as incredible

245
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:42,166
as that one, then everyone
would look at me and only me.

246
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,625
It would be a dream come true!

247
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,250
[CHUCHU] Before that,
music was just something

248
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,750
I enjoyed listening to.

249
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,291
But ever since that
day, it became more.

250
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,791
I wanted people to notice me

251
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,291
because of my talent
and performance.

252
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,916
[CHUCHU] Eventually, I saved
up enough of my allowance

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,875
to buy a guitar.

254
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,125
I soon learned it'd be
easier to get noticed

255
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,166
playing in a band
than it would be solo

256
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,125
'cause it was more
of a spectacle.

257

Banded Rocking Records?

00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,375
Mister Maple Arisugawa?

261
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,125
[MAPLE]
Mm-hm.

262
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,666
[CHUCHU] It was a small indie
label I'd never heard of.

263
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,875
But I thought of it as the first
step toward achieving my goal.

264
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,750
[CHUCHU]
What am I thinking?

265
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,041
I can't let it
end here, like this.

266
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,875
The band was supposed
to be a stepping stone

267
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,833
for me and nothing more.

268
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,250
[CHUCHU] And even at that
moment, I thought to myself,

269
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,166
"If we can get this
girl to join our band,

270
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,208
Plasmagica will
definitely be noticed."

271
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,541
With that much attention,

272
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,458
everyone would focus
their eyes on me,

273
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,625
just like they did on Grateful
King all those years ago.

274
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,875
And when that happened...

275
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,041
I'd be able to leave
Plasmagica behind

276
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,208
and take off on a
magnificent solo career!

277
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,041
Yes. In order to make
my dreams come true,

278
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,625
I will do anything.
No matter what it may cost me.

279
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,083
[DAGGER]
Welcome, dear Chuchu.

00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,541

It appears as though you've
already made up your mind.

284
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,541
That's right. I have.

285
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,708
I've decided to quit
Plasmagica and go solo.

286
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:41,000
[DAGGER]
Hm... A wise decision, Chuchu.

287
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,708
My, my. I wonder what dear
little Cyan will think of that.

288
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,291
Ah! So that's
what you're up to!

289
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,666
You're trying to use Chuchu

290
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,041
to make Cyan fall into
despair and sadness!

291
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,666
[DAGGER] If Cyan's
quickly-evolving Melodisian

292
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,500
were to suddenly become dark,

293
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,958
I wonder how much
power it would have.

294
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,125
Oh, the possibilities.
I can't begin to imagine.

295
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,416
Dammit! [growls]

possess Strawberry Heart again?

[gasps]
How'd you know about that?

298
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:15,000
[DAGGER] Come now, did you
really think I hadn't noticed?

299
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,000
Then again, you've just
about reached your limit

300
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,750
with that little
bit of trickery.

301
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,458
If you carry on doing that,

302
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,041
you'll be putting
yourself in danger.

303
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,958
Aw... I'm moved that you
worry about me like that,

304
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,333
really, I'm touched.

305
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,833
[DAGGER]
Don't get cocky.

306
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,208
You're not the one I
need in this scenario.

307
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,750
I only need your song.
Remember that.

308
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,166
[GRATEFUL KING grunts]

309
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,833
[DAGGER]
Now, Chuchu. Go.

310
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,083
Make your dreams and
ambitions come true

311
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,750
by betraying your friends.

312
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:45,750
Send them spiraling into
the depths of despair.

313
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,041
Yes, sir.

314
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,791
[GRATEFUL KING gasps]
Chuchu! No, you can't!

315
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,625
[DAGGER] Howl as much as
you want, Grateful King.

316
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,625
There is nothing you can do.

317
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,333
[GRATEFUL KING growling]

318
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:03,666
[DAGGER laughing]

319
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,583
[MOA]
Whoa, this new snack is amazing!

320
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,041
--I wanna eat it forever!
--[RETOREE] I know, right?

321
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,333
Welcome back, Chuchu!

322
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,625
Wow, that was fast.

323
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,541
You've got a good nose, Chuchu!

324
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,708
We were just starting to
dive into these yummies!

325
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,666
What's wrong?

326
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,458
I came to say that
I'm quitting Plasmagica.

327
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:27,708
[ALL gasp]

328
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:29,500
You're what? But why?

329
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,750
Wait, what are you saying here?

330
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,916
This joke isn't very funny.
You're kidding, right?

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,750
I've decided to join
Unicorn Virtual Music.

332
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,958
They'll help my real
dreams come true.

333
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,000
Wha--?

334
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,625
It's simply time.

335
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,208
My goal was always
to have a solo career.

336
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,750
Plasmagica was never more
than a means to an end

337
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,625
for getting me there.

338
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,458
No way.

339
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,208
This is where we
part ways, everyone.

340
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,750
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Stop her, momma!

341
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,625
Don't let Chuchu leave!

342
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,583
Let go. I've made
up my mind, Moa.

343
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:07,375
I won't! You're staying!

344
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,541
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
She's not herself!

345
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,916
Dagger brainwashed her!

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,375
Huh? Dagger? [gasps]

347
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:19,666
You two need to get out
of my way right now!

348
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,041
--[CYAN] Chuchu!
--[ALL gasp]

349
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,791
[CYAN]
Recognize this?

350
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,125
It's a song you wrote for
Plasmagica! Listen carefully!

351
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,416
[CHUCHU groans]

352
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,791
What's happening?
Stop all that noise!

353
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,083
We'd never hold you back
from what you really wanted.

354
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,625
Even a solo career!

355
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,000
[CHUCHU groans]

356
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,666
But be honest with yourself.

357
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,125
Is Plasmagica really
a stepping stone?

358
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,625
[CHUCHU groans]

359
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:59,541
Chuchu! There's no
way that's true!

360
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,291
Chuchu.

361
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,083
Chuchu!

362
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:08,458
[CHUCHU whimpers]

363
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,291
[CHUCHU gasps]

364
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,000
Chuchu!

365
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:39,333
[CHUCHU] Whatever I first
thought, it's not the same.

366
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,750
Plasmagica is not
a stepping stone!

367
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,166
[CHUCHU pants]

368
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,208
[sighs]
What happened?

369
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,875
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
It was Dagger.

370
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:58,791
He was-- He was using you.

371
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,833
He wanted to cause
a rift in the band.

372
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,708
To make Cyan's
Melodisian turn dark.

373
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,458
[STRAWBERRY HEART]
Glad we weren't too late.

374
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,625
I see.

375
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,708
What a relief!

376
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,750
Seems like your
brainwashing's all gone!

377
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,375
That was shocking in a lame way.
"Stepping stones," huh?

378
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,125
I'm sorry, but...

379
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,458
[RETOREE gasps]

380
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:26,500
That part was true.
I honestly... felt that way.

381
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,833
And I'm really, really sorry!

382
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,500
Everything, all
I've done with you,

383
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,958
I really did see it as
just a stepping stone.

384
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,625
The song writing
and playing together

385
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,666
was completely to
serve my ambitions.

386
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,250
To make my own dreams come
true, no matter the cost.

387
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,750
Having Cyan write
that beautiful song

388
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,500
and suggesting we sing
twin lead vocals together.

389
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,833
It was all so Plasmagica could
become more popular and-- 

390
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,333
So that I could get noticed
and be loved by everyone!

391
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,625
It was all for my own
selfish reasons!

392
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,541
Come on. It all turned out okay.

393
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,291
[CHUCHU gasps]

394
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,916
Sure did! Think about it.

395
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,458
Everything you did
helped Plasmagica, too!

396
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,166
And besides, if it was
up to the three of us,

397
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,875
we might not have been able
to keep this band going.

398
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,833
It's true! The fact that
we've made it this far

399
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,166
is all thanks to you!

400
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,291
Yeah, you bet!

401
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,541
Don't put it like
that; it sounds bad!

402
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,041
We wouldn't be very interesting
if we didn't have at least one

403
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,625
slightly evil
character in the band!

404
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,666
[CHUCHU gasps, sighs]

405
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,708
[MOA giggles]
She's right on that one!

406
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,166
[CYAN giggles]

407
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,916
Whatever your ambitions,
do you really want to

408
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,291
leave Plasmagica
at this very moment?

409
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,916
[CHUCHU gasps]

410
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:52,083
Let me answer that question
and be perfectly clear.

411
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,833
I have no intention of doin' so!

412
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:55,833
I'm so glad!

413
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,833
[MOA giggles]

414
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,250
Ahem! Right. It's settled.
So let's practice!

415
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,166
Let's do it!

416
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,750
Hey. Thanks for your help.

417
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:14,375
Huh? Mister Berry?

418
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,750
[MAPLE]
Too bright! Oh! It's Shuzo!

419
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,250
[SHUZO] I can only shine
thanks to all my fans!

420
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,041
My brilliant singing
voice reflects off

421
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,958
the mirrors of their hearts,
and that reflection

422
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,791
makes it sparkle even more!

423
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,791
Your reflection
is extraordinary!

424
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,583
[MAPLE]
You mean EGG-straordinary?

425
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,791
Served! With bacon!
