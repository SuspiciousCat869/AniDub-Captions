when you bite it?

what I wanted! It's raw!"

the foil off excitedly.

And you take a big bite,
thinking you're about

sweet chocolate.

Swanky, right?

319
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,666
[ANGELICA]
Here you go.

320
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,083
I'm Angelica.

321
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,458
Maple's secretary and
the band manager here.

322
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,875
Nice to meet you.

323
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,875
Yes. Likewise.

324
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,250
[ANGELICA]
Make yourself at home.

325
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,125
[MAPLE] Let me get
straight to the point.

326
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,208
You're not affiliated with
another agency, are you?

327
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,166
Uh, no. But...

328
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,875
There are many I'd like to
join, since I love playing.

329
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,333
It's my dream.

330
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,166
It's just been kinda hard
to get my foot in the door.

331
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,958
Um, you know what I mean?

332
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,416
[MAPLE] I can't believe
a person with your

333
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,916
incredible talent
can't get a contract.

334
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,166
Oh, I wasn't talking about
getting a record contract

335
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,791
or anything major.

336
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,666
All I have to do is
turn in my application

337
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,625
to join a club,
but I just can't do it.

338
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,625
[MAPLE]
Eureka! Problem solved then!

339
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:23,916
What do you say?

340
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,791
Wanna be the newest
member of the BRR family?

341
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,791
Well, I'm thinking.

342
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,916
[MAPLE] True, I know we look
like small potatoes right now,

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,583
but we're about to blow up,
and I have no intention

344
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,750
of letting you walk out
of here without a fight.

345
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,375
In addition to Plasmagica here,

346
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,125
we've got another group
full of rowdy boys

347
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,958
to add variety to the mix.

348
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,583
I believe using these two bands

349
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,625
as cornerstones of
BRR will be our way

350
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,541
to give fantastic music to
everyone around the world.

351
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,458
The future will be
nothing but sunshine!

352
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,416
Now, come to the stage
of dreams! Please!

353
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,875
[ANGELICA]

355

Ah!

356
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,291
Now, now, don't worry.

357
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,958
This'll be a cinch for you.

358
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,583
With your incredible
guitar skills,

359
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,750
you're unbeatable
by any standard.

360
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,333
Let's level up.

361
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,458
We all wanna sound as good as
we can, and have been thinking

362
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,958
about getting another guitarist.
Help make us crackerjack!

363
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,916
So if you're not
in another one, yet,

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,583
and you want to play,
come join our band.

365
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,500
[gasps] Can't believe it.

366
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,083
I've been wanting to hear
those exact words forever,

367
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,291
and I just heard them!

368
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:37,291
Joining a band...
It's my dream come true.

369
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,750
If you don't want to, it's cool.

370
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,333
No, wait. I do want to
join your band, meow!

371
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,333
--[echoing] Meow, meow, meow...
--[gasps]

372
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,625
I can't wait for it! I'd be
honored to play with you!

373
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,833
[MAPLE]
I'd call that closing a deal.

374
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,333
[CHUCHU]
Yay, this'll be so fun!

375
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:55,750
[MOA] Now there's even more
magic in Plasmagica! Pyuru!

376
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,166
[CYAN] But wait. I still
have so many questions.

377
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:04,125
Where in the world am I, anyway?
And also, why am I even here?

378
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,000
What, to do?

379
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,875
[CYAN]
Oh, well. I'm in!

380
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,000
[DAGGER]
You failed?

381
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,333
[OGASAWARA]
My apologies.

382
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,041
There were some
unforeseen circumstances.

383
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,000
[DAGGER] Small mistakes can
lead to giant failures.

384
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,583
Consider this your last chance.

385
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,916
[OGASAWARA]
Yes, sir!

386
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:34,958
[DAGGER] Grateful King,
have you finished the song?

387
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,666
[DAGGER]
Hm. I see.

388
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,833
Then you will not leave that
room until it is completed.

389
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,916
And may I remind you,
this exclusive contract

390
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,291
with Unicorn Virtual Music is
precisely what you asked for.

391
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,083
If you do not release
an album every year,

392
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,125
you will pay a hefty fine
for breach of contract.

393
00:20:56,208 --> 00:21:00,041
Your stubbornness is
growing quite irksome.

394
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:03,833
I intend to gain control
over Sound World.

395
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,500
No, over the Sound Cosmos
in the very near future,

396
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,458
mark my words.

397
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,125
To do so, I need
an incomparable song

398
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,875
written by a
legendary guitarist,

399
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,791
who happens to be you.

400
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,708
On that note,
I've found a musician

401
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,416
who will be able to play
your piece perfectly.

402
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,875
There was some
difficulty, however,

403
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,583
and the player has
not yet arrived.
