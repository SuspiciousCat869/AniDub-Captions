00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,125
[HOLMY]
All right, girls!

2
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,583
Battle of the bands
is this weekend.

3
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:00,666
Even though we beat Plasmagica
in the last competition,

4
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,833
we still can't let our
guard down, y'know?

5
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,333
You're totes right.

6
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,916
I mean, in battles, challengers
usually have a major edge

7
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,375
over the defending champs,

8
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,083
and you can't even turn your
back on them for a second

9
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,208
or you're gonna
get spanked, Fool!

10
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,500
[TSUKINO]
Mm.

11
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,875
Yeah, it's like the
strawberry daifuku defend,

12
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,416
and the melon daifuku are
launching a super-attack on 'em!

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,458
I'm starving. Let's eat!

14
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,833
Yup, melon daifuku
are so yummier!

15
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,833
Right? I know.

16
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,958
Hm? Hey, you knock that off!

17
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,500
You're being really negative!

18
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,833
It almost sounds like you're
expecting us to lose this thing,

19
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,333
and I don't want to hear it!

20
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,666
[JACKLYN]
Chill, Rosia!

21
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,500
We're only trying not to
get our hopes up too much,

22
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,291
just in case, okay?

23
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,333
[ROSIA growls]

24
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,750
No! Please turn that off!
Just stop it!

25
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,833
You're gonna make me dry
up like a wrinkly old lady!

26
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,500
[JACKLYN]
We can't win.

27
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,958
There's no chance
we'll come out on top.

28
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,041
They're gonna knock us out cold.

29
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:00,875
[JACKLYN gasps]

30
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,791
Don't do that again, Rosia.

31
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,125
If Jacklyn's skin dries out,

32
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,375
she falls into a
way major depression!

33
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,083
Hmph! Well, her bad attitude
was depressing me.

34
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,166
I get it.

35
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,916
But dude, Plasmagica's
hungry for real,

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,541
and they'll be looking
for revenge, girl!

37
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,000
The strawberry daifuku
isn't just sitting around.

38
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,250
It's become a stronger
strawberry cream one,

39
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,708
so it can defeat
the melon daifuku.

40
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,208
Yup, it's still delicious!

41
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,583
Right, totally!

42
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,291
I agree, too.
That's why, today...

43
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,750
We have to make sure
we prevent them

44
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,333
from winning the battle.

45
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,333
[GROUP gasps]

46
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,166
Like totally for sure!

47
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,708
Now don't you worry girls,
it's a done deal!

48
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,416
Everyone's eyes'll be
glued to my shining light!

49
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,041
Just like always, we can't lose!

50
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,125
[TSUKINO, JACKLYN]
Mm...

51
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,125
[HOLMY]
I-I guess you're right.

52
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,291
[GRATEFUL KING]
Yo!

53
00:03:56,625 --> 00:04:00,416
[GRATEFUL KING]
S'up, Kingpin, you copy? Hey!

54
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,541
[DAGGER]
Well, well, this is a new twist.

55
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,958
You're actually
reaching out to me.

56
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,333
[GRATEFUL KING]
Yeah, I can't believe it either.

57
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,666
[DAGGER]
Indeed.

58
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,125
Then clearly you must have
arrived at wit's end.

59
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,375
[GRATEFUL KING]
Not really.

60
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,000
I just have a little of
the old writers' block.

61
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,208
I thought I'd talk to
someone besides myself

62
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,458
for a change of pace.

63
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:22,583
[DAGGER]
Writer's block, eh?

64
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,666
Then you've finally
decided to start putting

65
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,875
pen to paper again.
How delightful to hear.

66
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,500
[GRATEFUL KING laughs]
I'm just here to make you happy.

67
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,250
[DAGGER] That's cute.
Such admirable words.

68
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,500
You flatter me.

69
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,291
I thought you'd reply
with your usual sarcasm.

70
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,750
Would it be clearer if I used
more abusive language?

71
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,791
[GRATEFUL KING] Being cooped
up in such a small space

72
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,833
is making me tired and cranky.

73
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,958
It's cramping my style, man.

74
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,041
How about it?

75
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,583
Can you let me out
of this box soon?

76
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,291
[DAGGER]
That all depends on you.

77
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,583
That is, if you
understand my meaning.

78
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,500
I, too, am growing rather weary
of this ongoing battle of wills.

79
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,750
[GRATEFUL KING]
Uh...

80
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,750
Oh, yeah? What exactly
are you trying to say?

81
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,625
[DAGGER] The festival
is rapidly drawing near.

82
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,708
Bands who have
flocked to Midi City

83
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,083
in pursuit of success
and their dreams

84
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,958

in this esteemed arena.

85
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,916
I have no greater
chance than this one.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,291
[GRATEFUL KING] So what's
the actual endgame here?

87
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:28,250
[DAGGER] Hm... I've made you
well aware of my intentions.

88
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:32,000
My primary objective is to
gather the best talent possible

89
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,416
for my stable.

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,625
Then, I will be the undisputed
ruler of Sound World.

91
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,583
[GRATEFUL KING chuckles] You'll
have to work at that a little.

92
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,375
You're not exactly
Mister Popularity.

93
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,625
[DAGGER]
Do you think I care?

94
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,583
Their opinions are of
absolutely no relevance.

95
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
They will quickly discover that,

96
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:54,416
and eventually have no choice
but to surrender to me.

98
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,041
It's sounding good!

better all the time!

with the defeated Plasmagica!

at us about something?

[CHUCHU]
Yes, right. That makes sense.

definitely do this.

they seem to be headed here,

their tails off, aren't they?

Indeed. However...

You're right, as usual.

Shall we seek that
dignitary's counsel now?

Hmm... I suppose it's time to.

not only by fans at the concert,
