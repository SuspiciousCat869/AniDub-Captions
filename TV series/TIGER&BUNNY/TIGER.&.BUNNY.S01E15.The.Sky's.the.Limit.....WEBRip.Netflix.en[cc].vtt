00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

he worked twice as hard as we did.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.903 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

[Barnaby] What do you want? Why did
you program her to kill heroes?

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:27.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
