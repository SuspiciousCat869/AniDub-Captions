You can't argue with the truth.
Your exploits are history now.

31
00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:32.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, It's amazing that Barnaby

32
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

37
00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:46.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It' is frustrating that
her capture wasn't helpful.

38
00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
For starters, I still don't know why she

everything he's gone through recently...

41
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he's been able
to keep his focus.

42
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:05.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thanks, but I couldn't have achieved
any of this without your support, Tiger.

43
00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No! It was your hard
work, Bunny!

44
00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:09.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was you, Tiger.
Really!

45
00:04:09.358 --> 00:04:10.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

the credit.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

fighting when they started out together?

53
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Dragon Kid] Yeah,
Barnaby kept calling Tiger an old man.

54
00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:32.856 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty sure it wasn't a joke.

55
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think he did that to get back
at Tiger for calling him 'Bunny',

56
00:04:36.067 --> 00:04:37.277 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
which he really hated.

57
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now he seems to have
gotten used to it.

58
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:42.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

61
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Nothing's bugging me--

62
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.810 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're just bummed out
'cause your ranking dropped, aren't you?

63
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

64
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.085 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Tiger 'cause he's been so busy lately...

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only reason I'm here is to teach you,
you know.

103
00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right. Sorry about that.
But we're here now and ready to learn!

104
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just follow my lead and
you both should be fine.

105
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you guys have
any dance experience?

106
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you worry, I have a few moves
in my repertoire...

107
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:49.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

108

109
00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh...

110
00:06:55.457 --> 00:07:00.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[imitating robot]

111
00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:04.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wow. You suck. You're really awful.

112
00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, you finally
smiled.

113
00:07:06.301 --> 00:07:10.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasping]
Hurry up and go get dressed.

114
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no! My note!
It's gone!

115
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the big deal?
What are you freaking out about?

116
00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:19.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't get it!
My boyfriend wrote that note for me!

117
00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Didn't you say it just gave directions
on where to meet him?

118
00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:26.237 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not important what it says. I wanna
keep everything from someone I like!

119
00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:28.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it's in
your bag.

120
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you help us look for
my note, Karina?

121
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, are you
listening?

122
00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.539 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I wonder if this is
because I'm... in love.

123
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[both] What?
-Wait, you've fallen in love with someone?

124
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not exactly sure about that.
There is this guy who's on my mind a lot.

125
00:07:44.923 --> 00:07:47.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I find myself staring at
him when he's around.

126
00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, it sounds like
you totally love him!

127
00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know. The truth is,
I don't even know why I like him.

128
00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:59.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He doesn't seem to notice me
and he's incredibly rude.

129
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>Oh, not to mention,</i>
<i>he's incredibly irresponsible.</i>

130
00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:07.779 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>And, to top it off, he</i>
<i>can be incredibly goofy!</i>

131
00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:11.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[screams]
That was my favorite towel!

132
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, he sounds like
a total loser!

133
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you may be right.
But I can't get him out of my mind.

134
00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hold on. That's not love.

135
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:20.701 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

136
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't keep your eyes off him
because he's such a klutz!

137
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.755 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're worried about what
he's gonna end up doing.

138
00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right. There's no way in the world
I'd fall for a guy like that.

139
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:32.887 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there is one little
thing that worries me.

140
00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

141
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:37.600 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A lot of times, he ends up calling me
by a nickname.

142
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:38.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really?

143
00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:42.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Blue Rose!
How ya doin'?

144
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:45.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't care much when
other co-workers use it,

145
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but when he's around,
I want him to call me by my real name.

146
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Doesn't that mean
I'm in love?

147
00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, that's definitely
love in my book!

148
00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:54.534 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-That's not love either!
-[both] Huh?

149
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, Karina. That just means
you don't like your nickname that much.

150
00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:02.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh yeah. I see. You must be right.

151
00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why are you being so harsh to her, Jane?

152
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean,
she's obviously in love with the guy.

153
00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I can hear
it in her voice.

154
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasping]
Then what are you doing?

155
00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're not trying to ruin it
because you're jealous or something!

156
00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Nothing of the sort.

157
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I've seen her
in this kind of situation.

158
00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she worries too much about it,
she's sure to screw it up.

159
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They must be right.
I guess this isn't love.

160
00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:32.280 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

161
00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:35.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Da-da-da-da! You
were off by a beat.

162
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? I was?

163
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to get it right.
It's our last practice session.

164
00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, how 'bout we
take a little break?

165
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you talking about?
You need to work on this 'til you get it!

166
00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:49.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't have a breakthrough...
without taking a break!

167
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[laughing]
I kill me.

168
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.093 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is wrong
with that man?

169
00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:55.386 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to say I've
thought the same thing.

170
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What? You've made that
same lame joke about taking a break?

171
00:09:58.598 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You misunderstood.

172
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:02.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I meant that, in the past, I've wondered
what was wrong with him as well.

173
00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:03.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, right.

174
00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:07.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But... after working with
him, I came to realize...

175
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's different. He's the kind of guy
who thinks about the needs of others

176
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
before he thinks about himself.

177
00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:15.156 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Like taking this break.

178
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.618 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure he decided to do
it so we wouldn't get tired of practice.

179
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You sure about that?
Because that's not the way I see it.

180
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No need to worry. He'll be ready
by the time the concert begins.

181
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Once he commits, he'll
never let you down.

182
00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:31.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know,
you really have changed.

183
00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a short break.

184
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Before I forget,
here, Blue Rose.

185
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:38.304 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is for you.

186
00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:39.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh? What's this?

187
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:43.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I kinda ruined your towel,
if you remember. So here.

188
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait, you bought
this for me?

189
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You sure she'll be comfortable
with that towel?

190
00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:56.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Of course she
will, right?

191
00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:01.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? Well, if you're asking whether or not
I like the thing, I kinda don't...

192
00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, uh...

193
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.166 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't have another towel,
so I'll use it.

194
00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't really have a choice.

195
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the spirit.

196
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I am sorry I
wrecked your towel.

197
00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's all right, really.

198
00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Um, I think I'll take a break!

199
00:11:19.053 --> 00:11:20.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait!

200
00:11:20.847 --> 00:11:21.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm?

201
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you happen to
be free tonight?

202
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasping]

203
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:37.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
...Five, six, seven,
eight. Da-da-da-don...

204
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All right! I finally got it!

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:17.680 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

320
00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

321
00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute,
I've seen that guy.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:42.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

326
00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:46.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're the backstage
thief?

327
00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

328
00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:49.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

329
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:51.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

330
00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:52.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

331
00:18:52.506 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the day of that event, I discovered
backstage security was pretty light.

332
00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:58.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't help it, I
had to take a souvenir.

333
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, so it's our fault
you have sticky fingers?

334
00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Quit blaming us for
your behavior!

335
00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll never understand my feelings,
you get to see Blue Rose all the time!

336
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I understand you're
a crazy stalker!

337
00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ahhhh! Wait, a minute,
what the hell was that?

338
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.865 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.998 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

What's going on?

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:34.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was pretty scary.
What's happening to me?

344
00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:38.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

345
00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:40.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're gonna mess around,
you better let me handle this.

346
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:42.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, you don't understand.
I'm amazing today!

347
00:19:42.754 --> 00:19:44.767 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
For some reason, I'm stronger than usual!

348
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right.

349
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have a minute left,
I'll catch that sneaky jerk, no sweat.

350
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:52.650 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:54.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

not goin' anywhere!

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:12.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Why the glitch? I
still have time.

360
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:25.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:00.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

very timely.

00:21:00.634 --> 00:21:02.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To tell you the truth,
we were gonna let you go

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:04.305 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
if you continued to do poorly.

00:21:06.724 --> 00:21:10.311 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No worries. Looks like you still have
what it takes to get the job done.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:14.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

378
00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:17.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what made my power run out?

379
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.863 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, there you were,
being kind as always, Kotetsu.

380
00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

381
00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:24.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Acting as though your power ran out?
That was great.

382
00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:25.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

depressed,

384
00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

exactly how to handle this one.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:36.462 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure you could've
easily made the arrest.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's right. And on top of that,
you got this back for me.

389
00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:41.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:21:41.592 --> 00:21:44.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But... I hope you don't make a
habit of being unselfish.

391
00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

I'm, uh... I'll treasure this forever,
all right?
