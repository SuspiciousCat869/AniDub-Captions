That girl Kriem, who was

[Wild Tiger chuckling]
Check out how young I looked.

12
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hadn't decided what
kind of a hero I wanted to be.

13
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Argh! This is really not the time to be
doing this!

16
00:01:10.112 --> 00:01:11.405 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alright.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Bunny, there's something
I have to tell you.

18
00:02:51.088 --> 00:02:54.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry... But due to
events beyond my control...

19
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I've decided to retire.

20
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:07.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, wait. I wonder if Bunny's gonna ask
what those events are?

22
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What do I say?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tiger, you're back!
It's great to see you!

25
00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You took off so suddenly,
we were worried about you!

26
00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah... Sorry.

27
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was only a few days,
but something didn't feel right about it.

28
00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.247 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have to agree.

29
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But you're back now, and
that's a reason to celebrate.

30
00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So welcome. And welcome again!

31
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's good to
be back.

32
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.006 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, come on, what's everyone getting
so excited about?

33
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

34
00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:38.844 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, you really didn't have to
come back if you didn't want to.

35
00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:43.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why doesn't everyone admit it?
It felt nice having one less rival.

36
00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.558 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the point of lying
like that?

37
00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?
-Well, if I'm not mistaken,

38
00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you missed Mr. Wild more
than any of us.

39
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh-- no I didn't.

40
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:54.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, she did. [impersonating voice]
"When is Tiger gonna come back?"

41
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She asked me that every
single day.

42
00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Yep, she asked me the same thing.
-Me, too.

43
00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well... I... I was
worried.

44
00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Welcome back.
-[Fire Emblem] Hmm...

45
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:16.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't imagine what's
making her act like that. Hm?

46
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Hmm.

47
00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.053 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, her reaction does show
just how much we missed you.

48
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now that you're back,
everything's gonna be golden.

49
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right...

50
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:29.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, by the way,
anybody seen Bunny?

51
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:30.270 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Hm?

52
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>So, what's happening?</i>

53
00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:35.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Have you told everybody</i>

54
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] I... haven't found the right time
to bring up the subject.

55
00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Wild Tiger's mother] <i>Oh, good heavens!</i>
<i>What are you waiting for?!</i>

56
00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] Well, I wanted to tell my partner
first, but he hasn't been around.

57
00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger's mother] <i>Are you sure you can do</i>
<i>this, Kotetsu?</i>

58

<i>The longer you wait, the harder</i>

59
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.209 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry, I'm sure the opportunity
will come up soon.

60
00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As a matter of fact... I
heard Bunny's in a pretty good mood.

61
00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A key suspect is finally talking.
<i>-Oh?</i>

62
00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right. And after that,
I'm gonna tell him.

63
00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, whatever works.
But please, son, don't drag your feet.

64
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We need you back here
as soon as possible.

65
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:11.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've been having a tough time.
Kaede's powers are running wild!

66
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:12.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

67
00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She's been breaking
everything in the house.

68
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm telling you, it's
complete chaos!

69
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tiger] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

71
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I remember. You
had the same problem.

72
00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:29.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[gasps] Okay! That's it!
I'm sick of this--

73
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.458 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! My kitchen table!

74
00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If she keeps this up, I'm afraid she's
going to bring the whole house down!

75
00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, hurry up, will you?!

76
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:40.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alright, already!

77
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll resign and get back there
just as soon as I can. [sighs]

78
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.278 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, coffee,
Bunny?

79
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kotetsu, you
just get back?

80
00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:05.198 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

81
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's up? Have you been able to get in
and talk to Kriem yet?

82
00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.079 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not yet.

83
00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
After she heard about Jake's death...
Her condition worsened.

84
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not surprising.

85
00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:18.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So, what brings you here?

86
00:06:19.296 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, no reason. I just had...

87
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
something important I wanted to
talk to you about.

88
00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:28.221 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh? So, what is it?

89
00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:29.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

90
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[chuckles] We'll talk about it
later.

91
00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.936 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mr. Brooks? She says
she wants to talk to you.

92
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The doctors said you have something
to tell me, Ms. Kriem?

93
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:48.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need to know...
Why did Jake kill my parents?

94
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess you don't understand.
He was my savior.

95
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Jake meant everything to me.

96
00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, right! This is nonsense!

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:08.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
just because I happened
to be a NEXT.

101

Mr. Jake. I will be with you... forever!

[Bunny] By the way...
What is it you wanted to tell me?

215
00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.099 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

216
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Bunny] Earlier, you said you had
something important to tell me.

217
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:35.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! Well... I don't need to
tell you right now.

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bunny] Okay.

219
00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm really sorry, Bunny.

220
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you were hoping today's meeting
would give you some closure.

221
00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:49.620 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks to me like we're
back to square one.

00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I'm sure the answers are
out there--

223
00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bunny] Jake is the murderer!

224
00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

225
00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bunny] I remember the whole thing.

226
00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's burned into my memory
like it happened yesterday!

227
00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no way it was someone else.

228
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then you think Kriem was saying all that
just to bait us?

229
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Bunny] Yes. She obviously held
a grudge against us.

230
00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:14.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but... there really was a report

231
00:14:14.645 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
saying that Kriem had been kidnapped
21 years ago.

232
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On top of that, the date was accurate.

233
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
According to the case file,
she went missing on Christmas Eve.

234
00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Bunny] So what? It doesn't prove that
Jake was the one who kidnapped her!

235
00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But still...

236
00:14:27.283 --> 00:14:30.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Who are you going to believe?
I remember Jake as the murderer.

237
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
His face is burned into my memory.

238
00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:36.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I remember him looking at me,
right after he killed my parents!

239
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was holding a gun in his right hand,
the one with the Ouroboros tattoo on it!

240
00:14:49.263 --> 00:14:52.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
What's the point in looking through
all those old video files?

241
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm trying to see if there's any footage
of Jake with his gloves off.

242
00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

243
00:14:56.604 --> 00:14:58.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] Well, we don't really know if
he was with Kriem

244
00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
on the day your parents were murdered.

245
00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:01.609 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Trust me, he wasn't.

246
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.194 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What if you're wrong?

247
00:15:03.528 --> 00:15:05.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You see, one thing we can easily confirm

248
00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:07.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is whether or not Jake
was sporting a tattoo.

249
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should be able to learn something
from these archived videos.

250
00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you saying?
That my memory's not reliable?

251
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:14.831 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well...

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:17.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

255
00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Go ahead, but I already
know the answer.

259
00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He doesn't have a tattoo.

260
00:15:45.528 --> 00:15:46.571 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.160 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Impossible! Something's wrong!
Maybe he had surgery to remove it!

262
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:56.330 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can understand your feelings,
but there's no evidence he ever had one.

263
00:15:56.581 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

in my memory!

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.575 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

270
00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:37.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. My memory of Jake's face suddenly
morphed into all sorts of other people.

00:16:37.914 --> 00:16:39.081 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:41.125 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

trying to figure out!

Have you told him you're quitting yet?

It's fine. You should hurry home
and go see your daughter.

311
00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:30.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, wait. I,
Wild Tiger--

312
00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:32.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't have to explain.
I can handle things.

313
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry. It'll be
okay.

314
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.115 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute, that's not
what I meant--

315
00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello?

316
00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Samantha Taylor] <i>Oh, hello!</i>
<i>I haven't heard from you in a while.</i>

317
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:44.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I must say, it's kind of unusual</i>

318
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Oh my! Who's the gentleman with you?</i>

319
00:18:49.003 --> 00:18:51.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello, ma'am!
My name's Wild Tiger.

320
00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Very nice to meet you.
My name is Samantha.

321
00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.637 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I used to work as a housekeeper for
Master Barnaby and his family.

322
00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Nice to meet you!
-Samantha...

323
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Taylor] <i>Yes?</i>

324
00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry to bother you,
but there's something I want to ask.

325
00:19:03.893 --> 00:19:05.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is it,
my dear?

326
00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:07.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
21 years ago...

327
00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you tell me where you were
on the day my parents were murdered?

328
00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?

329
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That day...
You weren't there at the house, were you?

330
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:19.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. I believe I was home ill,
I remember having quite a serious cold.

331
00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:21.535 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Is there anyone who can
prove you were sick?

332
00:19:21.786 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Prove it? I'm afraid not,
that was quite a long time ago.

333
00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, the fact is, we have
to take your word--

334
00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.710 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, hold on a minute!
-What is it?

335
00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:33.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-What's goin' on with you?
-I told you what was going on!

336
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
My memory of the murderer's face
started changing!

337
00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Her face was in the mix!

338
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:39.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, you think she murdered
your folks?

339
00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.931 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell's wrong with you, Bunny?

340
00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:45.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
She seems to be just a
nice, sweet old lady.

341
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:47.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, but she showed up
in my memory!

342
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.105 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't have any other leads!

343
00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I have to follow up on the ones
that present themselves!

344
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:53.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How do you know you can
trust your memory,

345
00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:55.611 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
after all the things
you're starting to find out?

346
00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you ask me, you're
acting nuts!

347
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Taylor] <i>Umm... Master Barnaby...?</i>

348
00:20:00.825 --> 00:20:02.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>-Are you still there?</i>
-[grunting]

349
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:06.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's still here, he just got interrupted.
He'll have to call you back.

350
00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:14.964 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At this point, I just don't know
what to think.

351
00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:19.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The facts I've believed all this time,
have suddenly begun to fall apart.

352
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.265 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I feel like the ground's been
pulled out from under me.

353
00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:26.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] That's completely
understandable.

354
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Kotetsu...

355
00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:34.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe it would be best if I just
stepped down, and quit being a hero.

356
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:35.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

357
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not really confident I can do the job.
Not in this state of confusion, anyway.

358
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.031 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?!

359
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, let's not get hasty!

360
00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm sorry. I need to sort some things out.

361
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But-- hold on a
minute!

362
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:56.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tiger] <i>I'm so sorry, Kaede!</i>

363
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.716 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Daddy's been having a
really tough time!

364
00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Just when I was about to
tell my partner I was quitting,

365
00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he beat me to it and said
he was quitting!

366
00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:04.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Yeah, so?</i>

367
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:07.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the problem is,
I'm not sure what to do.

368
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:10.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If we all quit, no one's going to
be around to do the job, right?

369
00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:12.396 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, that means you're
not coming home...

370
00:21:12.563 --> 00:21:13.814 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Not immediately...</i>

371
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:15.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I expected some excuse!

372
00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:18.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No! It's just a
temporary delay!

373
00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.988 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... so, tell me about your powers!

374
00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I hear you have two of them,
that's pretty amazing!

375
00:21:23.532 --> 00:21:25.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-No. I just have one.
<i>-Huh?</i>

376
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:27.828 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I have one power, okay?

377
00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:31.791 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? But grandma said that you had
magnetic power, plus the Hundred Power.

378
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:34.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like I have the
ability to copy powers.

379
00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

380
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:38.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uncle Muramasa told me he
thinks he figured it out.

381
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:40.841 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can copy the power
of any NEXT I touch.

382
00:21:41.008 --> 00:21:42.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He says I'm like a chameleon.

383
00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't think I've ever heard of
a power like that.

384
00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:48.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So... does the previous power go away
when you copy the new one--

385
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>I don't really know! And...</i>
<i>I don't really want to talk about it!</i>

386
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:55.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Kaede. Come on,
please tell daddy.

387
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I don't even know why I'm talking to you!

388
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.318 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's the point?
You're not coming back!

389
00:21:59.485 --> 00:22:01.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not true, I'm
definitely coming home tomorr--

390
00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, brother!
