just scratches. No problem.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or should I come up there
to finish you off?!

209
00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:05.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh, wait a second.

210
00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:08.097 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you trying to
get in my way again?

211
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I really don't have time for this.

212
00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:14.312 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I finally figured out
Jake's other power.

213
00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're unable to hit him because
he can anticipate

214
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and detect our movements.

215
00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought about it and there's
only one possible answer.

216
00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
His hearing is very
sensitive.

217
00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
During my battle, Jake said
he could hear everything.

218
00:14:28.409 --> 00:14:29.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's when it should've hit me,

00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:31.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

221
00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:36.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

222
00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.753 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was listening to the sound
of our muscles moving

223
00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.546 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so he could predict our next move.

224
00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:42.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Impossible.

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.009 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to use this
to defeat him,

226
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.933 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:54.435 --> 00:14:56.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.158 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
