00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:45.994 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The technology that runs that android was
originally developed by Barnaby's parents.

53
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They were very careful,
so all of their robots

56
00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:57.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

57
00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:01.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

58
00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:05.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

61
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.984 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

65
00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

66
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:39.005 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

69
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.608 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

77
00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:31.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

78
00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:32.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.353 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

80
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you know if all

81
00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:41.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a very tough situation,

82
00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:46.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

then who can?

90
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.323 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

going how I thought.

91
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.577 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

92
00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

94
00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

96
00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

during our final attack together.

241
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What're you saying? Why
would your powers run out?

243
00:20:08.499 --> 00:20:13.295 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To be honest, my power can
barely last four lousy minutes.

00:20:22.146 --> 00:20:24.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was pretty tough tryin'
to keep it from you, pal.

249
00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.098 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

a secret from me!?

251
00:20:28.394 --> 00:20:31.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, because I knew you'd worry about me.
Didn't want that.

252
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:33.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, is that why you were quitting?

253
00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:36.444 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you're going to quit being a hero,
just like that?

254
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:38.612 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Being a hero is
unpredictable.

255
00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:42.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's fine when you're a young man,
but I'm gettin' too old for this stuff.

256
00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:48.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so sorry. You were in
bad shape this whole time...

257
00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:50.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and I didn't see it.

258
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You dummy. That was the whole point
of hiding it from you.

259
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.213 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So you wouldn't see.

260
00:20:56.839 --> 00:20:58.424 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

261
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:03.345 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, I... I don't
think I'm gonna make it.

262
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:05.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop talking,
just lay still.

263
00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:06.891 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But, Bunny...

264
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:08.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said stop it!

265
00:21:08.726 --> 00:21:13.022 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Chasing after the bad guys with you,
and listening to your lame lectures...

266
00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:14.857 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I loved every minute of it.

267
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:17.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The truth is, when you finally
started calling me "Kotetsu,"

268
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you made me so happy I went out
on an all-night bender to celebrate.

269
00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:24.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This isn't the end.
Stop talking like that!

everything, buddy.

271
00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.122 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Shut up, Kotetsu!
You're not dying, you hear me?

272
00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're not the kind of
person who gives up!

273
00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:34.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're optimistic,
dammit, act it!

274
00:21:35.085 --> 00:21:39.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, I've been learning to make
fried rice and that's your favorite dish!

275
00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
