00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ben] It's cold,
but at least it'll fill you up.

317
00:18:02.757 --> 00:18:04.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When I heard you were on the run,

318
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I figured you might be hungry,
so I came out looking for you.

319
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't believe you thought
I'd forgotten you.

320
00:18:11.265 --> 00:18:12.683 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry about that.

321
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:15.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd never stop believing in you,
no matter what they say.

322
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.638 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, I'm one of
your biggest fans!

323
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

324
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.851 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gulps]

325
00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is this what I think?

326
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:25.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh yeah! Brings back
memories, huh?

327
00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:29.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Ben] This suit is filled with the good
old times we spent together, my friend.

328
00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:31.402 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I always
keep it with me.

329
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, that's great!

330
00:18:33.487 --> 00:18:34.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

331
00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:35.698 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute,
what happened?

332
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.199 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How come it's
all wrinkled?

333
00:18:37.408 --> 00:18:40.369 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, I'm a cab
driver, not your maid.

334
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:42.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[coughs]

335
00:18:42.663 --> 00:18:48.461 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[both laughing]

336
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know I have to say,
I was pretty shocked.

337
00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:03.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On TV, they're talking about
you like you are the murderer,

338
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
no ifs, ands, or buts.

339
00:19:06.496 --> 00:19:08.873 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Somebody made sure I was,
framed.

340
00:19:09.482 --> 00:19:11.317 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kaede]
This is where Dad works.

341
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:17.531 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Sorry, Grandma.

342
00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Albert] Excuse me, young lady.
Are you lost?

343
00:19:22.787 --> 00:19:24.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No. I just...

344
00:19:25.623 --> 00:19:28.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I came all the way here
so I could meet Barnaby!

345
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:29.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Barnaby, you say?

346
00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:31.045 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. You see, I have a problem,

347
00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:32.838 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and I was hoping he might
be able to

348
00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-help me out.
-I see,

349
00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.966 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you're one of Barnaby's
biggest fans, aren't you?

350
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.144 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, thank you for
coming all this way.

351
00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Unfortunately, he's pretty
busy right now.

352
00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:42.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm afraid he won't be
able to help you

353
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with your problem at the moment.

354
00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry, my dear.

355
00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:02.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Ben] I see...

356
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.454 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So this whole mess you're in
is Maverick's doing, huh?

357
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

358
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:08.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's even gone through the trouble

359
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.415 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
of finding someone to go out
and pretend to be me!

360
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:14.004 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
<i>Who is that guy, anyway?</i>

361
00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:15.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll tell ya,

362
00:20:15.506 --> 00:20:18.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you sure know how to make enemies
with the wrong people, Kotetsu.

363
00:20:18.926 --> 00:20:21.595 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, it seems like it's
always happening to me!

364
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:25.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think that Barnaby's being influenced
by this guy, as well?

365
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:28.728 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I'm guessing he's probably not
going to remember me, either.

366
00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:32.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I'm right, he'll be
just like everyone else.

367
00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:37.486 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Ben] And you figure Maverick is
the reason they've forgotten about you?

368
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.238 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Kotetsu]
Well, I can't be sure, Ben.

369
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I don't know if
it's him or a NEXT.

370
00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:42.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I'll tell you this, though;

371
00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:45.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
a NEXT power is definitely
at the root of this.

372
00:20:45.953 --> 00:20:47.496 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So what's gonna be
your next move?

373
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.915 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only thing I can
think to do at the moment

374
00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:53.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is to try and make them remember
that I'm the real Wild Tiger.

375
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:54.503 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, but how?

376
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry,
I have a plan.

377
00:20:56.589 --> 00:20:57.715 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm listening.

378
00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know it'll work now,
thanks to you, Ben.

379
00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:02.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm?

380
00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:03.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's going on?!

381
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:04.930 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not sure.

382
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:07.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A man who resembles Kotetsu Kaburagi

383
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:09.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
has appeared up on the
roof of Apollon Media.

384
00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:11.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Did you contact him?
-Actually, he called us.

385
00:21:12.062 --> 00:21:13.564 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He says he's the real Wild Tiger,

386
00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:16.567 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he wants us to assemble
all the Heroes at that location.

387
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:17.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What, are you
kidding me?!

388
00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:21.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What the hell's going on?

389
00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.187 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, looks like most
of you are here.

390
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right!
It's time to let out a...

391
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
...wild roar.
