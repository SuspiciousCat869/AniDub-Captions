00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
by changing the memories of everyone

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:30.083 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm so sorry!
This is our fault.

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:34.128 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should have put two and two together

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

240
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

241
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Were Barnaby's

242
00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.293 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

253
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.151 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Barnaby's been brainwashed
by a very bad man, Kaede.

254
00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:24.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
