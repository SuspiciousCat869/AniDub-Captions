[man]
We have reached a verdict.

2
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This court finds
that the structural damages

3
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
caused by the hero known as Wild Tiger

4
00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:17.643 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
in the filming of <i>Hero TV </i>did not result
in saving any civilian lives.

5
00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:22.523 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Therefore, Apollon Media will be
held liable for the cost of all repairs.

6
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:23.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah.

7
00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:25.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This court is adjourned.

8
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Kotetsu] Hey, why are you pissed off?
This is my problem.

9
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's my problem too!
We're a team.

10
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That verdict takes points away
from both of us.

11
00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.253 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, who cares about points? A real hero
does it to protect innocent lives and--

12
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.879 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Would you just shut up?

13
00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:46.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasping]

14
00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know we're a duo, and I've really tried
to put up with you...

15
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:54.012 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But I don't think I can take much more...
of your constant meddling.

16
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Meddling?

17
00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:59.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You said you were trying to save people,
but all you did was destroy buildings!

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How is that supposed
to save anyone?

19
00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.939 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Geez, it was just
this one time.

20
00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's every time!

21
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.652 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And it's not just during work.
You stick your nose in everything!

22
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You even bug me about my diet!

23
00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:12.364 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, now I can't
give you advice.

24
00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not when it drives me crazy! Listen,
I know you mean well,

25
00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but every time you try to help,

26
00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it just causes more problems
for everyone around you!

27
00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[girl] Oh my god, Barnaby?

28
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.417 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh.

29
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, he's a huge fan of yours!
Can you please sign my baby?

30
00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:29.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Barnaby] Uh, your baby?

31
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I guess so...

32
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, and by the way,
happy birthday!

33
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

34
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tomorrow's your
big day, isn't it?

35
00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.266 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, that's right.

36
00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[shocked gasp]

37
00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I bet a mega-star like Barnaby Brooks Jr.

38
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:46.982 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
must have the most extravagant birthday
party planned for tomorrow.

39
00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Actually, I don't have plans.

40
00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here.

41
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.239 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, wow! I'll treasure this pen forever!

42
00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:59.286 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ah, lemme get that for you.
It's the least I can do for a young mom.

43
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:00.829 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasping]

44
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:03.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[screaming]

45
00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
My pen.

46
00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:06.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[sighing]

47
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You gotta be kidding, dumb car!
Talk about awful timing!

48
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
[Kotetsu] Good morning, everybody!

49
00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Isn't the weather out there
beautiful today?

50
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mmm-hmm. I guess so.

51
00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you look at a gorgeous blue sky,

52
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it makes stuff like
paying government fines

53
00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
seem so trivial, don't you think?

54
00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:58.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you're not
the one payin'.

55
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.491 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ha-ha! You're such
a kidder, Florence.

56
00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:04.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hm? What's wrong?
You sick or somethin'?

57
00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, I feel fine.

58
00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's just that seeing your face is
reminding me of what happened yesterday.

59
00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:13.795 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[screaming]

60
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.467 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, what do you mean,
what happened?

61
00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh never mind. It bums me out
just thinking about it.

62
00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.141 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute...
yesterday...

63
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:29.978 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Barnaby Brooks Jr. must have the most
extravagant birthday party

64
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
planned for tomorrow.

65
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:33.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, I
don't have plans.

66
00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.068 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, I get it.

67
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:39.613 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A birthday party?

68
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:42.324 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right! We gotta throw Bunny
a big shin-dig!

69
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Fabulous idea.

70
00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're saying pretty-boy was really
upset about some stupid birthday?

71
00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah. The poor guy was so depressed.

72
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.502 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That was the first time
I've ever seen him like that.

73
00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only way we can cheer him up
is with a kick-ass birthday party!

74
00:04:57.422 --> 00:04:59.216 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sounds like you're just
meddling to me.

75
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Say what?

76
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:04.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean your partner doesn't strike me
as the type of guy who enjoys surprises.

77
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:08.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't get it! When Bunny finds out
we went to all this trouble for him,

78
00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
he's gonna be like, thank you!
He's gonna hug all of us!

79
00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Blue Rose] Then count me out.

80
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:14.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

81
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not interested in
hugging that guy.

82
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:19.986 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, look at us. We're not
his friends, we're his competition.

83
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
She makes a good point, there.

84
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:23.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But Fire Emblem said it
was a fabulous idea.

85
00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
On second thought, it sucks.

86
00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on!

87
00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong with you people?

88
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Aren't birthdays a chance for everyone
to celebrate and be together?

89
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:34.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Sky High] Absolutely!

90
00:05:34.918 --> 00:05:38.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I completely agree.
Birthdays are special days.

91
00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, when one of us celebrates
a milestone,

92
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we should all support him.
Right, Mr. Wild?

93
00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.303 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Right, but these
guys don't wanna--

94
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A surprise party it is!
-Huh?

95
00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.017 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If the King of Heroes says so,
then I'm on board.

96
00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sky High, what you just
said was really moving.

97
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, he just repeated the
same thing I said before!

98
00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:00.777 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right people! Let's work together
to throw Barnaby a one-of-a-kind party!

99
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[all] Yeah!

100
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This was my idea.

101
00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:07.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, so what kind of gift
are you getting Barnaby?

102
00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:10.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? I kinda thought the party
was his present.

103
00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:13.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Uh, no, dummy. You have to get him
a real gift. Something from the heart.

104
00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
