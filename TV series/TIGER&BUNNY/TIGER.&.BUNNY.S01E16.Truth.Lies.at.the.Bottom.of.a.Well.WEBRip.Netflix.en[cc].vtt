[Ben] I recently spoke with a guy
that was a hero during Legend's time.

210
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:25.114 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And they had no reason to lie to me.

211
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's crazy. Legend set a record
that no one could touch for years, Ben.

212
00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:32.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

When I first found out, I certainly
didn't wanna believe it either.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Apparently when his powers started to go,

215
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
they began staging the program
on a regular basis.

216
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They'd let the other heroes do the work,
rounding up the criminals,

217
00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then give Legend the actual credit
for making the arrest.

218
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:48.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:53.101 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Ben] Not only that, they even went as far
as erasing any arrest records

220
00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:54.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
