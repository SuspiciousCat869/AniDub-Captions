Ah, looks like you're
already needed, sir.

321
00:20:00.074 --> 00:20:01.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

322
00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:05.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Saito, old buddy!

323
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.790 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[whispering]

324
00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Alright pal,
turn yourself in.

325
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I happen to know you
already exhausted your powers,

326
00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:14.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so you can't stop me!

327
00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:15.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughs]

328
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.341 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be a smart-ass!

329
00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.052 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can take you down,
powers or no powers--

330
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:24.557 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[gasps, screams]

331
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bunny?

332
00:20:37.153 --> 00:20:40.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Honestly. You haven't
changed a bit, have you?

333
00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:42.908 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What brings you here?
I thought you retired.

334
00:20:42.992 --> 00:20:45.161 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? I should ask
you the same thing.

335
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah.

336
00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:50.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well Kaede said I was uncool
for being a couch potato all day long.

337
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.043 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And you know what I realized?

338
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:56.088 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't always get to set your own
limits with the choices you make.

339
00:20:57.882 --> 00:20:59.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So that's that.

340
00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even if I lose
all my powers,

341
00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:02.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm still gonna
keep on trying.

342
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:05.139 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And even if I look
ridiculous,

343
00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:07.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm gonna remain a
Hero 'til the very end.

344
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.310 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'll never give up.

345
00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:13.647 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When you think about it, it doesn't hurt
to have a Hero who's uncool, right?

346
00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:16.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now I've heard everything.

347
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:19.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're gonna make a comeback,
then I suppose I'll have to, as well.

348
00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:20.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And why's that?

349
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:24.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean?
Because I'm your partner, that's why.

350
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.576 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

351
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:28.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I have to advise you. You'll probably
have to pay for these damages.

352
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.080 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, wait a minute!

353
00:21:30.247 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not the one who suddenly appeared
and smashed this hood!

354
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.336 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So you should pay to
have this car repaired!

355
00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:36.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How could you possibly
figure that?

356
00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:40.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Easy! Whose feet actually landed
on the hood and caved it in?

357
00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:41.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're unbelievable!

358
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:42.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[growling]

359
00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:46.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay. It's time to
go now, old man.

360
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I read you... L'il bunny.

361
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:55.231 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think it's time...
to let out a Wild Roar!
