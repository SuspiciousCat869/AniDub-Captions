00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was anyone else in the room
when you got that information?

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:45.712 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kotetsu was with me, but that's it.
Nobody else.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
What do you mean,
missing?

[Agnes] <i>Barnaby's gone AWOL and</i>
<i>I absolutely have to talk to him.</i>

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>We were supposed to meet earlier</i>
<i>about a charity event he's hosting.</i>

11
00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.037 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Like you don't have enough troubles
without worrying about him.

12
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.499 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Leave it to me. I'll track the jerk down
and make him call you back.

13
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:47.542 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.381 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm a bit worried about
Handsome.

15
00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.635 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll say. Hosting an event like that
sounds stressful.

16
00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.096 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's not what I
meant, honey.

17
00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:00.138 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No?

18
00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:04.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's not like him to just disappear
like this. He's serious about his work.

19
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.520 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You think he might be in
some kind of trouble?

20
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, this is so like him.

21
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.401 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't worry, he'll show up
when he feels like it.

23
00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:16.905 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What's wrong? You know
it's true.

24
00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.949 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tiger] So what's going on, people?

25
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:21.910 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Fall asleep in your salad?

27
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.872 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

28
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Barnaby's missing.

29
00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Do you happen to have any idea
what's going on with him right now?

30
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm?

31
00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:42.973 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You didn't get in a fight with him again,
did you?!

32
00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:45.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It wasn't really a
fight--

33
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:48.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, no you don't! You got in another fight
with him, didn't you?

34
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.480 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So it's all your fault.

35
00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:52.566 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why don't you tell us
what you did.

37
00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I gotta take this, sorry.

He's just gonna walk away?

39
00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:04.953 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kotetsu, go!

40
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Maverick here.

41
00:04:06.997 --> 00:04:08.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mr. Maverick--!

42
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is quite a surprise, sir.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

43
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.839 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's about your partner Barnaby,
I need to speak with you privately.

44
00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah...

46
00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sure.

47
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mornin'!

00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:42.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come in.

50
00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wanted to
see me, sir?

51
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have a seat. Would you
like some coffee?

52
00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm fine, sir, thanks.
Don't trouble yourself.

53
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's no trouble at all.

54
00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, what's this
about Barnaby?

55
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:02.219 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, yes, Barnaby.

56
00:05:02.636 --> 00:05:06.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, you see, I received a rather strange
phone call from him last night.

57
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Strange how?

58
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.354 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He said he didn't believe in anything
anymore. That he'd lost his faith.

59
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I haven't been able to get in contact
with him ever since.

60
00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was hoping you'd have some idea
of what's going through his mind.

61
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:24.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Did anything unusual happen?

62
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Anything that might have
set him off?

63
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:35.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, we learned that it wasn't Jake
that killed Barnaby's parents.

64
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.170 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm?! It wasn't?!

65
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:39.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Turns out Jake had an alibi.

66
00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

67
00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We talked it over, and decided to reopen
the whole investigation.

68
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Then I kinda got him
upset.

69
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But anyway, I'm worried he might lose it
and get himself into trouble again.

70
00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:59.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd say Barnaby's a lucky boy, to have
a partner that worries so much about him.

71
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:01.695 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, well...

72
00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is something wrong?

73
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Got any cream?

74
00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:12.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah! Why, of course.

75
00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Cool. Thanks.

77
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm?

78
00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now what's the
matter?

79
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like somebody
dropped something...

80
00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.225 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

81
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.445 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, that's weird.

82
00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:47.282 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes? Well? What of it?

83
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, it's mine! I guess
I forgot I pinned it on today!

84
00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.331 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Looks like it must've
fallen off...

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:02.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry about that.

89
00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:03.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

tell her I'm on my way.

I see it. She's waiting for me now.

97
00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.490 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I better check it out.
Thanks for the coffee, sir.

Right away.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.768 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

105
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:59.980 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Forgive the short notice, but I have
something very important to announce.

219
00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:25.383 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something that will affect the future
of Hero TV. And your futures, as well.

220
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

We're all ears.

222
00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.180 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hold on. Wild Tiger
isn't here yet.

223
00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.724 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh. Yeah, we should
wait for everyone--

224
00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.894 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, Tiger and Barnaby
already know about it, don't worry.

225
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:40.731 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You found Barnaby?
So where in the world was he?

226
00:15:40.982 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was exhausted and
just needed a rest, that's all.

227
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So I guess it wasn't
Tiger's fault after all.

228
00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So, let's hear the
big announcement, sir!

229
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.783 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Very well.

230
00:15:50.992 --> 00:15:54.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's something that I think is sure
to push our ratings through the roof,

231
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but it's still
top secret.

232
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's why I'm only allowing
the core group to know about it.

233
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:02.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that's the case,
what are the three of us doing here?

234
00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought I could let you in on the secret

235
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:08.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
because you three
all know Wild Tiger's true identity.

236
00:16:08.926 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not quite sure
I'm following you, sir.

237
00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wild Tiger will be the
star of the new project.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:16.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The star?!

240
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Please, just tell us!

241
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:24.066 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come now, let's not be hasty. First,
here's a toast to our future success.

242
00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It won't do. I just can't have you
digging up the past.

245
00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.989 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Barnaby's finally at a point
where he can live for the future.

246
00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:15.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
To show him this now
would just cause him needless suffering.

248
00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:27.421 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What you have to understand is that
some truths are better left unknown,

249
00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:28.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
for everyone's sake.

250
00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Under normal circumstances, I would have
been satisfied in replacing your memories

251
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

252
00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and then allowing you to
continue on with your life.

253
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:46.357 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But circumstances have changed.
And because of that, I'm afraid

254
00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:50.069 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll be needing you to play a far more
important role in my little plan.

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:13.509 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm really sorry about that, ma'am!

Any word from Bunny yet? Has he called?

Bunny. You know, Barnaby. Now it looks
like his old housekeeper's vanished, too.

263
00:18:32.278 --> 00:18:35.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to offend you, Mr. Lloyds?
