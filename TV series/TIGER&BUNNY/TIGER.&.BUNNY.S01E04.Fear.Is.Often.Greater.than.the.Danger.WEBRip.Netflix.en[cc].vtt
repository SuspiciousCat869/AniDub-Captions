get hurt.

Oh, please! This from a guy
who has zero points this season!?

You're so lame.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:33.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now, hold on a sec!
We are not lame!

110
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:36.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We were awesome the other day
when we took care of that bomb scare!

111
00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Barnaby] Let's be honest,
that bomb thing was mainly me.

112
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.670 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Huh?!
-Like I said, lame.

113
00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey! I am not finished
talking to you!

114
00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What I do in private
is none of your business!

115
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Truth is, I don't want to be a hero,
anyway.

Ugh, what a know-it-all.
That bearded idiot.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ahem. Do you have a problem
with my beard, miss?

119
00:08:05.694 --> 00:08:08.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, I wasn't
talking about you.

120
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look Karina, I understand
it can be stressful being a Hero.

121
00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:17.622 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But... a student should put
her education above everything.

122
00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You really must finish
your assignments if you--

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.751 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karina]
Actually, I just did!

124
00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Does that mean I can go?

125
00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No way!
I don't believe you!

126
00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:31.928 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's true! I saw them
walking home together today.

127
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.889 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karina's friend] She's with that guy?
He's so weird!

128
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Karina, what's wrong?

129
00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:38.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, nothing!

130
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So... What do you guys
want to do now?

133
00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:45.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, what about that
new sushi place?

134
00:08:45.984 --> 00:08:48.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, I heard it was great!

135
00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:50.530 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you say Karina?
Do you wanna come with us?

136
00:08:50.655 --> 00:08:52.699 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh?
Oh! Uh...

137
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Sorry, but I can't really
do anything today.

138
00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.911 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
More urgent business?

139
00:08:56.995 --> 00:08:59.039 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's right.
Kinda hard to explain.

140
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.958 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What?! But we waited through
your tutoring session.

141
00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.084 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry.

142
00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:07.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're kinda used to it by now anyway,
aren't we? Bye Katrina.

143
00:09:07.422 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yeah, see ya later.

144
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:09.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Bye.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:12.927 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why?

147
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Robert] Karina, sweetheart.

148
00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How many times have I told you
to follow our instructions to the letter?

149
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know you're young,
but you can't act like an amateur.

150
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you ran away yesterday,

151
00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
you missed the perfect chance
to make an arrest.

152
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:30.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not to mention, your little stumble
gave rescue points to Apollon's hero.

153
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is unacceptable!
You're damaging our company's image!

154
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

155
00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, according
the big-wigs.

156
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:43.208 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karina] How was I supposed to know
that guy had a submachine gun?

157
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:46.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Robert] Listen.
I get it, okay? It can be tough out there.

158
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But risking your life to stop criminals
is part of this job.

159
00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I mean, you are a hero.

160
00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:57.013 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Besides, that's why you have these powers,
Karina, to help you beat the bad guys.

161
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:58.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[clears throat]

162
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What I'm saying is...

163
00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:06.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You need to realize how important it is
to keep our sponsors happy.

164
00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And right now,
they're not very pleased. 'Kay?

165
00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.111 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's all
about the sponsors.

166
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:16.616 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Every day, I'm risking my life. For what?
What's the point of me being a hero?!

167
00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, there's lots of--

168
00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karina]
Is it to make your company look good?

169
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it to keep the sponsors happy?

170
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's for the citizens of Stern Bild.

171
00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.418 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, do you really
believe all that?! Honestly?

172
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.420 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't you dare question me!

173
00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, I was starting to have my doubts,

174
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:34.342 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but now it's clear you
don't think of yourself as a hero.

175
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:36.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our company isn't interested
in a star singer.

176
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We pay you to be a star hero.

177
00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:42.267 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You listen to me.
We are running a business, Karina.

178
00:10:42.392 --> 00:10:45.395 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, you listen.
I never even wanted to be a hero.

179
00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The company said I had to
if I wanted to make it as a singer.

180
00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.235 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's the only reason I signed up.

181
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Now, if you'll excuse me.

182
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

185
00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:03.663 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karina] I mean, how could he sit there
and berate me like that?

186
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Easy, kitten. You don't wanna
give yourself wrinkles.

187
00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:11.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm out there getting shot at, and
they only care about profits and sponsors.

188
00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure your employers
have their reasons,

189
00:11:14.841 --> 00:11:17.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but there are some things
that can't be changed.

190
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:21.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Easy for you to say, Fire Emblem.
After all, you own your company.

191
00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.350 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But that doesn't mean I'm free
to do whatever I want.

192
00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:27.437 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I can't even tell my friends
what I do every day.

193
00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I never expected this job
to be so frustrating.

194
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, how have you guys
done this for so long?

195
00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:34.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No one ever acknowledges--

196
00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:35.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kotetsu] Hey!

197
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, look who it is.
What do you want?

198
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:42.452 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I think you've got the wrong idea
about us.

199
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, yeah, how am I wrong?

200
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
All us heroes.

201
00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.000 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We don't do this job just because
we want people to appreciate us.

202
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mm-hmm.

203
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:52.962 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And?

204
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:54.589 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And... nothing.

205
00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.132 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That supposed to move me?

206
00:11:56.257 --> 00:11:59.510 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I mean...
I'm talkin' about-- [sighs]

207
00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:03.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Karina] That's just it.
You're all talk, zero point man.

208
00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[grunts] Hey, hold on!
I'm not finished yet.

209
00:12:07.352 --> 00:12:08.770 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
