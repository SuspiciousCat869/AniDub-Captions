Apparently, he only kills murderers.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.058 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
So I heard.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:20.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
<i>Lunatic will continue his killing</i>

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:23.899 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Man, with Lunatic around,
crime will soon be a thing of the past!

6
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He seems to be more effective
than the heroes, don't you think?

7
00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:28.070 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a face!

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.339 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must say, this is unexpected.

10
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We never thought something like this
would cause the public

11
00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.217 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to mistrust our city's heroes.

12
00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:17.888 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If more and more people question
their abilities, it could be disastrous.

13
00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're right-- It could
put <i>Hero TV </i>in jeopardy.

14
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We've got to do everything we can
to prevent that from happening.

15
00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.730 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At this point, we've got too much money
invested in them.

16
00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:30.192 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's focus.

17
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We can't afford to have someone
operating above the law.

18
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Lunatic may think he's fixing the world,

19
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:39.660 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
but the Justice Bureau doesn't approve of
the use of capital punishment.

20
00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:42.287 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We should be putting together a plan
to arrest him

21
00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.956 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and as soon as possible,
before there are more victims.

22
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait a second! How do we do that?

23
00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We have no idea when
or where he will strike again.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.798 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Everyone, please, calm down.

26
00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

27
00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:57.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
is that people are beginning to
support Lunatic's actions.

28
00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:02.641 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Our top priority should be to help
people regain their trust in heroes.

29
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.309 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We need to convince our citizens

30
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:07.521 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
that the Heroes are the true
representatives of justice in this world.

today some currently active heroes

33
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
have come here to address
the Hero Academy!

35
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
-What a waste of time.
-Huh?

36
00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
We're not being effective here.

37
00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
We should be out on patrol
looking for Lunatic.

38
00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:42.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
But the higher-ups want us
to regain the people's trust first.

39
00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Their trust in what?
Our pretty smiles?

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:50.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah, so we finally meet!

42
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:54.443 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pay attention, everyone! I shall now
teach you the secrets to becoming a hero!

<i>Now, repeat after me... Shwing! Shwing!</i>

46
00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Whew! It's so hot.

47
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:16.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm tired.

48
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't tell me you want to
go home.

49
00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Sounds good to me.

50
00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? You're giving up?

51
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:25.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why not?

52
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, what happened to you?

53
00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You were so jazzed about
that Ninja star thing.

54
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was putting on a show
for all those kids!

55
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:34.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not really qualified to teach anybody.

56
00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:35.525 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

57
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean all I ever do is
stay in the background.

58
00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:40.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who am I kidding?

59
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.157 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm the lowest-ranking hero.

60
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You shouldn't worry about that.

61
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.244 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
And I got bashed on my blog last week.

62
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:47.579 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Seriously?

63
00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:51.041 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was full of comments telling me
I wasn't really made to be a hero,

64
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and that I should just quit.

65
00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's pretty weird.
I wasn't aware you had a blog.

66
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you're worried about what's been
bringing down our reputation...

67
00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:00.008 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think it's been me.

68
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.220 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell me something, were
you always such a downer? Huh?

69
00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:05.847 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hello boys, are you ready?

70
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

71
00:05:08.517 --> 00:05:10.519 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ahh, Barnaby!

72
00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Good to see you! You've
become such a fine hero!

73
00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.190 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well, it's all because of this school.

74
00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.526 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Thank you, my boy,
I'm happy to hear that!

75
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:21.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ivan! I've been following
your activities, too!

76
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Please don't call me by
my real name, sir.

77
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.661 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, you're right!
I should be calling you 'Origami Cyclone'!

78
00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:30.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The both of you have
made me so very proud.

79
00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ah! Mr. Tiger!

80
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So pleased to meet you!

81
00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.711 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right back at you.

82
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:39.756 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hope you don't mind I'm here, even though
I'm not a graduate of the school--

83
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't be silly!
The students will be thrilled

84
00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to meet someone who's an ex-star hero!

85
00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.389 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe you could leave out the 'ex'
and just introduce me as a star hero?

86
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:48.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why, of course!

87
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.852 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We're all looking forward to hearing
the lectures from the three of you.

88
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Right.
-Sure.

89
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
One of the most important things
a hero needs to do is to earn points.

90
00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.568 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take before it is taken.

91
00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:01.653 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's a well-known
phrase in this industry.

92
00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:02.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right!

93
00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Protecting people is your
most important task!

94
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't let anything get in your way.

95
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:10.412 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Destroy buildings if you have to.
Don't worry about the damages, all right?

96
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Right!

97
00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The most important thing
a hero needs to do

98
00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.792 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
is to be able to showcase his sponsors!

99
00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When you're being interviewed on-camera,

100
00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
make sure your logos are visible,
does everyone understand?

101
00:06:22.007 --> 00:06:22.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uhh...

102
00:06:23.008 --> 00:06:25.176 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm not doing this
just for screen time.

103
00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Can you give us any tips on how to
save people who are in trouble?

104
00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:31.349 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh... let me think.

[all talking at once]
Hey, Mr. Tiger! Please, Mr. Tiger!

106
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:43.737 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Take it easy, everyone!

107
00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.697 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Show me your powers,
one at a time.

108
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.450 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, sir. My power's pretty unique.

109
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.288 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunting]

110
00:06:57.167 --> 00:06:58.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's different...

111
00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.963 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Nobody else can stretch
their skin this far.

112
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heh! You've got a great smile.

113
00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Me next! Watch this, sir,
I can sweat buckets.

114
00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
S'cuse me?

115
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:13.308 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunting]

116
00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:15.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pretty impressive, huh?

117
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.020 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Heh! Sweet sweat!

118
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.481 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, can you watch my powers now?
-Can I be next?

119
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.359 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunting]

120
00:07:33.036 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can we all become heroes like you?

121
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:38.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uhh, well... anything's possible.

122
00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[cheering]

123
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:45.048 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can I actually become a hero?

124
00:07:45.215 --> 00:07:47.425 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm not sure I have what it takes.

125
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Come on, that's not true.

126
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:51.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're really lucky, Edward.

127
00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.766 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Everyone says you're bound to be
a hero, once you graduate.

128
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not like me, I'm just a big failure.

129
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey! Why so down on yourself?

130
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:03.733 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Isn't it obvious?

131
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.945 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Look at the power I've got.
I don't even know how to use it.

132
00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:10.573 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll be fine. There's gotta be
something only you can do.

133
00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.076 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There is, but for what purpose?

134
00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:16.621 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're over-thinking it.
It'll become obvious as you train.

135
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thank you very much, Mr. Tiger

136
00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're welcome!

137
00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.678 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be tough for them to become heroes
with those kinds of powers.

138
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.806 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're more like sideshow attractions
than NEXT...

139
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, Tiger!

140
00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.145 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

141
00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:42.230 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, what's goin' on?

142
00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:45.150 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Would you mind taking a look at
my powers, as well?

143
00:08:45.692 --> 00:08:46.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?!

144
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! Amazing!

145
00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.449 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wow! Amazing!

146
00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.909 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's okay. You don't
need to copy me.

147
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.370 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's okay. You don't
need to copy me.

148
00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm serious.
You can stop now.

149
00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.624 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm serious.
You can stop now.

150
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.044 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[growling]
I'm not kidding, Origami!

151
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, sorry about that.

152
00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You know, that's an amazing power.

153
00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can actually shape-shift
into other people.

154
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:13.845 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The only thing is,
it's not really useful for saving people.

155
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:14.971 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You think so?

156
00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:17.474 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You could shape-shift into me
and use my Hundred Power.

157
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.601 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not really. See, I can copy
a person's appearance,

158
00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:20.977 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
but not their powers.

159
00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:22.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That blows.

160
00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:26.232 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I knew it! I'm not fit for being in
the company of superheroes

161
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:27.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
with powers like these!

162
00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:31.488 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I should just quit right now
and get a job. [crying]

163
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:36.242 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Now I'm starting to feel depressed.
Could you stop crying with my face there?

164
00:09:36.326 --> 00:09:37.744 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh! Sorry.

165
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Maybe you shouldn't
obsess over it.

166
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.709 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

167
00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure there are some situations
that your power would be perfect for.

168
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Actually, someone once
told me the same thing.

169
00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:52.842 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

170
00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That someone was a friend who was
a NEXT at the top of our class.

171
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.807 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But I didn't take his words seriously.

172
00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:02.227 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really? But the guy never
went on to become a hero.

173
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.604 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The fact that you became one is important.

174
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:07.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It means that you were better suited
for this work than he was.

175
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:08.399 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That's not true.

176
00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Of course it is!

177
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, really, you're mistaken.

178
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.570 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Don't be so modest!

179
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.656 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Believe me, I'm telling the truth!

180
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What?!

181
00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.119 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He should've become
the hero, not me.

182
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:24.874 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm?

183
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I remember like it was yesterday, Barnaby,

184
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:32.382 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
everything you did when you
were a student was perfect.

185
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.385 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I don't know if you realized it,
but the whole school looked up to you.

186
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.761 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Aww...

187
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:40.056 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You even had a fan club.
That never happened before.

188
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:42.725 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They all wore glasses
in the same style as yours.

189
00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Stop, please--
You're embarrassing me.

190
00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh. I'm sorry.

191
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Tell me... What was he like,
way back then?

192
00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.442 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey. Enough, already.

193
00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:54.654 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not you, Bunny.
I was talking about Ivan.

194
00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:00.410 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, Ivan was interesting.
He was talented, no question.

195
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:04.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>But he was very quiet, always hiding</i>
<i>behind his closest friend at the academy.</i>

196
00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Was that the student
he keeps talking about,

197
00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
who was at the top of his class?

198
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm sure it is--
He was actually very gifted.

199
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.174 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But while he was still a student here,
an incident happened...

200
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.675 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Really...

201
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:21.222 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We haven't talked about it much at school,
it's a very bitter memory.

202
00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:25.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Where's the car I ordered?

203
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:27.562 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Have any heroes arrived?

204
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.688 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, not yet.

205
00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:30.106 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go, Ivan.

206
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.191 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh!

207
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.234 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on,
we have to take care of this.

208
00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But using our powers off-campus
is against academy rules.

209
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You've gotta be kidding?

210
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Think about it! The powers we have
are meant to help people.

211
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What good are they if
we don't get involved?

Don't worry. You'll do fine.
I'll back you up. Let's go.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.297 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You wanna become
a hero or not?

What's takin' so long?
I'll kill her, I swear I will!

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:07.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Alright, give it up! It's over!

218
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Who the hell are you, kid?!

219
00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

220
00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:14.108 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Help me!
What are you waiting for?!

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I heard about that entire incident.

226
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Even though it was an accident,
he was charged with murder.

227
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As a result, Edward ended up in prison.

228
00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.801 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was no longer eligible
to become a hero.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.886 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

230
00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He should have been the hero, not me.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not anymore.

235
00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:00.738 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Edward! I--

237
00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:04.409 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This brings back memories.

238
00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.954 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It was at this spot that
you often asked me for advice.

239
00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
How did you get here?
I thought you were still in prison.

240
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.960 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I came back for revenge.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:16.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes, I got the call a few

Do you know how much I've suffered
because of you? Huh?!

245
00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:27.640 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was this close to becoming
a certified hero.

246
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:29.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But you ruined everything!

247
00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:33.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Why didn't you try and help me that day?!

248
00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.314 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I went to save someone,

249
00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.025 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
so why am I now the criminal
while you're the hero?

250
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.818 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
This is your fault, coward!

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Because you were too

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:48.995 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

256
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:50.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

259
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.591 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Why did you guys
have to interfere?

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.633 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

261
00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:06.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'd be willing to die if I thought
it would somehow make him feel better.

262
00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.430 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have to understand.
I'm the one who ruined his life.

264
00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:13.269 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Edward is just looking
for someone to blame, Ivan.

265
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He should never have stepped in.

266
00:14:15.355 --> 00:14:17.607 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What happened back then
was not your fault.

267
00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmm.

268
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:25.448 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No. He asked for my help.
And I was so afraid, I froze.

269
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:26.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I couldn't move.

270
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All I could think about
was getting killed.

271
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.371 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
As it turns out,
I might as well have been.

272
00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:37.251 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If I'd jumped in, he would have been
a hero... a much better hero...

273
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:38.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
than me.

274
00:14:43.216 --> 00:14:45.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, you're comin'

275
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Edward simply wasn't ready to be
a hero back then

276
00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:52.016 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
and he'll mess up again
if you don't stop him.

277
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What do you mean?
I can't do anything.

278
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:56.854 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wouldn't that be the same mistake
you made before?

279
00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:02.735 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Let go! Ivan! Help me!
What are you waiting for?

280
00:15:04.487 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Remember. You're a hero now.

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.124 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.042 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's no big deal. Let's go.

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.593 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You have a good partner,

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.387 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

So what's with the scared face?

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:48.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:06.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.024 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
