00:00:20.938 --> 00:00:22.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I said stop!

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.484 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No! It's the person we were
persuaded to believe was him!

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.914 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

7
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You aren't getting off with a few
minor burns after what you pulled!

8
00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Guess I have no choice.
Let's do this!

Barnaby. Come on, you still
can't remember who I am?!

17
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.343 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, and your yammering
is starting to annoy me.

18
00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:43.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

19
00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's no point in
continuing on like this.

20
00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, so you're finally surrendering?

21
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:15.630 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

22
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That pain feels kind of
familiar, doesn't it?

23
00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, I bet that
jogged your memory.

24
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.603 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well it damn well should.

25
00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.313 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the pain of friendship.

26
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:38.528 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That was a cheap shot.

27
00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You thought you'd win
with a sucker punch?

28
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:50.749 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

like I thought it would...

31
00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

32
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

we had together just like that?!

33
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

36
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

57
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:27.864 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

80
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.159 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

81
00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.328 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

83
00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:03.835 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes. But he took care of that.

[Saito] I had to! I didn't design the

we need to rendezvous with the others.

127
00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.215 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

have been tampered with as well.

140
00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:53.922 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There are a few others we
could reach out to for help,

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.258 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.261 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess that means we're gonna have to
settle this ourselves.

That's great, but I thought
their hero suits already had cameras.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:45.676 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:47.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:50.556 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Communications between heroes are
relayed using a special private network

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:06.489 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:15:06.656 --> 00:15:10.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

cameras on their suits, right?
