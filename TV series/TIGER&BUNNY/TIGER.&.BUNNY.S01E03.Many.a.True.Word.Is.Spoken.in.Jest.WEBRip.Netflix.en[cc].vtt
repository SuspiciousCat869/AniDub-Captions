[Wild Tiger]
Well this is gettin' us nowhere.

2
00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I say we rush 'em.
What do ya think? You in?

3
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.904 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hello?! Oh, forget it, you do what
you want, I'm goin' in--!

4
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.365 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Bunny] Okay, on the count of three,
we'll rush them from the right.

5
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Tiger] Screw the counting, let's go!

6
00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:34.785 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Wait, why the right?

7
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.246 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Bunny] There's less dirt on this side,
so there'll be less mud.

8
00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.248 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's the logical direction to attack from.

9
00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] Forget logic! I go off my gut.
And my gut tells me we go left!

10
00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.211 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bunny] No. Right.

11
00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:46.547 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger grunting] Like it matters
which way we go!

12
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.632 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[Bunny] So, we go right.
-[Tiger] No! Left!

13
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.133 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bunny] Definitely right.

14
00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:51.885 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

15
00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That does it!

16
00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.055 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Listen, Bunny, I've been around the block
a few times, okay?

17
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:56.848 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I think I know what I'm doin' here!

18
00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:59.351 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-[whirring]
-[gasping] Ah!

19
00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:40.952 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Bunny] Well that shut you up.

20
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.082 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And for the last time,
stop calling me Bunny.

21
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:46.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?!

22
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:51.296 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Okay! We've had enough of this!
This simulation is over!

23
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:56.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You just proved my point.

24
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.011 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Your gut?

25
00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If that's what we're supposed to rely on,
I don't want any part of it.

26
00:03:02.808 --> 00:03:04.976 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[grunts] It was just a simulation...

27
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.561 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Bunny]
And you're lucky that's all it was!

28
00:03:06.645 --> 00:03:09.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If it had been real, neither of us
would be walking out of here alive.

29
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.067 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

30
00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:19.700 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Uh--

31
00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.870 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, don't mind us, just pretend
we're not here. Act natural.

32
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:30.127 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What a jerk! Why I agreed
to this, I'll never know.

33
00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Don't you get it? You're supposed to be
a team! That's the whole point!

34
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.468 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A team is about teamwork.
And yours is terrible.

35
00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.554 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Going off the results so far,

36
00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.974 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm beginning to wonder why
we ever hired you, Kotetsu.

37
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.726 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? It's my fault?

38
00:03:46.518 --> 00:03:48.019 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, I'll leave
you guys to it.

39
00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.439 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Hey, where do you think you--?
-No, let him go.

40
00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:55.485 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Barnaby's not the problem.

41
00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
In fact, our stock's been up
ever since we signed him.

42
00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.075 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
As for you, well, we expected much more.

43
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.120 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-And frankly, it's make or break time.
-[Tiger sighs]

44
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
We thought you'd set a better example
while showing him the ropes.

45
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You've been at this a lot longer
than he has after all.

46
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.919 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not that much longer...

47
00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.212 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Well we thought...

48
00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.799 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
a training simulation would give you a
chance to demonstrate leadership.

49
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
To show us what you've got!

50
00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:21.094 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-A simulation?
-Yes.

51
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:23.764 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's never the same thing
running around in a simulator,

52
00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.849 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
there's no danger, no risk involved!

53
00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I prefer the real thing!

54
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.479 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Really. We could fire you.
Would that be real enough?

55
00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

56
00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:40.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
When it rains, it pours.

57
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, turn it off, will ya?
I'm rusting here!

Wild Tiger, got a moment?

59
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Or maybe I should call you Kotetsu,
since you're clearly off-duty.

60
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:54.836 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Rock Bison]
What do I think of Barnaby?

61
00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

62

you've got nothing?

72
00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

Are you trying to wreck my show?

75
00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:34.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

if you can't say anything nice, then...

76
00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:37.629 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is the most idiotic,
unprofessional behavior I've ever seen!

77
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] Idiotic? What about
Sky High's catchphrase?

78
00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

79
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
