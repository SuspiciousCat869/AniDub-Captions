[Jake] Problem is, when you
kidnap a child, you're stuck with 'em.

2
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:22.356 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You gotta feed 'em. keep 'em quiet.
They're a pain in the ass.

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.776 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, guess he would've been,
if we'd kept him alive.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:30.197 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He was in the ground before we even sent
the ransom note. Makes it a lot cleaner.

5
00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.074 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:43.789 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

We'll just be focusing on Barnaby today.
Don't worry about the other one.

25
00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

[Barnaby] Aw, don't leave the old man out,
you'll hurt his feelings.

27
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:01.890 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

32
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:24.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

33
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

they kill me! [laughing]

34
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.131 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wait a minute.
I've seen these guys before...

35
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.298 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00%

36
00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:47.394 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, yeah, you're right.
I'm surprised you remember them.

37
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Most people would.

38
00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.941 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, well, when you've busted
as many bad guys as I have,

39
00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
they all start to blend together.

40
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah, or your
memory's going. Hm?

41
00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.741 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Tiger] Says here they
were burned alive.

42
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Gee, what a shame.

43
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.245 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That's all you can say?

44
00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:06.705 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What else is there?

45
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
That's a hell
of an attitude.

46
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.335 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Three men died! Doesn't
matter who they are!

47
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

48
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I thought it was our job to save
people's lives! That's what a hero does!

49
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:22.763 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Save the sermons for
someone who wants to listen!

50
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:27.327 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Lloyds] No, no problem at all.
I'll have Wild Tiger head over right away.

51
00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:28.252 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm?

52
00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:32.147 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No, sorry. I'm afraid
Barnaby's tied up at the moment.

53
00:04:32.314 --> 00:04:34.483 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You'll have to make do
with Wild Tiger.

54
00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Yes, yes. He's quite resilient.

55
00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.781 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Mr. Lloyds?
What's goin' on?

56
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.117 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If you insist.

<i>It should be hotter, much hotter.</i>

61
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What a sadist!

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
He's going to melt the
whole prison in a minute.

64
00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:18.210 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

70
00:05:36.545 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, man. Did you have
to lay it on so heavy?

71
00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:43.260 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Excuse me. I'm just trying to clear
myself of a murder charge, that's all.

72
00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

73
00:05:44.845 --> 00:05:46.388 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Still don't have
enough data.

74
00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

76
00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's that or Fire Emblem will have to be
suspended from the show.

77
00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And you really think all this
will clear him of any suspicion?

78
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It might, if we can reenact the events of
last night and then compare the data.

79
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And my word's not good
enough for you?

80
00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
There's nothing we know of that could have
produced flames of such intensity.

81
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So it's natural to suspect that whoever
produced them

86
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:27.512 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%
