[Alexander] <i>You want to take a</i>
<i>vacation?!</i>

2
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:12.262 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. I thought I'd
better go visit my daughter...

3
00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:14.723 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You know, before she
forgets what I look like.

4
00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:17.518 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's unusual for you to
request time off...

5
00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Not to mention you wouldn't return
any phone calls the other day.

6
00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh! Yeah, well it was
just a thought.

7
00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If it's not possible, that's okay.

8
00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, after all,
the safety of the city has to come first!

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Relax. I'm not saying
the idea's out of the question.

10
00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.826 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[Barnaby] Just to let you know,
it's okay with me.

11
00:00:35.244 --> 00:00:38.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It shouldn't be a problem,
I can handle things by myself for a while.

12
00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.500 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, if you're sure
about that, then fine. He can go.

13
00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.003 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
It would be good for you to spend
some quality time with your daughter.

14
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.257 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, I have to look out for my crew.
She's one of my biggest fans.

15
00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:49.925 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[laughing awkwardly]

16
00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.721 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The latest Invincible
Hero Legend? That's great.

17
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:03.397 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
<i>You should start thinking</i>

18
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.580 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
[sighing]
Hm?

19
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
Hey, do you need some
help with your car, pal?

20
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.714 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No thanks. I don't need a
hero to handle a job like this.

21
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.384 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's nothing I can't take
care of on my own.

22
00:02:56.259 --> 00:03:00.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, man, it's old. How long
are you gonna keep driving that clunker?

23
00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:02.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's not a clunker!

24
00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It happens to be
vintage, Kotetsu.

25
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.146 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I guess that depends on
how you look at it.

26
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:12.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You don't see anyone driving second-hand
junk like this in Stern Bild anymore.

27
00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It runs just fine out here in the boonies.
You coming or what?

28
00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:23.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'm kinda surprised you picked me up
in the middle of the day.

29
00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.205 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I thought you were busy.

30
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.707 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Slackin' off?

31
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.167 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I came because mom asked
me to.

32
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.797 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[car rattles]

33
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:54.109 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh? What? You're not
even gonna come inside?

34
00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:59.072 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
You said it yourself, I'm busy right now.
I still have some deliveries to make.

35
00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:02.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Your little brother comes home for the
first time in years.

36
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.703 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Come on, at least
stay for a cup of tea.

37
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If you want to have a talk,
come by the store.

38
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I'll keep the place open tonight...
Just for old time's sake.

39
00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:15.422 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You always were the
serious one, weren't you?

40
00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.759 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, the place looks
the same as always.

41
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey Mom! I'm home!

42
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:24.765 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hm?

43
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.606 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Huh?

44
00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Mom!

45
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, I'm home.

46
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.867 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh Kotetsu... I didn't
expect you 'til later.

47
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's all right. You seem to be
doing pretty well, mom!

48
00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:51.374 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I try to keep active.
How 'bout you?

49
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.504 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Oh, I'm fine.
Everything's going along perfectly.

50
00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You sure about that?
Tell me, did something happen?

51
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Something happen?
No, not a thing.

52
00:05:02.344 --> 00:05:05.263 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
All right. If that's
what you say...

53
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.934 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I was just surprised when you said
you were coming home, that's all.

54
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.021 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
So... Is Kaede still at
school?

55
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.233 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yes. She should be coming
home pretty soon, though.

56
00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Oh, great.

57
00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I knew it...

58
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You're not looking very
well to me.

59
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.283 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No! It's not like that,
Mom!

60
00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.118 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're all wilted.

61
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It was the plant.

62
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.171 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's been a long time
since I've seen this room and my old desk.

63
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[screams]

64
00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What is all this? She's
been collecting these?

65
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.686 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Huh?
[groaning]

66
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:54.896 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
[Kaede] Dad?

67
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kaede!

68
00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.694 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hey, surprise!

69
00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:04.322 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Are you happy to see me?
I haven't been here in a long time!

70
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.325 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
What are you doing,
snooping around my room?!

71
00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.578 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You came in without
permission.

72
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Well, that's true... But this used to be
Daddy's room,

73
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.207 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
so I didn't think you'd mind.

74
00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.961 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You went through my
stuff?!

75
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:20.130 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I... uh... well...

76
00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:24.259 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I must say, you've really
been growing! You're big now!

77
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You must be eleven
stories tall! Hmm?

78
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know! Why don't we take a bath together
like we did a few years ago--

79
00:06:32.267 --> 00:06:33.184 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pervert!

80
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pervert? S'cuse me?

81
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.689 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Where did you even learn
a word like that?

82
00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:38.815 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Pervert!

83
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.943 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Pervert! Pervert! Get
out of here!

84
00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.446 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Kaede, what's the matter?

85
00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:54.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hmph!

86
00:06:54.623 --> 00:06:58.001 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kotetsu! You need to
eat more vegetables. Come on.

87
00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.378 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You probably eat fried rice all the time,

88
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.380 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
since it's the only thing
you know how to cook!

89
00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Am I right?

90
00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:06.760 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
So what's the problem with fried rice?

91
00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It just happens to taste really good,
ya know.

92
00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:12.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks for dinner.

93
00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Hey, Kaede, are you
still mad at me?

94
00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.152 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You expect her to just forgive you?

95
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.655 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Have you even tried
apologizing to the girl?

96
00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:27.822 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Not exactly.

97
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:30.784 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I mean, going through
your daughter's things like that!

98
00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:33.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Wake up, she's already 10
years old!

99
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:10.00% 
I'm so sorry, Kaede!

100
00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I realize I shouldn't have
gone into your room without asking!

101
00:07:42.337 --> 00:07:43.713 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Can you forgive me?

102
00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:47.050 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I promise, I'll never go in there again
unless I'm invited!

103

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:44.375 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.588 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

tough, Kotetsu.

141
00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.634 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

you're not Wild Tiger, the hero...

142
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.679 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

143
00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.684 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

weaker?

144
00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah. The time limit that I can use
them in is getting shorter and shorter.

145
00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.817 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
At this rate I'll
completely lose them.

146
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When that happens,
I won't be able to be a hero anymore.

147
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.366 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's what scares me.
And I don't know what to do about it.

148
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

you have to just accept your fate, but...

151
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:31.631 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I've sacrificed a lot to get where I am!
A lot more than I ever wanted to.

152
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:36.803 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

and be put out to pasture?

153
00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

about this before now?

154
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I didn't want to burden
you with it.

155
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:45.478 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
That's always been
your way.

156
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:49.107 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

to yourself, even when you were a kid.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.859 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

158
00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:56.030 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

powers, you did the same thing.

159
00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

give you any answers.

160
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.871 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Give yourself some time to rest.
That's why you came home, isn't it?

00:11:04.289 --> 00:11:05.748 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

Do you know why Kaede got so upset?

231
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:14.455 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

00:15:35.685 --> 00:15:39.272 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Kaede was probably never able

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.023 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%
