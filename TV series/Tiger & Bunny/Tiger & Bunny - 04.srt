-Look, Karina, I understand it
can be stressful being a hero.

170
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,843
But a student should put her
education above everything.

I saw them walking
home together today.

He's so weird!

I know you're young, but you
can't act like an amateur.

When you ran away yesterday,
you missed the perfect chance

to make an arrest.

Not to mention

supposed to know

TITAN INDUSTRY SUIT:
Listen, I get it, OK?

00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:49,777
It can be tough out there.

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,310
But risking your life to stop
criminals is part of this job.

222
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,210
I mean, you are a hero.

223
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,910
Besides, that's why you
have these powers, Karina,

227
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,177
is to keep our sponsors happy.

228

Every day, I'm risking
my life-- for what?

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,510
What's the point
of me being a hero?

Is it to keep the

but now it's clear you don't
think of yourself as a hero.

242
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,677
Our company isn't
interested in a star singer.

to be a hero.

wanted to make it as a singer.

00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,648
What's that for?

331
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:54,848
-It's a tip.

332
00:13:54,882 --> 00:13:58,915
Not a lot, but look, you've
got a pretty nice voice.

333
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:03,248
If you really want to be
a singer, I say go for it.

334
00:14:03,282 --> 00:14:04,682
Sorry I bothered you.

335
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:06,048
KARINA: Hey, hold on.

336
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:07,382
-Huh?

337
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:10,848
-I was just wondering
why you became a hero.

338
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:24,815
-It's funny, you seem
like a pretty honest kid.

339
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:25,982
I misjudged you.

340
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:27,082
-Uh?

341
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:29,782
You don't know what
you're talking about.

342
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,382
-Anyway, aren't you too
young to be drinking?

343
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:35,648
-This is just mineral water.

344
00:14:35,682 --> 00:14:38,215
-Like I said, an honest kid.

345
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:39,948
-Don't pretend you know me.

346
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:44,315
-Say, you never told me why
you want to be a singer.

347
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:46,015
-I love singing.

348
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:49,048
And I want to share my
voice with the entire world.

349
00:14:49,082 --> 00:14:50,448
-Same goes for me.

350
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:51,848
-Huh?

351
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:55,615
-The reason I became a hero was
because I enjoy helping people.

352
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,382
What other reason
could a guy need?

353
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:01,182
If people acknowledge
what I do-- well,

354
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,782
that doesn't really
matter to me.

355
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,382
[knock]

356
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:19,915
MR. LYLE: Karina?

357
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,715
Can we talk for a moment?

358
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:24,582
KARINA: I don't want
to talk to anyone.

359
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,282
-I understand that
you quit being a hero.

360
00:15:27,315 --> 00:15:29,782
Your mother was quite concerned.

361
00:15:29,815 --> 00:15:30,982
KARINA: Why do you care?

362
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,048
You were against it all along.

363
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:37,148
-The other day, you said being
a hero wasn't your goal in life.

364
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:40,248
Now I'm no fan of your
costume, but what really

365
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:42,948
bothered me that day
was your attitude.

366
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,348
If you don't believe
in what you're doing,

367
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:48,348
that's a recipe for disaster.

368
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:51,315
I'm saying if you want
to quit, then quit.

369
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:52,715
I think it's the right choice.

370
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:01,948
And think-- if
you do retire now,

371
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,415
this card may be worth
a lot in a few years.

372
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:17,648
-They don't get it.

MANAGER (ON PHONE): Oh, Karina.

381
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:37,115
Hey, sorry for calling you
out of the blue like this.

382
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:39,948
Look, the singer we booked
for tonight just bailed on us.

383
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,415
I hate to ask, but can
you head over to the bar

384
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,348
and start warming up?

385
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:43,848
-Huh?

386
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:51,182
-All right.

387
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:53,415
Your mission for today is
a basic search-and-rescue

388
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:54,682
operation.

389
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,482
WILD TIGER: Right,
we know the drill.

390
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,115
AGNES (ON COMM): However, things
are still dangerous out there,

391
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,982
so stay on the boat
until I give the order.

392
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:02,648
Especially you, Wild Tiger.

393
00:17:02,682 --> 00:17:04,548
Look before you leap.

394
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,448
-Yeah, I'll behave.

395
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:07,515
-Status check.

396
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:08,748
Where's Blue Rose?

397
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,482
Why isn't she
responding to our calls?

398
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:11,815
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): This just in!

399
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,615
There's been an
explosion on an oil rig

400
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:15,582
just offshore in Stern Bay.

401
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,582
According to reports,
most of the workers

402
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,715
have been evacuated
safely, but one of them

403
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,415
is still trapped inside.

404
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,582
We've been informed that several
fearless heroes are already

405
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:25,982
on their way.

406
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,515
However, the inferno shows
no signs of dying down

407
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,015
The situation is
spiraling out of control.

408
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,415
With the explosions,
smoke, and deadly blaze,

409
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,915
there may be nothing our
heroes can do at this point.

410
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:49,582
-Hey, Agnes.

411
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,848
I'm not waiting anymore.

412
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:51,682
We're moving in.

413
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:53,015
AGNES (ON COMM): Absolutely not.

414
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:54,415
It's too dangerous.

415
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,848
I'm not going to risk
losing two of my heroes.

416
00:17:56,882 --> 00:17:57,648
Stand down.

417
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:59,082
That's a direct order.

418
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,448
-Sorry, can't hear you.

419
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:02,215
AGNES (ON COMM): Tiger,
this isn't a joke.

420
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,548
-Hey, I'm an old man.

421
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,015
My hearing's shot.

422
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,582
-Don't you disobey me!

423
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:08,515
WILD TIGER: If there's
even a glimmer of hope,

424
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:11,515
a hero cannot
abandon a human life.

425
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,715
Un!

426
00:18:12,748 --> 00:18:15,048
-You have a million corny
catchphrases, don't you?

427
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:16,382
-Don't stop me.

428
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,748
-Whoever said anything
about stopping you?

429
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:19,915
-Huh?

430
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:21,382
-Here's what I say.

431
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:23,015
If there's even a
glimmer of hope,

432
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,382
a hero cannot abandon his point.

433
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,615
AGNES (ON COMM): Barnaby!

434
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,782
-Huh?

435
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,582
Showoff.

KARINA: [singing]
The smile that you

437
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:33,482
see is just my heart breaking.

Change the [inaudible]
behind your [inaudible].

439
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:48,848
Another day sleeping, my
soul kept from waking.

440
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:55,982
Not myself, not the
girl deep inside.

441
00:18:56,015 --> 00:19:01,082
Now I walk alone down
a dark, shadowed path--

442
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,282
PATRON: (SLURRING) Come on!

443
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,648
They only gotta save
one fellow, right?

444
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,582
So what the hell's
taking 'em so long?

445
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,915
These punks call
themselves heroes?

446
00:19:13,948 --> 00:19:16,248
You wimps don't seem
like heroes to me.

447
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:17,848
-Uh?

448
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:20,648
-We don't risk our
lives every single day--

449
00:19:20,682 --> 00:19:22,948
-Simply to be
appreciated by people.

450
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,982
-No, they're not just doing
this to win your gratitude.

451
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:33,315
-These heroes are so pathetic.

452
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,982
Anybody want to make a bet?

453
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,415
$20 says they can't
save that guy.

-Sure, you might
talk a big game,

but you have no idea how
much those heroes risk
