00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:39,547
-Then why the hell did you
end up joining that psycho?

166
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:41,814
-It was a simple decision.

167
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,181
Mister Jake saved me.

168
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,647
We waited in the
station for hours.

169
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:53,814
But in the end?

170
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:57,147
My parents didn't show
up with the money.

171
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,681
-They're not coming, are they.

172
00:08:58,714 --> 00:09:01,114
They really don't want me.

173
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:04,681
It's because I'm a NEXT.

174
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,281
It's because I'm a freak.

175
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:07,547
-Hmm?

176
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,114
-Sorry.

177
00:09:09,147 --> 00:09:11,747
My parents don't think
I'm worth the money.

178
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:13,481
There's no point in waiting.

179
00:09:13,514 --> 00:09:16,581
You can kill me now.

180
00:09:16,614 --> 00:09:19,514
Go ahead, get it over with.

181
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:20,647
It really doesn't matter.

182
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:22,581
No one's going to
miss me anyway.

183
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:25,181
You're doing everyone a
favor by getting rid of me.

184
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,847
So go ahead.

185
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,814
Kill me.

186
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,714
[kriem sobs]

187
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:30,681
-Tell me.

188
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:33,914
What's so great
about being normal?

189
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,681
Don't be ashamed of who you are.

190
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:36,814
Be proud.

191
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:37,581
Listen to me.

192
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:39,014
People consider us freaks.

193
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:42,714
But we're actually the ultimate
form of human evolution.

194
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,114
The reason we've been
given power is easy to see.

195
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:46,414
We are the chosen ones.

196
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:47,114
-What?

197
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,214
We're the chosen ones?

198
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,447
Really?

199
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:52,014
-I've never been more sure.

200
00:09:52,047 --> 00:09:54,647
We NEXTs stand above
the human race.

201
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:55,781
Remember that.

202
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:57,881
The weak have always
been fearful beings.

203
00:09:57,914 --> 00:10:00,747
In fact, they refuse to accept
the existence of anyone who's

204
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,047
superior to them.

205
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,314
You're a member of
that superior race.

206
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:07,081
The rest of the population
is afraid of your abilities,

207
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,981
and will always
try to destroy you.

208
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:12,747
So remember, don't be ashamed.

209
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,681
Be proud.

210
00:10:16,547 --> 00:10:17,347
Go on.

211
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:18,281
You're free to leave.

212
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:24,147
-I couldn't believe
what I had heard.

213
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:27,547
His words released
me from my suffering.

214
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,481
He was the first
person to accept me

215
00:10:29,514 --> 00:10:33,114
for what I was, and told
me to be proud of it.

216
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:34,047
Wait, please!

217
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:39,947
Will you take me with you?

218
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:40,947
-Hmm?

219
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:41,914
-I get it.

220
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:43,381
And I want to help you.

221
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:47,481
-Fine, whatever.

222
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:57,714
-When I look back on it, the
only happy time in my life

223
00:10:57,747 --> 00:10:59,047
was with him.

224
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:03,514
It was when I truly
felt alive and free.

225
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:05,847
Mister Jake and I were
trying to build a world ruled

226
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:08,914
by NEXTs, where we'd be
free from persecution.

227
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,214
It was a dream he had for
a long time, something

228
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:14,181
we shared together.

229
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,114
[kriem gasps]

230
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:16,047
-Are you all right?

231
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,114
-If you and your friends hadn't
interfered with the plan,

232
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,481
we would have been saved.

233
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,814
We were on our way to
completing our ideal world.

234
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:29,781
And you heroes kill him!

235
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,147
-How would that have been ideal?

236
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,681
I mean just look at
what you've described.

237
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,647
In that world, normal
humans would just

238
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,581
experience what you did.

239
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,214
Everything would be
the same, but you'd

240
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,714
end up being the persecutors.

241
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:45,047
-It would be a
natural progression.

242
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:48,014
After all, humans are
inferior to NEXTs.

243
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,647
-So killing normal people
would then be acceptable?

244
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:53,581
That would be your
idea of justice?

245
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:57,814
Is that why Jake went out
and killed my parents?

246
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,614
-To defend Mister
Jake's honor, I'm

247
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:00,914
going to tell you something.

248
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:04,114
I know you think he was the
one who killed your parents.

249
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:06,414
But you see, he didn't.

250
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:08,781
I'm sure you remember
your parents were killed

251
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:11,681
21 years ago on Christmas Eve.

252
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:15,814
That also happened to be the day
when Mister Jake kidnapped me.

253
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:17,147
-What are you saying?

254
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,181
-I can vouch for his innocent.

255
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,247
I was with him the
entire day it happened.

256

-You're lying.

257
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:25,081
-Sorry, but he's
innocent of the crime.

258
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:29,214
That means your parents' murder
hasn't been solved, I guess.

for the rest of your life!

something important to tell me.

-Oh, well.

278

I don't need to
tell you right now.

-I'm really sorry, Bunny.

some closure.

00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:52,547
Looks to me like we're
back to square one.

284
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,281
But I'm sure the
answers are out there.

285
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,147
-Jake is the murderer.

286
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,847
I remember the whole thing.

287
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,281
It's burned into my memory
like it happened yesterday.

288
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:06,647
There's no way it
was someone else.

289
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:09,647
-Then you think Kriem was
saying all that just to bait us?

290
00:14:09,681 --> 00:14:10,781
-Yes.

291
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:14,814
She obviously held
a grudge against us.

292
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,014
-Yeah, but there
really was a report

293
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:19,847
saying that Kriem had been
kidnapped 21 years ago.

294
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:21,981
On top of that, the
date was accurate.

295
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:24,947
According to the case file, she
went missing on Christmas Eve.

296
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:26,281
-So what?

297
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,314
It doesn't prove that Jake
was the one who kidnapped her.

298
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,547
-But still--

299
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:30,781
-Who are you going to believe?

300
00:14:30,814 --> 00:14:32,847
I remember Jake is the murder.

301
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,347
His face is burned
into my memory.

302
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,381
I remember him
looking at me right

303
00:14:37,414 --> 00:14:40,147
after he killed my parents.

304
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,014
He was holding a gun
in his right hand,

305
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,147
the one with the
Ouroboros tattoos on it.

306
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,884

looking through all

there's any footage of Jake

-What?

00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:04,584
-Well, we don't really
know if he was with Kriem

312

on the day your
parents were murdered.

-What if you're wrong?

315
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,550
You see, one thing
we can easily confirm

316
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:13,850
is whether or not Jake
was sporting a tattoo.

317

from these archived videos.

00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,917
That my memory's not reliable?

321

Well, this is so stupid.

Here we go.

-Go ahead.

-Were the heroes
too boring for you?

Well, here's some
titillating news.

328
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,217
After the NEXT match,
we're halfway done.

329
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:51,550
-He doesn't have a tattoo.

330
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,550
-Can't be.

331
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:55,350
Impossible.

332
00:15:55,384 --> 00:15:56,384
Something's wrong.

333
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,784
Maybe he had surgery
to remove it.

334
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,517
-I can understand your feelings.

335
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,617
But there's no evidence
he ever had one.

336
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,850
-No way.

337
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:06,617
That tattoo is very
clear in my memory.

338
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,950
If it wasn't him, who's
the murderer I saw?

339
00:16:17,517 --> 00:16:18,050
-What's wrong?

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,450
What's going on?

343
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:30,350
-I'm not really sure.

344
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,084
-The murderer's face changed?

345
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:40,050
-Yeah.

346
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:41,550
My memory of Jake's
face suddenly

347
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,717
morphed into all
sorts of other people.

348
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,484
-What does that mean?

349
00:16:45,517 --> 00:16:47,484
-That's what I'm
trying figure out.

350
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:50,384
-Has something like this
ever happened to you before?

351
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,017
-There was a time when I
couldn't remember his face,

352
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,117
but nothing like this.

353
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,050
-Hmm.

[cell phone rings]

-Hello, Kotetsu?

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,550
How did it go?

357
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:07,150
Have you told them
you're quitting yet?

358
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,084
-Uh, not really,.

359
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,350
-What are you doing, son?

360
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,884
You promised me
earlier that you were

361
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:13,984
going to tell them before
the end of the day.

-And I was going to, believe me.

00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:19,050
But it's been crazy,
things keep coming up.

-Oh, please.

365
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:23,150
Are you going to break your
promise to Kaede again?

366

-Huh?

367

-I won't go on making
excuses for you, Kotetsu.

-So how is Kaede?

369
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,217
Has she at least calmed down?

-Well, not exactly.

371
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,217
It seems as though her power is
turning out a little different

372
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:35,950
than yours.

-It's very strange.

Are you saying she has

-I really can't tell.

That's why I want you to hurry.

Get home, will you, so
you can look after her?

going to have tomorrow.

Get here before something
really bad happens.

00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:08,484
You sounded like
you were worried.

-Yeah.

388
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,117

But there's something else I've
been meaning to talk about.

-Sorry.

-Oh, hello.

407

I haven't heard
from you in a while.

408
00:18:46,184 --> 00:18:50,117
I must say, it's kind of unusual
for you to give me a call.

Oh my, who's the
gentleman with you?

-Hello ma'am.

My name's Wild Tiger.

-Very nice to me you.

413

My name is Samantha.

414
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,050
I used to work as a
housekeeper for Master

415
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,617

-Samantha.

-Sorry to bother you.

00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,817
But there's something
I want to ask.

421
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,417
-What is it, my dear?

422
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,950
-21 years ago, can you tell
me where you were on the day

423
00:19:14,984 --> 00:19:16,884
my parents were murdered?

424
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,117
-What?

425
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,817
-That day, you weren't there
at the house, were you?

426
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,584
-No.

427
00:19:21,617 --> 00:19:23,084
I believe I was home ill.

428
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,417
I remember having
quite a serious cold.

429
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,484
-Is there anyone who
can prove you were sick?

430
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:28,784
-Prove it?

431
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:29,717
I'm afraid not.

432
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,617
That was quite a long time ago.

433
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,717
-So the fact is, we
have to take your word.

434
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,884
-Hey, hold on a minute.

435
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:35,817
-What is it?

-What's going on with you?

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,350
-I told you what was going on.

438
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,717
My memory of the murderer's
face started changing.

439
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,017
Her face was in the mix.

440
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,750
-So you think she
murdered your folks?

441
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,784
What the hell's wrong
with you, Bunny?

442
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,350
She seems like just a
nice, sweet old lady.

443
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:53,717
-Yeah, but she showed
up in my memory.

444
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,050
I don't have any other leads.

445
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:57,717
I have to follow up on the
ones that present themselves.

446
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,484
-How do you know you
can trust your memory

447
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:01,584
after all the things you're
starting to find out?

448
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,050
If you ask me,
you're acting nuts.

449
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,517
SAMANTHA: Um, Master Barnaby?

450
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,484
Are you still there?

451
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:11,250
-He's still here, he
just got interrupted.

452
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:12,450
He'll have to call you back.

453
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,217
-At this point, I just
don't know what to think.

454
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,950
The facts I've
believed all this time

455
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,584
have suddenly begun
to fall apart.

456
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,817
I feel like the ground's been
pulled out from under me.

457
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,150
-That's completely
understandable.

458
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:35,050
-Kotetsu?

459
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:36,717
-Hmm?

460
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,317
-Maybe it'd be best
if I just stepped

461
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,217
down and quit being a hero.

462
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,417
-Huh?

463
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,750
-I'm not really confident
I can do the job-- not

464
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,950
in this state of
confusion, anyway.

465
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,150
-What?

466
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:48,284
Now, let's not get hasty.

467
00:20:48,317 --> 00:20:49,550
-I'm sorry.

468
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:51,550
I need to sorts some things out.

469
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,950
-But, hold on a minute!

470
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:02,384
-I'm so sorry, Kaede.

471
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,584
Daddy's been having
a really tough time.

472
00:21:04,617 --> 00:21:06,917
Just when I was about to tell
my partner I was quitting,

473
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,117
he beat me to it and he
said he was quitting.

474
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,284
-Yeah, so?

475
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:12,850
-Well, the problem is,
I'm not sure what to do.

476
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:15,517
If we all quit, no one's going
to be around to do the job,

477
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,484
right?

478
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:18,317
-So that means you're
not coming home.

479
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,717
-Not immediately.

480
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,450
-I expected some excuse!

481
00:21:21,484 --> 00:21:24,150
-No, it's just a
temporary delay.

482
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:26,684
Uh, so tell me
about your powers.

483
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,050
I hear you have two of them.

484
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,250
That's pretty amazing.

485
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:29,950
-No.

486
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,717
I just have one.

487
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,717
-Huh?

488
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,684
-I have one power, OK?

489
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:35,084
-Really?

490
00:21:35,117 --> 00:21:36,984
But grandma said that you had
magnetic power plus the Hundred

491
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:38,084
Power.

492
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:40,084
-Looks like I have the
ability to copy powers.

493
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:41,850
KOTETSU: Copy?

494
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,517
-Uncle Muramasa told me he
thinks he figured it out.

495
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,784
I can copy the power
of any NEXT I touch.

496

He says I'm like a chameleon.

497
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:50,817
-Don't think I've ever
heard of a power like that.

498
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,150
So does the previous power go
away when you copy the new one?

499
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,484
-I don't really know.

500
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:57,950
And I don't really
want to talk about it.

501
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,117
-Oh, Kaede.

502
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,117
Come on, please tell daddy?

503
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,050
-I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

504
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:04,217
What's the point?

505
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,184
You're not coming back.

506
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:06,384
-That's not true.

507
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:09,984
I'm definitely coming
home tomorr-- oh, brother.

KOTETSU: Hi, I'm Kotetsu,
the member of Tiger and Bunny

00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:15,647
who develops crushes
on every actress.

The truth about Ouroboros
is a complete mystery again,

516
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:21,314
but I've already decided
to quit being a hero.

Next time on "Tiger and
Bunny," "There's No Way Out."

Hey, pretty good, huh?
