MR. MAVERICK (VOICEOVER):
Have sweet dreams, Barnaby.

[phone ringing]

00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:43,033
-Was anyone else in the room
when you got that information?

5
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,333
-Kotetsu was with me, but
that's it, nobody else.

[music playing]

00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,894
-What do you mean missing?

9
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:38,461
-Barnaby's gone AWOL and I
absolutely have to talk to him.

10
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,927
We were supposed to meet
earlier about a charity

11
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,961
event he's hosting.

12
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,327
-Oh like you don't
have enough troubles

13
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,461
without worrying about him.

14
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:45,694
Leave it to me.

15
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,694
I'll track the jerk down
and make him call you back.

16
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,027
-I'd appreciate it if you would.

17
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,261
-I'm a bit worried
about Handsome.

18
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:59,961
-I'll say hosting a big event
like that sounds stressful.

19
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:01,961
-That's not what I meant honey.

20
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:03,227
-No?

21
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:05,327
-It's not like him to
just disappear like this.

22
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,927
He's serious about his work.

23
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:09,227
-Do you think he might be
in some kind of trouble?

24
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:11,527
-Come on this so like him.

25
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,127
-(ALL) Huh?

26
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:15,227
-Don't worry, he'll show
up when he feels like it.

27
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,527
-(ALL) Ah, uh

28
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,194
-What's wrong?

29
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:19,694
You know it's true.

30
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,261
KOTETSU: So what's
going on people?

31
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:25,027
What happened to you,
fall asleep in your salad?

32
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,594
[screams]

33
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:28,227
What's wrong?

34
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,727
-Barnaby's missing.

35
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,561
Do you happen to
have any idea what's

36
00:03:33,594 --> 00:03:34,794
going on with him right now?

37
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,227
-You didn't get in a fight
with him, again, did you?

38
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,727
-It wasn't really a fight.

39
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,394
-Oh no you don't!

40
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,594
You got in another fight
with him, didn't you?

41
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:53,261
-So it's all your fault.

42
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:56,461
-Why don't you just
tell us what you did?

43
00:03:56,494 --> 00:03:59,794
[phone ringing]

44
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:00,694
-I got to take this.

45
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:01,661
Sorry.

46
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:03,027
-Wha-- He's just
going to walk away?

47
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:06,894
-Kotetsu.

48
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,327
Go.

49
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:09,627
-Maverick here.

50
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:11,294
-Mr. Maverick!

51
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,827
This is quite a surprise, sir.

52
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:14,994
To what do I owe the pleasure?

53
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,761
-It's about your
partner Barnaby.

54
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,861
I need to speak
with you privately.

55
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:19,994
-Uh.

56
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,727
I'm sorry to drag you
away, but could you

57
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,327
come to my office please?

58
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:23,827
-Sure.

59
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:32,994
-Morning.

60
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:43,427
[knocking]

61
00:04:43,461 --> 00:04:45,394
-Come in.

62
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:46,794
-You wanted to see me, sir.

63
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:51,861
-Have a seat.

64
00:04:51,894 --> 00:04:53,727
Would you like some coffee?

65
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,294
-Uh, I'm fine, sir.

66
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:55,994
Thanks.

67
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,794
Don't trouble yourself.

68
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,027
-It's no trouble at all.

69
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:02,861
-So what's this about Barnaby?

70
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:04,727
-Ah, yes, Barnaby.

71
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:07,694
Well, you see I received
a rather strange phone

72
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,794
call from it last night.

73
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:10,394
-Strange?

74
00:05:10,427 --> 00:05:11,561
How?

75
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,594
-He said he didn't believe
in anything anymore,

76
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:15,727
that he'd lost his faith.

77
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:18,494
And I haven't been able to get
in contact with him ever since.

78
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:23,927
I was hoping you'd have
some idea of what's

79
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:25,194
going through his mind.

80
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:27,027
Did anything unusual happen?

81
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:33,461
Anything that might
have set him off.

82
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,961
-Well, we we learned
that it wasn't

83
00:05:35,994 --> 00:05:39,061
Jake that killed
Barnaby's parents.

84
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:40,094
-(SHOCK) It wasn't?

85
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:43,927
-Turns out, Jake had an alibi.

86
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:48,327
We talked it over and decided to
reopen the whole investigation.

87
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,627
Then I kind of got him upset.

88
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:55,361
But, anyway, I'm worried you
might lose it, and get himself

89
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:57,694
in trouble again.

90
00:05:57,727 --> 00:06:00,294
-I'd say Barnaby's
a lucky boy to have

91
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,027
a partner that worries
so much about him.

92
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:03,927
-Oh, well.

93
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:11,094
-Is something wrong?

94
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,394
-Got any cream?

95
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:14,494
-Ah, why of course.

96
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:20,727
-Cool!

97
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:21,227
Thanks.

98
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:25,427
-Hm.

99
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:29,527
-Hm?

100
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:30,827
-Now what's the matter?

101
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,194
-It looks like somebody
dropped something.

102
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:45,661
Well, that's weird.

103
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:51,161
-Yes, well, what of it?

104
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:51,694
-Oh!

105
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:52,794
It's mine.

106
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:55,194
I guess I forgot I
pinned it on today.

107
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,327
It looks like it
must have fallen off.

108
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:59,361
Really glad I found it.

109
00:06:59,394 --> 00:06:59,861
-Hm.

110
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:04,627
-Ah, sorry about that.

111
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,861
-Go right ahead.

112
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,461
-Hello?

113
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:09,361
Who?

114
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,194
Samantha?

115
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:12,327
Oh, Samantha!

116
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:15,027
Yeah, right, Bunny's
old housekeeper.

117
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,361
She does?

118
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,894
OK, well, tell
her I'm on my way.

119
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:20,694
-What was that all about?

120
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:23,261
-This lady's got some
old photo of Bunny.

121
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,994
She says it's important
that I see it.

122
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,427
She's waiting for me now.

123
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:27,627
-A photo?

124
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:29,361
-Yeah, I better go check it out.

125
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:30,494
Thanks for the coffee, sir.

126
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:40,927
-It's me.

127
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:51,461
[explosion]

128
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:52,761
-Yes, I understand.

129
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:54,627
Right away.

130
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:56,827
-Is there a woman
here to see me?

131
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:58,927
-Perfect timing!

132
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:02,427
A terrorist group just set
off a bomb at a shopping mall.

133
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,527
-Really?

134
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:05,327
-Get over there and help
with the rescue effort.

135
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,594
-Right.

136
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,594
But I was supposed to
meet this woman here.

137
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:09,694
-Oh.

138
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,894
Don't worry I'll tell
her to wait for you.

139
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,394
Now, get moving.

140
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:13,227
-Roger.

141
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,761
I'm already there.

142
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,394
REPORTER (VOICEOVER):
Innocent shoppers

143
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:18,861
appear to have been the target
of this latest atrocity.

144
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:20,827
While it's still not
clear who is responsible,

145
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,761
terrorists are suspected.

146
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:23,861
And look who's here!

147
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:28,294
It's Wild Tiger, the
first hero on the scene.

148
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:29,227
MAN: Hey look!

149
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:31,294
Help's on the way!

150
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,027
Up here, we're up here!

151
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:33,927
WOMAN (SCREAMS): Help!

152
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:35,561
-OK hang on everybody.

153
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:38,394
I'm coming up.

154
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:39,361
WOMAN (SCREAMS): Hurry!

155
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,327
Hurry, help us!

156
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,894
-Wild Tiger at your service.

157
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,961
MR. MAVERICK (OFF
SCREEN): Nicely done.

158
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:53,727
-That ought to keep
him busy for a while.

159
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:54,261
-Excellent.

160
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,861
-I'm sorry to bother you.

161
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,994
I know you must be busy.

162
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:16,561
-He's ready to see you now math,
ma'am, if you'll come with me.

163
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:17,194
-All right.

164
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:27,594
-Is that everybody?

165
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:31,994
WOMAN (SHOUTING): Mikey!

166
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:32,961
-As you heard--

167
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:34,227

at least one child still

Mikey where are you?

171
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,127
-Nothing we can do now.

172
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:42,594
I'm

173
00:09:42,627 --> 00:09:43,261
-Going in.

174
00:09:43,294 --> 00:09:44,361
-It's too dangerous.

175
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:52,027
-Did you catch that?

176
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:52,527
Woah!

177
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,027
-Mikey

178
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:58,594
-Unbelievable!

179
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:01,061
Wild Tiger saves the day.

180
00:10:01,094 --> 00:10:02,061
Wow!

181
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:03,361
You were really great
out there today.

182
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,194
Anything to say?

183
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:05,594
-Yeah I got something to say.

184
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,494
What's so unbelievable about it?

185
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,127
Don't act so surprised, OK?

186
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,527
-Hey, I want to--

187
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,927
-It should be more like, Wild
Tiger saves the day as usual.

188
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,161
-Hey, watch the road!

It's done, sir.

-OK, good.

192
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:35,627
I'll be taking care
of the rest now.

Maybe she got tired
of waiting for you.

-It wasn't that long.

-Hm?

00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:12,094
Ah, you're awake, I see.

201
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:15,794
I was hoping for a quiet dinner
together, like we used to do,

202
00:11:15,827 --> 00:11:17,927
then you conked out on me.

203
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,994
I suppose I can't blame you.

204
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,527
Being a hero is hard work.

205
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:27,961
This is my little
home away from home.

206
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:30,061
Just make yourself comfortable.

What the-- Don't worry I
got something for you too.

211
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:56,827
See?

212
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:01,827
So is this one
Bunny's, or that one?

213
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:05,894
What's going on?

214
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:17,963
-I'm sorry, but I can't
remember did we already

215
00:12:17,996 --> 00:12:19,996
discuss what Kriem told me?

216
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:22,263
-You've really forgotten.

217
00:12:22,296 --> 00:12:24,729
Well then, allow me to
refresh your memory.

218
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:28,229
In a nutshell, you told me
that Jake murdered your parents

219
00:12:28,263 --> 00:12:30,096
for money.

220
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,163
-Right.

221
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:33,929
Yeah Kriem was the last
member of Ouroboros.

222
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:37,063
With her death, the
organization's been destroyed.

223
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:37,996
-That's it exactly.

224
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,729
The case is closed.

LLOYDS (ON PHONE):
Lloyds here, sir.

228
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:48,029
Sorry to bother you.

229
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:49,929
And I hope it's not
a waste of time,

230
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:52,429
but Wild Tiger says he's
got something urgent he

231
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:53,563
needs to talk to you about.

232
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,863
Do you mind if I
patch him through?

233
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,796
-Tiger, huh?

234
00:12:58,829 --> 00:12:59,329
All right.

235
00:12:59,363 --> 00:12:59,996
Go ahead.

236
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:00,663
Put him through.

237
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:08,829
-Uh, are you there, sir?

238
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:10,763
-You said this was urgent.

239
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,096
-Yeah.

240
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,496
It's about that pin I found
on the floor of your office

241
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,129
today, remember?

242
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,196
-What about it?

243
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,563
-Well, the thing is
it belongs to Bunny.

244
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:22,696
You see, I bought a
matching set of those pins,

245
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:23,929
one for each of us.

246
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:25,563
I, at first, thought
that one was mine,

247
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,163
but then I just
found mine in my car.

248
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:31,229
So the one in your office
was obviously Bunny's.

249
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,863
-Was it?

250
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,963
So you see bunny was there.

251
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:37,696
He had to have been in
your office earlier.

252
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:38,696
-Well, I--

253
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,429
-I mean when you weren't around.

254
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:41,396
-Hm?

255
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,996
-I'm thinking that
whatever happened

256
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,763
to make Bunny disappear,
it happened to him there.

257
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,929
Did you happen to notice
any signs of a struggle

258
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,329
or anything?

259
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,829
-No, I can't say that I have.

260
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:53,896
-Well, all right.

261
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,396
Anyway, I'm going
to try and catch

262
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:57,263
Bunny's housekeeper at home.

263
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:57,763
-Oh?

264
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,863
-Yeah.

265
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:00,463
she left the studio
before I could see her.

266
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,563
I figure this photo
she wants to show me,

267
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:05,596
maybe it's a clue to
where Bunny's gone.

268
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:07,129
-Yes, you may be right.

269
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:09,429
You let me know if
you find out anything.

270
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:10,096
-Right.

271
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:10,896
Got it.

272
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:11,596
Later, sir.

273
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:18,629
-That man is an utter fool.

274
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:23,496
A change in plans.

275
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,496
I've just come up
with a better idea.

I'm sorry about that.

happen to Kotetsu?

-No.

279
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:34,496
No, it was nothing important.

280
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:35,263
Why?

281
00:14:35,296 --> 00:14:37,029
Are you worried about him?

282
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:39,296
-Well sort of.

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:41,029

That's really blazes.

You want to be
more careful ma'am.

-Forgive the short
notice, but I have

292
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:26,463
something very
important to announce,

293
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,429
something that will
affect the future of Hero

Wild Tiger isn't here yet.

-Yeah, we should wait
for everyone to--

-Oh!

300
00:15:40,463 --> 00:15:41,929
Tiger and Barnaby
already know about it.

301
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:42,796
Don't worry.

302
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:43,729
-(ALL) Huh?

303
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,096
-You found Barnaby?

304
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:46,663
So where in the world was her?

305
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,729
-He was exhausted and
just needed to rest.

306
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:49,829
That's all.

307
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:52,496
-So I guess it wasn't
Tiger's fault after all.

308
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:55,496
-So let's hear the
big announcement, sir.

309
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,729
-Very well.

310
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,529
It's something that I
think is sure to push

311
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,796
our ratings through the roof,
but it's still top secret.

312
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:05,229
That's why I'm only allowing
the core group to know about it.

-If that's the case, what are
the three of us doing here.

314

-I thought I could let
you in on the secret

315
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,929
because you three all know
Wild Tiger's true identity.

-I'm not quite sure
I'm following you sir.

00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,196
-Wild tiger will be the
star of the new project.

-Please, sir, just tell us.

-Come now, let's not be hasty.

First, here's a toast
to our future success.

-I just can't have you
digging up the past.

327
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,829
Barnaby's finally
at a point where

328
00:17:15,863 --> 00:17:17,496
he can live for the future.

329
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,696
To show him this now would just
cause him needless suffering.

330
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:32,029
What you have to understand
is that some truths are better

331
00:17:32,063 --> 00:17:34,429
left unknown for
everyone's sake.

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,296
Under normal
circumstances, I would

333
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,429
have been satisfied in
replacing your memories

334
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,096
with the ones I
want you to have.

335
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:48,163
Then, allowing you to
continue on with your life.

336
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:51,363
But circumstances have
changed, and because of that,

337
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:53,596
I'm afraid I'll be needing
you to play a far more

338
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:55,429
important role in
my little plan.

[snoring]

341
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,463
-Oh, it's cold.

342
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,596
I'm really sorry
about that ma'am.

343
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,596
I must have dozed off.

344
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:21,396
Uh, ma'am?

345
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,629
Oh, Hey Mr. Lloyds.

346
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:30,263
Good morning!

347
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:31,663
Any word from Bunny yet?

348
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:32,529
Has he called?

349
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:33,529
-Excuse me?

350
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:35,096
-Bunny, you know Barnaby.

351
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:37,996
Now, it looks like his old
housekeeper's vanished too.

352
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,463
-And just who are you?

353
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:41,063
Are you a friend of Barnaby's?

354
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:44,529
Uh, not the time I'd
choose to be making jokes,

355
00:18:44,563 --> 00:18:46,696
but hey good one Mr. Lloyds.

356
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,296
(SHOUTS) Hey, I
asked you a question.

357
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:53,863
OK.

358
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:54,663
Look, I'm sorry.

359
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:55,996
It was really, really funny.

360
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:04,229
Excuse me, what's
up with the machine?

361
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:05,396
-I'm sorry, sir.

362
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:07,796
May I see your employee ID?

363
00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:08,729
-Huh?

364
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,663
Did something change
since yesterday?

365
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,729
-I have no idea
who this person is.

366
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:14,296
Hurry up and get
him out of here.

367
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:16,563
-Hey a joke's a
joke, but come on.

368
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,796
Did I do something to
offend you Mr. Lloyds?

369
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:20,463
-I don't know how
you got my name,

370
00:19:20,496 --> 00:19:23,196
but stop pretending
we know each other.

371
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,496
-But wait!

372
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,596
-Come on.

373
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:26,896
You can tell me all
about it in the office.

374
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,429
-Hey, don't you know who I am?

375
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:29,929
I'm a hero--

376
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:30,463
-You're what?

377
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:38,396
-Good morning.

378
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,129
Lovely day, isn't it?

379
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:42,029
-You're the guy
who was just here.

380
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,096
I saw you the whole time.

381
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:44,096
-Ah!

382
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:45,896
Come on, take a good look.

383
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,096
Can't you see who I am?

384
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,629
-Are you supposed
to be Wild Tiger.

385
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:52,696
-Bingo.

386
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:54,096
Very observant, now
let me in, will you?

387
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,496
-With a little beard and a
mask, anyone can look like him.

388
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,729
We get fans and loonies in
here all the time pretending

389
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,896
to be heroes, trying to
sneak past security--

390
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:05,696
-(ANGRILY) Look, I'm
not a fan or a loonie.

391
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:07,529
-Good morning!

392
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:10,596
Here is an urgent flash
bulletin from Hero TV.

393
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,229
That's right ladies
and gents, we've

394
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:14,229
got another fugitive on the run.

395
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:15,529
-Hey, wait a minute.

396
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:17,229
Why didn't anybody
tell me about this?

397
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:21,296
-Be on the lookout for this
man, Kotetsu T. Kaburagi

398
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:24,763
described as a homicidal NEXT.

399
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:27,296
He is suspected of having
murdered this woman,

400
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:32,596
68 year old Samantha Taylor,
a resident of Stern Bild.

401
00:20:32,629 --> 00:20:35,129
According to police,
Kaburagi's fingerprints

402
00:20:35,163 --> 00:20:37,929
were found at the victim's home
on a fireplace poker, which

403
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:39,729
is believed to have
been the murder weapon.

404
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:46,529
-What's going on here?

405
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:49,163
-Wait a second.

00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,596
First floor lobby.

407
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:51,996
I've got the suspect right here.

408
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:52,629
-Hey look--

409
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:53,496
-(YELLS) Don't move!

410
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:54,163
-You've got it all wrong pal.

411
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:54,634
-Stay where you are!

412
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:00,196
-OK, buddy.

413
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,663
Calm down.

414
00:21:01,696 --> 00:21:02,629
Don't shoot.

415
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,396
-Hold it right there.

416
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,229
-You got me guys.

417
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,396
-Samantha's dead?

418
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:18,229
And this is the
man who killed her.

419
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,696
-Who is he?

420
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:23,463
-Kotetsu Kaburagi.

421
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,663
-Kotetsu Kaburagi.

422
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,129
He won't get away with this.

423
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,696
(SADLY) Samantha's gone.

424
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:43,429
I never repaid her for
everything she's done for me.

425

[music playing]

426
00:23:24,622 --> 00:23:25,082
REPORTER (VOICEOVER):
The search is now

427
00:23:25,082 --> 00:23:26,015
focused in the East
Bronx district.

428
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:26,849
-Oh!

429
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:27,722
-Grandma, are you all right?

430
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:28,602
-No, don't look.

431
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:30,981
REPORTER (VOICEOVER):
Where authorities now

432
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:31,543
believe suspect Kotetsu
Kaburagi is hiding.

-That's dad!

434
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,122
REPORTER (VOICEOVER):
Hero's from each company

435
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,583
have been dispatched
to the area,

436
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,117
but residents are
warned to remain

437
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,750
indoors and on their guard.

438
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,317
The suspect is believed to
be a NEXT with lethal powers

439
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,083
and therefore an
extremely dangerous.

440
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,450
-Here's hoping the truth about
you is forgotten as well.

441
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:07,583
-What the hell is going on?

442
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,883
Hey!

443
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,117
Kotetsu here, the
member of Tiger & Bunny

444
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,783
who reads his fan mail at home.

445
00:24:14,817 --> 00:24:15,717
So what's happening?

446
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,617
I'm no criminal.

447
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,683
I've been framed.

448
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,917
And who the hell is
this guy, anyway?

449
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,250
Next time, on Tiger &
Bunny heaven help me!

450
00:24:22,283 --> 00:24:26,350
I mean helps-- uh the
uh heaven helps those--
