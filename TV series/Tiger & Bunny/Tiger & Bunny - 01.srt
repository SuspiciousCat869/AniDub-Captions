the hero world, Blue Rose!

WILD TIGER: Hey.

236
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,972
So who's your sponsor, anyway?

237
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:56,105
-Don't have one.

238
00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:58,405
-Wait, you're telling
me you're a free agent?

239
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,072
Why'd you stick
your nose in this?

240
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:02,505
-Come on, does it really matter?

241
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:04,072
I made the arrest.

242
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,205
-And showing your face.

243
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,805
Why would you take off
your mask in public?

244
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,239
Are you crazy?

245
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:10,905
-Huh?

246
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:12,239
-It's a basic rule.

247
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:15,272
A hero's secret identity
has to remain a secret--

248
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:16,105
-Secret, huh?

249
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,239
-Uh--

This is it!

The moment you've
all been waiting for.

We're about to reveal the winner
of this season's "Hero TV."

256
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:45,772
BEN: What were you
thinking, Kotetsu?

257
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,639
I mean, bending that track?

258
00:11:47,672 --> 00:11:51,139
And did you have to smash the
windows in the train like that?

259
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:52,305
KOTETSU: Well--

260
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,005
BEN: So much mayhem.

261
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,172
You realize how much
that's going to cost?

262
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:58,205
-Hey, if I worried
about all that stuff,

263
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,472
I couldn't do my job.

264
00:11:59,505 --> 00:12:01,072
-Well, you better
start worrying,

265
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:03,505
or else you might just
find yourself out of a job.

266
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:04,939
-Listen, I'm sorry.

267

you a hero, don't you, pal?

-Hmm.

-All right.

286
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,672
-We know it's not gonna be you.

287
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:40,639
-Shut up.

00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,905
here is the CEO of
Apollon Media as well as

Give it up for Albert Maverick!

very special to our viewers.

309
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:34,839
Come on up.

310
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:35,839

00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,772
won the approval of
the Justice Bureau,

314
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,805
so you'll all be seeing
a lot more of him.

Please welcome the city
of Sternbild's newest

Ugh, what a clown.

-Be nice.

321
00:13:57,105 --> 00:14:00,205
-His superpower may sound
familiar to some of you.

322
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,639
When activated, this young
man's physical strength

323
00:14:02,672 --> 00:14:04,572
is increased 100 times.

324
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:05,639
-Uh?

325
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,739
-But it only lasts
him for five minutes.

326
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:11,372
And yes, it's the exact
same power as Wild Tiger.

327
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,305
However, he also has
the power of youth,

328
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,739
which is why I'm hopeful our new
hero won't need to be rescued

00:14:25,905 --> 00:14:28,872
known as NEXT, began
appearing 45 years ago

335
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:30,272
due to some sort of mutation.

336
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:31,172
-Hey!

337
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,105
-I'm out of here.

338
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:32,939
MAVERICK: We still
don't know what

339
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,172
triggered these rare abilities.

340
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,539
However, we do know that
the NEXT have kept us safe.

341
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:40,972
Battling chaos,
crime, and injustice,

342
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,205
these brave fighters
have earned our trust

343
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:45,339
and become our heroes!

344
00:14:45,372 --> 00:14:47,272
[crowd roars]

345
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:56,472
-Good evening.

346
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:56,972
-Mm.

347
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:02,772
"A veteran hero who made
his debut 10 years ago.

348
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,772
He may be past his
prime, but he is"-- ugh.

349
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:12,039
Huh?

350
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:13,639
Give me 10 Wild Tigers!

351
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:14,372
-Whatever.

352
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:19,839
[cell phone ringing]

353
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:20,405
-Hey.

354
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:21,672
What's up?

355
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:24,439
ANTONIO: Are you seriously
ditching the after-party?

356
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:26,605
KOTETSU: Op: Ah, those
things are too stuffy for me.

357
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,939
-There's tons of free food
and all the suits are here.

358
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,639
KOTETSU: Op: Say hi
for me, will you?

359
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:33,572
ANTONIO: Hello?

360
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:34,439
Hello?

361
00:15:34,472 --> 00:15:36,539
[sigh] Ahhh!

362
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:38,972
-Hmm, Bison's got some
junk in the trunk.

363
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:39,805
Hmmm,

364
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,639
-Stop-- stop-- get off of me!

365
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:44,472
-You got your screen
time out there, as usual.

366
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:45,139
Keep it up.

367
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,172
It's great exposure.

368
00:15:46,205 --> 00:15:48,672
-I won't let the
sponsors down, sir.

369
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,572
I mean, I hope not.

370
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,205
-You're not listening.

371
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:53,605
My catch phrase is stupid.

372
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,472
Can't your company
let me change it?

373
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:59,072
-That domineering attitude of
yours is why people love you.

374
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:00,639
Why change what works?

375
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,205
-It's all about the fans.

376
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,972
Thanks, and thanks again.

377
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,672
-Hello, Mr. Maverick.

378
00:16:05,705 --> 00:16:06,839
-Ah.

379
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,572
I knew promoting
you to producer was

380
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:10,639
the right choice for "Hero TV."

381
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:13,839
But I never expected you
to pull in these ratings.

382
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:19,805
-Well, when it comes to creating
a spectacle, I stop at nothing.

383
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,672
[phone ringing]

384
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:21,839
KOTETSU: Yeah, yeah, coming.

385
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:27,405
Yello?

386
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,339
KAEDE: Op: Dad?

387
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,272
-Honey!

388
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,805
What's going on, Kaede?

389
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,472
-Tomorrow's my recital.

390
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,772
You didn't forget, did you?

391
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:35,672
-Forget?

392
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,105
I said I'd be there, and I will.

393
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:38,672
Ow!

394
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:39,939
-You mean it?

395
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,205
You're not gonna have to
work like you usually do?

396
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,572
KOTETSU: Op: No way.

397
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:46,005
Tomorrow you are gonna be the
cutest little girl on stage,

398
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,839
and I'm gonna be the first
in line to see you perform.

399
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:50,472
I wouldn't miss
it for the world!

400
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,405
MRS. KABURAGI: Op: You
said that last time.

401
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,639
-Gah.

402
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:55,072
You know, you
should say something

403
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,639
when you take the phone, Mom.

404
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:57,805
-(QUIETLY) I saw you on TV.

405
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,239
Do you have to pay for all that?

406
00:16:59,272 --> 00:16:59,939
KOTETSU: Op: Heh.

407
00:16:59,972 --> 00:17:01,005
Real funny, Mom.

408
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,939
All I'm saying is
that you should really

409
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,939
try to be more careful, dear.

410
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,172
-Yeah, I know.

411
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:07,372
MRS. KABURAGI: Op: I mean it.

412
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,439
If something horrible
were to happen to you,

413
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,739
I'd have to tell little
Kaede about your work

414
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:14,172
as a superhero at your funeral.

415
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,905
She'd be so heartbroken.

416
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:17,205
-You always worry too much.

417
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,939
MRS. KABURAGI: Op:
Well, can you blame me?

418
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:22,539
A man who's away from his family
and faces criminals every day

419
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:23,805
just to make a living?

420
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,072
Of course I worry.

421
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:26,972
KOTETSU: Yeah, I know.

422
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,772
Believe me, I know.

423
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:37,239
-Huh?!

424
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:39,605
BEN: I'm sorry, Kotetsu.

425
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,039
KOTETSU: Ben?

426
00:17:41,072 --> 00:17:42,339
A buy-out?

427
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,372
-It was the only option.

428
00:17:44,405 --> 00:17:46,439
Ad revenue kept
falling and we were

429
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:50,205
lucky to find a buyer
willing to take on our debts.

430
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:50,772
Here.

431
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:51,672
KOTETSU: Huh?

432
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:53,272
Who's this Lloyds guy?

433
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,705
-Your new employer.

434
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:55,939
-Huh?

435
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:58,339
-And I would suggest you
go and pay him a visit.

436
00:17:58,372 --> 00:17:58,972
-What?

437
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:00,072
Hang on a second.

438
00:18:00,105 --> 00:18:01,639
What the hell is going on?

439
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:04,905
-Starting this next season, only
the seven biggest corporations

440
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,305
are going to be
sponsoring heroes.

441
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:10,272
Hate to say it, but our company
just dropped off the list.

442
00:18:10,305 --> 00:18:12,839
-So you're gonna
disappear, just like that?

443
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,872
-Hey, business is business.

444
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:19,239
-Do all the other
heroes know about this?

445
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:21,772
I'm the last to know.

446
00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:24,072
BEN: Sorry, old pal.

447
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:25,472
KOTETSU: What'll happen to you?

448
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,205
BEN: Oh, don't worry about me.

449
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,839
I'm going to relax,
collect my unemployment,

450
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:31,505
and look for work
in a few months.

451
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,939
-So I'll be alone
at this new place?

452
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:34,805
-You'll be fine.

453
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,939
-But Ben--

454
00:18:36,972 --> 00:18:39,705
-Times are changing.

455
00:18:39,739 --> 00:18:41,772
I'm really going to miss
being in your corner

456
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,105
and watching you fight.

457
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:44,805
Really.

458
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,272
But no matter what
happens, I'll always

459
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:49,172
be Wild Tiger's biggest fan.

460
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,039
-Hm?

461
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:02,539
Hmph.

462
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,872
-Oh!

463
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:09,605
-[humming to self] Hm?

464
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,572
This is the place.

465
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:13,072
Hm?

466
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:17,472
Hm.

467
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:23,539
I got it.

468
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,439
Unh!

469
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:26,405
[gasp]

470
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,072
-Here you go.

471
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:30,005
-Aw, thank you.

472
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,372
Um, I think you
dropped your cards.

473
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,039
-Ah!

474
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,439
Oh, those are just--

475
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,805
-It's OK, Mister.

476
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,172
I understand.

477
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:38,672
-Aha, darn.

478
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:40,172
You figured it out, huh, kid?

479
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:42,672
-You like Wild Tiger
'cause he's old like you.

480
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:46,572
-[laughs] Say what now?

481
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,505
KID: Here, you
can have this one.

482
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,605
-Uh, you should keep that.

483
00:19:49,639 --> 00:19:51,139
I'm sure it means a lot to you.

484
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:53,572
-Actually, I'm a Sky High
fan, so I don't need it.

485
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:54,572
Take it.

486
00:19:54,605 --> 00:19:55,239
-Heh.

487
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:55,739
Thanks.

488
00:19:58,605 --> 00:20:00,005
Huh.

489
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,005
That's how it is.

490
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,939
-So you're Wild Tiger.

491
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:12,505
And I see your real name here,
but how do I pronounce it?

492
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,639
-It's Kotetsu.

493
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,372
Kotetsu Kaburagi.

494
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:18,239
-Hm.

495
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:19,639
Right.

496
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:22,172
You'll be briefed on your new
suit in the design department.

497
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:23,105
-Oh.

498
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,139
I hadn't planned
on starting today.

499
00:20:25,172 --> 00:20:27,639
-Or you can just quit
if you don't like it.

500
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:28,205
-Today works.

501
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,805
Heh.

502
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,372
[alarm buzzing]

503
00:20:30,405 --> 00:20:31,205
-Huh?

504
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,272
LLOYDS: The industrial district.

505
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,772
-The Steel Hammer statue?

506
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,305
-Why is it moving?

507
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,439
-I bet a NEXT is behind this.

508
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,239
-All right, you'd
better get going.

509
00:20:42,272 --> 00:20:43,205
-Huh?

510
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,039
Oh, but I don't have
my suit with me.

511
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:45,872
-No need.

512
00:20:45,905 --> 00:20:47,305
I have your new one right here.

513
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:49,572
-Uh--

514
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:53,439
-This is a perfect chance
to debut your new look.

515
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:56,705
-I don't think I
could do that, sir.

516
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:57,272
-Really?

517
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:58,705
And why is that?

518
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:02,105
-It's just-- I've worn the
same suit my entire career.

519
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,072
LLOYDS: Don't be nervous.

520
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:04,805
The tech on this
suit is far better

521
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,772
than that old one
you're used to.

522
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:09,205
KOTETSU: Yeah, that's
not the issue here.

523
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:11,239
That costume defines my life.

524
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,505
It's everything I am as a hero.

525
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,039
A symbol of hope and justice.

526
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,005
-Just wear the thing,
or you're fired.

527
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:22,372
[sirens blaring]

528

[tires squeal]

529
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,239
-Actually, this
thing is really cool.

530
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:39,905
[rumbling]

531
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,205
-There you are.

532
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,405
Let's do this.

533
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,305
LLOYDS: There is
one other thing.

534
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,005
We've decided to partner
you up with another hero.

535
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,939
-Huh?

536
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,505
-Apollon Media is
going to sell it

537
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:52,805
as the first ever superhero
duo to take the stage.

538
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,639
-Nobody asked me about that.

539
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:56,905
-That's because you don't
have a say in the matter.

540
00:22:00,272 --> 00:22:01,739
-Where's my teammate, anyway?

541
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:04,139
And who the hell
are they giving me?

542
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,105
ROCK BISON: Aaaahhhhhh!

543
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,105
[thud]

544
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:07,572
-Unnh!

545
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:08,539
Damn, that hurt.

546
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:10,572
Guess I can't take
this guy alone.

547
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:11,305
-What?

548
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:14,072
It's you?

549
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,307
[MUSIC - AOBOZU, "HOSHI NO
SUMIKA"]

550
00:23:47,184 --> 00:23:48,284
-Hold up.

551
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:49,484
They're pairing me
with you, Rock Bison?

552
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:50,318
-Unh.

553
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:51,551
Say what?

554
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,784
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

555
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:55,118
Apollon wants you
to be my partner?

556
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:56,051
[tires squeal]

557
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,551
-You gonna talk
all day, old man?

558
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:03,918
Or are we gonna get to work?

559
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:04,684
-Gah!

560
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:05,184
No way.

561
00:24:11,251 --> 00:24:14,584
Hey, I'm Kotetsu, the bearded
member of Tiger and Bunny.

562
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:16,651
Holy crap, a statue
has gone wild.

563
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:19,384
And a NEXT could be
pulling the strings.

564
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:22,451
Next time on "Tiger and
Bunny," a good beginning

565
00:24:22,484 --> 00:24:26,284
makes a-- I can't read
this stupid thing.
