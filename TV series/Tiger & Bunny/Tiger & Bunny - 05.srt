JUDGE: We have
reached a verdict.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,300
This court finds that the
structural damages caused

by the hero known as Wild Tiger
in the filming of "Hero TV"

any civilian lives.

Therefore, Apollon Media

We're a team.

destroy buildings.

this one time.

Hercules, is currently

166
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:20,094
on display at the
Sternbild Central Museum.

167
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,661
People have been
lining up all day

168
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:23,194
to get a glimpse
of the gem, which

169
00:07:23,227 --> 00:07:26,427
is valued at roughly 6
million Stern Dollars.

170
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:27,994
-Out of my price range.

171
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,561
PAULY: I want that rock.

172
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:32,527
In fact, I've decided that's
what we're going to steal next.

173
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:34,127
-Yet another diamond, sir?

174
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,627
-Do you have a problem
with what I want?

175
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,694
-But sir, isn't your collection
already quite extensive?

176
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:40,761
-Don't you get it?

177
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,561
When it comes to
my desires, there's

178
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:43,961
no such thing as enough.

179
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:45,894
If I want something,
I will make it

180
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:49,361
mine-- that is, as long as I
have my wealth and my powers.

181
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:56,727
[laughs]

182
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,894
-You're wondering why
I called you down here.

183
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:00,961
Well, it's because
there's a dangerous gang

184
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,194
of thieves on the loose.

185
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:06,261
Are you up to catching
these guys, Bunny?

186
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,527
(FALSETTO VOICE) As
long as you're with me.

187
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:10,227
Let's do it, then.

188
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:12,627
[grunts] [groans] Look!

189
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,461
That must be one
of the thieves now.

190
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,394
Let's roll.

191
00:08:15,427 --> 00:08:16,661
-(FALSETTO VOICE) OK!

192
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:17,961
[panting]

193
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:20,527
-Get back here!

194
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:26,327
[panting]

195
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,061
-You're cornered!

196
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:33,394
-Boss, you gotta save
me from this guy.

197
00:08:33,427 --> 00:08:34,561
-Stop right there.

198
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:36,327
So you're the thief in charge.

199
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,961
-Who are you guys, anyway?

200
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:42,127
--[laughs] We don't give
our names to scum like you.

201
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,761
You guys got one more chance.

202
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:45,427
Give up or you're going down.

203
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:47,327
-You are the one who
should be giving up.

204
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,227
-What?

205
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,961
KARINA: Freeze, tough guys.

206
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:52,761
-Uh?

207
00:08:52,794 --> 00:08:53,394
-Oh, no!

208
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:54,594
We're surrounded!

209
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:56,927
-We heard that you've been
calling us scum behind

210
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:57,861
our backs.

211
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:59,261
Bit mistake, buddy.

212
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:00,727
-What should we do, Bunny?

213
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:01,994
(FALSETTO VOICE) I don't know.

214
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:02,894
I'm scared!

215
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:06,461
-[laughs] I am afraid it's over.

216
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,761
You'd better say your prayers.

217
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,361
-Save me, Bunny!

218
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:10,761
-Eat lead!

219
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:12,094
[bang]

220
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:14,061
[bang]

221
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:14,894
ALL: Happy birthday!

222
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:21,961
-And that's a wrap.

223
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,827
-Good rehearsal.

224
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:24,927
-Yeah.

225
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,294
-I think I sounded
pretty cool, huh?

226
00:09:27,327 --> 00:09:31,894
We don't give our names to scum
like you. [chuckles] Awesome.

227
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:32,727
-Yeah, yeah.

228
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,594
-What kind of feedback is that?

229
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:36,494
-Well, how do you think I did?

230
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:38,127
I threw in some brand new lines.

231
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,161
-You overdid it.

232
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:40,561
"I'm afraid it's over.

233
00:09:40,594 --> 00:09:42,361
You'd better say your prayers."

234
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,194
You're laying it on too thick.

235
00:09:44,227 --> 00:09:45,494
-Oh, sorry.

236
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:47,361
Next time I won't improvise.

237
00:09:47,394 --> 00:09:49,561
-So did you decide
on a present yet?

238
00:09:49,594 --> 00:09:51,727
-Nah, I took your
advice and asked him

239
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:54,061
what he likes wearing, but
he's kind of hard to read.

240
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,294
-I see.

241
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:56,327
Well, sorry.

242
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,161
-It's fine.

243
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,227
But thanks for the help.

244
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,094
-Huh?

245
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,394
-Maybe I'll just
give him this, hum?

246
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:04,661
-Oh, no you won't.

247
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:05,927
We chipped in for this.

248
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:07,327
It's from all of us.

249
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:10,127
Barnaby's your partner, so you
better get him something good.

250
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:10,627
-Hmm.

251
00:10:15,027 --> 00:10:16,927
BARNABY: Thanks for
doing this every year.

252
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:18,561
OLDER WOMAN (ON
MONITOR): It's nothing.

253
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:21,527
I worked for your family
for so long, dear.

254
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:24,161
Baking you a pound cake
is the least I can do.

255
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,861
For as long as I
know you, I promise

256
00:10:30,894 --> 00:10:34,294
I shall always send you
a cake on your birthday.

257
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:36,427
-Samantha, you're the best.

258
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,627
[chuckles]

259
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,161
SAMANTHA (ON MONITOR): Barnaby?

260
00:10:41,194 --> 00:10:43,027
-Oh-- uh, sorry.

261
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,961
-I'm sure that your parents
would send you their warmest

262
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:49,394
blessings, if only they
were still with us.

263
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:51,494
Have a wonderful birthday.

264
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:51,994
-Thanks.

265
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:58,227
[beeping]

266
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,461
-What do you want?

267
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:00,494
-Get over here.

268
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,661
We've got a bad
situation on our hands.

269
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,794
-Uh?

270
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,761
GUARD: Nothing over here.

271
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,494
That thing is something.

272
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,394
6 million bucks, huh?

273
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:15,427
Mm, what I could do
with that kind of dough.

274
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,327
Nothing over there.

275
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:21,127
Nothing over here, either.

276
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:21,627
Huh?

277
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,827
-Good evening.

278
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:28,327
-Uh?

279
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:28,894
Ah.

280
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,661
Ah! [screams]

281
00:11:32,694 --> 00:11:35,161
-Well, did you ever pick
out a birthday present?

282
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,227
-Sure did.

283
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,061
I gave it some thought
and realized just

284
00:11:38,094 --> 00:11:40,494
hanging out with me
is present enough.

285
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:41,427
-Are you kidding me?

286
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,194
He hates hanging out with you.

287
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:45,194
-Yeah, that's a problem.

288
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:46,961
-You should really
go buy him something.

289
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:48,594
-I would, but we're
running out of time.

290
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:49,561
-Ooh, heads up!

291
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:50,294
He's coming.

292
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:52,294
-Get into position!

293
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:52,794
Hey.

294
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:56,861
-Hey.

295
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:57,994
So what's going on?

296
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:00,727
-You're wondering why
I called you down here.

297
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,927
Well, it's 'cause there's
a dangerous gang of thieves

298
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:04,161
on the loose.

299
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:05,494
Are you up to catching them?

300
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:06,727
-I think I'll pass.

301
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,061
-Huh?

302
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,694
-I thought it might be more
of your incessant meddling.

303
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,194
That's why I only respond
to calls from headquarters.

304
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:14,094
-[grunts]

305
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:16,627
-Pickpocket!

306
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,894
What are you doing?

307
00:12:17,927 --> 00:12:19,427
-The stupid bag is stuck!

308
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:20,461
-Would you just go?

309
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:21,561
-I'm trying!

310
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,127
-That guy a friend of
yours or something?

311
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,027
-No, no, not at all!

312
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,294
Hey, that guy ran
off with my bag!

313
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:28,894
Come on, help me get him.

314
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:29,927
-No thanks.

315
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:31,061
-What are you waiting for?

316
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:31,994
Ah!

317
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:34,027
-Ah!

318
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,994
-Uh, sorry about that.

319
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,294
-What is he doing?

320
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:41,827
-Hey, I'm pretty sure that
pickpocket of yours got away.

321
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,894
-Uh?

322
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:46,727
[sigh]

323
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,861
[humming]

324
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:52,651
BARNABY: There's no way
we're going to find him.

325
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:53,951
-Just have faith.

326
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:56,084
Let's see, where was it again?

327
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:57,784
-What do you mean, where was it?

328
00:12:57,817 --> 00:13:00,351
Do you know where the guy's
secret hideout is or something?

329
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:01,617
-How would I know that?

330
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,317
It's just a feeling.

331
00:13:03,351 --> 00:13:04,951
Ah, there he is now.

332
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:05,584
Hey, you!

333
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:06,217
-Mm?

334
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,384
-Stop right there.

335
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,817
So you're the thief in charge.

336
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,051
-How did you know that?

337
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:15,884
-How did I-- um, lucky guess?

338
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,984
That dummy's
improvising lines again.

339
00:13:18,017 --> 00:13:19,484
-Who are you guys, anyway?

340
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:20,184
-Yes!

341
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,651
Now we're back on track.

342
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:22,551
-Ha-ha!

343
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,951
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha!

344
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,917
We don't just give
out our names to--

345
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:27,217
-Barnaby.

346
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:30,717
My name is Barnaby Brooks
Jr. And this is Wild Tiger.

347
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,184
I assume that
you've heard of us?

348
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,084
-You mean the heroes?

349
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:36,284
-If you're smart,
you'll surrender now.

350
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,017
Well, looks like you
can take it from here.

351
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:38,651
-Uh?

352
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:39,751
What do you mean?

353
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,551
-He's not going to
run from a superhero.

354
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:43,584
I think you can handle
this one on your own.

355
00:13:43,617 --> 00:13:44,151
KOTETSU: Wait!

356
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:45,084
Don't go yet.

357
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,517
-Stop wasting my time.

358
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:49,717
KARINA: Freeze, tough guys!

359
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,484
-Oh no.

360
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:51,817
We're surrounded.

361
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:55,084
-We heard you've been calling
us scum behind our backs.

362
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:56,451
Big mistake, buddy.

363
00:13:56,484 --> 00:13:57,251
-What do you mean?

364
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,851
We never called you scum.

365
00:13:58,884 --> 00:13:59,417
-What?

366
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,217
-They didn't?

367
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:02,484
-Ah, great.

368
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:03,184
This is a mess.

369
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,617
-Are you mocking me?

370
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:05,984
Better say your prayers!

371
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:07,517
-Ah, that's right.

372
00:14:07,551 --> 00:14:08,817
Save me, Bunny!

373
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:09,417
-Too late.

374
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:10,051
Die!

375
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:11,151
[gunshot]

376
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:11,984
[gasp]

377
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,817
[gasp]

378
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:13,617
[gasp]

379
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:14,984
-What's going on?

380
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:17,017
-That's exactly
what I want to know.

381
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,984
Were you seriously just about
to use me as a human shield?

382
00:14:20,017 --> 00:14:21,817
-Oh. [chuckles] Never mind that.

383
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,617
Hey, why did he use live rounds?

384
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:24,917
-Care to explain
to me why you're

385
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,351
talking to the criminals?

386
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:28,317
Wait, what are those?

387
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,717
BOTH: (WEAKLY)
They're our weapons.

388
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,617
-Over here!

389
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:34,484
-Finally!

390
00:14:34,517 --> 00:14:35,517
Get me out of here!

391
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,551
-That guy was a real criminal.

392
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,951
-Come on.

393
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,717
-I feel like I'm
missing something.

394
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,684
-Well, that's the
understatement of the year.

395
00:14:47,717 --> 00:14:48,651
Start talking.

396
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:50,217
What is the meaning of all this?

397
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:52,917
-Well, uh, truth
is, we were throwing

398
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,617
you a surprise birthday party.

399
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,017
-Again with your meddling.

400
00:14:56,051 --> 00:14:58,851
How many times do I have to tell
you that you have to stop this?

401
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:02,784
You always cause more problems
for people you try to help.

402
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,217
[alarm buzzes]

403
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:06,951
-Hello there, heroes.

404
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,751
New orders from
the Justice Bureau.

405
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,117
This time it's a robbery.

406
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:13,017
Get on it right away.

407
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,917
-Hey!

408
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,584
ANNOUNCER: Time for another
episode of "Hero TV."

409
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,017
We're live with a brand
new crime in progress.

410
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:23,451
And there they are--
it's Pauly and his gang,

411
00:15:23,484 --> 00:15:25,951
criminals wanted for stealing
the Tears of Hercules!

412
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:29,917
-He's a NEXT?

413
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,184
AGNES (ON COMM): That's right.

414
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:34,251
He's able to transform
his body into diamonds.

415
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:35,717
-Sounds like he's tough.

416
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,384
What's the big
plan, Little Bunny?

417
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:38,584
-I've had enough of you.

418
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:39,717
Don't bother me.

419
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:40,817
-Huh?

420
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,817
Nothing good happens
when you're involved.

421
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,317
From now on, I'm going solo.

422
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:46,551
We're no longer a team,
as far as I'm concerned.

423
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:55,284
SAITO (ON PA): Tiger and
Barnaby, you guys ready?

424
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:58,784
-You've got that mic
turned up pretty loud.

425
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,284
[zhoom]

426
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:04,251
[zhoom]

427
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,251
[zhoom]

428
00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:07,251
-Ah.

429
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:09,717
[zhoom]

430
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,217
[zhoom]

431
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:30,617
SAITO (ON PA): A little
something extra for you.

432
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,617
I heard it was
Barnaby's birthday,

433
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,084
so I modified his suit a little.

434
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,617
Tiger's, too.

435
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:37,684
-You what?

436
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:38,551
Huh?

437
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:39,184
Where is it?

438
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:39,784
What the hell?

439
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,584
ANNOUNCER: Incredible!

440
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:47,517
The King of Heroes himself, Sky
High, is first on the scene!

441
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,751
-You criminals ruined
our entire skit,

442
00:16:49,784 --> 00:16:53,751
and after I worked so
hard to learn my lines!

443
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,251
Aah!

444
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,217
Sky High!

445
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:00,717
-Aah!

446
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:04,817
-Let's go!

447
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:08,351
-Huh?

448
00:17:13,184 --> 00:17:13,651
-Huh?

449
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,117
ANNOUNCER: Wild
Tiger and Barnaby

450
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,517
have activated their powers.

451
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,917
This means they have five
minutes before their Hundred

452
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:25,451
Power wears off.

453
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:28,851
-Spread out!

454
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,317
-[grunts] Oh!

455
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:31,517
Oh!

456
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,684
ANNOUNCER: Sky High has
captured one of the thieves.

457
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:36,084
-You crossed the line this time.

458
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:37,351
-I'm sorry.

459
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:38,951
-The next one's ours, Bunny.

460
00:17:38,984 --> 00:17:39,484
Huh?

461
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:39,984
Bunny?

462
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:49,351
-Eh!

463
00:17:52,351 --> 00:17:56,251
[screams]

464
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,651
-My ice is a little cold,
but your crime has--

465
00:18:00,684 --> 00:18:01,651
-Oh, balls, I'm late.

466
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:02,117
-Huh?

467
00:18:02,151 --> 00:18:03,117
Hey!

468
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,251
At least let me
finish my catchphrase.

469
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,217
SKY HIGH: I know the feeling.

470
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,617
I also wanted to say my lines.

471
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:11,517
There I was, waiting
the whole time,

472
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:15,884
alone in some dingy
back alley, like a dog.

473
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,517
-Oh, that just sounds awful.

474
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:19,017
Why don't we make it up to you?

475
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,351
Take the last guy.

476
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,484
-Thanks, but no thanks.

477
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,517
I think it's best if
we let them handle it.

478
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,017
-Huh?

479
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,084
-Huh?

480
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:28,817
-After all, it is
Barnaby's special day.

481
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:32,451
-[grunts] Ah!

482
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:34,751
Gotcha, punk.

483
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,451
Come to Papa.

484
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,117
[grunts] Huh?

485
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:38,617
-Bye-bye.

486
00:18:44,151 --> 00:18:46,017
-Hah!

487
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:46,984
Ah!

488
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:48,351
-Hey, let go of me!

489
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:50,451
-You're not getting away.

00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:54,484
This is good.

493
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:55,651
Our powers are almost out!

494
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:56,851
-I heard her, you idiot.

495
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:59,084
And thank you for sharing
