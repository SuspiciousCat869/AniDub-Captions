1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,500
-Now that we have
your attention,

2
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,466
let us introduce ourselves.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,066
We're known as Ouroboros.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,566
The clock is ticking.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,433
If you want to save yourselves,
you know what to do.

6
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:20,033
Release one man.

7
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,666
His name's Jake Martinez.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,666
[gasp]

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,666
That's it for now.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,666
We expect to receive an
affirmative response.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,166
[theme music]

12
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,875
-This is crazy.

13
00:02:03,908 --> 00:02:06,275
Isn't there some place safe
we could move everyone?

14
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,341
-Yes, what about downtown?

15
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,208
That area hasn't been hit yet.

16
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,441
-That's right

17
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,775
-Gentlemen, that option has
already been considered.

18
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,941
We have a much more
urgent concern.

19
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:26,008
This city is built on
three separate levels

20
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,608
with a stern medial
area at its center.

21
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,408
Should the foundation
collapse, everything

22
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,508
will go down with it.

23
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,708
-They're holding the
entire city hostage.

24
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,141
We must be careful not
to do anything reckless.

25
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:39,241
-Are you saying we should
give into terrorists?

26
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,208
-We can't do something
that irresponsible.

27
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,608
-How could we find
ourselves in this position?

28
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,175
You said the heroes
would handle this,

29
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,441
that they were on top of it.

30
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:52,575
-It's horrible Miss Agnes.

31
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,808
Isn't there anything
we can do to help out?

32
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,541
AGNES JOUBERT:
Sorry, not right now.

33
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,208
-So we have to sit
by and just let

34
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:00,208
these bastards do
as they please?

35
00:03:00,241 --> 00:03:02,241
-With all our abilities,
I can't believe

36
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,808
there's nothing we can do.

37
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:04,941
-No.

38
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:06,575
I'm positive that there's
something we can do.

39
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:08,941
We just have to stand by and
wait until that time comes.

40
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:16,875
-I understand how
you feel, but don't

41
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:18,641
forget people's
lives are at stake.

42
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:21,041
-I happen to be aware of that!

43
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,341
-Come on you guys.

44
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,341
This is no time to fight.

45
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,641
-We need to pull together
as a group and stay focused.

46
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:32,641
-What's eating him today?

47
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:33,141
-Mm.

48
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,241
-Uh sorry guys.

49
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:40,108
I'm afraid I must of
gotten on his nerves.

50
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,508
-What did you say to him?

51
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,041
-Well I thought I'd tell
him how I got my code name.

52
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,841
It is kind of interesting.

53
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,708
-Huh?

54
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,808
-The ko in Kotetsu means tiger.

55
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,808
That's why I'm
called Wild Tiger.

56
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:51,308
Get it?

57
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,741
-What?

58
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,875
-Why would you bring
that stuff up now?

59
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:55,708
-Inappropriate.

60
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:58,008
No wonder the guy got so upset.

61
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,508
-Yeah.

62
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,808
I'm going to go
apologize to him.

63
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:06,341
-How could he be so oblivious
to what's happening right now?

64
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,341
-No, honey.

65
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,375
Something else is
going on there.

66
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,775
[sighs]

67
00:04:11,808 --> 00:04:13,108
-Hey Bunny.

68
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:14,508
Wait up a minute.

69
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,275
Where ya going?

70
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,675
-Sorry about that.

71
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,541
I kind of lost it back there.

72
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:22,375
I know you were only
trying to help out.

73
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:37,708
[grunt]

74
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:40,275
Right when I found the bastard.

75
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,241
-We have an emergency.

76
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:43,641
-Can't make you
out, repeat that.

77
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:46,075
-The powered exosuits destroyed
one of the support columns

78
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:46,808
in East Bronx.

79
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:55,875
[yelling]

80
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:59,375
-Sky High and Blue Rose, you
have to head to the scene

81
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,641
immediately.

82
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:02,941
-We're responding.

83
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,441
What do you want us to focus on?

84
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:06,308
-Ignore the powered exosuits.

85
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,841
You need to save people and
prevent widespread panic.

86
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,241
-I'm going with them, Agnes.

87
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,008
-I'm ordering you to stay.

88
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,375
-Why would you do that?

89
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,275
-There could easily
be another attack.

90
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:17,875
Everyone else is on standby.

91
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,708
-We should be doing
something right now.

92
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,441
What's taking so long
to make a decision?

93
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,175
REPORTER: With Sternbild on
the brink of destruction,

94
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:30,475
everyone's asking, why aren't
the city leaders and the heroes

95
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:32,608
mobilizing to fight back?

96
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:33,641
-Tiger's right.

97
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,241
We can't just wait
for the next attack.

98
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,908
KRIEM: We've been waiting.

99
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:43,075
Waiting for someone in charge
to respond to our demands.

100
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:47,008
Perhaps you don't believe
that we're serious.

101
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,141
Our next attack will be
in an hour at 11 o'clock.

102
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:55,008
We'll decide on the location
by rolling a pair of dice.

103
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,508
-I'm not waiting til then.

104
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,841
Come on, Bunny.

105
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,075
AGNES JOUBERT: Don't do this.

106
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,241
You're disobeying
a direct order!

107
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,508
-They plan to destroy
another support column.

108
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,775
-How do we know that for sure?

109
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:05,608
They could be bluffing.

110
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:06,775
-What are you talking about?

111
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:08,541
The city's already
beginning to tilt.

112
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,175
We must take action now!

113
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,041
-We can't drag this
out any longer.

114
00:06:12,075 --> 00:06:14,208
We're facing a
potential disaster.

115
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,108
You have to make a
decision, Mister Mayor.

116
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:16,775
-Huh?

117
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:18,475
-We have no choice.

118
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,375
You have to release Jake.

119
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,075
-What?

120
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:22,675
Wait just a minute here.

121
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,375
Don't put all of this on me.

122
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:26,541
-I'll accept full
responsibility if that's

123
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:28,375
what it takes to
get through this.

124
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:30,708
But you're the one who must
make the final decision.

125
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:31,841
-Yes, right.

126
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,841
But if by any chance
things go wrong.

127
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,175
-Ladies and gentlemen.

128
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,475
I've deployed Sky High and
Blue Rose as you requested,

129
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:42,775
but we have one little problem.

130
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,475
-Why the hell are you just
sitting on your asses?

131
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,975
Isn't your top priority to
save the lives of citizens?

132
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:48,675
-What?

133
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,108
What are you doing here?

134
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,475
-Listen, let us worry
about Jake and his gang.

135
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:57,175
We heroes always
come through for you.

136
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,241
-Usually.

137
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:00,975
-Then what the hell
are you waiting for?

138
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,841
You're not trying to protect
that thing of yours, are you?

139
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:07,575
-Thing?

140
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:08,741
-Can't think of the word.

141
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:11,775
Uh, self something or other.

142
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:12,675
-Self-interests.

143
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,175
-Yeah, that's it!

144
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,308
-Aha

145
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:17,675
-There's no point in
beating around the bush.

146
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,741
You all have friends
and family in the city.

147
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,608
Don't you want to protect them?

148
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,808
Then you need to make a
decision quickly and rise

149
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:27,508
above your own whatchamacallits.

150
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,741
-Self-interests.

151
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:30,108
-Thank you!

152
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,441
-I have to say, even though my
friend here wasn't very clear,

153
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:36,541
he does make a good point.

154
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:37,841
-Listen to the man.

155
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,108
He's absolutely right.

156
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,208
[gasp]

157
00:07:40,241 --> 00:07:43,408
Except he's wrong
about capturing us.

158
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:47,375
We got tired of waiting for
an answer from you big shots.

159
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:50,441
I'm here to work out the
details of your surrender.

160
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:51,841
-You're one of the Ouroboros!

161
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,641
-You can call me Hans Chuckman.

162
00:07:56,675 --> 00:07:57,908
I'm here to negotiate.

163
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:59,975
-You have some nerve,
barging into this place!

164
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,208
-Oh, really.

165
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:03,141
I don't suppose the same
could be said of you.

166
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,941
-Ugh, stop it, both of you.

167
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:07,475
People's lives are at stake.

168
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:08,475
-Sorry.

169
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:10,541
People's lives are
the top priority.

170
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,041
-I agree.

171
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,375
-Now that we've
settled that, tell me.

172
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:20,275
What have you big
shots decided to do?

173
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:23,208
-Well we thought,
in order to ensure

174
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,841
the safety of our
people, we'd like

175
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,441
you to withdraw your
powered exosuits.

176
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:28,675
-Ha, you've got
to be kidding me.

177
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,075
Apparently you don't
understand the situation.

178
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:33,541
-We were just hoping to reach
some kind of accommodation.

179
00:08:33,575 --> 00:08:35,875
-We're not making any deals.

180
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,308
You've been offered one
final chance to surrender.

181
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:39,608
-Why, funny should say that.

182
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:41,508
We were just talking about that.

183
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,708
-It's no use trying to buy time.

184
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:45,608
If we don't hear from
you before the deadline,

185
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,541
the decision is simple.

186
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:48,108
Kaboom.

187
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,475
-Residents of Sternbild, this
is an important announcement.

188
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:01,275
Your safety is our top
priority and therefore we

189
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,908
have concluded the following.

190
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,641
We are unable to defend the city
and we cannot allow any more

191
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,941
casualties.

192
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:08,875
That being said we
have decided to give in

193
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:12,375
to the enemy's demands and
release Jake Martinez at once.

194
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:13,908
-Good, should have
done that earlier.

195
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:33,008
[humming]

196
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:41,975
-Hey Jake.

197
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:44,108
I thought you were in here
for the rest your life.

198
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,741
-Want to know why I'm
being released today?

199
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,908
There's a simple answer.

200
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,541
You see, I'm Jake.

201
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,408
And you my friend are not.

202
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,775
No big deal.

203
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:58,308
I mean, the next time you see
me, we'll still be friends.

204
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,108
Wait.

205
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,141
There won't be a next time.

206
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:16,775
I kind of figured this
was your doing, Kriem.

207
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,975
-I'm sorry you had to be in
there for so long, Mr. Jake.

208
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:21,108
We were trying.

209
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:23,975
-How did you finally do it?

210
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:27,075
-I think I'll leave that
one to your imagination.

211
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:28,408
-A secret, huh?

212
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,341
I love secrets.

213
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,075
And I love a woman with secrets.

214
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:37,908
-Jake Martinez has
now been released

215
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:39,641
and is leaving the
prison in a helicopter.

216
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,508
The question is, has
destruction been averted?

217
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,275
-I guess we're all just
going to have to be patient.

218
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:50,841
-Once they've withdrawn their
forces and the people are safe,

219
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,408
then we'll make our move.

220
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,675
-It's a daring plan.

221
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,608
I hope everything goes OK.

222
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:58,675
-It will, as long as they
don't know what we've done.

223
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:06,508
-This city's still a dump.

224
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,241
Nothing's changed, I see.

225
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:15,108
How about a toast?

226
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,208
-Better not, I'm
at the controls.

227
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,875
-You're so serious, my friend.

228
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,208
-What do you think you're
going to accomplish

229
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:26,475
by keeping me here?

230
00:11:26,508 --> 00:11:28,675
The city's about to sink.

231
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,941
-We're well aware
of the problem.

232
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:32,675
That's where I come in.

233
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,741
-Sorry you have to
do this, but I'm

234
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:42,775
absolutely sure that you'll
be able to pull it off.

235
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,875
Of course, if things
go wrong, your life

236
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,308
will be in grave danger.

237
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,175
You can still--

238
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,208
-I'm fine.

239
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:51,741
After all, I am still a hero.

240
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:55,541
The fact is this is something
only I can do, right?

241
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:56,308
I'll do it.

242
00:12:00,508 --> 00:12:03,141
-Hey, Origami.

243
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:06,008
You forgot this.

244
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,808
-Thank you.

245
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,075
If something goes
wrong, contact us.

246
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,608
We'll all be standing
by to back you up.

247
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,708
-Got it.

248
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:16,875
-Our future now depends
upon your abilities.

249
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:19,208
Good luck, Origami Cyclone.

250
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:19,708
-Thanks.

251
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,241
-I've been meaning to ask,
what's the name of our pilot?

252
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:28,208
-This is Hans Chuckman.

253
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:30,408
As you've probably figured
out, he's not a NEXT,

254
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:32,541
but he believes in our cause.

255
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,508
-A regular human being?

256
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,708
That explains why
he's so boring.

257
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,175
-He wants to help us create
a Utopian nation controlled

258
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,541
by NEXTs.

259
00:12:41,575 --> 00:12:43,875
A world ruled by you.

260
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:45,208
-Ah.

261
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:49,208
I guess that means you aspire
to become a NEXT some day.

262
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,175
I'm afraid that's impossible.

263
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,441
Isn't that right Kriem?

264
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:53,841
-That's true.

265
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,508
It's too bad for you humans,
but NEXTs are God's chosen ones.

266
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:01,808
Chuckman.

267
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,908
-What is it ma'am?

268
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,941
-Since Mr. Jake has
been freed as planned,

269
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:07,675
you can now prepare to
release the hostages.

270
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,608
-Yes.

271
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,341
-Hold on.

272
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,475
Tell me about these hostages.

273
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,352
-Do you have any updates?

274
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,319
-No, sir.

275
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:25,019
There's been no
movement whatsoever.

276
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:25,519
-I see.

277
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,119
-What's happening?

278
00:13:31,152 --> 00:13:33,019
When are they going to
pull back their forces?

279
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:33,819
-Easy.

280
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:35,619
Let's not panic gentleman.

281
00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:38,819
It's only been a half hour since
Jame Martinez was released.

282
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,752
Maybe they're in the
process of mobilizing

283
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:44,319
their forces to pull out.

284
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:45,519
-I have to agree.

285
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:47,319
Our plan is right on track.

286
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:50,119
We at least need to wait until
Origami Cyclone has a chance

287
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:51,519
to contact us.

288
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,285
-He's the key to
the whole operation.

289
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,152
Do you think he's
all right out there?

290
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,452
-He's still alive.

291
00:13:56,485 --> 00:13:59,185
We're able to monitor his
vital signs through sensors.

292
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,552
We only have to worry
if that green tracking

293
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:04,485
signal turns red.

294
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,252
-Hey, what's happening?

295
00:14:06,285 --> 00:14:08,219
We kept up our end
of the bargain.

296
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:09,452
-Don't ask me.

297
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:11,685
I don't know how they think
or what they plan to do!

298
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,452
-Hey, calm down.

299
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,485
We need to trust Origami.

300
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:18,152
-I am calm!

301
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:20,252
Tell me what
Ouroboros is planning.

302
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:23,052
Answer me.

303
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,919
-Hey, you're going too far.

304
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:25,619
Cool it Bunny.

305
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,585
-I'm gonna go out
and take a break.

306
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,119
-They're not idiots.

307
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,985
They probably caught
onto your stupid plan.

308
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,052
-Please just leave me alone.

309
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:04,519
How long do you plan
on standing out here?

310
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:06,285
-(MOUTH FULL) That's
none of your business.

311
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:09,252
Just leave me alone.

312
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:13,219
-I know I must seem to
be acting irrationally.

313
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,685
-You really don't seem
much different than usual.

314
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:18,252
-When I finally see
Jake face to face,

315
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:21,485
I'm not sure I'll have
much self control.

316
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,485
-Quit worrying about it.

317
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,952
I got you covered.

318
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:27,585
I'm not going to let
you do anything stupid.

319
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,152
Relying on others for a little
help every now and then?

320
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,152
Not such a bad thing.

321
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:34,919
-Hey Kotetsu, Barnaby.

322
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:37,852
We've got some trouble.

323
00:15:37,885 --> 00:15:40,219
-Citizens of Sternbild.

324
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:42,385
Thanks for releasing me.

325
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:45,185
I speak to you
now is a free man.

326
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:46,252
-It's Jake.

327
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:49,219
-I had no idea why I
was being released.

328
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,485
No one told me it was
negotiated in exchange

329
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,052
for sparing the lives of
useless human garbage.

330
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,619
As a result, I've
made a decision

331
00:15:58,652 --> 00:16:01,652
not to release any
of the hostages.

332
00:16:01,685 --> 00:16:02,552
-What?

333
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:03,852
Am I hearing this right?

334
00:16:03,885 --> 00:16:06,719
-In other words for those of
you who are still confused,

335
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:09,385
your lives will remain
in the palm of my hand.

336
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,552
After all you'll
do anything I want.

337
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:12,852
Am I right about that?

338
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,885
I guess we're going to find out.

339
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,285
Bye-bye now.

340
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:25,185
-Well Origami's still safe.

341
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,519
Damn it, how much longer
is this all going to take?

342
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:32,185
-What's going on here?

343
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,319
Mr. Maverick?

344
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,719
-Actually we expected
this to happen.

345
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:39,019
Our plan is going just fine.

346
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:42,385
Now all we have to do is wait
for our spy, Origami Cyclone,

347
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,585
to tell us how the
powered exosuits work.

348
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,885
Then we'll know how
to attack the enemy.

349
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,819
-What?

350
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:48,919
How am I supposed
to explain this

351
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:52,052
to the people who
thought this was over?

352
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,319
This is crazy.

353
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:55,685
The population of the city
is going to be up in arms.

354
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:56,585
How am I supposed to--

355
00:16:56,619 --> 00:17:00,585
-I have a plan to address that.

356
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,219
-Mr. Mayor!

357
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:01,785
What's your plan?

358
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,385
-You'll have to
hold your questions.

359
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:09,719
Mr. Maverick is handling
everything at the moment.

360
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,485
-Mr. Maverick is?

361
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,685
You're the mayor, aren't you?

362
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,952
-Of course I am.

363
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:16,119
We'll hold an interview
after everything's resolved.

364
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,385
That'll have to do for now.

365
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,152
-The people deserve a straight
answer from their mayor.

366
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:20,119
-We have questions.

367
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:21,485
Over here, sir.

368
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,752
-Yes, we're meeting with
the press at 2 o'clock.

369
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:26,085
We'll explain what
we can at that time.

370
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,852
Hopefully that will
satisfy everyone.

371
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,952
-You wanted to see us, sir?

372
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:37,719
-Mr. Maverick's about to speak.

373
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:41,819
-As you all know, Sternbild is
undergoing a terrorist attack.

374
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,719
The mayor decided that your
lives took top priority

375
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:47,119
and therefore acted accordingly.

376
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,319
Rather than put your
family's safety at risk,

377
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,685
he decided to take the
terrorists at their word

378
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:53,085
and release their leader.

379
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,785
However, it turned out that the
terrorists couldn't be trusted.

380
00:17:55,819 --> 00:17:58,285
-Now everything's even worse.

381
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,485
[shouting]

382
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,952
-I'm sure you're angry
and dissatisfied.

383
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:04,552
So is the mayor, and
so are we, of course.

384
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,219
But shouldn't that
anger be directed

385
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,552
at Ouroboros, and its
leader, Jake Martinez?

386
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:11,452
There's a hero who's
been waiting patiently

387
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:13,819
to fight these terrorists.

388
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:17,085
I've talked to him about why
he chose to become a hero

389
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,519
and now he's ready
to reveal the reason.

390
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:21,552
-Barnaby?

391
00:18:21,585 --> 00:18:22,919
-You might not have
noticed, but he's

392
00:18:22,952 --> 00:18:26,252
the only hero whose chosen
to fight under his real name.

393
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,952
-Reveal my past?

394
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,185
-Yes and soon.

395
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:34,752
This isn't your problem
alone anymore, Barnaby.

396
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:36,885
Go public.

397
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,319
-But what about his
right to some privacy?

398
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:40,719
-I know how you
feel, but there's

399
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,119
a more pressing imperative.

400
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:43,819
The people need the
courage and spirit

401
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:46,185
to stand up to these
terrorists and Barnaby

402
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:48,419
can help them do that.

403
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,852
If you share your
thoughts with them,

404
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:53,152
I'm sure they'll be inspired.

405
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:54,919
Please reconsider.

406
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:56,519
We desperately need your help.

407
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,319
After a terrible
childhood tragedy

408
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:03,952
involving the death
of his parents,

409
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:06,219
this boy became
a hero, and chose

410
00:19:06,252 --> 00:19:08,885
to go by the name of
Barnaby Brooks Junior.

411
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,385
Taking on his father's
name was this boy's way

412
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,919
of declaring war.

413
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:16,152
War against the man who killed
his parents 20 years ago.

414
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,019
-Is that for real?

415
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:22,919
-I never knew that
was his background.

416
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:25,819
-No wonder he's so
committed to justice.

417
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:28,719
-And now he's finally
found that man.

418
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,752
He's identified the
criminal he saw murder

419
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:33,585
his parents when he was
just a child of four.

420
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,752
An innocent child.

421
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:37,852
Forever scarred by
an unspeakable act.

422
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,152
That man is Jake Martinez.

423
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,219
Barnaby Brooks is just as
angry, perhaps more angry,

424
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:44,819
than any of you.

425
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:46,352
Everything he's
done in his life has

426
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,552
been in anticipation
of this very moment.

427
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:51,785
-Uh, Mr. Brooks.

428
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:53,452
Tell us, is all of this true?

429
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,019
-It is.

430
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:03,452
Every single word of it.

431
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:05,519
I've dedicated
myself to capturing

432
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,819
Jake and his compatriots
and saving this city

433
00:20:07,852 --> 00:20:09,319
from the threat of terrorists.

434
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:12,652
[shouting]

435
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,685
-This should get
things back on track.

436
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:22,485
-That's heavy.

437
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,952
He had a tough past.

438
00:20:23,985 --> 00:20:26,585
-So that's why he's
been so dedicated.

439
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:28,585
-We need to catch Jake
for our friend Barnaby,

440
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:29,385
if nothing else.

441

-Origami?

00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:35,485
ORIGAMI CYCLONE: Yes.

444
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,852
And I need to report.

445
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:39,685
I've finally gotten
inside Jake's hideout.

446
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:40,819
-Great job, Champ!

447
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,385
And great job again.

448
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,619
ORIGAMI CYCLONE: Thanks,
but now comes the hard part.

449
00:20:44,652 --> 00:20:47,219
I've got to find the secret
behind those powered exosuits.

450
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:49,352
-Watch your back at
all times, Origami.

-Return safely and I'll
give you a big kiss.

ORIGAMI CYCLONE: Ye-- Yeah.

00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,385
Well I gotta go.

454
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,585
-I wasn't through, ah!

455
00:20:56,619 --> 00:20:59,085
-Guess it's time for us
to get ready for battle.

456
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,252
You set?

457
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:01,752
-Yeah.

458
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:05,185
This is where it all begins.

[theme music]

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,930
-Hey Chuckman,
tell me something.

466
00:22:56,964 --> 00:23:00,364
What do you think
of my new haircut?

467
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:03,097
-Well I think it looks
very good on you, sir.

468
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,464
-I think so too.

469
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:06,464
Makes me look like
one of those heroes.

470
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:07,864
Heroes are great, aren't they?

471
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,930
They look so cool.

472
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:13,064
Hey Chuckman, what do
you think of heroes?

473
00:23:13,097 --> 00:23:14,997
Right after Legend
died, all those NEXTs

474
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,597
sided with the humans.

475
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,264
It made no sense to
me back then and I

476
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,697
have to admit I don't fully
understand it even now.

477
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,430
But the bottom line
is it's awesome.

478
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,697
Awesome for them to
be such a nuisance.

479
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,297
Of course, that's not
what you and I want is it?

480
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,997
Ah!

481
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,964
Bingo!

00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:38,797
I know no one's asked you, yet.

485
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,697
But if you become a NEXT
wouldn't you want this ability?

486
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,564
Wouldn't you?

487
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:44,830
-I suppose so.

488
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:46,230
I think.

489
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:48,597
-Well he looks silly,
but I think he's useful.

490
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,330
There's no way I would
waste a power like his.

491
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,930
But the question is,
when would I use the guy?

492
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:56,264
I mean think about it.

493
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:57,997
Someone who could
shape shift like that

494
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,364
would come in pretty handy.

495
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,830
He'd be the perfect
spy, wouldn't he?

496
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,364
Hey.

497
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:05,164
What's wrong?

498
00:24:05,197 --> 00:24:07,064
You're sweating like a pig.

499
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,597
-Hi I'm Kotetsu.

500
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,297
The member of Tiger & Bunny who
squashes his burgers before he

501
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,430
eats them.

502
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:17,730
We finally come face to
face with the guy who

503
00:24:17,764 --> 00:24:19,197
killed Barnaby's parents.

504
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,197
Next time on Tiger &Bunny, take
heed of the snake in the grass.

505
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,230
Snakes.

506
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:26,597
Why'd it have to be snakes?
