Because it happened to me too.

I hated them for that.

Most of all, I hated my powers.

Then a hero called Mr.
legend came along and told

me something that
changed my life.

00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,729
He's one of those
heroes, you know?

506
00:22:05,762 --> 00:22:07,629
Oh, and you should see him.

507
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:08,429
He's so cool!

508
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:09,695
And really cute.

509
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,195
He's my new favorite
hero on the show.

510
00:22:12,229 --> 00:22:15,095
-Uh-- um-- [sigh]

516
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:18,885
who went and planted the bomb?

517
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,318
I'm right in the middle of
a freaking interview here.

00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:23,885
Next time on "Tiger and
