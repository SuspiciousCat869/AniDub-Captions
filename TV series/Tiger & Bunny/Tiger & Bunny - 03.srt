-Uh?

166
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,583
-Uh, hey, homey, you
want to, like, hang out?

167
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:08,883
-Why are you talking like that?

168
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,283
It's creepy, man.

169
00:08:10,316 --> 00:08:11,450
-Ugh, I agree.

170
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,683
AGNES: Cut!

171
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:14,616
That's going to be the
worst acting I've ever seen.

172
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,350
And just call him Barnaby, OK?

173
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,116
That's his name.

174
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,716
-I was improvising.

175
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,350
-All this scene's
about is you wanting

176
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:23,083
to spend some time with your
partner on your day off.

177
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,383
What's so hard about that?

178
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,283
Now let's try it
again from the top.

179
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:28,350
-Hey, I'm not being
paid to be an actor.

180
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,716
AGNES: You're lucky anyone's
paying you for anything.

181
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,450
-So what am I supposed to do?

182
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:34,683
-Oh, you're OK.

183
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,216
Just be yourself, that's all.

184
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,516
-Just be myself?

185
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,283
That I can do.

186
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,183
[sigh]

187
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,016
He's being himself all
right, and it's sickening.

188
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,016
KID: Go get it signed!

189
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,416
He's not gonna bite you.

190
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:56,916
-There.

191
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,483
-Thanks!

192
00:08:57,516 --> 00:08:58,850
-Now me, now me!

193
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:01,850
-Some people just have
it-- and some don't.

194
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:04,150
-What are you talking
about, you don't want it?

195
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:05,183
I'm giving it to you.

196
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,316
It's a collector's item.

197
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,350
-No thanks.

198
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,350
Wild Tiger's lame!

199
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,650
-Hey, come on, take it.

200
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,716
It's free.

201
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,983
You can exchange it
for something else.

202
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:15,016
Oh, come on.

203
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,883
CAIN: OK, hold it.

204
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,850
-Huh?

205
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:22,850
Where'd he come from?

206
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:24,150
-I don't know.

207
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:26,383
-He really thrives
on this stuff.

208
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,383
So does Origami Cyclone.

209
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,083
Hey there.

210
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,750
Are we almost done here?

211
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:31,850
AGNES: Yeah, it's late.

212
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,850
We've got to move on
to the next location.

213
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:34,683
KOTETSU: What?

214
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:35,850
There's more?

215
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:38,883
-One more, the Fortress
Tower Building.

216
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,116
The sponsor wants to get
in some free publicity

217
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,016
for its new landmark.

218
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,383
-Ah!

219
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,050
Look at that!

220
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:55,050
AGNES: Come on,
let's keep moving.

221
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,383
-Hey, wait!

222
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,116
Don't you want to
get a shot of this?

223
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,416
Look, it's Mr. Legend!

224
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,583
-There's something
wrong with it.

225
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:16,250
-Hey, is it OK to get on?

226
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,583
-Yeah, I just fixed it.

227
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:20,550
-Fixed it?

228
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,050
I thought this
place was brand new.

229
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,716
-It wasn't anything big.

230
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,416
I was just greasing the cables.

231
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:30,816
AGNES: Well?

232
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,450
We're waiting.

233
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,583
Let's go.

234
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:34,783
-Uh, you sure it's safe?

235
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:35,883
-Would you just get on?

236
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,050
-I'm telling you, it's him.

237
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:42,850
It's Barnaby.

238
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:44,083
Oh my god, he's gorgeous.

239
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:45,050
WAITRESS: Shut up!

240
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,416
[women giggle]

241
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,983
-Uh, doesn't that
make your arm tired?

242
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,383
-What do you mean?

243
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,783
-Excuse me, I was just wondering
if I could shake your hand.

244
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:54,583
-Sure.

245
00:10:54,616 --> 00:10:55,883
I'm pleased to meet you.

246
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,683
WAITRESS: Likewise.

247
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:58,116
Thank you!

248
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,450
-You're not sick of that?

249
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:00,483
-Not really.

250
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,516
Comes with the territory.

251
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,750
So then, nice view.

252
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:09,150
-Oh, yeah, it's breathtaking.

253
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,750
-What's that building there?

254
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,083
-Jeez, man, I don't know.

255
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:16,350
Where are you--
well now, let's see.

256
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:17,516
Which one?

257
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,650
-There.

258
00:11:18,683 --> 00:11:21,416
KOTETSU: Oh, that's just
your standard building.

259
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,583
BARNABY: What about that one?

260
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,350
KOTETSU: That would
be another building.

261
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,783
And you see that
thing next to it?

262
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:26,783
That's a building, too.

263
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,250
And so is that little
one down there.

264
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:30,350
In fact, most of these
things you see sticking up

265
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,450
are buildings.

266
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,150
-Will you please knock it off?

267
00:11:33,183 --> 00:11:34,383
-I thought it was going well.

268
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,150
[alarm sounding]

269
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:36,750
-Uh?

270
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,250
MAN (ON PA): Attention
all visitors.

271
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:41,516
The building's security
alarm has been activated.

272
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,650
Great.

273
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:43,750
MAN (ON PA): Remain calm
and await instructions

274
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:44,383
from our security personnel.

275
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,016
SECURITY: Follow me!

276
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,850
Please, everyone!

277
00:11:45,883 --> 00:11:47,016
We need to evacuate this floor!

278
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,416
-What's this all about?

279
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,950
A fire?

280
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:49,950
-Uh, well--

281
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:50,783
AGNES: It's OK.

282
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:52,950
They're Barnaby and Wild Tiger.

283
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,850
You know, "Hero TV"?

284
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:55,516
-Oh.

285
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,016
Well, in that case, OK.

286
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,116
Just between you and me,
we got a bomb threat.

287
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,916
-What?

288
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,150
-Where's the bomb?

289
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:02,016
-They didn't say.

290
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,683
We're still searching for it.

291
00:12:03,716 --> 00:12:05,316
-Hm.

292
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,716
-It could be some sort
of prank, I guess.

293
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,383
-Were there any demands
made by the perpetrator?

294
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,450
SECURITY: No, not
that I'm aware of.

295
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:13,616
-It might be a prank.

296
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,350
-I was just greasing the cables.

297
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:19,350
-Uh!

298
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:20,816
Be right back!

299
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,583
-Hey, where the
hell are you going?

300
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,316
-Just checking something out!

301
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,850
WOMAN: A bomb?

302
00:12:24,883 --> 00:12:27,183
Did you hear?

303
00:12:27,216 --> 00:12:28,383
-It's all right, everybody.

304
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,716
It's just a prank,
from the looks of it.

305
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,883
But they want us
out just to be safe.

306
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,450
Just think of it
as a fire drill.

307
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,383
[ding]

308
00:12:57,783 --> 00:12:58,750
-Damn!

309
00:12:58,783 --> 00:12:59,850
It's huge!

310
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:02,683
That thing could flatten
this whole building!

311

-All right, people, this way.

314
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:14,435
This way.

315
00:13:14,468 --> 00:13:15,001
Over here.

316
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:15,635
-It's all right.

317
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:16,535
No need to panic.

318
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:17,935
Everyone stay calm.

319
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:21,401
Single file down the
stairs, nice and easy.

he's a hero even when

Don't you think we should
maybe get out of here, too?

00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,001
-How much time we got?

332
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:42,801
AGNES: So it really is a bomb.

333
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:43,668
-Let's go.

334
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,168
-You!

335
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:48,968
you're both coming with me!

336
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,868
We stick to them like glue.

337
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:53,601
Don't just stand there, come on!

338
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,368
-You've got to leave
like everyone else.

339
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:55,968
-Huh?

340
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,068
No way.

341
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,901
Listen, buddy, I've
got a show to run here,

342
00:13:58,935 --> 00:14:00,035
whether you like it or not.

343
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:02,068
-You're not running this show.

344
00:14:02,101 --> 00:14:03,535
This isn't a game
anymore, Agnes.

345
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:04,868
It's the real deal.

346
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:06,535
Look, if you want
us to be heroes,

347
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,268
you've got to get out of the
way and let us do our job.

348
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:11,635
And that job's defending
the people of this city,

349
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:15,335
and that means everyone--
including you and your crew.

350
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:24,068
-Whoa, man, that was a
cool speech he made, right?

351
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:24,568
-Huh?

352
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:25,701
Whatever.

353
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:28,335
-You're forgetting we've
got a job to do, too.

354
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,468
-Hey, don't worry.

355
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,368
The old man can shoot
your footage for you.

356
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:33,368
-Huh?

357
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:33,868
-Jerk.

358
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:38,901
I'm gonna have to direct
issue from the van.

359
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:42,435
Bring it around front right now.

360
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:45,368
We now go to Fortress Tower,
where officials have confirmed

361
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:48,435
that a bomb threat was
received at 7:15 this evening,

362
00:14:48,468 --> 00:14:50,835
forcing them to evacuate
hundreds of visitors

363
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,168
from the brand new building.

364
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,201
-The latest word from
here is that everyone

365
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:56,301
has been evacuated
safely, largely

366
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:58,635
through the efforts of the
world famous heroes who

367
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:00,868
arrived quickly on the scene.

368
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,801
Authorities don't yet know
who is behind the bomb threat

369
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,668
or why the Fortress Tower
Building has been targeted.

370
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,435
They don't even know yet
whether there really is a bomb.

371
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:15,235
But meanwhile, they're
taking every precaution.

372
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:17,635
-OK, let's guess
this party started.

373
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,768
REPORTER (ON TV): And this
is certainly not the way

374
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,435
Albert Maverick envisioned
the grand opening.

375
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:23,435
-Can't wait to see if they'll
pull this off. [laughs]

376
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:29,101
WILD TIGER: So,
any ideas, Bunny?

377
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:32,535
[beeping]

378
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,068
While we're waiting,
tell our viewers

379
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,968
what hair product you use.

380
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,135
-What made you think that
the bomb was here, anyway?

381
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:40,135
-Oh, it just seemed strange
that they were still

382
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:42,868
working on the elevator after
the building had opened.

383
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:43,868
-Is that all?

384
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,235
-You saw that guy.

385
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,601
That workman.

386
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,835
He was way too clean to have
been greasing cables all day.

387
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,501
His clothes were spotless.

388
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:54,368
-Years and years of honing your
skills have paid off, I see.

389
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:56,901
-Uh, hey, it hasn't been
that many years, OK?

390
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,068
So, seriously, you got a plan?

391
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:00,568
-Yeah, to be careful.

392
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,068
You're lucky you didn't set it
off when you barged in here.

393
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:04,301
-Heh.

394
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:06,968
-Fortunately, I've had some
experience with devices

395
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,301
like this.

396
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,068
-You're kidding me.

397
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:09,535
You have?

398
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,068
Really?

399
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,468
How is that?

400
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:15,368
-It's part of what I consider
to be basic training for a hero.

401
00:16:15,401 --> 00:16:16,968
(MOCKING) It's part
of what I consider

402
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:21,135
to be basic training for a hero.

403
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:22,568
Hm.

404
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:23,168
Well, OK.

405
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:24,468
Fine.

406
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:28,801
Then I guess I'll just sit
back and watch the master work.

407
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:29,935
-What are you doing?

408
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:31,201
-Well, what do you think?

409
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:33,435
You were the one who
stuck me with the camera.

410
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:35,335
-Look, I can handle
this by myself.

411
00:16:35,368 --> 00:16:37,168
Why don't you get out
of here while you can?

412
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,735
-Yeah, right, like I'd
just run off and ditch you.

413
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,601
What kind of a jerk
do you think I am?

414
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,501
Don't answer that.

415
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,468
-Anyway, that's touching,
but if I were in your place,

416
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,568
I'd ditch me.

417
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:48,835
-Well, I'm not you.

418
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:51,101
Look, don't go getting the
idea it's 'cause I like you

419
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,368
or trust you or anything.

420
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:54,368
It's just that I've got
standards too, you know?

421
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,835
And one thing a hero doesn't
do is run away when the going--

422
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:58,035
-OK, I got it.

423
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,735
Now can you just keep
quiet for a little while?

424
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,801
-Fine, fine.

425
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:02,868
Not a problem.

426
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,768
[beeping]

427
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:12,601
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): You can
feel the tension in the air.

428
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:14,401
Still no word from
inside the building,

429
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:16,501
where our heroes,
Barnaby and Wild Tiger,

430
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,435
are attempting to
defuse the bomb.

431
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,268
And keep in mind, they're
facing this danger

432
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:22,968
without the protection
of their hero suits.

433
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,868
Time's running out on this,
the first-- and hopefully not

434
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:29,201
the last-- real test of Apollon
Media's two-man team of crime

435
00:17:29,235 --> 00:17:29,968
fighters.

436
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:31,168
While we wait--

437
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:32,968
It's such a shame we're
not getting any live feed

438
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:35,135
from that camera
inside the building.

439
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:39,001
We're just repeating the same
boring footage over and over.

440
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,568
I've been thinking--
wasn't it Wild Tiger

441
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:44,601
who supposedly found the bomb?

442
00:17:44,635 --> 00:17:46,768
Well, we know he hasn't
been happy playing Barnaby's

443
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:50,168
sidekick, so what if he made up
the story for a publicity stunt

444
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:50,835
or something?

445
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:51,735
-Will you be quiet?

446

ROCK BISON (VOICEOVER): Don't
get yourself killed, Kotetsu.

[beeping]

448
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:22,001
-Hey, are you almost done?

449
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,901
You do realize we're
way past the point

450
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,035
where we could get
to safety, right?

451
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:27,035
-Yes.

452
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:28,335
-You did it?

453
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,768
-I've only disconnected
the conductor.

454
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:31,735
So now--

455
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:32,701
-What?

456
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,435
-I have to avoid the trap.

457
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:35,801
-Huh?

458
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:38,068
-There are two wires, one above
and one below the detonator.

459
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:38,968
-Oh.

460
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,535
Well, isn't that just wonderful?

461
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:41,735
-I've got a choice.

462
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:44,601
Cut the correct one and
the bomb will be diffused.

463
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:45,768
-Yeah, I know, I know.

464
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,168
Stop milking it.

465
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:49,135
And if you cut the wrong one,
we'll be blown to bits, right?

466
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:50,801
-Yeah, that's about it.

467
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:52,201
WILD TIGER: Go high or go low.

468
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:54,601
Oh, wow, this is such a cliche.

469
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,301
So which one is it?

470
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,668
-If I knew, I would
have cut it already!

471
00:18:58,701 --> 00:18:59,768
-I say go high.

472
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:00,968
-Excuse me?

473
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:01,835
-Cut the top one.

474
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:03,468
-Oh, man, not your gut again.

475
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,368
-Hey, my gut's got a
pretty good record.

476
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:06,935
-So far, it's 0 and 1.

477
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,935
-OK then, Mr. Logic,
which one's the right one?

478
00:19:09,968 --> 00:19:12,535
-I'm trying to figure that
out, if you'd just shut up.

479
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,601
-Well, cut one of them.

480
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:14,801
Hurry up!

481
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:15,768
[beep and buzz]

482
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:16,768
-Uh!

483
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,235
-Gah!

484
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:20,701
-The bottom or top?

[sirens]

488
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:54,401
So tell me, what was it that
made you finally listen to me?

489
00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:56,535
BARNABY: I don't
know, a snap decision?

00:19:56,568 --> 00:19:58,735
Seemed like the right
thing to do at the time.

491
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:02,335
-So, you went off your gut.

492
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,535
Put us in a
real-world situation,

493
00:20:04,568 --> 00:20:06,735
and I say we make
a pretty good team.

494
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,868
BARNABY: Well, don't
go getting too excited.

495
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,401
-Huh?

496
00:20:14,435 --> 00:20:16,601
-I'm still not
looking for a partner.

497
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:19,035
And if I were, it
wouldn't be you.

498
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:22,735
WILD TIGER: You know, for a
bunny, you're not so cute.

499
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,335
-What?

ANNOUNCER: We can
finally show you

501
00:20:25,768 --> 00:20:28,535
footage of exactly what
happened inside the building.

502
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:33,435
-Go high!

503
00:20:33,468 --> 00:20:35,968
Unh!

504
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:40,235
ANNOUNCER: Take Wild
Tiger's furious fists

505
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:42,835
and Barnaby's
explosive footwork--

506
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,201
-Haaahh!

507
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,701
Unh!

AGNES: Right, a winning team.

00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:05,601
Except for the fact that
they hate each other.

513
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:07,301
MARY ROSE: Speaking
of which, what

514
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,068
do you want to do
with this footage?

515
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,668
-Well, we're sure as
hell not gonna air it.

516
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:13,801
BARNABY: Great idea, old
man, blowing the roof

517
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:15,201
off the whole building.

518
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:16,535
Couldn't just open a window?

519
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:17,368
-Shut up!

520
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,568
What took you so long?

521
00:21:18,601 --> 00:21:20,135
That's what I can't figure out.

522
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:21,868
I was nearly caught
in the explosion.

523
00:21:21,901 --> 00:21:23,768
BARNABY: Maybe
that was the idea.

524
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:24,803
-That's it!

525

-I'll have what he's having.

528
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:11,183
-So you saw the bomber, right?

529
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,017
What'd he look like?

530
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,917
-He was just your average
bad guy, that's all.

531
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,850
-That's it?

532
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:21,483
-But that sure was
no average bomb.

533
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,183
It was C9.

534
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:27,617
-But that's the most
sophisticated explosive around.

535
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,150
How'd he get his hands on that?

536
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:31,017
-It's a mean and
ugly world out there.

-Barnaby?

He's a great guy and
a terrific partner.

Hey, this is

of Tiger and Bunny

who puts mayonnaise
on everything.

OK, so Blue Rose has a
nice voice, but how come

557
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:20,145
she's hung up her uniform?

558
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:22,579
Is she really gonna
quit being a hero?
