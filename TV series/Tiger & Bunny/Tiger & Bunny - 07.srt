BARNABY: This is your fault.

None of this would have happened
if you hadn't gotten in my way

00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,966
I was this close to
uncovering the Ouroboros.

I understand that this
is personal for you,

16
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:35,565
but you lost control.

17
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,965
And a suspect in our custody
got killed because it.

18
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:38,865
You know that, right?

19
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,098
Will you fill us in?

20
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,431
Why did you lose it on that
perp in the first place?

is this Ouroboros?

I think Ouroboros is
the crime syndicate that

murdered my parents.

28
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,398
And that perp had their
symbol tattooed on his neck.

-Tattoo?

30
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,465
Does that mean the bomber creep
was a member of Ouroboros?

And how did he just show up
out of nowhere like that?

34
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,731
-Well, judging from that
insane power of his,

35
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,298
I bet he's the one
we're looking for,

Barnaby has been nothing but

my thunder out there.

KARINA: Hey, I did you a favor
filling in at the last minute.

149
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,465
So what happened?

150
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:59,065
You two have another
lover's quarrel?

151

-Oh, you mean Bunny?

152
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,931
This time, it has
nothing to do with me.

-Fine.

154
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,531
Don't tell me then.

155
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:06,365
-Hey, wait.

156
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,298
Do you have feelings for him?

157
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:08,865
-No.

158
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,065
Absolutely not.

ANNOUNCER: And now,
the main event.

161
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:16,398
A surprise live concert
by our superstar guest,

162
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:19,231
the Ice Queen
herself, Blue Rose.

163
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:20,098
-You heard him.

Now get off my stage.

166
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:25,331
-Anyway, I'm sure Bunny
would have thanked you.

167
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,165
-I didn't do it for him, dummy.

168
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:29,631
Now, beat it.

169
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:33,665
-Hey Tiger--

170
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,098
-Hm.

171
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:37,898
-Why didn't you kill them?

172
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,431
-Why didn't I kill who?

173
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:40,898
-Those bad guys.

174
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:44,098
Why didn't you take them
out when you had the chance?

175
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:45,665
-It's not that simple.

176
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:46,998
Hey, I made the arrest.

177
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,698
Doesn't that count
for something?

178
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:52,431
-The good guys are supposed
to kill the bad guys.

179
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:56,698
-Little punk got me
in the same spot.

180
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:57,665
[sigh]

181
00:10:02,898 --> 00:10:05,165
MAVERICK: That charity
event raised a lot of money

182
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:06,498
for a good cause.

183
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:07,731
Nice work.

184
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:09,265
-What?

185
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,398
Oh.

186
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:11,931
-Show some respect.

187
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,031
That's not how
you greet our CEO,

188
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:16,031
or have you forgotten that
this is the person who

189
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:19,365
took a chance on you when
nobody else wanted to hire you?

190
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:20,998
-Oh, that's right.

191
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,465
He did, didn't he?

192
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,798
Thanks a bunch.

193
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:25,598
You rock.

194
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,298
-Were you raised by animals?

195
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,331
-Don't worry, Lloyds.

196
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,731
It's fine.

197
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:32,498
I'm the one who barged into the
man's dressing room unannounced

198
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,065
in order to thank him.

199
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,431
-I was just doing my job.

200
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:39,998
-I also wanted to ask if
you're busy later this evening.

201
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,165
-Me?

202
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:43,065
-Yes, I'd like to take
you somewhere special

203
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:46,131
as a sign of appreciation
for all the hard work you do.

204
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:47,765
-Oh.

205
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,898
OK.

206
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:53,165
So this is where
you're taking me?

207
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:56,065
-You're looking at a highly
concentrated oxygen chamber

208
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:58,231
that Dr. Saito
recently developed.

209
00:10:58,265 --> 00:10:59,931
A prototype anyway.

210
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,731
It's supposed to
restore your health.

211
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:04,398
And I thought this would be a
good chance for the two of you

212
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,665
to test it out.

213
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,198
-The two of us?

214
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,098
Me and Doc Saito?

215
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:13,065
Bunny?

216
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:14,531
What are you doing here?

217
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,798
-I was invited, like you.

218
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,031
-By Mr. Maverick?

219
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,098
-Our young Barnaby has
been exhausted lately.

220
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:24,065
He needed to take a break.

221
00:11:24,098 --> 00:11:27,165
I apologize that you had
to handle those criminals

222
00:11:27,198 --> 00:11:29,031
without your partner today.

223
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:29,765
-Oh.

224
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:30,598
No problem.

225
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,865
Just another day at the office.

226
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,431
SAITO (OVER SPEAKER):
So how does it feel?

227
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,431
Your body seems
lighter doesn't it?

228
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:46,365
Like you're drifting
off to a blissful sleep.

229
00:11:46,398 --> 00:11:47,898
-I just got in the damn tank.

230
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:49,931
SAITO (OVER SPEAKER): Are
you getting sleepy yet?

231
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:51,765
Well, how about now?

232
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:52,665
Are you sound asleep?

233
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:53,731
-Grr.

234
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:55,098
SAITO (OVER
SPEAKER): Hey, Tiger.

235
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,265
Are in dream land?

236
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,531
Is it relaxing?

237
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:58,431
Tell me.

238
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:01,698
-I can't sleep with you yelling.

239
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:04,731
MAVERICK (OVER SPEAKER):
Can you hear me, Barnaby.

240
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,398
I understand how
frustrated you must be.

241
00:12:07,431 --> 00:12:10,565
But if you give up now,
your goal will elude you.

242
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,298
You won't have closure.

243
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,965
-Sir, the trouble I've
caused, I'm sorry.

244
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:18,231
MAVERICK (OVER SPEAKER): Just
close your eyes and rest.

245
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:20,598
You'll get another
chance soon enough.

246
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:21,698
-Thank you.

247
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:23,098
MAVERICK (OVER SPEAKER):
Good night, Barnaby.

248
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,867
[alarm sounding]

249
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,400
-I was so close.

250
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,900
ANNOUNCER: Calling
Tiger and Barnaby.

251
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:05,200
It's show time.

252
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,967
Report immediately to
the abandoned church

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,233
site located in
the downtown area.

254
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:10,300
I repeat.

255
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,967
Calling Tiger and Barnaby.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,900
It's show time.

257
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,067
-Been waiting long?

258
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
-This time it's not a show.

259
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:27,267
We've got the real deal here.

260
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,433
-I figured.

261
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:30,200
-Apparently, the cops
are going to raid

262
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,033
the hideout of some
crime syndicate

263
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,667
they've been watching.

264
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,500
-Crime syndicate.

265
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,433
-We're going live.

266
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:43,667
No tape delay?

267
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,933
-It'll be a sensation.

268
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,967
Our ratings are going
to go through the roof.

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,367
-But ma'am, this is supposed
to be a surprise operation.

270
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,667
Isn't airing it live going
to tip off the criminals?

271
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,200
-Not if we get really creative.

272
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:56,867
Come on.

273
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,233
Let's live a little.

274
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:00,267
BARNABY: Standby?

275
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
KOTETSU: Yep.

276
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,300
BARNABY: Why is
she making us wait.

277
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,567
The hideout is right down there.

278
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,833
KOTETSU: The hell if I know.

279
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:07,767
She just said to sit
tight and wait for orders.

280
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,533
-The Justice Bureau
gave us approval.

281
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,067
We've set up a direct line
of contact to the police.

282
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,733
Once the heroes are
in position, they'll

283
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,367
all move in on my command.

284
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:27,367
At that instant, you roll the
cameras, and Hero TV goes live.

285
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,433
-I get it.

286
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,300
So they won't have
enough time to escape.

287
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,933
I got to admit, the audience
is going to eat it up.

288
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,800
-Are you getting excited?

289
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,700
-[gulp] No.

290
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:40,067
-Hello, heroes.

291
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,533
We know there are five criminals
hold up in that church.

292
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,233
They are heavily armed
and very dangerous.

293
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,033
There may also be NEXTs.

294
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,933
So watch out.

295
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:56,167
Just in case, the police
have set up roadblocks

296
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,967
and sealed all entry
points around the area.

297
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,333
Listen.

298
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,167
The police have spent months
tracking down this syndicate.

299
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,967
You cannot let them get away.

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,667
Hero TV's reputation
is at stake.

301
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,000
Or to put it another way,
do a good job and you'll

302
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,800
rack up a huge amount of points.

303
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,733
-Hey, you hear that?

304
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:19,100
I bet you're happy now.

305
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:22,200
Yeah, well, I guess
points aren't everything.

306
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:23,800
You know if those
guys in the hideout

307
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,800
are from Ouroboros, that
NEXT with the blue flames

308
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,800
might make an appearance.

309
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,733
He's been dropping criminals
one by one, keeping them quiet.

310
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,533
Almost like he's cleaning
house for his organization.

311
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't you think?

312
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:41,033
-I'm surprised you figured
that all out on your own.

313
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:44,333
-Well, Fire Emblem kind
of helped, a little.

314
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,267
-Of course, he did.

315
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,833
-Look.

316
00:15:46,867 --> 00:15:48,133
I get it, Bunny.

317
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,800
I know how bad you want to
go in and get your revenge,

318
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,400
but an order's an order.

319
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:56,133
-I don't need lessons on
professionalism from you,

320
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,700
but you can save the sympathy.

321
00:15:58,733 --> 00:15:59,200
-Good talk.

322
00:15:59,233 --> 00:15:59,767
Good talk.

323
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:05,933
AGNES: Right.

324
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,400
Then, we'll proceed.

325
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:10,033
Everyone's in position.

326
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,667
I'm going to change things up.

327
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,400
For this mission, open all
com channels to the heroes.

328
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,567
-On it.

329
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,200
AGNES: The second
this commercial ends,

330
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,000
we're on the air.

331
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,100
-Hey, Bunny.

332
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:28,667
If that NEXT does show up,
are you, uh-- you know.

333
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,167
-What?

334
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,667
-Hey, what the
hell just happened?

335
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
NATHAN (ON INTERCOM): Is
that who I think it is?

336
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,667
KOTETSU: It's him.

337
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:52,900
[shouting]

338
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,267
-He's egging us on.

339
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,333
ANTONIO: Where are
you going, Kotetsu?

340
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,133
-Where do you think?

341
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,500
I'm going to save people.

342
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,533
Hey, Bunny, we've got
the hideout covered.

343
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,867
You go after the NEXT.

344
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,233
NATHAN (ON INTERCOM): Teach
that wannabe a lesson for me.

345
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,133
-Whoa.

346
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,433
-You'll never take us
alive, you bastard.

347
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,800
-What are you, nuts?

348
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,367
We're here to protect you.

349
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,167
-OK.

350
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,133
We're back from commercial.

351
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:27,533
What do we do about
the broadcast?

352
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,000
Should we call it off?

353
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,067
-Not a chance.

354
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,633
-But, ma'am.

355
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:31,900
-Roll cameras.

356
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:34,033
I want those ratings.

357
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,167
Think about it.

358
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,633
Heroes trying to protect
the very criminals they

359
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,433
were sent to arrest.

360
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,400
You can't buy drama like that.

361
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,333
LUNATIC: My fellow heroes.

362
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:15,067
I do hope you can hear me.

363
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,167
-Hey, who was that?

364
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,800
-Ignore him.

365
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,033
Just stay on task.

366
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,667
LUNATIC: The justice
you seek is nothing

367
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,100
more than a hollow fallacy.

368
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
COMPUTER: Good Luck Mode.

369
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,333
LUNATIC: You call
yourselves heroes,

370
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:12,800
but you can neither
save nor punish anyone.

371
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,800
Your so called bravery
is all in vain,

372
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,367
why do you even bother trying?

373
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,567
-Come on.

374
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,867
LUNATIC: If you
want true justice,

375
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,867
only I can give it to you.

376
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:38,500
What a shame.

377
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,767
Is the show already over?

378
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,733
-Are you part of Ouroboros?

379
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,000
Tell me.

380
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:48,433
-And if I were, what
would you do to me?

381
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,533
Catch me and rip off my suit?

382
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,833
Tear my body limb from limb.

383
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:54,400
-Damn you.

384
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,133
-Ah.

385
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,700
There's the answer I expected.

386
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:08,067
I understand that the justice
you and your hero pals believe

387
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,100
in only takes you so far.

388
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:13,367
It's all a facade.

389
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,967
My name is Lunatic,
and you'll see,

390
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,900
I follow my own code of justice.

391
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,067
KOTETSU: Not today,
you psycho bastard.

392
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,433
You call what you do justice?

393
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,433
Well, I got another word for it.

394
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:36,933
Murder!

395
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,433
-Murder?

396
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,100
You have a peculiar way
of looking at things.

397
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:45,900
-Yeah.

398
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:47,300
Well, your face is peculiar.

399
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,967
What the hell's that
on your head, a glove?

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,433
-So you're Wild Tiger.

401
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:53,767
I'll be sure to remember you.

402
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,533
-Hey, get back here.

403
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:04,633
LUNATIC: Don't worry.

404
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,800
We'll meet again.

405
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,400
Where there is
darkness in the world,

406
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:12,700
I'll be there to snuff it out.

407
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:13,367
-Dammit.

408
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,900
I let him get away.

409
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,867
-Don't give up just yet, Bunny.

410
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,933
After all, we have a lead.

411
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,433
Rock Bison just called
in from the hideout.

412
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:25,733
He managed to capture one
of the criminals alive.

413
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:38,695
[theme music]

414
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,098
-So did he have one
of those tattoos?

415
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:15,831
Ah, dammit.

416
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,865
Then whatever that
crime syndicate was,

417
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:19,898
it wasn't part of Ouroboros.

418
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,598
-There's no point beating
ourselves up over it.

419
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:24,765
We'll just have to
wait till he wakes up,

420
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,265
and then ask more questions.

421
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,998
-Hey, you're taking this
better than I thought.

422
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:32,231
But if that NEXT wasn't
trying to silence him,

423
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:34,931
then what was he trying to do?

424
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:38,065
-The good guys are supposed
to kill the bad guys.

425
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:41,198
-I follow my own
code of justice.

426
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:41,665
-Lunatic.

427
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:46,831
-Sir, I apologize
for all the trouble.

428
00:23:46,865 --> 00:23:48,231
I realize you're very busy.

429
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:48,798
-No.

430
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:49,665
It's fine.

431
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:51,231
This is just part of my job.

432
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,665
-Being a judge sounds
like a tough gig.

433
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,531
I mean you got to sit through
all those boring trials.

434
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,465
-Well, we judges
are here to serve

435
00:23:58,498 --> 00:24:01,365
the Justice Bureau,
just like you.

436
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,465
If there's anything
else I can do for you,

437
00:24:04,498 --> 00:24:06,598
please don't hesitate to ask.

438
00:24:06,631 --> 00:24:07,431
I'm here to help.

439
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:13,431
BARNABY: Hi, I'm Barnaby,
the member of Tiger and Bunny

440
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,498
who owns five pairs
of the same glasses.

441
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:16,498
What?

442
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:17,998
A hero campaign?

443
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:18,765
Hold on.

444
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:20,365
With these people?

445
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:23,998
Next time on "Tiger & Bunny,"
"There is Always a Next Time."

446
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,531
See ya.
