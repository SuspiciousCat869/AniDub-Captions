Well done.

held on to the top spot

until the day he died.

ruin your moment.

this without your help, Kotetsu.

He's been like a father to me
for as long as I can remember.

-What do you mean?

101
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:21,994
-Well, Mr. Maverick and my
parents were very good friends.

102
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:23,461
He would look after
me whenever they

103
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:24,861
were tied up with
their research.

104
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:32,061
He was always there for
me, whenever I needed him--

105
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:35,661
even on that fateful
Christmas Eve, 21 years ago.

It's all right, you
won't ever be alone, son.

BARNABY: After that,
I was an orphan,

-Starting today, this is
going to be your home.

I was his own son.

-Oh.

117

-Even when I was
at boarding school,

118
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,927
he was always
looking out for me.

-This bright young man has just
won the approval of the bureau,

120
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:40,027
so you'll all be seeing
a lot more of him.

123
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:45,927
BARNABY: And he knew
I was determined

124
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:48,394
to find my parents'
killer, so he encouraged

125
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:52,161
me to become a hero, then he
pulled all the right strings.

126
00:07:52,194 --> 00:07:55,794
Without Mr. Maverick, I
wouldn't be here today.

-That's a hell of a story.

128

-Until now, my only goal in life
has been to avenge my parents.

129
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:06,161
But after all this time,
I finally have a new one.

-Huh?

131
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,627
-I want the hero
business Maverick

and better than ever.

it happen to show

my gratitude for everything
he's done for me over the years.

135
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:19,127
I guess that you could
say it's my dream.

-And what about
yourself, Kotetsu?

139

-Huh?

140
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:24,961
-You must have a dream too?

141
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,227
-Uh--

You know, I'm glad you asked,
'cause I do-- a big one.

I want my kid to think
her old man is cool.

-Hey!

147
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,127
What exactly is it you're
trying to say, huh?

148
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:42,561
-Just that there's a difference
between having a dream

149
00:08:42,594 --> 00:08:43,761
and sentimental pining.

150
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:44,961
-Aw, shut it.

151
00:08:44,994 --> 00:08:47,727
I'm not gonna judge
myself by your standards.

152
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,394
As far as I'm concerned,
it's an awesome dream.

153
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:54,661
-I hope you're able to
get your wish someday.

154
00:08:54,694 --> 00:08:57,394
-Uh, I don't think that'll
be happening anytime soon.

00:10:03,194 --> 00:10:04,661
years.

166
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,527
Due to the fact that
all of Benoit's targets

167
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:09,727
have been women, he has aptly
been dubbed the Lady Killer.

168
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:11,061
-Real charmer, huh?

169
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:12,727
And you mentioned it
was a civilian who

170
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,827
spotted him and
tipped off the police.

171
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:15,927
YURI: That's right.

172
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,261
We're currently
following up on the lead.

173
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:20,294
-Time is of the essence here.

174
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,127
We need to have the heroes deal
with this in proper fashion

175
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,861
before Lunatic kills him.

176
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:25,361
-Yes.

177
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,668
WOMAN 1: What?

178
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:34,721
You're the Lady Killer?

179
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:36,255
WOMAN 2: Oh, he's just joking.

180
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:37,055
[chuckling]

181
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,821
-Of course I'm joking.

182
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:40,488
Say, uh--

183
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:41,721
WOMAN 1: Whoa!

184
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:44,055
-Either of you ladies
up for a little fun?

185
00:10:44,088 --> 00:10:45,221
[giggling]

186
00:10:45,255 --> 00:10:46,888
-Trying to buy yourself a woman?

187
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,721
You're such a bad boy.

188
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:50,788
-Yeah, but you like
bad boys, don't you?

189
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,255
[groaning]

00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:07,255

00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:19,455
-Don't you look at me like that.

198
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:21,788
I know what you're thinking,
that I'm some useless,

199
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:25,088
broke down old loser, huh?

00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:29,721

00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:36,188
Get away from her!

206
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:36,688
[groaning]

207
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,188
-Oh!

208
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,588
Oh my god!

209
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:40,255
[groaning]

210
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:40,988
-You little shit!

211
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,021
Heh.

212
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:47,988
Huh?

213
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,355
[growling]

214
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:55,755

[panting]

218
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,555
MOTHER: How is it?

219
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:11,988
Is it good?

220
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:14,055
A little bland, you say?

221
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,755
Yes, of course.

222
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:17,888
Ah, Yuri, my dear.

223
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,155
Would you pass me the vinegar?

224
00:12:19,188 --> 00:12:21,755
I can't quite reach it.

225
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:23,021
[chuckling]

226
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:25,588
Don't mind Yuri, dear,
he's just rebelling a bit.

227
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,955
You know, boys will be boys.

228
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:28,921
Oh--

229
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,321
[grunt]

230
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:34,555
YURI: Don't make me
repeat myself, mom.

231
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,888
Dad has been dead for years.

232
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,821
-And it is all because of you!

233
00:12:42,855 --> 00:12:45,621
He was just going
through some hard times.

234
00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:47,588
He would have
eventually gone back

235
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:50,421
to being the father
he once used to be.

236
00:12:50,455 --> 00:12:51,988
But you!

237
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,821
It's all your fault!

238
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:57,288
You!

239
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,755
You!

240
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,255
Why are you giving me that look?

241
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:04,588
Are you going to kill me too?

242
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:06,521
You're horrible!

243
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,955

00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:16,455

[phone ringing]

246
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:34,621
JACKSON: Over here.

247
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,421
-Ah.

248
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:36,855
-Hey.

249
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:38,488
-Funny to see you on
this side of town.

250
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,421
Heh heh.

251
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,721
Uh, hey, I'll have
a Legends Cola.

252
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,055
So, what'd you want
to talk to me about?

253
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:46,188
-Brace yourself.

254
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:47,555
I went ahead and
did some digging

255
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,055
to see what I could uncover
about NEXT that might have lost

256
00:13:50,088 --> 00:13:54,221
their powers and I came
across something really big.

257
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,721
-What is it?

258
00:13:56,755 --> 00:14:01,255
-Well, I hate to tell you
this, but as it turns out,

259
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:04,388
Legend also suffered a
decline in his powers.

260
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:06,255
-Say what?

261
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:06,755
-Uh.

262
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:10,388
-(HUSHED) Hey, come on.

263
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,488
Keep it down.

264
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:13,588
-Uh-- yeah, sorry.

265
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:14,221
Uh-- oh!

266
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,488
Hey, Legends Cola.

267
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:15,988
Thanks.

268
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:22,388
There's just no way
that can be true.

269
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:24,188
Do you have any proof?

270
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:25,855
-I recently spoke
with a guy that

271
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:28,388
was a hero during
Legend's time and he

272
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:30,488
had no reason to lie to me.

273
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,855
-That's crazy.

274
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:33,688
Legend set a record that no
one could touch for years, Ben.

275
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,455
A hero like that wouldn't be--

276
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:36,988
-Trust me, I know how you feel.

277
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,621
When I first found
out, I certainly

278
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:40,588
didn't want to
believe it either.

279
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:42,588
Apparently, when his
power started to go,

280
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:45,455
they began staging the
program on a regular basis.

281
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:47,788
They'd let the other heroes
do the work rounding up

282
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,255
the criminals and then
give to the actual credit

283
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:51,955
for making the arrest.

284
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,855
-Are you serious?

285
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:56,355
-Not only that, they
even went as far

286
00:14:56,388 --> 00:15:00,121
as erasing any arrest records
that made him look bad.

287
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,988
-So that's why there
were no records on Jake.

288
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:06,055
-With his powers declining,
I guess he had no choice.

289
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:08,155
Otherwise, it would have
been impossible to remain

290
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:09,855
at the top.

291
00:15:09,888 --> 00:15:12,521
I'm told that Legend
was torn up about it.

292
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:16,688
They say he drowned
himself in alcohol.

293
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,821
So, how are you holding up?

294
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:20,521
You notice any decline
in your powers?

295
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,021
-Yeah, sort of.

296
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,588
-I see.

297
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,788
Look, let me give
you some advice.

298
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:31,888
You should start thinking
about what to do with your life

299
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,288
before you end up like Legend.

300
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:37,055
-I don't want to
quit being a hero.

301
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:38,021
-Hey, come on.

302
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,555
I don't want you
to quit, either.

303
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,421
But you and I both
know you can't

304
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:42,721
continue this work forever.

305
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:48,121
Listen, I'm saying
this for your own good.

306
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,255
-I'm not done yet!

307
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:56,488
[sigh]

308
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,221
-That makes you a hero too.

309
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:10,121
[chuckling]

310
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,721
-Yuri, if you ever see people
doing wrong in this world,

311
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,455
you mustn't turn a blind eye.

312
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:36,988
You have to be strong someday
so you can punish evil.

313
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:38,821
-OK.

314
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:42,321
-You'll be a chip off
the old block, son.

315
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,588
[gasp]

316
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:44,655
Why?

317
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:46,721
Why are my powers slipping away?

318
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,155
-It's going to be
all right, dear.

319
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,321
You've done more than
enough for this city.

320
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:51,021
-Shut up!

321
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,355
You don't understand!

322
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,421
People are expecting
me to do this.

323
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:55,788
I can't let it end like this.

324
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,688
What do you know about my
pain, what I go through?

325
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:07,121
-I can't turn a
blind eye anymore.

326
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:08,888
I have to be strong,
no matter what.

327
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:18,188
-You again.

328
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:24,121
How long are you going
to torment me, father?

329
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,755
-Do you still honestly
believe that striking me down

escape from a hero
of justice, did you?

You're gonna have to

Looks like I'm doing

Don't they have any standards?

down the path of

Are you out of your mind?

This isn't what the heroes
of justice as supposed to do.

-You made two mistakes,
unfortunately.

First, I'm not a hero.

idea of justice.

Depardieu, also know
as the Lady Killer,

418

was murdered last night.

Judging from the
scene of the crime

420
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,152
and according to
eyewitness accounts,

421

he was killed by Lunatic.

422

At this point, it's
unclear how the heroes

will handle this turn of events.
