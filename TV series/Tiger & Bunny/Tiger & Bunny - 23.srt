00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,066
-Hey, stop.

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,466
I said stop!

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,833
Oh, would you cut
it out already?

4
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,633
-Is that Tiger?

5
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,900
-No.

6
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:37,266
It's the person we were
persuaded to believe was him.

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,766
-Who are you?

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,866
-You aren't getting off
with a few minor burns

9
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,133
after what you pulled.

10
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,900
-Guess I have no choice.

11
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,333
Let's do this.

12
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:01,433
SUIT: Good Luck mode.

13
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:28,800
KOTETSU: Damn it.

00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,733
[opening theme music]

15
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,904
-Barnaby.

16
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:35,837
Come on.

17
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,704
You still can't
remember who I am?

18
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,504
-No, and your yammering
is starting to annoy me.

19
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,637
-Wait, hold up.

20
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,304
There's no point in
continuing on like this.

21
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:51,970
-Oh, so your finally
surrendering?

22
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,070
-Instead, let's try this!

23
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:26,570
The pain feels kind of
familiar, doesn't it?

24
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:28,204
Yeah, I bet that
jogged your memory.

25
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,370
well, it damn well should.

26
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:33,737
It's the pain of friendship.

27
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:42,470
-That was a cheap shot.

28
00:04:42,504 --> 00:04:45,204
You thought you'd win
with a sucker punch?

29
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:45,704
-What?

30
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,070
No wait.

31
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:53,204
That's not-- That didn't quite
work like I thought it would.

32
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,204
Come on.

33
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:17,904
You mean you forgot
all the good times

34
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:21,170
we had together just like that?

35
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:23,270
You're a lot further gone
than I thought you were.

36
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,604
Like when we first met.

37
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:42,437
That day couldn't
have gone any worse.

38
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,870
Out of the blue, they
made me team up with you.

39
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:49,370
At first I hated the whole idea.

40
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:52,404
After all, why
did I, Wild Tiger,

41
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:57,637
have to partner up some
smart-ass hotshot kid, right?

42
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,270
But you know what?

43
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:03,070
As time went on, I started
to get to know you better.

44
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,870
And before I knew
it, well, it felt

45
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:09,804
like we were always
meant to be teammates.

46
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,204
Ah.

47
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,237
The two of us had some pretty
good times together, didn't we?

48
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,704
I know you're in there.

49
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:30,204
Come on, Barnaby, don't
look at me like that.

50
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,670
Please, man, you gotta remember.

51
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,970
You're my partner!

52
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:43,104
And we were the best team--

53
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:44,104
BARNABY: Shut up!

54
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,470
How dare you dishonor
Wild Tiger's name.

55
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,104
I have to do this for Samantha.

56
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,104
SUIT: Good Luck.

57
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:12,104
-So this is how it ends, huh?

58
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:13,570
Take care, little Bunny.

59
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:30,337
-How many times must I tell you,
the name is Barnaby, not Bunny.

60
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,137
What?

61
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,670
Why did I just say that?

62
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,570
What's going on?

63
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:43,570
Tiger?

64
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,670
-You're back.

65
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:47,137
You know who I am.

66
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,937
-Huh?

67
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,537
Well, obviously.

68
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,637
But don't try to change
the subject, old man,

69
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,037
I really don't appreciate it
when you call me Bunny, OK?

70
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,837
-I am not a bunny.

71
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,604
My name is Barnaby.

72
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:03,037
-You must really
hate that nickname.

73
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,304
I'm going glad you do.

74
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:05,070
-What?

75
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:09,037
[groans]

76
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,104
-It's about time.

77
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:12,970
You're you again.

78
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:15,904
-Uh, what the heck
are you talking about?

79
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,570
-So you remember me, right?

80
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:20,904
-Hey are you listening
to me, old man?

81
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:23,237
I asked you first.

82
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,070
-Hm.

83
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,970
-Kotetsu.

84
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:29,370
[laughter]

85
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:31,737
-Hey, come on, now.

86
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,970
Wait, are you crying?

87
00:08:33,004 --> 00:08:34,304
KOTETSU: Oh yeah, that's my pal.

88
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,570
BARNABY: Y-you're hurting me.

89
00:08:35,604 --> 00:08:37,070
KOTETSU: Just like old times.

90
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,404
BARNABY: What is wrong with you?

91
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,304
KOTETSU: Oh, it's great
to have you back, man.

92
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:41,970
BARNABY: You've really
lost it, Kotetsu.

93
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:48,204
-I had hoped the boy might
still be of some use to my plan.

94
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:48,970
What a shame.

95
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,470
But no matter.

96
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:57,637
I just have to prepare
the other subject.

97
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,937
-That's right.

98
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,970
Maverick did this.

99
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,070
-Hold on a sec.

100
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:04,104
You already knew that
he was behind this?

101
00:09:04,137 --> 00:09:05,104
-Yes.

102
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:07,937
But he took care of that.

103
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,404
Right after I found out what he
had done, he wiped my memory.

104
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,504
I'm so sorry.

105
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,004
-Hm?

106
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:18,504
-I turned against you, Kotetsu
I betrayed you, my own partner.

107
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:20,604
-Eh, don't worry
about it, buddy.

108
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:25,070
You were under Maverick's
control the whole time.

109
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:27,304
-All these years he's
been using me as a pawn.

110
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:40,479
Need a lift?

111
00:09:40,512 --> 00:09:42,179
-What are you doing here, Ben?

112
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,112
-Hey, that's the greeting I get?

113
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:46,246
I was worried sick
about you, Kotetsu.

114
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,646
I rush all the way from
home to help you out.

115
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,279
-How'd know where I was?

116
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:51,779
-Come on, I drive a cab.

117
00:09:51,812 --> 00:09:54,046
I can find anything
in this city.

118
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,312
-Who's this?

119
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,279
-Oh, he was my boss at the
last company I worked for.

120
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:58,746
-Hey, forget all that.

121
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:00,746
So what's the game
plan, you guys?

122
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,346
-Game plan?

123
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:04,779
-I think it's time
to get to work.

124
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,846
-You got that right.

125
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,812
-Yeah.

126
00:10:06,846 --> 00:10:08,612
Then get your ass in the cab.

127
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,279
I'll take you anywhere you want.

128
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:10,812
-Thanks, man.

129
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,112
Oh, great.

130
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,046
Now what?

131
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,846
-Let's go, guys.

132
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,812
BOTH: Mr. Saito?

133
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,746
-It appears you gentlemen
had quite a scuffle earlier.

134
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,312
-Sorry about that.

135
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:32,346
-You came all this way
to give us new suits?

136
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:33,779
SAITO: I had to.

137
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:35,979
I didn't design the suit
you were just wearing.

138
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,979
There's no telling what sort of
dangerous features it contains.

139
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,612
-Sorry we ditched your cab, Ben.

140
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,346
-Oh, don't worry about it.

141
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,846
This thing is way
better than my ride.

142
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,346
I mean, I just drive
some dinky old taxi cab.

143
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:54,412
-Your car does indeed suck.

144
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,979
-Hey, watch your
mouse, squawk box.

145
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:02,679
-OK.

146
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,512
Shall I take us back
to Apollo Media?

147
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:06,846
-Yes.

148
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,679
But before we go, we need to
rendezvous with the others.

149
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:10,679
-Right.

150
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,079
Oh, and on the
way you'll finally

151
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:13,079
get to meet my daughter.

152
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:14,279
-Sounds good.

153
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:17,279
-I wonder if we should ask
Agnes for her help, too.

154
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:20,346
She could broadcast the truth
about Maverick all over TV.

155
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,646
As soon as the world finds
out, he'll be finished.

156
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,546
-That's a great idea.

157
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,179
SAITO: Not going to happen.

158
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,312
Sorry.

159
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:28,979
I already tried.

160
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:32,212
I went to the studio.

161
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:32,746
-What?

162
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:33,612
[whispering]

163
00:11:36,646 --> 00:11:39,046
-Are you trying to tell
me something, little man?

164
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,112
I have no idea what you're
trying to say to me.

165
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:46,646
Speak up.

166
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,312
If you don't leave me alone, I'm
going to have to call security.

167
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,379
SAITO: Her memories must've
been tampered with, as well.

168
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,112
KOTETSU: Damn it.

169
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:57,346
Too bad.

170
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:00,246
-There are a few others we
can reach out to for help.

171
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,046
But we can't be certain who else
Maverick may have gotten to.

172
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,679
-I guess that means
we're going to have

173
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:05,712
to settle this ourselves.

174
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,979
-Hey, Blue Rose, guess what,
we're heading over now.

175
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:16,746
And I've got Barnaby
with me, too.

176
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,546
Uh, hello?

177
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:22,646
MAVERICK: How unfortunate
that it has come to this.

178
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,012
-Maverick!

179
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,279
KOTETSU: Why do you
have her com unit?

180
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:31,079
-Ah, Wild Tiger, If only
you had allowed yourself

181
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:32,879
to be captured,
none of your friends

182
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,379
would have had to get involved.

183
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,779
-What the hell have
you done with them?

184
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:38,912
-You have no need for concern.

185
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,912
Everyone's safe for now.

186
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:43,712
All the heroes
and your daughter.

187
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,379
-What did you just say?

188
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:48,846
You think I'm going to let
you threaten my daughter?

189
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,512
-You monster, she's
just a little girl!

190
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:55,212
-The two of you have turned
into a massive liability for me.

191
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:58,179
I just can't have you boys
causing any more problems.

192
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:02,479
But you can save them all by
simply surrendering to me.

193
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:07,579
I will be waiting for
you at Justice Tower.

194
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:09,846
-Damn it!

195
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,179
-He won't get away with it.

196
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:14,712
I won't allow it.

197
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,446
KOTETSU: Justice Tower.

198
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,812
Justice, my ass.

199
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,712
-Where am I?

200
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:30,779
-What the?

201
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:31,846
What's going on?

202
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,212
-I am gonna bitch-slap
someone for this.

203
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,146
-Hello?

204
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:35,979
Hey!

205
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:37,712
Can anybody hear me out there?

206
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:49,346
ROTWANG: Rise and
shine, Ms. Rose.

207
00:13:57,246 --> 00:13:59,312
INTERCOM: You have
been expected.

208
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,179
Please come inside.

209
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,846
-Hold on.

210
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,579
We should be careful.

211
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,779
It might be a trap.

212
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,646
-I don't care if it is.

213
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:10,346
Come on.

214
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,346
There's no time to lose.

215
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:16,079
ELEVATOR: Welcome, and
thank you for choosing

216
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:17,612
to visit it Justice Tower.

217
00:14:17,646 --> 00:14:19,546
We're happy to have
you as our guest.

218
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:23,279
This elevator will take you to
the rooftop observation deck,

219
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:27,679
in the most exclusive section
of the tower, the Gold Stage.

220
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,979
Now arriving at
observation deck.

221
00:14:34,012 --> 00:14:36,279
-Why would he bring us
all the way up here?

222
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,946
SAITO: Perfection!

223
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,146
I never expected my invention
to be used like this.

224
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:48,412
-That's great, but I thought
their hero suits already

225
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:49,646
had cameras.

226
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,379
Why bother using that bug thing?

227
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:52,579
-It's simple.

228
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:54,146
Communications
between heroes are

229
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,346
relayed using a special
private network that's

230
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,046
encrypted to prevent
data from being

231
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,812
diverted to the wrong hands.

232
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:02,212
However, I've been unable
to access the network, which

233
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:04,779
indicates that Maverick
has seized control of it.

234
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:06,279
Are you getting all this?

235
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,712
-Not really, no.

236
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:10,379
SAITO (SHOUTING): Well
then, I'll clarify!

237
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,146
It's simple.

238
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,246
Communications between here--

239
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,379
-Let me guess.

240
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,879
We can't use the cameras
on their suits, right?

241
00:15:15,912 --> 00:15:17,812
-How succinctly put.

242
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:20,312
Now, if we can learn
what's going on inside,

243
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:21,946
I'm hopeful that we
may be able to help

244
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:23,446
rescue the other captive heroes.

245
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:30,479
-Kaede!

246
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,179
Where are you, Kaede?

247
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:33,912
-Kotetsu, calm down.

248
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,446
-How can I call down
when he's got my girl?

249
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,779
It's my fault she's in danger.

250
00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:47,679
Hey, jackass, where the
hell is my daughter?

251
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:48,879
BARNABY: Easy, now.

252
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,679
We don't know what kind of
Next we're dealing with.

253
00:15:51,712 --> 00:15:53,746
KOTETSU: Don't just stand
there looking stupid.

254
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:54,512
Answer me.

255
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:59,746
-Look at that What the
hell is that thing?

256
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,146
-That's no Next.

257
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,679
-He's a robot.

258
00:16:07,712 --> 00:16:09,679
-Weren't expecting that, eh?

259
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,646
It has been far
too long, Barnaby.

260
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,146
-Rotwang.

261
00:16:16,112 --> 00:16:19,512
-I suppose it must be quite
a shock to run into me again.

262
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,312
-Shut up!

263
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,412
Maverick, where's Kaede?

264
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:24,746
I want to speak with her.

265
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:25,946
Put her on!

266
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,412
MAVERICK: Now, now.

267
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,279
You should be far more
concerned with your own fate.

268
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:31,779
KOTETSU: What are
you talking about?

269
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:34,479
-Do you really think I'm going
to let you leave here alive?

270
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:35,546
-Oh, please.

271
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,812
I'll crush this tin
can in a second.

272
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:38,579
-Will you?

273
00:16:38,612 --> 00:16:39,712
I don't know.

274
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:42,779
You have quite a difficult
time battling Sis.

275
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:46,479
And H01 is even more
technologically advanced.

276
00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:48,846
His power levels
are far beyond hers.

277
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,146
Your little hero pals
tried their best,

278
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:57,812
but even with their
combined strength,

279
00:16:57,846 --> 00:16:59,879
they couldn't so much
as put a dent in him.

280
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:04,379
How will you fare?

281
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:06,479
Now's your chance to
turn tail and run.

282
00:17:06,512 --> 00:17:08,312
-Screw you and screw him!

283
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:12,712
-Oh that idiot.

284
00:17:12,746 --> 00:17:14,212
-Astounding!

285
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,712
A fully operational
battle android!

286
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,279
Impossible!

287
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:21,046
MAVERICK: I was quite impressed
by the technology employed

288
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,146
during the last
android incident.

289
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:25,479
So I made a deal
with Doctor Rotwang.

290
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:29,746
I gave him this facility and
every resources he desired.

291
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:32,879
ROTWANG: Now you see the
fruits of my labor, H01.

292
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:35,279
I've finally created
the ultimate being,

293
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:37,779
one that towers
above the human race.

294
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:42,546
-Maverick, what the hell are
you hoping to accomplish here?

295
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,712
-I've come to realize something.

296
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:46,779
Androids are the
ideal embodiment

297
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,479
of justice in this world.

298
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:52,346
We have no need for you
flawed Next anymore.

299
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:55,312
H01 will replace every
hero in this city.

300
00:17:55,346 --> 00:17:58,412
A glorious new age will begin.

301
00:17:58,446 --> 00:18:01,146
-How dare you call this
hunk of junk a hero.

302
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,012
-You must understand how
wondrous this is, Barnaby.

303
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:05,946
The day has come
when robotics will

304
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:08,112
play a crucial role in society.

305
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:09,879
Your parents' dream
has finally come true.

306
00:18:09,912 --> 00:18:12,412
-This wasn't their dream!

307
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,879
You may fight him
together, if you wish.

308
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:16,712
The data from this
encounter will

309
00:18:16,746 --> 00:18:18,746
be used for future development.

310
00:18:18,779 --> 00:18:22,246
-Unless you defeat H01,
you can't save anyone.

311
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:26,146
Not this fair city, not one
of your precious friend's, not

312
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,246
even your daughter.

313
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,212
Such a poor, innocent girl.

314
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:32,846
None of this would
have happened if you

315
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:35,379
she have you for a father.

316
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,612
-Kaede, I swear I'll
get you out of this.

317
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,646
-After that day,
the villagers knew

318
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,512
they could count on the
giant of the mountain

319
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,479
to protect them
forever and ever.

320
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:49,179
The end.

321
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,746
Read it again, Daddy.

322
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,346
-That was the third time!

323
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:53,612
-What's the matter, Mom?

324
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,079
-All you need to
know is that you

325
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:58,446
can count on your dad and me to
protect you forever and ever.

326
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,312
-I won't let you get away
with this any longer!

327
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:10,312
ROTWANG: Rise and
shine, Ms. Rose.

328
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,812
-Who am I speaking to?

329
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,146
Where are the others?

330
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,146
What did you do with Kaede?

331
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:18,379
-Never fear, the girl is safe.

332
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:21,946
Your friends on the other hand.

333
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:23,246
-Oh, thank goodness.

334
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,746
I hope everyone is all right.

335
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,546
-Can someone explain
what is going on?

336
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,946
-I remember being defeated
by the fake Tiger.

337
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:30,946
-You bastard.

338
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:32,546
Let us out of here
or I'll end you.

339
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,812
-Silence, you freaks!

340
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:38,279
I've locked you subhuman pieces
of garbage away in these cages

341
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,146
because that's where
animals belong.

342
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,446
MAVERICK: What'd you call us?

343
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,712
-He's some kind of Next hater.

344
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:47,279
-I've embraced the obvious, that
your era has come to an end.

345
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,479
Now surrender your
titles as protectors

346
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:52,212
of the city to
H01, the new hero.

347
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,079
[gasp]

348
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,312
BLUE ROSE: H01?

349
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,046
You mean the phony Tiger?

350
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,912
IRON BISON: You gotta
be outta your mind.

351
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,146
That lousy pile of bolts
could never replace us!

352
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,979
-That's a pretty
ironic statement,

353
00:20:03,012 --> 00:20:05,946
considering he easily
defeated everyone of you.

354
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:07,946
-No matter how
strong that thing is,

355
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:09,812
androids are just
mindless weapons

356
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:12,146
that need to rely on
humans to control them.

357
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,846
-You say that as if
it's a bad thing.

358
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,079
-Listen, you crazy bitch.

359
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:19,112
You shouldn't
underestimate us heroes.

360
00:20:19,146 --> 00:20:22,312
-When we hear the cries of the
people, we feel their pain.

361
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,279
We even try to help
criminals repent

362
00:20:24,312 --> 00:20:26,512
and rehabilitate themselves.

363
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:28,779
No cold piece of
machinery can do that.

364
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,212
-Yeah, he's right.

365
00:20:30,246 --> 00:20:32,146
We're real heroes
because at our core,

366
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:34,046
we're humans, with hearts.

367
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,912
I could never have
become a hero by myself.

368
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:39,546
I was only able to come
this far because of the bond

369
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,079
I have with my friends.

370
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:43,812
-Oh, you're making me all teary.

371
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:46,646
If that's true, then prove it.

372
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,246
If this human heart of
yours is really so special,

373
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,079
then why don't you show me.

374
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:54,312
A little demonstration
of your empathy.

375
00:20:54,346 --> 00:20:56,479
-What are you talking about?

376
00:20:56,512 --> 00:20:59,412
-Unfortunately, you and your
pals are all going to die.

377
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,379
You see those collars
around your necks

378
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:06,246
are actually bombs set to
explode any moment now.

379
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,146
But I will spare
one of your lives

380
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,946
if you pass a small
test of your humanity.

381
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,712
Only the fastest will make it.

382
00:21:12,746 --> 00:21:14,679
If you want to be saved,
all you have to do

383
00:21:14,712 --> 00:21:16,879
is reach up and flip
the deactivation switch

384
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:17,812
on your collar.

385
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:20,546
However, there is one catch.

386
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,279
The moment you flip your switch,
everyone else will blow up.

387
00:21:27,646 --> 00:21:29,612
Doesn't it sound fun.

388
00:21:29,646 --> 00:21:32,979
You have until Tiger and
Barnaby are defeated by H01.

389
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:35,212
The second they do,
all you costumed

390
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:38,979
idiots will go boom if none
of you has hit their switch.

391
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:41,946
And don't get any bright ideas.

392
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,946
If I catch any of you trying
to use your creepy powers

393
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:49,812
to wriggle out of this, I'll
just blow you up on the spot.

394
00:21:49,846 --> 00:21:52,046
So what do you think?

395
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,912
Do you still have faith in
you precious friendship?

396
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:58,412
Wouldn't it be much wiser to
betray your so-called friends

397
00:21:58,446 --> 00:22:01,212
before one of them
betrays you, heroes?

398
00:22:01,246 --> 00:22:03,212
Well, the game is set.

399
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:04,646
The players are ready.

400
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,012
The moment that Tiger and
Barnaby's fight begins,

401
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:09,546
your fight begins, as well.

402
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,612
[maniacal laughter]

403
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:14,712
-Hold on.

404
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:16,546
Wait, damn it!

405
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:17,779
Is anyone there?

406
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,246
-Let's do this.

407
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,521
-I'm with you

408
00:22:40,608 --> 00:22:44,508
[ending theme music]

409
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:13,071
BARNABY: Hi, I'm Barnaby,
the member of Tiger and Bunny

410
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:16,004
whose body temperature
is 35.7 degrees Celsius.

411
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,037
All right, we have to win.

412
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:19,304
What's with this guy?

413
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:20,437
Ugh.

414
00:24:20,471 --> 00:24:22,737
Next time on Tiger and
Bunny, Nothing Ventured,

415
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:23,671
Nothing Gained.

416
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:25,504
See ya.
