-So I heard.

00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,233
-From all appearances, Lunatic
will continue his killing

till every criminal
is wiped out.

-Man, with Lunatic
around, crime will soon

be a thing of the past.

like this would cause the public

-If more and more people
question their abilities,

00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,942
It could put Hero

leave out the ex

110

and just introduce
me as a star hero.

-Why, of course.

We're all looking forward

-Hey, why so down on yourself?

167
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,642
-Isn't it obvious?

168
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:07,775
Look at the power I've got.

169
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:09,742
I don't even know how to use it.

170
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:11,108
-You'll be fine.

171
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:13,908
There's got to be
something only you can do.

172
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:16,175
-There is, but for what purpose?

173
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,342
-You're over-thinking.

174
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,942
It'll become obvious
as you train.

175
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,775
-Thank you very much, Mr. Tiger.

176
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:27,442
-You're welcome.

177
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,875
It'll be tough for
them to become heroes

178
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:34,775
with those kinds of powers.

179
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:36,975
They're more like sideshow
attractions than NEXT.

180
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,442
IVAN: Hey Tiger.

181
00:08:43,475 --> 00:08:45,475
-Hey, what's going on?

182
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,275
-Would you mind taking a
look at my powers as well?

183
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:50,542
-Huh?

184
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:53,442
Wow, amazing.

185
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:55,508
-Wow, amazing.

186
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:56,575
-That's OK.

187
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,108
You don't need to copy me.

188
00:08:58,142 --> 00:08:58,975
-That's OK.

189
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,742
You don't need to copy me.

190
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:01,508
-I'm serious.

191
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,675
You can stop now.

192
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,608
-I'm serious.

193
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,308
You can stop now.

194
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,008
-I'm not kidding, Origami.

195
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,075
-Oh, sorry about that.

196
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,242
-You know that's
an amazing power.

197
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:13,508
You can actually shape-shift
into other people.

198
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,942
-The only thing
is it's not really

199
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:16,275
useful for saving people.

200
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,575
-You think so?

201
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,042
You could shape-shift into
me and use my hundred power.

202
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:21,108
-Not really.

203
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,375
You see I can copy a
person's appearance

204
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,675
but not their powers.

205
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,008
-That blows.

206
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,208
-I knew it.

207
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:28,642
I'm not fit for being in
the company of superheroes

208
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,075
with powers like these.

209
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:34,475
I should just quit
right now and get a job.

210
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,742
-Now, I'm starting
to feel depressed.

211
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,308
Could you stop crying
with my face there?

212
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:39,808
-Sorry.

213
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:47,875
-Maybe you shouldn't
obsess over it.

214
00:09:47,908 --> 00:09:49,575
I'm sure there are
some situations

215
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:51,908
that your power
would be perfect for.

216
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:55,508
-Actually, someone once
told me the same thing.

217
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,175
That someone was
a friend of mine

218
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,342
who was a NEXT at
the top of our class,

219
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,742
but I didn't take
his word seriously.

220
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:02,875
-Really?

221
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:04,908
But the guy never went
on to become a hero.

222
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,242
The fact that you
became one is important.

223
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,342
It means that you were
better suited for this work

224
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:09,942
than he was.

225
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:10,942
-That's not true.

226
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:12,042
-Of course, it is.

227
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:12,542
-No.

228
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:13,108
Really.

229
00:10:13,142 --> 00:10:13,975
You're mistaken.

230
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,408
-Don't be so modest.

231
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:16,075
-Believe me.

232
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:17,242
I'm telling the truth.

233
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:19,542
-What?

234
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,408
-He should have
become a hero, not me.

235
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,997
-I remember like it
was yesterday, Barnaby.

236
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:38,731
Everything you did when you
were a student was perfect.

237
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,097
I don't know if you realized
it, but the whole school

238
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,197
looked up to you.

239
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,197
-Aw.

240
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:44,797
-You even had a fan club.

241
00:10:44,831 --> 00:10:46,564
That never happened before.

242
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:49,097
They all wore classes in
the same style as yours.

243
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:49,631
-Stop.

244
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:50,331
Please.

245
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:51,297
You're embarrassing me.

246
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,364
-Oh, I'm sorry.

247
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:56,131
-Tell me, what was he
like way back then?

248
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:57,831
-Hey, enough already.

249
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:58,931
-Not you, Bunny.

250
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,864
I was talking about Ivan.

251
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:04,364
-Well, Ivan was interesting.

252
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,697
He was talented, no question.

253
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:09,297
But he was very quiet,
always hiding behind

254
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,231
his closest friend
at the Academy.

255
00:11:11,264 --> 00:11:12,797
-Was that the student
he keeps talking

256
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,764
about who was at the
top of his class?

257
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:15,997
-I'm sure it is.

258
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:18,664
He was actually very gifted,
but while he was still

259
00:11:18,697 --> 00:11:20,797
a student here, an
incident happened.

260
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:21,297
-Really?

261
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,831
-We haven't talked
about it much at school.

262
00:11:25,864 --> 00:11:26,931
It's a very bitter memory.

263
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,931
-Where's the car I ordered?

264
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:34,064
-Have any heroes arrived?

265
00:11:34,097 --> 00:11:35,064
-No, not yet.

266
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:37,431
-Let's go, Ivan.

267
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,264
Come on.

268
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,631
We have to take care of this.

269
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:42,831
-But using our powers off
campus is against Academy rules.

270
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,531
-You've got to be kidding.

271
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:45,631
Think about it.

272
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,597
The powers we have are
meant to help people.

273
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:49,731
What good are they if
we don't get involved?

274
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:52,064
-My powers are even useful.

275
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:53,231
-Don't worry.

276
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:54,097
You'll do fine.

277
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:54,997
I'll back you up.

278
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,531
Let's go.

279
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:57,597
-Wait a minute.

280
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:58,864
I'm not sure.

281
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:00,364
You want to become
a hero or not.

282
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:06,431
-What's taking so long.

283
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:06,997
I'll kill her.

284
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:07,997
I swear I will.

285
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,597
-All right, give it up.

286
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,597
It's over.

287
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:15,264
-Who the hell are you, kid?

288
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:17,697
You little punk.

289
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:20,031
-Let go of me, scumbags.

290
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,364
Ivan, help me.

291
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:23,897
What are you waiting for?

292
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:26,364
[gunshot]

293
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,097
-I heard about that
entire incident.

294
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:41,164
Even though it was an accident,
he was charged with murder.

295
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:43,664
-As a result, Edward
ended up in prison.

296
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,464
He was no longer eligible
to become a hero.

297
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,531
-That explains Ivan.

298
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:50,697
-He should have
become a hero, not me.

299
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:56,097
-Wait a minute, is
Edward still in prison?

300
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:57,064
-Not anymore.

301
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:07,364
-Long time, no see.

302
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:08,597
-Edward, I--

303
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:10,797
-This brings back memories.

304
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,197
It was at this spot that you
often asked me for advice.

305
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,464
-How did you get here?

306
00:13:15,497 --> 00:13:18,297
I thought you were
still in prison.

307
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:21,264
-I came back for revenge.

308
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:22,364
-He broke out.

309
00:13:22,397 --> 00:13:24,631
-Yes, I got the
call a few days ago.

310
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:27,464
IVAN: Help!

311
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:29,964
-Do you know how much I've
suffered because of you?

312
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,131
Huh?

313
00:13:31,164 --> 00:13:33,731
I was this close to
becoming a certified hero.

314
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:36,964
You ruined everything.

315
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,164
Why didn't you try
and help me that day?

316
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:41,997
I went to save someone, so
why am I now the criminal

317
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,331
while you're the hero?

318
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,931
This is your fault, coward.

319
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:48,831
I lost everything, because
you were too scared to move.

320
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:49,531
KOTETSU: Oragami!

321
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,931
-Edward.

322
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:55,797
-What's he doing?

323
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:56,631
Leave the kid alone.

324
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:06,197
-Are you all right?

325
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:07,997
-Why did you guys
have to interfere?

326
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:09,264
-Huh?

327
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,964
-I'd be willing to die if
I thought it would somehow

328
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,197
make him feel better.

329
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,897
-Why would you say that?

-Edward's just looking for
someone to blame, Ivan.

was not your fault.

-No.

336

He asked for my help, and
I was so afraid I froze.

was getting killed.

might as well have been.

in, he would have

Edward simply wasn't ready
to be a hero back then,

345

if you don't stop him.

mistake you made before?
