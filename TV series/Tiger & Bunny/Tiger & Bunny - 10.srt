00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,188
-Hello, Heroes.

162
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,788
As you can see, we have
a bit of an incident.

163
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,888
You know what to do, arrest
every last one of them.

164
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:52,354
ALL: Yes, ma'am.

165
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:53,221
-That's it.

166
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:54,954
I'm going full power.

167
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,154
You want to dance?

168
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:56,921
Let's dance.

169
00:11:14,321 --> 00:11:16,754
Knock, knock, who's there?

170
00:11:16,788 --> 00:11:20,188
What the hell?

171
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,388
AGNES (ON HEADSET): What
did you find, Tiger?

172
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,588
-It's a Mad Bear.

173
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:25,054
They're like super rare.

174
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:26,154
AGNES (ON HEADSET): A what?

175
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,521
-Haven't you heard of them?

176
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,788
They have these fresh
out of surgery stitches

177
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,821
and dead fish eyes
with this blank stare.

178
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:34,554
Whoa.

179
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:35,521
Hey!

180
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:36,354
Hey!

181
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:37,354
Get back here, you dumb doll.

182
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:40,421
Hey.

183
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:41,888
Come on.

184
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:42,688
Get back here.

185
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:48,488
A-ha, nowhere to run, Mr. Bear.

186
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:00,788
Ah, that smug little bastard.

187
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:05,654
Listen, pal, you are
so not worth 30 bucks.

188
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:06,154
Whoa.

189
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,254
-A teddy bear?

190
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,588
KOTETSU: That's
what I just said.

191
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:14,521
Look, there's got to be
a mastermind somewhere

192
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:15,788
with the power to control them.

193
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:17,654
-A NEXT must be behind this.

194
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:36,391
What happened?

195
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:39,391
-There was another explosion
at the North Gold heliport.

196
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,824
-So the plot thickens.

197
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:43,491
This show is getting exciting.

198
00:12:43,524 --> 00:12:47,124
Sky High, Rock Bison, Fire
Emblem, Origami Cyclone

199
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:47,757
come in.

200
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,857
Forget the bridge.

201
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:50,624
Get to North Gold now.

202
00:12:50,657 --> 00:12:51,591
ALL: Yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,691
-Well, is the army
containing the attack?

204
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:07,524
-Actually, Maverick has put
in a request with the mayor

205
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:10,157
to let the Heroes take
care of it from here on.

206
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:12,824
-Heroes have never dealt
with a terrorist attack

207
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:14,291
of this magnitude before.

208
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,857
It's outrageous, I tell ya.

209
00:13:15,891 --> 00:13:17,657
What is he thinking?

210
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:20,857
-Well, Heroes, let's
see if you're up to it.

211
00:13:23,724 --> 00:13:26,057
-Looks like the dolls
are at this location too.

212
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:28,457
-The same person is
responsible for both attacks?

213
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:31,824
-What?

214
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:32,591
Another one?

215
00:13:32,624 --> 00:13:33,824
-Where is it now?

216
00:13:33,857 --> 00:13:36,757
-Two more blasts now at
East Gold and West Bronze.

217
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,157
AGNES (ON HEADSET):
You're kidding.

218
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:44,791
-We're almost ready, Mr. Jake.

219
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,357
-Hey, Fire Emblem, Rock Bison,
leave this to the others.

220
00:13:48,391 --> 00:13:49,624
Got to East Gold.

221
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:50,857
-Oh, come on.

222
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:51,924
-We just got here.

223
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,657
-Oh, she's such a tease.

224
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:57,291
-And Blue Rose, Dragon Kid, get
your asses to West Bronze Port.

225
00:13:57,324 --> 00:13:59,757
-Ha, right.

226
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:00,957
-Will do.

227
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:03,824
But are you sure we should
leave Tiger by himself?

228
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:07,057
-What did she just say?

229
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:10,024
I can handle myself, lady,
and hey, if things get rough,

230
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,391
I'll just use your cutie escape.

231
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:16,524
Hey, come on, I
wasn't done talking.

232
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,891
Party time.

233
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:24,257
MECHANICAL VOICE: Powers
expire in five seconds.

234
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,991
Four, three--

235
00:14:26,024 --> 00:14:27,357
-This always happens.

236
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:28,324
MECHANICAL VOICE: Zero.

237
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,457
-Damn it.

238
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,224
Why haven't you heard
back from Barnaby yet?

239
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:34,924
-I keep dialing his com, ma'am,
but he must be ignoring it.

240
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:39,324
-What could possibly be
more important than this?

241
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:41,157
[beeping]

242
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,024
-What?

243
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,457
Are you saying I can't
handle things without you?

244
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:21,457
NEWS ANNOUNCER: Yes, Dragon Kid
brought down one of the robots.

245
00:15:21,491 --> 00:15:24,591
-Hey, don't go
stealing my targets.

246
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,391
-Oops.

247
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,124
Sorry.

248
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:29,457
NEWS ANNOUNCER: Fancy foot work.

249
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:31,757
They outwit another one
with a double escape.

250
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:36,091
-Fire!

251
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:42,557
NEWS ANNOUNCER: Now, Fire
Emblem's cranking up the heat.

252
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:54,491
-There you go.

253
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:02,557
NEWS ANNOUNCER: Oh, no.

254
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,957
Rock Bison and Fire
Emblem are surrounded.

255
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:06,057
-Sky High!

256
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:11,457
-And there he is.

257
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:14,591
The king of Heroes whoops in and
shows us why he's the champion.

258
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:20,691
-Thank you for saving me.

259
00:16:20,724 --> 00:16:22,124
-This is my duty.

260
00:16:22,157 --> 00:16:23,757
There's no need to thank me.

261
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,591
-Origami Cyclone actually
racking up the points

262
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:29,357
and he lands a nice close up.

263
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:33,257
Until he gets punched
off the screen.

264
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,757
-And stay down.

265
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,057
Man, how many of these walking
garbage cans are there?

266
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:40,991
-Help me!

267
00:16:50,624 --> 00:16:51,724
Ahh!

268
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,557
-Oh, for-- it was
supposed to stop the car.

269
00:16:59,024 --> 00:16:59,957
I got ya.

270
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,991
Just hang in there.

271
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:03,591
-This is really bad.

272
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,924
All the Heroes are starting
to get overwhelmed.

273
00:17:06,957 --> 00:17:09,457
Everyone watching this
is going to panic.

274
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:12,657
Ma'am, I really think we
should go off the air.

275
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:13,991
-Don't be such a baby.

276
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:16,224
We're not letting
this chance slip away.

277
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:19,024
-You want to make the
same mistake as last time?

278
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:20,057
Don't you see?

279
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,857
The public will turn
against us if they

280
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,091
lose faith in the Heroes.

281
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:26,357
Just like they did
when Lunatic appeared.

282
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,891
-It's not worth the risk.

283
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:29,624
OK, stop the broadcast.

284
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,457
Kill the live feed
and switch to tape.

285
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:32,757
-You'll do nothing of the sort.

286
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:38,924
What kind of show is this
if we can't trust our stars?

287
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,024
We owe it to the Heroes
to have faith in them.

288
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:42,424
They'll pull
through like always.

289
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:52,024
-Look, even the king of
Heroes can't beat these guys.

290
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:56,291
-You can do it, Heroes.

291
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:58,857
NEWS ANNOUNCER: It appears
Wild Tiger is in real danger.

292
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,591
He's sacrificing himself to
protect an innocent woman.

293
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:15,157
-Good.

294
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,224
-Everything is ready now, ma'am.

295
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:22,924
-Excellent work.

296
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,224
-Bastards.

297
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:29,991
Think a few bullets can stop me?

298
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:34,457
Got it.

299
00:18:34,491 --> 00:18:35,724
Just hold on.

300
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,079
I will get you out of there.

301
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:43,479
You know, I really hate
using these things,

302
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:47,046
but for them, I'll
make an exception.

303
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,479
Say hello to my little friend.

304
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:55,279
Ah!

305
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,646
-You all right?

306
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,879
-Bunny, what are you doing here?

307
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,113
-It's been awhile
since I carried you.

308
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:10,846
If feels like you've
packed on some pounds.

309
00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:14,479
-Shut up and put
me down, will ya?

310
00:19:14,513 --> 00:19:16,946
Hey, what about
your prison thing?

311
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:22,879
-His sentence is 250 years.

312
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:25,113
I don't think he's
going anywhere soon.

313
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:29,346
And besides, I owed
you one for saving me.

314
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:30,913
Now we're even.

315
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:33,213
-All righty then, let's
take out the trash

316
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:35,679
so we can pay your
friend here a visit.

317
00:19:35,713 --> 00:19:37,079
-Sounds good.

318
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:38,779
Just try to stay out of my way.

319
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,413
-Your way?

320
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,946
Smart ass.

321
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,413
[high pitched noise]

322
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:03,846
-That noise.

323
00:20:03,879 --> 00:20:05,646
-What is that?

324
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,279
-What the hell is all this?

325
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,446
-Business cards?

326
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,613
But why?

327
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:13,213
-That's weird.

328
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:20,979
-Hey, it's that symbol.

329
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,379
FEMALE VOICE: Attention
citizens of Sternbild.

330
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:25,879
Your resistance will
not be tolerated.

331
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:31,479
-Who's voice is that?

332
00:20:31,513 --> 00:20:32,879
-Nothing works.

333
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,813
Somebody must be
jamming our signal.

334
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:35,979
KOTETSU (ON HEADSET): Agnus?

335
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:38,079
Want to tell us what's going on?

336
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,079
-The hell if I know.

337
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,913
-Now that we have
your attention,

338
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,446
let us introduce ourselves.

339
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:57,946
We're known as Ouroboros.

340
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,813
-It's them.

341
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:02,646
-We have seized control of
every major traffic point

342
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,346
across your entire city.

343
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:06,646
I'm afraid Sternbild
is now isolated

344
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,713
from the rest of the world.

345
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:12,313
Or, in lay mans terms,
your entire population

346
00:21:12,346 --> 00:21:15,213
has become our hostage.

347
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:17,646
We only have one
single demand, there's

348
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,246
a comrade of ours being
held in a Voss prison

349
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,779
and we would like him to
be released immediately.

350
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:27,146
If you fail to
honor this demand,

351
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,679
we will destroy half
the pillars that

352
00:21:29,713 --> 00:21:36,113
hold Sternbild above water,
thus sinking your whole city.

353
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,713
-You're insane.

354
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,679
-You have more than 20
million citizens here

355
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,646
and I doubt many of them can
tread water for eternity.

356
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:52,246
The clock is ticking.

357
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,413
If you want to save yourselves,
you know what to do.

358
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:57,879
Release one man.

359
00:21:57,913 --> 00:22:01,046
His name's Jake Martinez.

360
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:01,546
-Damn!

361
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:25,779
-All done.

362
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:42,113
[theme music]

363
00:24:11,387 --> 00:24:14,220
-Hi, I'm Barnaby, the member
of Tiger and Bunny that refers

364
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,387
rose wine.

365
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,020
Ouroborus, you've finally
come out of the shadows.

366
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:19,254
Good luck, Origami.

367
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:22,387
If this plan works, then
I will finally-- Next time

368
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,920
on "Tiger and Bunny,
The Die is Cast."

369
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:26,420
See ya.
