JAKE (ON TV): I've decided
that if this hero loses,

2
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,200
I'll destroy half of your city.

3
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:11,933
That ought to get
your juices flowing.

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,409
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): Welcome
back to our show, everyone.

8
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:48,209
Just entering the stadium,
we have a new challenger.

9
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:50,676
This will be the fourth
of seven matches.

10
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,943
Let me introduce Mr.
Jake's next opponent.

11
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:57,409
He's out for revenge, so
we call him Revenge Boy.

12
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,743
-Those damn nicknames are
really pissing me off.

13
00:02:59,776 --> 00:03:00,943
-Hm?

14
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:01,876
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): We're
ready to start the match,

15
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:03,676
but I don't see
Mr. Jake anywhere.

16
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,609
What could have happened to him?

ANNOUNCER: There he is.

20
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:24,743
Mr. Jake has staged
a beautiful ambush.

21
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:34,843
-Oh my, that was a
really weak approach.

22
00:03:37,976 --> 00:03:39,576
-There's something
that I need to know.

23
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:41,209
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Revenge Boy's attack

24
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:43,676
didn't stand a chance
against Mr. Jake's power.

25
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:48,709
-Why did you kill my parents?

26
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:50,076
What did you have against them?

27
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:52,543
Answer me, you bastard.

28
00:03:52,576 --> 00:03:55,543
-Let's not dwell on things
that happened in the past.

29
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:58,443
It's more fun to deal
with the here and now.

30
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,776
-I can't believe his speed.

31
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,943
-It's like he's reading
all his attacks.

32
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,876
-Hey, hold on.

33
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:08,309
Why isn't handsome
using his power?

34
00:04:08,343 --> 00:04:11,443
-Tiger has the same power as
Barnaby, and he was defeated.

35
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:13,543
That's why Barnaby's
been so careful.

36
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:17,909
-At this rate, the
city will be destroyed.

37
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:19,143
AGNES (ON COM): Hello, heroes.

38
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:22,576
We're ready.

39
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,176
We've set up the signal jack.

40
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:26,743
Quite frankly, Barnaby
could lose at any time.

41
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,509
I want you three
uninjured heroes

42
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,376
to remove that Mad
Bears from the powered

43
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:33,543
exosuits before they
destroy the support columns.

44
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:35,443
That should stop them, right?

45
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:36,009
Origami.

46
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,409
-Yes, ma'am.

47
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,376
It should end the threat
for the time being.

48
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,376
AGNES (ON COM): Blue Rose,
you take North Bronx.

49
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,743
Dragon Kid, you
take South Bronx.

50
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:46,143
Fire Emblem, I
want you to take--

51
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:49,176
KOTETSU: I'm going too.

52
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:52,576
Which one do you
want me to cover?

53
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:53,509
-What are you doing?

54
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,243
Are you crazy?

55
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:55,209
-Get back in bed.

56
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:56,443
You're in no
condition to do this.

57
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,543
-Thanks for your
concern, everyone.

58
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:01,309
But I can't just
lie around here.

59
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,043
So complete the
assignments, Agnes.

60
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,543
Where should I go?

61
00:05:04,576 --> 00:05:06,509
-Stop this, Tiger.

62
00:05:06,543 --> 00:05:08,876
If you come with us, you'll
be nothing but trouble.

63
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:11,309
All you're going to
do is get in our way.

64
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:13,243
-What?

65
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:14,543
-Come on.

66
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:17,276
This is not the time to be
fighting amongst ourselves.

67
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:20,443
-Try to keep in mind you're
Barnaby's partner, Tiger.

68
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:24,709
You really should be thinking of
a way to help him defeat Jake.

69
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:25,209
Idiot.

70
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:32,243
-Damn.

71
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:33,043
-Take it easy, pal.

72
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,543
Blue Rose is right.

73
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:35,243
Stay.

74
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:37,643
You're no help out there.

75
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:39,143
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Here's an update.

76
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,776
Revenge Boy looks
like he's struggling,

77
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,876
but Mr. Jake hasn't
even broken a sweat.

78
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,309
He's incredible.

79
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,176
-Tell me, while I
was sleeping, did

80
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,476
Bunny get any hits in on Jake?

81
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:51,643
-Not one.

82
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:55,676
They were all rebuffed
by Jake's force field.

83
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,876
-He's right.

84
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,809
No one's been able to
even lay a finger on him.

85
00:05:59,843 --> 00:06:00,976
-Except for you, of course.

86
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,609
Right, Kotetsu?

87
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:05,976
Think back to that moment
when you kicked him.

88
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:12,943
-Can't really count
that as an attack.

[screaming]

90
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,376
-If I keep attacking
him, I'm bound

91
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:23,743
to break through at some point.

92
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:26,309
If I can just get him
to let his guard down.

JAKE (VOICEOVER): You're

It's never going to happen.

00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:31,976
But if you want to keep
trying, be my guest.

of them are completely

Where could they be?

JAKE (VOICEOVER): You need
to pay better attention.

100
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,943
I'm wide open at the moment.

101

BARNABY (VOICEOVER):
I've got you now.

102
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:01,776
JAKE (VOICEOVER):
You're never going

103
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,676
to be able to sneak up on me.

104
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,509
Unfortunately for
you, I can hear

105
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:07,143
your thoughts, loud and clear.

106
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:11,809
-Hey, what's wrong?

107
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:14,443
Is it time for a nap already?

Hm?

-This is what you call justice?

110
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,543
You don't inspire
much confidence.

111

WOMAN: This isn't happening.

112

to us if he loses?

113
00:07:26,376 --> 00:07:28,143
WOMAN: Oh no, is
he going to get up?

114
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:29,409
-All right, ladies.

115
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:31,143
Let's show them some girl power.

116
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:32,276
-Girl power?

117
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,043
One of us doesn't quite
fit that description.

PAO-LIN: I can't help it.

I wasn't talking about you.

00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,576
-Wait a minute.

122
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,743
Are you telling me
I don't qualify?

Barnaby can't take
much more of this.

JAKE (ON TV): What a complete

150
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:01,476
I mean, you are supposed

in despair as he realizes
the difference in power

You're just not strong enough.

In case you're
wondering, I've only

shown you half of
my capabilities.

-What?

00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,743
JAKE (ON TV): The fact
is the Almighty God

164
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:36,309
Himself, in is great
wisdom blessed me

165
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,176
with a grand total
of two powers.

166
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,909
-What does he mean two powers?

167
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:41,776
-Ridiculous.

168
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:42,743
I've never heard
of such a thing.

169
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:44,243
JAKE (ON TV): Well,
I'm afraid that's

170
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:45,876
all the clues I can
give you for now.

171
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,176
Come on, let's play.

172
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:48,009
-What clues?

173
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,643
The guy's yanking our chain.

174
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:53,543
-Frankly, I'm not
so sure about that.

175
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,343
I think, in fact, he may
have another hidden power,

176
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,909
and that's why our
attacks can't get to him.

177
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:01,443
-Are you saying he's using
this other power to figure out

178
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,109
our attacks before
we even launch them?

179
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:08,443
IVAN: What kind of power
are we talking about?

180
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:10,743
-I can hear what you're
going to do before you do it.

181
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,876
-Of course, that's it.

182
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,709
-Did you figure out
how he's doing this?

183
00:10:14,743 --> 00:10:18,143
-Yeah, and I've got to
tell Bunny right away.

184
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:19,176
-Mr. Tiger.

185
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,409
[panting]

186
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:23,609
-Someone else needs
to let Barnaby know.

187
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:24,776
You're too weak.

188
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:27,509
-I have to be the
one to pass it on.

189
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,043
I'm the only one that will be
able to get through to him.

190
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,843
ANTONIO: You're crazy.

191
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:35,176
-There has to be a way
to defeat this guy.

192
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,443
All I have to do is
figure out his other power

193
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:38,643
and neutralize it.

194
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:44,576
-Amazing.

195
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:56,076
You used your Hundred Power
to speed up your healing?

196
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,176
-That's right.

197
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,343
I've made a complete recovery.

198
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:04,909
I'm fine.

199
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:10,909
Don't worry about me.

200
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,243
Well, I'm heading out now.

201
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:15,276
See you later.

202
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,143
-I didn't know he
could heal so fast.

203
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,943
-That idiot, he knows better.

204
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:20,443
-What?

205
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:21,809
[thump]

206
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,209
[groaning]

207
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,376
-Hey there, Mr. Saito.

208
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:35,309
I've got a big favor to ask you.

209
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:45,578
ANNOUNCER: Uh oh, Revenge Boy
is down for a record 30th time.

210
00:11:45,611 --> 00:11:48,278
BARNABY (VOICEOVER): I can't
take any more hits like this.

211
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:52,145
But even if I activate my power,
I don't if I'll be able to win.

212
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,145
-Come on, will you hurry up
and use your power already?

213
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:57,978
Otherwise, you'll be
smashed to pieces.

214
00:11:58,011 --> 00:11:59,511
Oh wait, I get it.

215
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:02,245
You're dying to see your
mommy and daddy, aren't you?

216
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,178
Well, I think I can
accommodate you just this once.

217
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,811
BARNABY (VOICEOVER): I
won't let it end here.

218
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:12,345
I vowed to avenge them!

219
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,178
-Good boy, now you've got it.

220
00:12:27,978 --> 00:12:29,278
AGNES (ON COM): Report in.

221
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,845
What's taking everyone so long?

222
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,911
We're running out of time.

223
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:32,911
-We know that.

224
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:34,711
We're doing the
best we can, woman.

225
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:37,445
-You may not have noticed, but
these guys are pretty tough.

226
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:41,478
-There are too many of
them for us to take on.

227
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,945
-She's right.

228
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,478
Has our plan failed?

229
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:48,111
-I think Barnaby's
almost reached his limit.

230
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:51,711
He's getting his ass kicked even
though he's using his power.

231
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:54,445
-If he loses, they're going
to destroy half the city.

232
00:12:54,478 --> 00:12:55,511
-Or more.

233
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:57,845
It's very likely they
won't stop there.

234
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,578
Once this battle is over,
it won't take them very long

235
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,378
to realize we attacked
their powered exosuits.

236
00:13:03,411 --> 00:13:06,545
In retaliation, they might
just destroy all the support

237
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,111
columns.

238
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:09,011
-The whole city?

239
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:12,011
-Our only hope is that
Barnaby can beat him somehow.

240
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,511
-What's the matter, boy?

241
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:14,678
Is that all you've got?

242
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,178
BARNABY (VOICEOVER):
Even my Hundred

243
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:18,878
Power wasn't enough to
get through his defense.

244
00:13:18,911 --> 00:13:20,011
-It's my turn.

245
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:23,445
See ya, kid.

246
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:25,278
Aw, must have hit him too hard.

247
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,145
That's a shame.

248
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,845
BARNABY (VOICEOVER): Am I
going to lose this fight?

249
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:37,811
I've lived my entire life for
revenge against this monster.

250
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:46,545
Mother, father.

251
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,211
-You OK, Bunny?

252
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:57,011
A little help maybe?

253
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,011
-Tiger, what are you doing here?

254
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,511
What about your injuries?

255
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:04,445
-Those things?

256
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:05,478
They were just scratches.

257
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,311
No problem.

258
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,378
JAKE: Hey, are you coming down?

259
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:10,078
Or should I come up
there to finish you off?

260
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:12,011
-Uh, wait a second.

261
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,211
-Are you trying to
get in my way again?

262
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:17,478
I really don't
have time for this.

263
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:20,678
-I finally figured out
Jake's other power.

264
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,478
We're unable to hit him because
he can anticipate and detect

265
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:25,145
our movements.

266
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:29,345
I thought about it, and there's
only one possible answer--

267
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:31,911
his hearing is very sensitive.

268
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:34,278
During my battle, Jake said
he could hear everything.

269
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,845
That's when it
should have hit me,

270
00:14:35,878 --> 00:14:38,111
but I was busy
getting my ass kicked.

271
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,778
His power is super hearing.

272
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,578
Isn't it obvious?

273
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:44,411
He was listening to the
sound of our muscles

274
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:47,145
moving so he could
predict our next move.

275
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,978
-Impossible.

276
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:51,111
-You have to use
this to defeat him.

277
00:14:51,145 --> 00:14:54,011
It's Saito's special
ultrasonic grenade.

278
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:56,145
You won't have a
chance against him

279
00:14:56,178 --> 00:15:00,378
until you've destroyed
his hearing with this.

280
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:04,211
-The bottom line is
I can't trust you.

281
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,045
Don't act so surprised.

282
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:07,978
After all, you didn't trust me.

283
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:09,511
-Bunny, stop.

284
00:15:09,545 --> 00:15:11,745
-My power is going
to run out soon.

285
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:15,878
I have to trust in myself if I'm
going to make my final attack.

286
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:16,378
Blood?

287
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,078
You're still injured.

288
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:22,445
JAKE: Well, you ready yet?

289
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,145
It's about time you came back.

290
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:34,778
-Come on, Bunny.

291
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:35,545
Trust me.

292
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,011
BARNABY (VOICEOVER):
Get ready, Jake.

293
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,445
JAKE (VOICEOVER): Oh, I'm ready.

294
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,845
I heard all about
your little plan.

295
00:15:46,878 --> 00:15:48,278
But I've got news for you.

296
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:49,878
You think my power
is super hearing.

297
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:53,378
As you're about to find
out, you are dead wrong.

298
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,245
-Take this!

299
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:09,411
-Bye bye.

300
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:14,245
You really thought
you could beat me

301
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:15,278
with that stupid grenade?

302
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:23,011
-Get him, Barnaby!

303
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:31,245
-Mr. Jake!

304
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:36,111
-Son of a bitch.

305
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:37,611
I think my rib's broken.

306
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:43,278
Wait, no.

307
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,545
I give up.

308
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:46,945
I'm in way too
much pain to move.

309
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:48,145
Help me.

310
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:49,511
You're a hero.

311
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:50,945
You have to help me.

312
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:57,278
[choking]

313
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:18,245
-You'll spend the rest of your
life repenting for your sins.

314
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,145
He's my hero!

315
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:23,011
[cheering]

316
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,845
-Don't thank me.

317
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:30,678
-Truthfully, I wasn't about to.

318
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,778
-Huh?

319
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,478
-Why did you think that
you had to trick me.

320
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,145
You should have just
said it was a flash

321
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:36,711
grenade from the beginning.

00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:39,145
-He would have totally figured
it out if I have done that.

00:17:39,178 --> 00:17:42,078
The guy has the
ability to read minds.

-But what about
the super hearing?

He doesn't have that?

-Man, you sure are slow.

I don't know you've
survived this long.

328
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:52,145
-How did you figure it out?

329
00:17:52,178 --> 00:17:54,645
-Well, for starters,
when we were fighting,

330
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:57,645
he referred to me as Kotetsu.

331
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,711
-You're so dead, Kotetsu.

332
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,745
-I've never revealed my
real name to the public,

333
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:06,678
so how in the hell did this
guy happen to know what it was?

KOTETSU (VOICEOVER):
Come on, Kotetsu, focus.

335
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:11,278
He has to have some weakness.

336
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:12,978
-He couldn't have
known my name unless he

337
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:15,745
was listening to my thoughts.

338
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,511
-That's why he could
hear everything.

339
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:18,745
-Exactly.

340
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,345
-Come on, you've got
to be kidding me.

341
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:21,711
Super hearing?

342
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,611
Listening to the
sound of our muscles?

343
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,045
You're telling me
that's the best

344

stuff you could come up with?

345
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:29,145
Your whole plan hinged
on me buying that?

346
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:31,078
I mean, what if I hadn't
believe you, old man?

wouldn't happen.

-Excuse me?

349
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:37,545
-To be perfectly
honest, I was never

350
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:40,078
the least bit
worried about that.

351
