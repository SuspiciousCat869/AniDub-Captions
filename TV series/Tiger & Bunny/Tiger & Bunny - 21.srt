a homicidal Next named

00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:13,889
He is suspected of killing
68-year-old Samantha

Taylor, a resident of Sternbild.

the authorities immediately.

12
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:29,289
Is this phone broken?

13
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:30,622
Oh, boy.

00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,456
Ah, what now.

15
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,356
Hey, wait a minute, folks.

16
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:35,489
There's been a big mistake.

17
00:00:35,522 --> 00:00:37,089
I don't know how this
happened, but I'm not

18
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,289
the man you think that I am.

Aaah!

Let's get out of here!

can you tell me

30
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,158
what the hell is going on?

31
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:37,958
AGNES: Who is this?

32
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:39,125
KOTETSU: It's me, Kotetsu.

33
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,292
Don't you know my voice?

34
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,358
AGNES: Kotetsu?

35
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:42,292
Kotetsu Kaburagi?

36
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:43,492
KOTETSU: Is this
is supposed to be

37
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,558
some sort of special
event for Hero TV?

38
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:48,358
Because nobody told
me a thing about it!

39
00:02:48,392 --> 00:02:50,992
AGNES: Are you really
Kotetsu Kaburagi?

40
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:52,558
-I just told you I was.

41
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:54,425
Look I'm real close to
the studio, right now.

42
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,358
Give me some guidance.

43
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:56,658
What should I do?

00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:58,725
AGNES (TO OTHERS): Kotetsu
Kaburagi is near the studio.

45
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:00,325
Get everyone out
there, and find him!

49
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,525
Do you really think
you can get away

KOTETSU: Ah, quit showing
off for the cameras.

58
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,492
I didn't do anything
and you know it.

SKY HIGH: That is
not for me to judge.

60
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,392
A jury will decide whether
or not you're innocent.

61
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,192
I shall capture you and let
justice take its course.

-Don't worry, Sweetheart.

72

It's all just a big
misunderstanding.

KAEDE: I'm sure
you're right, Grandma.

74
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,258
-Kaede.

75
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:40,292
KAEDE: I know Dad, and he would
never do something so awful.

76
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,458
He's a liar, and
he can be silly,

77
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,992
but my dad would never
hurt anyone on purpose.

78
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:45,858
Not ever!

79
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,192
-You're right, Kaede.

80
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,992
Your father's job is
to capture criminals.

81
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:08,192
He's one the heroes.

82
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,058
There's a reason why he hasn't
been able to be with you.

83
00:05:11,092 --> 00:05:13,458
He's been living in the
city, working closely

84
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:16,058
with the other heroes
to keep everyone safe.

85
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:17,025
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:17,058 --> 00:05:18,892
I should've told you sooner.

87

-You're kidding!

-No, it's the truth, Dear.

89
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:25,025
I'm sure you must know who
Wild Tiger is, don't you?

90
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,592
Well, believe it or
not, he's your father.

was a phone call

from the fugitive,
Kotetsu Kaburagi.

93

He's still hiding
within the city.

Set up road blocks at
all major access points.

DETECTIVE 2: Do we have
any more information on him

96
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:40,525
besides his photograph?

97
00:05:40,558 --> 00:05:42,458
DETECTIVE 1: Aside from
the fact that he's a Next,

98
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:44,292
we haven't been able
to find out anything.

99
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,758
KOTETSU: I should've
known they'd be here.

100
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,992
Well, someone's all
pumped up and ready.

101
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:37,592
-Don't even try it.

102
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,858
There's nowhere to run!

DRAGON KID: So you
finally showed up, huh.

105
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,625
Haa!

106
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:44,558
-Uh, wait!

107
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,125
-Why would we do that?

108
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,892
Come along quietly
You're outmatched!

109
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,258
-Hold on guys.

110
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:53,092
A hero like myself would
never kill anybody.

111
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,392
This is clearly a case
of mistaken identity.

112
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:56,925
-You've got some nerve, Mister.

113
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,158
A criminal has no business
calling himself a hero!

114
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,058
-Huh?

115
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:01,892
-Eh?

116
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:02,792
-Wait a second.

117
00:07:02,825 --> 00:07:04,125
It's me.

118
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,792
Don't you know who I am?

119
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,558

120
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:08,792
-Right!

121
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:09,725
-Don't move!

122
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,825
-Ugh You guys are
driving me crazy!

123
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,392
Why are you treating
me like this?

124
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:15,225
Explain right now
what's going on--

125
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:17,392
ROCK BISON: We don't explain
ourselves to criminals.

126
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:23,058
As you'll discover,
it's very simple.

127
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:28,125
Earning points by capturing
bad guys like you is our job.

128
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:29,992
-You idiot, I'm
your best friend.

129
00:07:30,025 --> 00:07:31,258
ROCK BISON: Best friend?

130
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:34,792
What kind of nonsense are
you talking, you low-life?

131
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,992
-Low-life?

132
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:40,558
All right, you've crossed
the line, you bastard!

133
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,092
-What do you know?

134
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:46,192
This guy's a power-type Next.

135
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,158
-Hold it!

136
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,525
ANNOUNCER: The murderer
showed up at his home moments

137
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:59,658
ago, but has
disappeared once again.

138
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,325
According to reports, the
suspect, Kotetsu Kaburagi,

139
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,458
may actually be a
power-type Next.

MAVERICK: How are
you feeling, Barnaby?

141
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,292
-Sorry for missing so
much work lately, sir.

142
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,025
But I'm feeling fine, now.

143
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,958
I'll head out to make
the arrest immediately.

144
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:20,992
The timing couldn't
be more perfect.

145
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,792
New versions of the hero suits
have been in development,

146
00:08:23,825 --> 00:08:25,592
and I've received
word from the lab

147
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,092
that yours has just
been completed.

148
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:28,792
-You mean?

149
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:29,892
MAVERICK: That's right.

150
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,125
We have new suits for
both you and Tiger.

151
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:36,458
Everything is all set.

152
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:37,492
Go get them, my boy.

153
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:41,258
KOTETSU: Ugh.

154
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,358
That really hurt.

155
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:43,458
What a jerk.

156
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:46,992
That cow is as hard as a rock.

[shivering]

158
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:56,825
She's going to be a pain
in the ass, I know it.

159
00:08:56,858 --> 00:08:58,058
Damn it.

160
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,425
I'm running around here
like some kind of sewer rat.

161
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,392
I'm Wild Tiger, for
crying out loud.

162
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:05,158
KAEDE: My dad is Wild Tiger?

00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,725
MURAMASA: I'm not all that
worried about Kotetsu.

164
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,792
I'm sure it's just some
misunderstanding that'll

165
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,592
get cleared up.

166
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,492
Anyway, how's Kaede?

167
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:31,425
ANJU: She's taking it quite
well, all things considered.

168
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,958
She seems to be
a lot more mature

169
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:34,725
that we gave her credit for.

170
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:35,392
MURAMASA: I see.

171
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,592
Well, that's good.

172
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,092
ANJU: Kaede?

173
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:42,758
-Why don't you give up.

174
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:43,892
This is silly.

175
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,292
Do you really think you
can run away from me?

176
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:47,525
-I don't have much choice.

177
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:49,792
I wouldn't have to run
if you'd quit chasing me!

178
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,558
BLUE ROSE: Playtime's
over, loser.

179
00:09:56,592 --> 00:10:00,725
There's no way for you
to escape, you murderer.

180
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:02,558
-I told you before, and
I'll tell you again,

181
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:03,892
I didn't kill anyone.

182
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:05,792
How many times do
I have to say it?

183
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:07,525
-There happens to be proof.

184
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,758
Really, it would be best
if you admitted your crime,

185
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,458
so we can wrap this up.

186
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:12,458
-Come on.

187
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:14,058
What the heck
happened to you guys?

188
00:10:14,092 --> 00:10:16,558
Why don't any of
you recognize me?

189
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:18,792
All right, maybe this'll
help jog your memory.

190
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,258
Remember that time
when you weren't

191
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,858
sure about how your
career was going?

192
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:23,658
How I gave you a tip
at the bar because I

193
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,425
thought you were a good singer?

194
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,025
BLUE ROSE: What are
you talking about?

195
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,158
KOTETSU: Huh?

196
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,158
-Wild Tiger was the one
who gave me that tip.

197
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:33,025
How do you know so much about
my private life, anyway?

198
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:34,125
-How do I know?

199
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:35,658
Because I'm Wild Tiger!

200
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:37,025
How else would I
know that stuff?

201
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:37,758
-Come on.

202
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:38,792
Stop joking around.

203
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:39,758
KOTETSU: Huh?

204
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:40,925
-As you're probably
aware, nobody

205
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,292
knows Wild Tiger's
true identity.

206
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:45,458
It's pretty bold of
you to claim to be him,

207
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:48,292
just because we don't know
his real face or name.

208
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:49,358
-This is unbelievable.

209
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:50,192
What are you--

210
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,425
BLUE ROSE: Freeze right there!

211
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:52,958
I'm warning you,
I'll show no mercy

212
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,725
if you keep spouting
this nonsense.

213
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,725
KOTETSU: You're the one
who's spouting nonsense.

214
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:58,625
You're crazy.

215
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,158
And I suppose you've forgotten
about the time I gave you

216
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:02,925
that towel, as well.

217
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:04,925
How could you forget that?

218
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,925
At a rehearsal I spilled coffee
on your towel and ruined it.

219
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,025
And then, I gave you a really
cool towel to replace it.

220
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:14,858
Will you snap out of it?

221
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:17,225
I really am Wild Tiger.

222
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:18,358
Please believe me.

223
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,525
Wait, do remember now?

224
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:35,025
Wah!

225
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:39,458
Oh, man.

226
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:40,792
Who is it this time?

227
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:57,092
It's Wild Tiger?

228
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:04,860
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome back.

229
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:07,027
We are focusing on
Wild Tiger, who's

230
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,827
made a wild entrance
in his new suit.

231
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,660
Looks like this might be the
end of the line for the suspect.

232
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,493
-You have got to be kidding.

233
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,993
The real Wild Tiger is me.

234
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,127
So who the hell are you?

235
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,727
Are you serious?

236
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,193
In that case, see you.

237
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,227
Who the hell are you?

238
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,960
And that suit,
where'd you get that?

239
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,360
FIRE EMBLEM: Aww.

240
00:13:20,393 --> 00:13:21,793
You already found him.

241
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:23,793
It's so frustrating.

242
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:26,560
You always steal the
show, little Tiger.

243
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:27,427
-Wait a minute.

244
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,360
Who exactly are you talking to?

245
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,627
-What do you mean?

246
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,193
You really don't know
who Wild Tiger is?

247
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:34,593
-Yeah, I'm Wild Tiger!

248
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:36,293
BLUE ROSE: You can
drop the act, now.

249
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,493
We all know it's a lie.

250
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:43,693
-What's happened to you guys?

251
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:45,693
Aren't we friends?

252
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,460
Colleagues who fought
alongside each other?

253
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:49,760
You have to believe me!

254
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,327
This is some kind of nightmare.

255
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,427
You've really
forgotten who I am.

256
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,960
FIRE EMBLEM: What is this
creepy old man talking about?

257
00:14:02,993 --> 00:14:04,893
Take this nutcase
away and lock him up.

258
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,260
LUNATIC: Is this how it's
going to end for you?

259
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,727
KOTETSU: Lunatic?

260
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:25,927
Stop!

261
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,093
Let me explain.

262
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,627
I'm not the murderer.

263
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,427
-You need to reflect
carefully upon your actions.

264
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:41,027
-Why are you helping me?

265
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,093
LUNATIC: Passing judgment on
those who are truly sinful

266
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:47,027
is my idea of justice.

267
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,960
Therefore allowing
you to be captured

268
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:51,627
by the hands of
false justice would

269
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,493
be something that goes
against my beliefs.

270
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,327
Kotetsu Kaburagi,
is this how you're

271
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,693
going to let your
idea of justice end?

272
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:06,160
FIRE EMBLEM: What the hell
do you think you're doing?

273
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,193
Do you plan on
defending that murderer?

274
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,327
LUNATIC: I defend no one.

275
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,027
Nor do I follow your
code of justice.

276
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,960
I obey the voice of Thanatos.

277
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:20,160
ANNOUNCER: Kotetsu T
Kaburagi, the prime suspect

278
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:21,127
in this case--

279
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,560
-I don't understand.

280
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:24,793
Why did he help me?

281
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:25,560
HOBO: Hey.

282
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:26,693
This is my spot.

283
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:27,893
I'm trying to sleep.

284
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,027
Why don't you find
your own place.

285
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,893
-Yeah, like you pay rent.

286
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:36,360
-Bunny will find that bad guy.

287
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,993
HOBO: Maybe not, but
I was here before you.

288
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:41,360
As far as I'm concerned,
you're trespassing.

289
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:42,393
So go on.

290
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,860
Get out of here.

291
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,593
ANNOUNCER: We have a
scoop for you, folks.

292
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,260
Our cameras have caught up
with Hero TV's number one

293
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,727
star, Barnaby Brooks
Jr., who was reported

294
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,427
to be resting away from home.

295
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,027
KOTETSU: Bunny!

296
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,127
I'm so glad he's safe.

297
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,893
ANNOUNCER: This solves
one mystery for us.

298
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:01,793
During his time away,
it appears that Barnaby

299
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:05,727
was staying at the vacation
home of Mr. Albert Maverick.

300
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,627
-Please rest assured, everyone.

301
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,360
The criminal who is
terrorizing this city

302
00:16:09,393 --> 00:16:11,027
will be brought to justice.

303
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,927
He will be captured
by Barnaby himself,

304
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,827
who is thirsting for vengeance.

305
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,393
The victim, Ms. Samantha
Taylor, was more than a friend

306
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:18,693
of Mr. Brooks.

307
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,727
She worked for his parents
for many years and, in fact,

308
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,993
helped raise him.

309
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:23,227
He though of her as family.

310
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,627
REPORTER: Over here, over here.

311
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,093
Just one question, sir.

312
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,027
-Mister Maverick was with Bunny?

313
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,860
All this time?

314
00:16:29,893 --> 00:16:32,427
-Did anything unusual happen?

315
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,227
ASSISTANT: Ms. Samantha
Taylor is here,

316
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,093
and she has a photograph
she'd like to show you.

317
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:38,393
KOTETSU: Well that's weird.

318
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:42,227
-You need to reflect
carefully upon your actions.

319
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,493
-I understand it now.

320
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:46,427
-Hey, man.

321
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,327
You're that guy.

322
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,960
[screams]

323
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,293
-Hey!

324
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:02,027
Ben, it's Kotetsu.

325
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:05,827
-Get in.

326
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,627
-Good grief.

327
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,427
I knew I could
still count on you.

328
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,093
At this point I had no
one else to rely on.

329
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:19,627
I figured if I stayed in the
area, you'd pass by eventually.

330
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,660
Where are you going?

331
00:17:27,693 --> 00:17:28,860
Hang on.

332
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:31,693
Ben, don't tell me you
forgot who I am, too.

333
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:32,993
BEN: Shut up, and stay put.

334
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:35,093
-Hey, you're not taking
me to the police, are you?

335
00:17:35,127 --> 00:17:36,827
I'm telling you, I
didn't do anything.

336
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm not a murderer!

337
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:40,927
Please, stop the car.

338
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,160
You've got to believe me, Ben.

339
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,193
I was set up!

340
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,660
BEN: Calm down, Kotetsu.

341
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,460
Really?

342
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:52,927
You call yourself a hero?

343
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,027
I don't know what
happened here, but I'm

344
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,927
willing to give you the
benefit of the doubt.

345
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,293
It's cold but at least
it'll fill you up.

346
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,327
When I heard you
were on the run,

347
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,593
I figured you might be hungry,
so I came out looking for you.

348
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,627
I can't believe you'd
thought I'd forgotten you.

349
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,760
-Sorry about that.

350
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,327
-BEN: I'd never stop
believing in you,

351
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,827
no matter what they say.

352
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,393
Hey, I'm one of
your biggest fans.

353
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:28,893
-Is this what I think?

354
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:29,627
-Oh yeah.

355
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,860
Brings back memories, huh?

356
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:33,993
This suit is filled
with the good old times

357
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,527
we spent together, my friend.

358
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,360
I always keep it with me.

359
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:39,160
-Ah, that's great.

360
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:39,727
Huh?

361
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,027
Wait a minute.

362
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,827
What happened?

363
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,193
How come it's all wrinkled?

364
00:18:43,227 --> 00:18:47,860
-Hey, I'm a cab
driver, not your maid.

365
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:51,827
[laughing]

366
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:06,827
-You know, I have to say,
I was pretty shocked.

367
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,760
On TV they're talking about
you like you are the murderer.

368
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:12,260
No if, ands, or buts

369
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:15,260
-Somebody made
sure I was framed.

370
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:16,593
KAEDE: This is where Dad works.

371
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,027
Sorry grandma.

372
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,393
MAVERICK: Excuse me,
young lady, are you lost?

373
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:29,760
-No.

374
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:33,760
I just-- I came all the way
here so I could meet Barnaby.

375
00:19:33,793 --> 00:19:34,860
-Barnaby you say.

376
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:35,827
-Yes.

377
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,393
You see I have a
problem, and I was

378
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,127
hoping it he be
able to help me out.

379
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,327
MAVERICK: I see.

380
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,893
You're one of Barnaby's
biggest fans, aren't you?

381
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,993
Well, thank you for
coming all this way.

382
00:19:44,027 --> 00:19:46,693
Unfortunately, he's
pretty busy right now.

383
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,527
I'm afraid he won't
be able to help you

384
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,327
with your problem at the moment.

385
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,160
Sorry, my dear.

386
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,260
BEN: I see.

387
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:11,227
So this whole mess you're
in is Maverick's doing, huh?

388
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,127
Well, I guess that makes sense.

389
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,327
-He's even gone through the
trouble of finding someone

390
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,660
to go out and pretend to be me.

391
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,927
Who is that guy, anyway.

392
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,960
-I'll tell you.

393
00:20:20,993 --> 00:20:22,693
You sure know how
to make enemies

394
00:20:22,727 --> 00:20:24,560
with the wrong people, Kotetsu.

395
00:20:24,593 --> 00:20:27,193
-Yeah, it seems like it's
always happening to me.

396
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,993
You think that Barnaby's
being influenced by this guy,

397
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:31,193
as well?

398
00:20:31,227 --> 00:20:32,593
-Yeah.

399
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,227
I'm guessing he's probably not
going to remember me, either.

400
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,760
If I'm right, He'll be
just like everyone else.

401
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,860
BEN: And you figure Maverick
is the reason they've

402
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,093
forgotten about you?

403
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:45,327
KOTETSU: Well, I
can't be sure, Ben.

404
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,993
I don't know if
it's him, or a Next.

405
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,193
I'll tell you this, though.

406
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:51,427
A Next power is definitely
at the root of this.

407
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,027
-So what's going to
be your next move?

408
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,360
KOTETSU: The only thing I can
think to do at the moment,

409
00:20:55,393 --> 00:20:58,960
is to try and make them remember
that I'm the real Wild Tiger.

410
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,227
Yeah, but how?

411
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,027
-Don't worry.

412
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,827
I have a plan.

413
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,493
-I'm listening.

414
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,527
-I know it'll work now,
thanks to you, Ben.

415
00:21:08,227 --> 00:21:09,527
-What's going on?

416
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,593
-Not sure.

417
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:12,793
A man who resembles
Kotetsu Kaburagi

418
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:15,027
has appeared up on the
roof of Apollo Media.

419
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,260
-Did you contact him?

420
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:17,593
-Actually, he called us.

421
00:21:17,627 --> 00:21:19,127
He says he's the
real Wild Tiger,

422
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,193
and he wants us to assemble all
the heroes at that location.

423
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:25,893
-What, are you kidding me?

424
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:27,060
What the hell's going on?

425
00:21:56,327 --> 00:21:58,827
-Well, looks like
most of you are here.

426
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,027
All right.

427
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,627
It's time to let out a...

428
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,860
Wild Roar.

429
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:17,839
[ending theme music]

430
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:47,588
-Why do you suppose he's
wearing that costume?

431
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:49,754
KAEDE: Dad!

432
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:50,821
MAVERICK: That fool.

433
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,254
What's he planning to do?

434
00:24:11,154 --> 00:24:12,188
KOTETSU: Hi.

435
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:13,588
I'm Kotetsu, the member
of Tiger and Bunny

436
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:16,221
who hits the want ads first
when he reads the newspaper.

437
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,621
All right, come
at me all at once!

438
00:24:18,654 --> 00:24:20,821
Kaede, why are you here?

439
00:24:20,854 --> 00:24:22,221
No!

440
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:26,288
Next time on Tiger and Bunny,
Bad Luck Often-- Often-- damn.
