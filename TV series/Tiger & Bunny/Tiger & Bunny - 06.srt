in that a NEXT is behind it?

-The old man's memory is going.

339
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:51,128
He can't even remember faces.

340
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,561
-Will you shut up?

341
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,994
-You know I think
Handsome has a point.

342
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:56,794
You're not much help, are you?

343
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:58,594
In fact, come to
think of it, I don't

344
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:00,128
know how he puts up with you.

345
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:01,728
-Weren't you the
one who just offered

346
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:04,828
to spend the night
snuggling with me?

347
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:05,928
-He's crazy.

348
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:06,894
I swear to you.

349
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:09,361
There's nothing
going on between us.

350
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,194
Nothing.

351
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:13,894
-Like I said, this
is a waste of time.

352
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:14,761
I'm leaving.

353
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:15,294
-Good.

354
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:15,861
-Wait.

355
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:19,194
I'm coming with.

356
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:20,561
[whispering]

357
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:21,128
-Say what?

358
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:24,961
-That's right.

359
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,528
Where the hell were you?

360
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,961
I almost got myself killed.

361
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:31,194
-Huh?

362
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,528
-You poor guy.

363
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,161
What the hell is going on with
all the elevators in this town

364
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:44,661
anyway?

365
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:48,794
-I just fixed it.

366
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,561
-Thank you, Mr. Saito.

367
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:54,894
I just remembered where
I've seen that guy.

368
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,228
-Oh.

369
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:58,261
-He's the worker who was coming
out of the elevator right

370
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,794
before the bomb scare.

371
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:01,861
-You lost me.

372
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:05,128
-And he came after
you, because--

373
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:05,994
-Mhm.

374
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:06,761
Let's go.

375
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,661
-Where?

376
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:09,028
What?

377
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,961
I can't stand being
kept in the dark.

378
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:14,294
-Come on, Bunny.

379
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:15,661
Would you step on it?

380
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,061
-What use are you going to be
anyway without your powers?

381
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,361
You've got an hour before
you get them back, don't you?

382
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:21,794
-Ah, who cares about that?

383
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:22,728
Look.

384
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:23,661
I'm going to nail
this creep, if I

385
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:24,961
have to do it with
my bare hands.

386
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,428
-Sorry to interrupt
this macho banter,

387
00:18:27,461 --> 00:18:29,828
but will someone tell
me what is going on?

388
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,728
-The perp in question is trying
to silence any witnesses who

389
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,828
saw him at the scene
of the bomb scare.

390
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:35,928
-Ah.

391
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:36,694
Were there others?

392
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:38,294
Who else was there?

393
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:42,194
-Agnes and the camera man.

394
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:44,828
-All right, but I
need that final edit

395
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:46,828
on my desk first
thing in the morning.

396
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,394
Got it?

397
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,561
-What the hell?

398
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:00,561
What are you doing?

399
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,261
-You all right?

400
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:12,761
-Barnaby.

401
00:19:16,928 --> 00:19:19,661
-Looks like we got
here just in time.

402
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,261
-You again.

403
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,828
-Safe and sound.

404
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,261
-Just who is this guy?

405
00:19:24,294 --> 00:19:25,361
-Later, honey.

406
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,028
Right now, we've got
to get you out of here.

407
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,461
-I'll finish all of you.

408
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,094
-What's wrong?

409
00:19:47,128 --> 00:19:48,628
That all you've got?

410
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:49,794
-Nice work, Handsome.

411
00:19:49,828 --> 00:19:52,394
-Hey, how come you
always get the spotlight?

412
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,228
-Be my guest.

413
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,594
There aren't any
points involved.

414
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:55,428
-Huh?

415
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,828
Oh, OK.

416
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:02,161
The party's over,
you lowlife scumbag.

417
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:03,994
We're taking you in.

418
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,728
-Then stop showing off and
take me in, you jackass.

BARNABY (VOICEOVER): Ouroburos.

-You made a big mistake
tangling with me, punk.

421
00:20:16,794 --> 00:20:18,594
I'm gonna-- hey,
what are you doing?

422
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:20,694
You said I could handle this.

423
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:22,961
-That tattoo on your neck.

424
00:20:22,994 --> 00:20:25,061
It's an Ouroburos, isn't it?

425
00:20:25,094 --> 00:20:26,694
What is it?

426
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:27,894
Some kind of crime syndicate?

427
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:35,228
-Where's the man who wears
that mark on his hand?

428
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:35,728
Answer me.

429
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:45,561
-Hey, hey, wait.

430
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:46,594
What are you going to do?

431
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:47,494
-Out of my way.

432
00:20:47,528 --> 00:20:48,061
-All right.

433
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:49,294
Just calm down.

434
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:50,061
What's eating you?

435
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:51,461
-Stay out of it.

436
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,961
-They're at it again.

437
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:56,828
Honestly, you're like
an old married couple.

438
00:20:59,661 --> 00:21:01,994
-Take off those masks and
put your hands in the air.

439
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:08,561
I'll blow her head off.

440
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:10,494
I swear.

441
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:11,861
-OK.

442
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:14,294
OK.

443
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:15,994
-The other guy too.

444
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:17,961
Now!

445
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:18,928
-Hey.

446
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:19,928
-Better do it.

447
00:21:24,328 --> 00:21:25,661
-There we go.

448
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:27,861
-What's your game anyway?

449
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:30,461
Why'd you kill those
guys in the prison cell?

450
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,328
How the hell do they
fit into all this?

451
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:33,161
-What?

452
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,094
-And the one this morning?

453
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,161
Why?

454
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,394
-I don't know what
you're talking about?

455
00:21:37,428 --> 00:21:38,928
-Don't play dumb with me.

456
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:39,594
Come on.

457
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,394
-I said I don't know.

458
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:43,094
I'm going to do you first.

459
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:55,994
-What on earth was that?

460
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:00,494
-Is it human?

KOTETSU: Hey, Kotetsu here,
the member of Tiger and Bunny

who prefers to bite
into his candy.

Oh, so it's you again.

Who are you anyway?

467
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:20,053
OK.

468
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:21,186
Fine.

469
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:21,640
I guess I'll just have
find out the hard way.
