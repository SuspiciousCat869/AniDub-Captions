Sorry, bud.

00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:16,933
I just wasn't fast enough.

00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,166
-What are you saying?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,466
Why would your powers run out?

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,800
You still have plenty of time.

8
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:28,466
-To be honest, my power can
barely last four lousy minutes.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,400
You see, it's been
getting weaker.

10
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:32,266
-Don't you think I
should have known?

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,466
Why did you keep it
a secret from me?

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,600
-Listen.

13
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,033
I don't think I'm
going to make it.

-I said stop it.

I loved every minute of it.

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,700
The truth is when you finally
starting calling me Kotetsu,

22
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:54,133
you made me so happy, I
went out on all-night bender

Why?

35
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:02,146
-If Tiger's signal's
gone, it means he's gone.

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,180
-What happened?

00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:10,546
-He was in trouble.

38
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,746
His powers have been
declining lately.

-What?

40
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,713
When it came down to
it, he told me to fire,

get away with this?

You took away my parents, then
Samantha, and now, Kotetsu.

The lethal power demonstrated
by these androids

is based entirely
on their research.

The truth is they're the ones

-You're wrong.

76
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,013
The research my
parents did was always

77
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:03,013
meant to save people, not
to create killing machines.

-But Mr. Maverick,
that's suicide.

-Now that your androids
have been completed,

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,580
I have no further use for you.

99
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:33,046
-But I thought the
plan was for us

100
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,213
to exterminate those
creepy NEXT together.

101
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:38,013
-The trouble is I'm also a NEXT.

102
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:38,513
-Huh?

103
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:47,313
-That guy's a monster.

104
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,746
-You're not getting away.

105
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,546
-Accept your defeat
and surrender.

106
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,180
-You're wasting your time.

107
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:11,346
Even if you were to arrest me,
it wouldn't do you any good.

108
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,613
-And why is that?

109
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:15,380
-Because I have the full
respect and trust of powerful

110
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,713

111
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,280
You can go to them and make
all the accusations you want,

112
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:21,613
but no one will
dare to question me.

-Are you crazy?

114
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:23,913
You killed Wild Tiger.

Don't forget, I can

We recorded everything you
just said, Mr. Maverick.

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,946
-Sorry about that.

125
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,380
Did I forget to tell you?

00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:52,480
Well, surprise.

127
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:54,580
Unfortunately for
you, I actually

128
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,080
did see that white burst.

129
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:02,246
The truth is I was
really worried.

130
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,680
I wasn't sure what
you'd do to me

131
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,746
if you found that I
got my memory back.

132
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,580
I have to say, the toughest
part of the whole process

133
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,480
was trying to restore
communications

134
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:11,913
without you finding out.

135
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:13,113
-Damn you.

136
00:09:13,146 --> 00:09:15,446
-I can see you're
upset, but truthfully, I

137
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,580
have to thank you.

Oh yes, Mr. Maverick.

141
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:26,046
The fact is almost
everyone in Sternbild

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,180

143

[laughing] Our ratings are going
to be absolutely astronomical.

144
00:09:34,413 --> 00:09:37,213
I wish you could see
the look on your face.

145

We've got the whole
thing on close-up.

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,313
-It's time to the surrender.

147
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,213
-This guy has no
idea when to quit.

148
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:54,180
-There's no place for
you to hide, Maverick.

149
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,913
You might as well give up.

150
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,480
MAVERICK: Don't be
so sure about that.

151
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,260

00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,293
Any sudden moves on your
part, and this girl is dead.

00:10:27,626 --> 00:10:28,693
-Right on time.

155
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,293
I'll be taking your
helicopter, Agnes.

-Oh my god.

157
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,493
-I've come back from
the depths of hell.

158
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:57,526
Guess that line was a
little over the top, huh?

159
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,693
I was debating between that one
and this one, "Don't you worry.

-What?

163
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,326
-I thought you were dead.

164
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,426
I saw you stop breathing.

165
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,093
-Come on, man.

166
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:11,360
Give me some credit.

167
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:14,326
I couldn't stand it and
passed out from all the pain.

168
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,993
Did you even check my pulse?

169
00:11:17,026 --> 00:11:18,393
Hey, what's with you?

170
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,593
-Oh dad.

171
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:20,560
Dad.

172

-Tiger, thank goodness.

What's going on?

-Come on.

Are you nuts?

178
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,626
-It's not nice to
make girls cry.

179

-Welcome back.

180
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:33,293
-And welcome back again.

181
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,726
-What are you doing?

182
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,693
-Stop.

183
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:42,193
-Mr. Maverick, that's
pretty lame of you.

184
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:43,460
-How could you?

185
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:45,960
I devoted my life to
avenging my parents' murder.

186
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,993
At times, it became my
only reason for living.

187
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:53,693
You have to pay for that
and all the other crimes

188
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:55,160
you've committed.

189
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,326
-Crimes.

190
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Really?

191
00:11:57,393 --> 00:12:00,126
What crimes have I
actually committed?

192
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,526
-What?

193
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,360
-Thanks to all of my
efforts, the public

194
00:12:03,393 --> 00:12:05,460
has come to accept heroes.

195
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:08,193
And because of that, you're
able to live your lives freely.

196
00:12:08,226 --> 00:12:10,060
-That doesn't give
you a free pass.

197
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,693
- Before Hero TV came
along, you weren't

198
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:16,360
seen as the symbols of
justice you are today.

199
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,660
The public needed
a sense of hope,

200
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:22,993
and watching you capture low
level criminals provided that.

201
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:25,193
I gave the people
exactly what they needed.

202
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:27,893
-Yeah, so you and your
cronies could run this place.

203
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,826
MAVERICK: And what's
so bad about that?

204
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,826
Someone has to be in charge.

205
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,226
Sternbild used to
be a rundown dump.

206
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,626
The sense of security
that the heroes provided

207
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,293
has turned things
around and made

208
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,360
this city what it is today.

209
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,793
Without me, this place
would not have progressed.

210
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,893
I did what needed to be done.

211
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:48,160
You should be thanking
me, not arresting me.

212
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,526
-Nice try, Maverick.

213
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
But you're finished here.

214
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:53,393
-And your Ouroboros.

215
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:56,693
-Ouroboros will go on.

-What?

217
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,626
But aren't you the
boss of Ouroboros.

218

Kotetsu, you're alive.

But then, why did
we lose his signal.

his suit got destroyed.

-Any idea on the meaning
behind these numbers.

239

Your parents used
it as the password

up, so I'd become a hero.

00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:56,026
-How did she do that?

331
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,526
-She beat us here.

332
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,493
-Ah dammit.

333
00:18:58,526 --> 00:18:59,626
-She's first again.

334
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,026
SECOND LEAGUE HERO:
Stop right there!

335
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,426
ANNOUNCER: What's happening now?

336
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,760
COMMENTATOR: The second league
heroes are after someone.

337
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,193
KOTETSU: You won't escape.

338
00:19:07,226 --> 00:19:07,860
ANNOUNCER: Look.

339
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:08,893
It's Wild Tiger.

340
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,860
-Come back here.

341
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,593
COMMENTATOR: At one point, Tiger
retired from the hero business

342
00:19:13,626 --> 00:19:15,126
due his declining powers.

343
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,093
But now, calling himself
Wild Tiger One Minute,

344
00:19:18,126 --> 00:19:20,593
he has enthusiastically
returned to active duty.

345
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,326
ANNOUNCER: He's not
kidding around either.

346
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,993
We're told his power
lasts for just one minute.

347
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:26,860
COMMENTATOR: And he's
not afraid to hide it.

348
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,293
I got to tell you.

349
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:29,360
He is the man.

350
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:30,393
-Grandma, did you see?

351
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,360
Dad's on TV, and he looks good.

352
00:19:32,393 --> 00:19:32,993
-Really?

353
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,060
Is he keeping up?

354
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:35,660
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Well, that's it for us.

355
00:19:35,693 --> 00:19:37,626
Tune in next time.

356
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,493
-Ah, the show's over.

357
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,960
Why don't they give the second
league heroes some air time?

358
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,560
It's not fair.

359
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:46,960
-Wild Tiger One
Minute, what a name?

360
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:47,726
Hm.

361
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,226
Who thinks this stuff up?

362
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,993
Ah, thanks for coming in.

363
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,260
Can you sign off on this?

364
00:19:58,726 --> 00:19:59,393
-Thank you kindly.

365
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:07,560
-Looks like you're
already needed, sir.

366
00:20:07,593 --> 00:20:08,793
-Saito, old buddy.

367
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,560
Try to talk a little, will you?

368
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,326
-All right, pal.

369
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,560
Turn yourself in.

370
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:18,293
-I happen to know you already
exhausted your powers,

371
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:20,893
so you can't stop me.

372
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:22,460
-Don't be a smart ass.

373
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:24,760
I can take you down,
powers or no powers.

374
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:42,226
Bunny?

375
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,026
-Honestly, you haven't
changed a bit, have you?

376
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,726
-What brings you here?

377
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,026
I thought you retired.

378
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,860
-Really?

379
00:20:48,893 --> 00:20:50,393
I should ask you the same thing.

380
00:20:50,426 --> 00:20:51,760
-Oh yeah.

381
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,993
Well, Kaede said I
was uncool for being

382
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,860
a couch potato all day long.

383
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:58,760
And you know what I
realized, you don't always

384
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:02,860
get to set your own limits
with the choices you make.

385
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:04,193
So that's that.

386
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:06,093
Even if I lose
all my powers, I'm

387
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:08,426
still going to keep on trying.

388
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,793
And even if I look
ridiculous, I'm

389
00:21:10,826 --> 00:21:13,126
going to remain a hero
till the very end.

390
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,960
I'll never give up.

391
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,660
When you think
about it, it doesn't

392
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,293
hurt to have a
hero who's uncool.

393
00:21:18,326 --> 00:21:19,793
Right?

394
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,193
-Now, I've heard everything.

395
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:22,660
If you're going to
make a comeback,

396
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:24,726
then I suppose I'll
have to as well.

397
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,960
-And why's that?

398
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,526
-What do you mean?

399
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,060
Because I'm your
partner that's why.

400
00:21:30,093 --> 00:21:30,960
-Huh?

401
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:32,360
-And I have to
advise you, you'll

402
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:34,060
probably have to pay
for these damages.

403
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,393
-Hey, wait a minute.

404
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:37,860
I'm not the one who suddenly
appeared and smashed this hood.

405
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,260
So you should have to pay
to get this car repaired.

406
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:42,126
-How could you
possibly figure that?

407
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,426
-Easy.

408
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,560
Whose feet actually landed
on the hood and caved it in?

409
00:21:45,593 --> 00:21:48,626
-You're unbelievable.

410
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,826
OK.

411
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,793
Time to go now, old man.

412
00:21:52,826 --> 00:21:56,860
-I read you, little bunny.

413
00:21:56,893 --> 00:22:01,260
I think it's time to
let out a wild roar.

414
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:07,312
[theme music]

415
00:23:45,978 --> 00:23:48,912
-How much is it for this
Barnaby card, ma'am?

416
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:50,178
-$0.50.

417
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:51,312
-Oh, OK.

418
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:53,012
I'll get a Wild Tiger card too.

419
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:55,645
That's a dollar, right?

420
00:23:55,678 --> 00:23:57,212
Here.
