They are the Hero

HOST: Tiger and Barnaby.

15
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:30,238
They are Barnaby Brooks,
Junior, the new hero

16
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,878
who has had a stunning
debut, and his partner,

00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:36,945
the veteran hero, Wild Tiger.

18
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:39,745
As you may remember, the
world's very first heroic duo

19
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,412
leapt to fame 10 months
ago in a fierce battle

20
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,078
with the terrorist
Jake Martinez.

00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,645
By taking on and defeating
this vicious killer,

22
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:51,678

think about all this?

-We're not really as cool
as you make us out to be.

to save us from all
sorts of danger.

34
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:15,812
On top on that, you
managed to prevent Lunatic

from inflicting any
further casualties.

36
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:20,345
I think it's
important to point out

37
00:03:20,378 --> 00:03:23,378
that in last year's annual
ranking, Tiger placed fourth

38

first place and was named MVP.

that Barnaby was

43
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,745
able to come this
far in just one year.

I didn't ask this.

told that Kriem still remains

make a statement of any kind?

-It's frustrating that her
capture wasn't helpful.

For starters, I
still don't know why

-Barnaby is pretty impressive.

Despite everything he's
gone through recently,

00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:04,778
he's been able to
keep his focus.

have achieved any of this

hard work, Bunny.

-It was you, Tiger, really.

calling Tiger an old man.

Pretty sure it wasn't a joke.

75
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,412
-I think he did that to get
back at Tiger for calling them

76

Bunny, which he really hated.

77

gotten used to it.

sure about that.

There is this guy
who's on my mind a lot.

at him when he's around.

you totally love him.

-I don't know.

182
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:57,478
The truth is, I don't
even know why I like him.

183
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:02,445
He doesn't seem to notice
me and he's incredibly rude.

184
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,045
Oh, not to mention he's
incredibly irresponsible.

185
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:10,012
And to top it off, he
can be incredibly goofy.

him because he's such a klutz.

You're worried about what
he's gonna end up doing.

-You're right.

197

There's no way in the world
I'd fall for a guy like that.

-I don't care much when
other coworkers use it,

205
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,978
but when he's around, I want
to call me by my real name.

206
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,845
Doesn't that mean I'm in love?

-Yeah, that's definitely
love in my book.

That just means you don't
like your nickname that much.

You're not trying to
ruin it because you're

jealous or something?

But I've seen her in
this kind of situation.

If she worries too much about
it, she's sure to screw it up.

00:12:45,655 --> 00:12:46,122
Come on!

329
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,522
[sigh]

330
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,688
WOMAN: I just can't believe
we're actually doing this.

331
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:00,055
Who do you think
we're gonna see?

332
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:01,755
MEN: (IN UNISON)
Please to meet you.

333
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:02,388
-Hi.

334
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:03,522
What's this about?

335
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,288
-Allow me to introduce
you to the second league

336
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,122
heroes who are
starting this season.

337
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:08,522
-The second league?

338
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,755
-Yes.

339
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,988
You know, heroes are becoming
more popular these days.

340
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:14,388
Well, we decided to use
this opportunity and up

341
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:17,488
the excitement of our show by
making it a two league format.

342
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:18,722
-How will that work?

343
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,655
AGNES: You and the other
first leaguers will continue

344
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:22,422
to handle any major
crimes that come up,

345
00:13:22,455 --> 00:13:23,655
while the second leaguers'll--

346
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,455
-They'll handle the
minor crimes, right?

347
00:13:25,488 --> 00:13:26,588
-Yes, sir!

348
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,655
Right now, we're going
after a backstage thief.

349
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:29,955
-Oh yeah?

350
00:13:29,988 --> 00:13:31,688
-I called them to
come over to help

351
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:33,555
with crowd control
for your appearance.

352
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:35,922
-We intend to work hard so
we can uphold the peace,

353
00:13:35,955 --> 00:13:36,988
just like you do, sir.

354
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,355
-(IN UNISON) Please excuse us.

355
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,355
-Wow.

356
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,388
They didn't even look at me.

357
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,488
-Huh?

358
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,022
-It's because I'm the
lowest ranked hero.

359
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,555
-They didn't recognize you
'cause you're not in your suit.

360
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:49,288
-That's it!

361
00:13:49,322 --> 00:13:50,288
Of course.

362
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:51,322
I was worried.

363
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:53,155
-Uh, what are you
doing here, anyway?

364
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:53,688
Go home.

365
00:13:53,722 --> 00:13:54,522
-Why?

366
00:13:54,555 --> 00:13:56,222
I came to see you guys perform.

367
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:58,655
Jeez.

368
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:01,922
[panting]

369
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:03,088
-That was awful close.

370
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,388
They almost found me.

371
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:07,488
I'd better get outta here.

372
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:09,855
Eh?

373
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:11,288
Oh.

374
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:14,022
[inhaling]

[karina humming]

377
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,022
-OK.

378
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,455
-Miss Blue Rose,
you're on very soon.

379
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:39,955
-Coming.

380
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:54,222
[panting]

381
00:14:54,255 --> 00:14:56,388
-I was so close to
seeing everything.

382
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,822
-Thank you all for
being so patient.

383
00:14:58,855 --> 00:15:00,788
And now for our show.

384
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:04,055
Here's the super group,
BTB, with their new single,

385
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,222
"Thank You, Summer Romance."

386
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:06,955
Let's hear it for them!

387
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:08,455

-Hey, buddy!

391
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:25,022
Bust a move!

392
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:26,622
-Oh oh.

393
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,855
Should I try it on?

394
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:32,355
[music playing]

395
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:39,322
[cheering]

396
00:15:43,322 --> 00:15:45,155
-H-hey, what do you
know about that?

397
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:46,655
I really am good at dancing.

398
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:47,488
-Yeah, right.

399
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:48,788
You were still off by a beat.

400
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,422
-Oh thanks, Flashdance.

401
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,755
-Just try to get it
right during the encore.

402
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,722
-Uh, I'm afraid we
have some bad news.

403
00:15:54,755 --> 00:15:57,422
-(IN UNISON) Huh?

404
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:58,555
-What happened here?

405
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,488
-We don't know, sir.

406
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,155
We just found it like this.

407
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:02,355
-It's gone.

408
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:03,555
My bag is gone.

409
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,988
-This is very likely the
work of that backstage thief

410
00:16:06,022 --> 00:16:07,288
we've been chasing.

411
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:08,255
-(IN UNISON) Huh?

412
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:09,955
-He likes pop stars,
and as a result,

413
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:12,422
he always shows up
at events like this.

414
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:13,788
-Yes.

415
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:15,922
He may be some sort of NEXT,
and he's always getting away.

416
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:16,788
He's tricky.

417
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:17,555
AGNES (ON COMMS)
: Hello, heroes.

418
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:18,788
-Huh?

419
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:20,355
AGNES (ON COMMS) : Go after
the suspect immediately.

420
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:22,022
We'll be broadcasting it live.

421
00:16:22,055 --> 00:16:23,022
-OK, let's go, Bunny.

422
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:23,855
-Right.

423
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:25,555
-What about the encore, boys?

424
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:27,622
-We need to settle
this matter first.

425
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:32,055
You just had your bag stolen,
in case you've forgotten.

426
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,388
-Hey, you don't have
to worry about my bag.

427
00:16:35,422 --> 00:16:37,288
[gasp]

428
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:40,122
My towel's in there.

429
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:43,388
-Well, I kinda ruined your
towel, if you remember.

430
00:16:43,422 --> 00:16:43,888
So here.

431
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,155
[gasp]

432
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:52,022
-Why am I crying?

433
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,655
-It's not important
what it says.

434
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:56,855
I want to keep everything
from someone I like.

435
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:00,588
-I have to admit, I
really do like him.

436
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:02,955
[sobbing]

437
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:07,855
-Damn!

438
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,222
Can't find him anywhere.

439
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,122
[inhaling]

440
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,955
-Security's been
alerted, so we'd

441
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,088
know if anyone
suspicious passed by.

442
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:17,322
-I don't understand
how we got away.

443
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:18,788
[gulp]

444
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:19,922
-Stop that!

445
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,422
This is no time to be
stuffing your face!

446
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:22,922
-Mm, the kids from
the second league

447
00:17:22,955 --> 00:17:24,522
asked us to let them handle it.

448
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:25,855
They could use the experience.

449
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:26,755
-No!

450
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,288
You have to catch
him right away!

451
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,755
-How are we supposed
to do that when

452
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:31,688
we don't know anything
about the guy's powers?

453
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:32,322
Right, Bunny?

454
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:33,555
-Hmm.

455
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:35,788
What do you suppose they are?

456
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:36,288
-Hmm.

457
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,055
-What was that?

458
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:43,529
-Uh.

459
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:49,088
I guess that's his power.

460
00:17:49,122 --> 00:17:50,455
[panting]

461
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:51,022
Hold it!

462
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:52,455
-Come back here!

463
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,822
-Are you completely nuts?

464
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:54,988
Look at what you're wearing!

465
00:17:55,022 --> 00:17:56,322
-Go away!

[inhaling]

00:17:58,722 --> 00:17:59,788
-What the hell?

468
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,155
He disappeared!

469
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,222
-I knew it.

470
00:18:02,255 --> 00:18:06,588
He's a NEXT with the
power of invisibility

471
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:07,255
-Huh?

472
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:08,588
-He's getting away!

473
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,622
Come back with my bag!

474
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,322
-Man, she's hot.

475
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,155
Too bad I gotta go.

00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,788
-No!

478
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:19,022
-I'll go after him.

479
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,222
Bunny, you stay here--

480
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:21,822
- --and save my powers in
case something happens?

481
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:23,255
Is that what you
were going to say?

482
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,422
-You got it, partner.

483
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,622
Come back here, you thief!

484
00:18:27,655 --> 00:18:28,222
-Huh?

485
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,455
Can he see me?

[inhaling]

00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:35,022
-You got smoke coming
outta your ass, buddy!

488
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:39,955
-Dammit, why couldn't she
be chasing me instead.

489
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,955
Hey, I only break for Blue Rose.

490
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,155
-Wait a minute.

491
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,888
I've seen that guy.

492
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,955
You're the one who filled
in for Bunny before!

493
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:49,155
-Huh?

494
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:50,122
Damn.

495
00:18:50,155 --> 00:18:51,855
-You're the backstage thief?

496
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:52,788
-I wasn't.

497
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,388
Not until recently.

498
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:55,322
-You're a liar!

499
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:57,055
-This is all your
fault, you know?

500
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:58,122
-What?

501
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,488
-On the day of that
event, I discovered

502
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:01,455
backstage security
was pretty light.

503
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,288
I couldn't help it.

504
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:03,422
I had to take a souvenir.

505
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:05,922
-Oh, so it's our fault
you had sticky fingers?

506
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:07,488
Quit blaming us
for your behavior!

507
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,155
-You'll never
understand my feelings.

508
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:11,188
You get to see Blue
Rose all the time.

509
00:19:11,222 --> 00:19:12,955
-I understand you're
a crazy stalker.

510
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:13,888
Ho ho aah!

511
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:14,588
Wait a minute?

512
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:15,722
What the hell was that?

513
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:24,122
How did I run right past him?

514
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:25,888
-Yaa!

515
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:29,022
-You're not getting
away from me!

516
00:19:29,055 --> 00:19:30,688
Why am I jumping so far?

517
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:32,155
What's going on?

518
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:33,088
Ho ho aah!

519
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:38,355
That was pretty scary.

520
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:42,188
What's happening to me?

521
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,588
-Why are you all over the place?

522
00:19:43,622 --> 00:19:44,655
-If you're gonna
mess around, you'd

523
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,822
better let me handle this.

524
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:47,055
-Uh, no, you don't understand.

525
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,522
I'm amazing today.

526
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,822
For some reason, I'm
stronger than usual.

527
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:51,688
-Right.

528
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:52,988
-I have a minute left.

529
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:57,088
I'll catch that
sneaky jerk, no sweat.

530
00:19:57,122 --> 00:19:58,355
-Oh wow.

531
00:19:58,388 --> 00:19:59,122
-Give it up!

532
00:19:59,155 --> 00:20:00,622
You're not going anywhere!

533
00:20:00,655 --> 00:20:01,655
-Yaa!

534
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,122
Leave me alone.

535
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:05,455
[grunt]

536
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:06,388
-Thank heavens.

537
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:07,522
-Forgive me, my love.

538
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:08,788
I got carried away.

539
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:10,622
-I'll carry you away!

540
00:20:10,655 --> 00:20:11,122
Raa!

541
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:20,188
What?

542
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:21,188
Aah!

543
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:25,088
[grunting]

544
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,555
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Powers expire in 30 seconds.

545
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:28,655
-Why the glitch?

546
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:29,688
I still have time.

547
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,022
-Tiger, what are you doing?

548
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:31,655
-Come on!

549
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,422
He's getting away.

550
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,288
[sigh]

551
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,422
-All right.

552
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,288
I don't know how, but it
looks like I lost him.

553
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:39,455
It's my lucky day.

554
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:43,688
Huh?

555
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:44,655
Aah!

556
00:20:44,688 --> 00:20:47,322
-Where do you
think you're going?

557
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:49,222
Raa!

558
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:49,722
-Yaa!

559
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:02,322
-Rock Bison, you did
a great job today.

560
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:04,188
-Well, thank you very much, sir.

561
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,988
-That move was very timely.

562
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:07,688
To tell you the
truth, we were gonna

563
00:21:07,722 --> 00:21:10,955
let you go if you
continued to do poorly.

564
00:21:10,988 --> 00:21:11,722
-Seriously?

565
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:13,122
-Oh, no worries.

566
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:16,055
Looks like you still have what
it takes to get the job done.

567
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:16,555
-Hmm.

568
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:20,588
What?

569
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,955
So what made my power run out?

570
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,155
-Well, there you go again,
being kind as always, Kotetsu.

571
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:27,388
-Huh?

572
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,755
-Acting as though your power
ran out, that was great.

573
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,322
-What?

574
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,388
-And it worked.

575
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:32,855
Rock Bison was feeling
depressed and you

576
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:34,422
helped him regain
his confidence.

577
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:36,055
-Uh, wait, you've
got it all wrong.

578
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,322
-Come on.

579
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:40,022
Admit it, you knew exactly
how to handle this one.

580
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:42,188
I'm sure you could have
easily made the arrest.

581
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:43,322
-He's right.

582
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,822
And on top of that, you
got this back for me.

583
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,122
-Uh--

584
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:50,055
-But I hope you don't make
a habit of being unselfish.

585
00:21:50,088 --> 00:21:51,555
We have to protect
our point total.

586
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,822
-Um, Tiger?

587
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:58,622
-Hm?

588
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:02,288
-I'm, uh-- (ANGRILY) I'll
treasure this forever,

589
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:02,822
all right?

590
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:10,388
-That was weird.

591
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,049
[music - tamaki, "mind game"]

592
00:23:47,815 --> 00:23:51,415
-Man, I haven't been able to
kick ass like that in a while.

593
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:54,549
-Yeah, I was pretty
impressive myself today.

594
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:55,049
Hm.

595
00:24:00,449 --> 00:24:04,382
I've never had that
much pure power before.

596
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:07,282
Hold on a second-- could
my power be evolving?

597
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:13,049
BARNABY: Hi there.

598
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:14,749
I'm Barnaby Brooks, Junior,
the member of the Tiger

599
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:17,682
and Bunny who always drinks
milk before he goes to bed.

600
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:18,349
What?

601
00:24:18,382 --> 00:24:20,282
Sky High is in love?

602
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,415
I think something big
is going to happen.

603
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:25,449
Next time on "Tiger and
Bunny," "The Sky's the Limit."

604
00:24:25,482 --> 00:24:25,807
See ya.
