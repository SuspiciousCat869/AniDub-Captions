00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,659
-But why right now?

167
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,726
Is this related to your
daughter's new powers?

168
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,159
Is there something
wrong with her?

169
00:10:32,192 --> 00:10:34,726
-No, it has nothing to
do with that at all.

170
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,859
-Then why are you running away?

171
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,926
-Well, I just think
it's time for me

172
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,059
to settle down and
be a normal guy.

173
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:42,992
You know what I mean?

174
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,192
-No.

175
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,192
-Being a hero is unpredictable.

176
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:47,592
It's fine when
you're a young man,

177
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:51,892
but I'm getting too old
for this stuff, which

178
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,059
is why I decided to get
out of the hero game

179
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:56,592
and get myself a nice desk
job like everybody else.

180
00:10:56,626 --> 00:11:00,626
-Do you honestly think
I'm going to believe that?

181
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,459
Why want you just tell me
what's really going on?

182
00:11:03,492 --> 00:11:04,459
-Huh?

183
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:06,159
-You always told
me that partners

184
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:10,026
are supposed to be
there for each other.

185
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,559
The truth is you don't
trust me, do you?

186
00:11:12,592 --> 00:11:13,692
-Hey, come on Bunny.

187
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:15,026
It's not like that.

188
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,092
Oh, I get it.

189
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,392
All day long, you've
been trying to help,

190
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:19,826
trying to stop me from quitting.

191
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,659
You were doing all
that so it would

192
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,659
make it easier when you quit.

193
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:25,492
-Well, I--

194
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:27,226
-The only reason
you wanted to help

195
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,226
was so you wouldn't feel guilty
for turning your back on me.

196
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,192
-No!

197
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:36,259
-I trusted you, and
you betrayed me.

198
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,692
Well, guess what?

199
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,759
You don't have to bother
pretending anymore.

200
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:43,726
Leave whenever you feel like
it, I'll be just fine on my own.

201
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,892
-Hey, hang on a second Bunny.

202
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:47,192
-I'm better off alone.

203
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:48,492
-Huh?

204
00:11:48,526 --> 00:11:51,092
-I was doing fine
before I met you,

205
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:52,959
and I'll be relieved
when you're gone.

206
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:55,026
-You don't mean that.

207
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,026
-Letting you get some
arrests was one thing,

208
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,692
but I'm tired of carrying you.

209
00:11:58,726 --> 00:11:59,459
-Hey!

210
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,492
-I'm better as a solo act.

211
00:12:01,526 --> 00:12:04,726
In fact, I can't wait
till you're gone.

212
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:15,059
-Woah!

213
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:16,192
Sorry about that Bunny .

214
00:12:16,226 --> 00:12:17,926
Don't you power up!

215
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,192
Hey, wait a minute!

216
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:19,892
Come on!

217
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:23,192
Uh.

218
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,959
-Sorry to drop in so suddenly.

219
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:32,892
-Did something happen.

220
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,192
Why don't you try
telling me about it?

221
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,192
I might be able to
help you out Barnaby.

222
00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:50,659
-It's my parents.

223
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,892
Their murder isn't solved.

224
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:57,926
Whoever killed my mom
and dad, it wasn't Jake.

225
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,059
-What!

226
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,226
Impossible!

227
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,059
-Kriem let it slip
right before she died.

228
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,259
-I can vouch for his innocence.

229
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,226
I was with him the
entire day it happened.

230
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:09,659
We're just a small
faction of Ouroboros.

231
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:15,726
BUNNY: The real
murderer is probably

232
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,059
someone else who works
with Ouroboros, which

233
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:22,126
means Ouroboros might be a much
bigger organization than we

234
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,259
ever imagined.

235
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:24,926
-And you're just going
to believe everything

236
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,826
a dying criminal tells you?

237
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,692
-But what about that tattoo?

238
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,426
The murder had one on his
right hand, but Jake didn't.

239
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,392
-Then, I'm sorry Barnaby.

240
00:13:35,426 --> 00:13:37,292
It appears we're
back to square one.

241
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:42,126
-That's not the only thing.

242
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,826
Ever since I found out that
Jake wasn't the real murderer,

243
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,159
my memory has been
a complete mess.

244
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,759
Without that lead, I
don't know anything.

245
00:13:49,792 --> 00:13:51,792
-You should calm down my boy.

246
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,859
I can understand
your frustration,

247
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,526
but impatience won't help you
get any closer to the truth.

248
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,892
Perhaps, I should do some
digging into Ouroboros.

249
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:09,359
-Thank you.

250
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:14,059
-Was anyone else
in the room when

251
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,259
Kriem gave you that information?

252
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,159
-Huh?

253
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,859
-I think it would
be wise to keep

254
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,692
this just between the two of us.

255
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,559
-Kotetsu was with me.

256
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:24,026
That's it, but--

257
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:29,892
[phone ringing]

258
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:30,592
-I don't mind.

259
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:32,892
You can answer it.

260
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:34,226
-Sorry Samantha.

261
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,892
Would you mind if I
called you back later?

262
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,659
-Barnaby I remember the
day of your parents murder.

263
00:14:50,192 --> 00:14:52,459
-Hey, can I leave my
car here overnight?

264
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,092
-Sure, buddy.

265
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,059
Of course you can.

266
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,559
-Great, Ill take
something stronger.

267
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:03,226
-Well, Barnaby, you've already
broken Mr. Legends record,

268
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,959
so is there any hero out
there you aspire to be?

269
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,626
-Well, no one comes to mind.

270
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,992
-Thanks, pal.

271
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:13,592
-But, you know, there is one
person with more heart than me.

272
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,592
REPORTER: Oh, more
heart, you say?

273
00:15:15,626 --> 00:15:17,792
-He's clumsy and
does crazy things,

274
00:15:17,826 --> 00:15:20,526
but he always gives it
110% and takes pride

275
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:22,592
in his work like no one else.

276
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,826
He impresses me
all the time, and I

277
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:27,492
hope that one day I can
be worthy of his trust.

278
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,059
Even so, I wouldn't want
to be exactly like him.

279
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,592
-Which hero is it?

280
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:33,859
-That's a secret.

281
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:38,759
(VOICEOVER) The truth is
you don't trust me, do you?

282
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,926
-On second thought,
I'm done for the night.

283
00:15:46,492 --> 00:15:49,059
SAMANTHA (ON PHONE): What you
said yesterday got me thinking,

284
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:52,959
so I dug through some old
boxes, and I found a photograph.

285
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:53,926
-Photograph?

286
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:55,159
SAMANTHA (ON PHONE):
Yes, Barnaby.

287
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:59,059
It was taken the
day of the murder.

288
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:01,492
-What is going on?

289
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:02,926
SAMANTHA (ON PHONE):
I don't know,

290
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,592
but ever since I
found this picture,

291
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:09,092
I've been really confused
about what happened.

292
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:12,226
I still can't make head
or tails of any of this.

293
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:13,959
-Don't get too upset, OK?

294
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:16,426
Listen, I'll look into this
and give you a call later on.

295
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,126
-Everything OK Barnaby?

296
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:38,692
-Mr. Maverick, you
took me to the park

297
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:42,159
to see the Christmas tree the
day they died, didn't you?

298
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:49,859
-Barnaby, don't-- Yes,
it was 21 years ago.

299
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,792
You and I went to see
the Christmas tree

300
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:53,326
and spent the day together.

301
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,226
We've gone over this 100 times.

302
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,192
BUNNY (VOICEOVER): I can't wait
to show this to mom and dad

303
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:06,392
when I get home.

304
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:12,026
[laughter]

305
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,492
-I know!

306
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,592
I wasn't with you.

307
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:18,592
-Of course you were.

308
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:20,859
What on earth are
you talking about?

309
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,492
-I visited the
Christmas tree that day,

310
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:24,159
but you weren't the one with me.

311
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:25,559
-Yes, I was.

312
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:28,659
My boy, you seem to be a
bit confused and anxious.

313
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:30,026
Maybe you need some rest.

314
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,359
-I can remember it
perfectly now all

315
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:35,492
because of Samantha's
this picture.

316
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:36,959
SAMANTHA (VOICEOVER):
Yes, Barnaby.

317
00:17:36,992 --> 00:17:39,526
It was taken the
day of the murder.

318
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:45,159
-What is going on?

319
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,192
You weren't there with me that
day at the Christmas tree.

320
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:53,992
So the real question
is, why have you

321
00:17:54,026 --> 00:17:57,026
been lying about
it all these years?

322
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,559
And if you weren't with me,
then what were you really

323
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:01,959
doing that day?

324
00:18:01,992 --> 00:18:05,059
-How dare you talk
to me like that?

325
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,759
If anything you should
be grateful to me.

326
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,826
You are the man you are because
of the way I raised you.

327
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:13,992
When you were young, I was
impressed by your powers.

328
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,992
I knew that I could make
you into a true hero,

329
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,426
and I was right.

330
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,692
You have far surpassed
my original expectations.

331
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,492
-What are you talking about?

332
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:27,692
-Barnaby, seeing you now I
know I made the right decision.

333
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:29,392
I'm glad I let you live.

334
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:31,292
-Let me live?

335
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,626
No, you don't mean--

336
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,826
-Your mother and father
had a strong sense

337
00:18:35,859 --> 00:18:40,759
of justice and compassion
almost to a fault

338
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,526
It was rough when I
first launched Hero TV.

339
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,692
Your parents were about the only
people who supported my vision.

340
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:49,026
They were my closest friends.

341
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:51,892
They even provided me with
the earliest hero suits

342
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:54,026
using special metal
alloys they developed

343
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,926
through their extensive
robotics research.

344
00:18:56,959 --> 00:19:02,559
But despite our best efforts,
Hero TV's ratings were abysmal.

345
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,792
The audience was against us.

346
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:08,559
People still had a strong
prejudice against the NEXT.

347
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:10,259
So I came up with
a plan that would

348
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,559
make the heroes of
vital necessity,

349
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:17,026
and at the same time,
boost my show's ratings.

350
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:21,792
I set up exciting crimes and
broadcast the arrests live.

351
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:24,126
I knew that by doing so,
the people of the city

352
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:26,192
would change how they
thought about heroes.

353
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,326
But I needed
perpetrators, so I had

354
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,926
to team up with a certain
crime organization.

355
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:34,792
-You mean Ouroboros?

356
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:37,692
-The plan worked perfectly,
but just as the show

357
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:41,759
began to pick up steam, your
parents asked to meet with me.

358
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:42,859
It was on Christmas Eve.

359
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:48,692
-Did you think we wouldn't
find out what you were doing?

360
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:50,392
We didn't develop
nanometals so they

361
00:19:50,426 --> 00:19:52,092
could be used by criminals.

362
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:53,726
MR. MAVERICK (VOICEOVER):
They realized

363
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,692
that I had joined forces
with the organization

364
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:57,859
and had been using
their technology

365
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,959
to supply them with weapons.

366
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:03,326
They demanded that I come
clean, make everything public,

367
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,759
and atone for my crimes.

368
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,126
But when I refused

369
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,526
[sigh]

370
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:25,826
It turned out that your parents
were far too smart and too

371
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,526
naive for their own good.

372
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:39,526
[gun shots]

373
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:41,026
-It can't be.

374
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:42,359
You're lying.

375
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:44,226
I can still see that
moment, and you're not

376
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:46,226
the murder in my memories.

377
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:49,059
-There's one more thing
I've neglected to tell.

378
00:20:49,092 --> 00:20:53,792
You see, I can plant memories
inside people's minds.

379
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:55,926
You're a NEXT.

380
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,626
-But now it's apparent that
the memory I implanted in you

381
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:01,992
has been compromised by
the tiniest contradiction.

382
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,359
This isn't good.

383
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:06,859
-You mean all this time you
were the one behind everything?

384
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,059
-There is really no point in
asking any more questions.

385
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:11,926
After all, when I'm
done, you're going

386
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:13,592
to forget this
entire conversation.

387
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,688
-Uh

388
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,326
-Don't worry my boy.

389
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:51,492
I will give you this
gift one more time.

390
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,759
[phone ringing]

391
00:22:30,926 --> 00:22:33,592
-Have sweet dreams Barnaby.

392
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:48,092
[music playing]

393
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:13,060
BUNNY (VOICEOVER):
Hi, I'm Barnaby

394
00:24:13,093 --> 00:24:16,227
the member of Tiger & Bunny who
uses an electric toothbrush.

395
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,160
Be careful Kotetsu!

396
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:20,460
It's been him all along.

397
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:24,427
Next time on Tiger & Bunny,
Full of Courtesy Full of Craft.

398
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,293
See you!
