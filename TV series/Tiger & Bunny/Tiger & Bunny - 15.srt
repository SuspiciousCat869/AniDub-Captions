00:07:43,822 --> 00:07:45,622
-(IN UNISON) Mm-hmm.

166
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:46,255
-OK.

167
00:07:46,288 --> 00:07:47,755
I'm all yours.

168
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,222
[grunt]

169
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,722
Here goes.

170
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:57,355
-Start with a smile.

171
00:07:57,388 --> 00:08:01,322
No girl can resist a winning
smile from a hot hunk.

172
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,155
-Hey.

173
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:03,822
How you doin'?

174
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:06,255
-Hi.

175
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:07,455
-Compliment her.

176
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,055
Girls like it if you
tell them they look nice.

177
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:11,755
-That's a nice hairband.

178
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:15,822
It's an interesting shade
of red, my favorite color.

179
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:17,488
Is it your favorite as well?

180
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:18,488
-It's not.

181
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:19,922
-OK.

182
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:22,622
-Girls need physical contact.

183
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,955
Just take her hand and
she'll be yours forever.

184
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:30,722
[gulp]

185
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:38,655
[belch]

186
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,055
-Well, see ya.

187
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:55,988
-Right here, please.

188
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,555
Can you face my camera?

189
00:08:57,588 --> 00:08:59,122
-Over here, too.

190
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,322
Many of my readers
look up to you,

191
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:04,055
but who is the person
you admire most?

192
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,888
-Well, I'd have
to say Mr. Legend.

193
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:07,988
-Why?

194
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,722
KOTETSU: 'Cause he's
so rad and so awesome.

195
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:11,755
-(IN UNISON) Mm.

196
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:12,888
-And you, Mr. Barnaby?

197
00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:13,855
Same question.

198
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,688
-I suppose that
would be my parents.

199
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,922
-Go on.

200
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,322
-Well, my mom and my
dad devoted their lives

201
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:21,188
to robotics research.

202
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:23,722
They had one dream--
to create a robot that

203
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:27,322
could protect people and bring
peace to the entire world.

204
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:30,222
They were partners at
work and partners at home.

205
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,155
I may wear a suit
and fight crime,

206
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:35,255
but my parents are my heroes.

207
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,788
BOY INTERVIEWER:
What a great answer.

208
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:38,722
GIRL INTERVIEWER: So sincere.

209
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:41,555
LLOYDS: Oh, I learned
something new today, Barnaby.

210
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:44,688
So, your parents really
worked in robotics?

211
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:47,322
-Yeah.

212
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:52,088
I have fond memories of them
bringing me along to their lab.

213
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:55,688
They always looked so cool
when they were at work.

214
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:59,922
I loved them both so much.

215
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:02,922
-I wish Kaede would feel
the same way about her dad.

216
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:04,555
-I'm sure she loves you too.

217
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:05,788
-Eh, I don't know.

218
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,622
Whenever I call her, all she
does is complain about me,

219
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:12,122
harping about how my stories
are boring or my jokes are dumb

220
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:13,922
or my beard is lame.

221
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:15,422
-She's right.

222
00:10:15,455 --> 00:10:17,455
-Gee, thanks a lot, pal.

223
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:18,088
Huh?

224
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,222
Hey, check it out.

225
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:20,555
BARNABY: Hero TV?

226
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,822
NEWSCASTER: We are live
with a suspect on the run

227
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,455
and he's got hostages.

228
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:25,888
And who's that in pursuit?

229
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,288
It's Sky High!

230
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:30,488
Can he break out of his slump
and make an arrest today?

231
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:32,955
-Hey, why the hell weren't
we called in on this?

232
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:34,088
-Is the comm broken?

233
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:34,922
LLOYDS: No.

234
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:35,988
I told them not to bother you.

235
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:37,322
-(IN UNISON) Huh?

236
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:40,288
-You two have your hands full
with all these interviews.

237
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,522
Your time is just too valuable.

238
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:44,655
I thought all the second
tier heroes could handle--

239
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:45,655
KOTETSU: Are you
out of your mind?

240
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:46,788
-Eh?

241
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,355
-Our job isn't to smile
for your dumb cameras!

242
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:50,955
We're heroes, dammit,
and heroes are

243
00:10:50,988 --> 00:10:52,922
supposed to be out there
saving people's lives.

244
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,555
-Kotetsu, take it easy.

245
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,088
NEWSCASTER: She did it!

246
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,522
Dragon Kid has
apprehended the criminal!

247
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,755
-Ha!

248
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:04,555
NEWSCASTER: And Origami
Cyclone racks up some points

249
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,388
for rescuing the hostages.

250
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:09,488
The young heroes are
really shining this season.

251
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:12,488
Meanwhile, Sky High suffered
a sudden crash right

252
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:13,488
at the end of the chase.

253
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,488
He'll finish scoreless again.

254
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:18,922
Sadly, his slump continues.

255
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,724
ANNOUNCER: They're the
invincible Tiger and Barnaby.

256
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:33,124
-I, uh-- I didn't expect
to find you here so late.

257
00:11:33,157 --> 00:11:33,624
-Yes.

258
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:40,724
-Would you mind if I get
some things off my chest?

259
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:42,524
-No.

260
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:47,590
-You see, I used to be the
best at my job until recently.

261
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,224
Now, nothing seems to click.

262
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,357
It's not dropping in
rank that bothers me,

263
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,024
it's just-- everyone has
these expectations of me

264
00:11:57,057 --> 00:12:00,590
and I don't want to
let them all down.

265
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:03,390
I failed them once, and
I learned the hard way

266
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:05,590
what it feels like
to be powerless.

267
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:10,590
And now, when it's time
to work, I-- freeze up.

268
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:13,124
I'm completely helpless.

269
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:16,124
I mean, the way things
have been going lately,

270
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:19,457
I'd be better off quitting.

271
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,857
WOMAN: Why?

272
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,624
-Because I'm worried that-- that
everyone will lose faith in me.

273
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:25,490
WOMAN: Why?

274
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:28,157
-Because I-- I can't--

275
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,824
-But why?

276
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,957
-You're forcing me to confront
a deeper truth, aren't you?

277
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,057
It's true.

278
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,824
I've just been
hiding behind excuses

279
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:50,924
and not doing anything to
change things for myself.

280
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:51,890
Thank you.

281
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:56,990
I-- it's late.

282
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:57,957
Let me walk you home.

283
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,757
-I am fine.

284
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,257
-Uh-- yeah.

285
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,457
Sorry for unloading like that.

286
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,524
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.

287
00:13:05,557 --> 00:13:08,357
Good night.

288
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,524
-Ah, Cis.

289
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,290
There you are.

290
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:17,824
I was worried about you.

291
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:18,590
-I am sorry.

292
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:42,090
-Here goes nothing.

293
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:43,924
[sigh]

294
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,557
-I can't believe we wasted
the whole friggin' day.

295
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,024
BARNABY: Giving interviews is
an important part of the job.

296
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,757
-But if all we do is talk,
we're gonna get out of shape.

297
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,457
-You know, maybe you
should stop whining

298
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,790
and try to follow
Sky High's example.

299
00:13:56,824 --> 00:13:57,890
-Huh?

300
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,924
-He never complained
when he was on top.

301
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:02,924
And if you think about it, he
worked twice as hard as we did.

302
00:14:02,957 --> 00:14:03,957
-Yeah, I know.

303
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:12,024
But still-- Whoa!

304
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,557
What the hell?

305
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,224
-Cis!

306
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:15,724
Stop!

307
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,824
[gasp]

308
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,690
-Are you all right, sir?

309
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,257
-Aren't you--

310
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,357
-She looks like a
power-type NEXT.

311
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,390
KOTETSU: That's
an understatement.

312
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:41,157
-Heroes.

313
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,631
Heroes.

314
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,265
-Yes!

315
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,798
It's about time I get to
do some real work today.

316
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:51,398
Hey, lady!

317
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,865
Waa!

318
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:54,665
[grunt]

319
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:55,898
-Heroes.

320
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,598
-Guess talking isn't an option.

321
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:07,565
-Plan B. What?

322
00:15:07,598 --> 00:15:08,065
Whoa!

323
00:15:12,798 --> 00:15:14,198
-She's powerful.

324
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,465
-What's wrong with her?

325
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,265
This is crazy!

326
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:20,131
-Perfect.

327
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:21,198
She's perfect.

328
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:29,598
-Yes.

329
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,598
No.

330
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,865
I am sorry.

331
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,165
I don't know.

332
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,131
I am fine.

333
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,298
Yes.

334
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:40,865
KOTETSU: That chick isn't human.

335
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,498
BARNABY: I had no idea such
an advanced android could even

336
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:44,665
exist.

337
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,665
-No, it couldn't until now.

338
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,898
I'm the one who brought
her into existence.

339
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,331
-You created her?

340
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:55,698
MAN: Yes, to show the
world that androids

341
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,898
have infinite capabilities,
that they could easily

342
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:03,198
surpass humans and soon could
even surpassed the NEXT.

343
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,965
My whole life, I've
worked to create

344
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,531
an all-powerful
cybernetic being,

345
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,998
one that will rise above us all.

346
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:14,031
I poured all of my data
into one prototype, Cis.

347
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,431
She is perfect.

348
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:17,765
Cis is my masterpiece.

349
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,965
-Hero.

350
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,098
-Knock it off!

351
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,398
And stop saying
"Heroes" already.

352
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:24,765
BARNABY: What do you want?

353
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:26,662
Why did you program
her to kill heroes?

354
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:28,728
MAN: No, she's not
programmed to kill you.

355
00:16:28,762 --> 00:16:32,795
This is all just a
peculiar malfunction.

356
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:36,428
Her memory is loaded full of
data on every single hero.

357
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,762
After all, I wanted her
to become the strongest

358
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,795
being in the world, so I
gave her powerful examples

359
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,428
to draw from.

360
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:48,195
But then, a few days ago,
while transporting her,

361
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:51,428
our vehicle was
struck by lightning.

362
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:54,595
In the commotion that followed,
Cis jumped out of the car

363
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:56,128
and fled.

364
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:59,262
And by the time I was
able to track her down,

365
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:00,962
her system appeared
to be damaged

366
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:02,828
by the electrical shock.

367
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:06,195
Now, it seems whenever she sees
anything related to heroes,

368
00:17:06,228 --> 00:17:09,328
she shifts into battle mode.

369
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,528
And that's what we
are witnessing here.

370
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:15,495
But this is far better
than I could have imagined.

371
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:18,695
I didn't think she could beat
your heroes this quickly.

372
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,495
And none of this would
have been possible

373
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:23,495
without your parents' research.

374
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:26,762
You still don't
recognize me, young man?

375
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,162
-You're--

376
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:29,028
-The name's Rotwang.

377
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:31,562
I worked for your mom and dad.

378
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:35,628
And yes, Cis is based
on their research.

379
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:39,195
It was passed on to me and
I took it to the next level.

380
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:41,762
They would have been so pleased.

381
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,728
-The hell they would!

382
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,062
My mother and father wanted
to invent a machine that

383
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:49,228
could save people's lives,
not some mindless weapon

384
00:17:49,262 --> 00:17:52,128
of mass destruction
like that thing.

385
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:55,195
ROTWANG: Young man, I put
their theories into practice.

386
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:59,328
As scientists, that's exactly
what would have they wanted!

387
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,795
[scream]

388
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:03,162
CIS: I am sorry.

389
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,562
I don't know.

390
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,395
I am fine.

391
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:09,162
ROTWANG: Unfortunately,
Cis will continue

392
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:12,228
to destroy the city
unless she is shut down.

393
00:18:12,262 --> 00:18:15,828
You see, Sternbild is plastered
with the faces of heroes.

394
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,762
BARNABY: Dammit.

395
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:21,462
KOTETSU: That-- really hurt.

396
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:24,828
It's payback time!

397
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:27,095
Hey, quit moving!

398
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:27,828
Whoa.

399
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:33,262
What the-- waa!

400
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,095
-Hold it!

401
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:38,562
-Aw, crap.

402
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:42,462
I, I thought I activated
my power when Bunny did.

403
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,862
How come his is still going?

404
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:45,795
-Dammit.

405
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:47,262
She can fly too?

406
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:54,295
KEITH: Hold it right there!

407
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:54,895
-Huh?

408
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:56,828
Sky High?

409
00:18:56,862 --> 00:18:58,028
-I can handle this one.

410
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:04,062
What kind of robot is this?

going to have to destroy her.

-I did it.

424
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:01,128
I did it.

425
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:06,828
-Well, what a
difference a day makes.

426
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:09,662
KARINA: Yeah, glad he's
back to his old self.

427
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:12,428
Wish I could say the
same for that one.

428

NATHAN: Huh, I wonder
what's eating him?

429
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:20,628
-Do you think
it'll happen again?

430
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:22,095
-Huh?

431
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,662
-Another android attack like
the one we had last night?

432
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,628
-Hey, Bunny, are you all right?

433
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:29,762
-Well, I am still
shocked that my parents'

434
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,495
work was manipulated
like it was.

435
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:34,262
But at the same
time, I can't presume

436
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:35,962
to know whether they
would have objected

437
00:20:35,995 --> 00:20:38,095
to Rotwang's ultimate goals.

438
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:41,695
If only they were still
alive, I could ask them.

Come on, guys.

00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:46,962
Heroes aren't supposed
to be all depressed.

442
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,128
We've got to set an
example for the citizens.

-Yeah, you're right.

-All right.

hear from you like this.

492
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:24,260
of a Well."

493
00:24:24,293 --> 00:24:26,127
Can I do that again?
