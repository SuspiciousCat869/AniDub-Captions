your results, dear,

but you might want to
use a little more flair.

-More flair?

a bit, get some buzz going.

We've been over this a
million times already.

young woman, all right?

Hey, why don't you
try that clipon?

-Oh, come on now, it's a
gift from your parents.

-I'll do anything else
you ask, all right?

-So, how was it?

26
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:05,922
Did you sleep all right in the
chamber I developed for you?

27
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,822

were quite extensive.

Did you really have
to tag that on?

00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:31,255

that it was my chamber.

it's like for parents when

out a gift for you.

far away, they're

in that moment.

-Who cares?

They don't know the first
thing about my feelings.

-All right, easy now.

00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:31,322
Try to keep an open mind,
he does have a point.

166
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:35,188
You should always treasure the
things your parents give you.

167
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:37,255
-Sharings not really
your strong suit, is it?

168
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,688
-That one?

169
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,355
-Doesn't smell right.

170
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:46,888
-Well, on to the next.

171
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:50,922
-Here I come.

172
00:08:59,488 --> 00:08:59,955
Ugh.

173
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,322
-It was worth putting
you through all

174
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,555
those special classes.

175
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,622
-That's right, you're
the pride of our family.

176
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,355
No, the pride of
the entire country.

177
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:21,088
-Here Pao-Lin, wear this on your
road to becoming a famous hero.

178
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:24,355
-OK.

179
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:29,988
-Dinner's ready.

180
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:35,355
Come on now.

181
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:36,488
You're hungry, aren't you?

182
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,922
I'm not giving up that easy.

183
00:09:41,955 --> 00:09:44,355
-Please, no more messes in here.

184
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:45,788
-Let me take care of this.

185
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,855
-But I went through all
the trouble of making it.

186
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,155
Wait, are these--

187
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:07,688
-There, there.

188
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:08,622
That's a good boy.

189
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:31,355
-Are they out?

190
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:32,255
-Like a light.

191
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:33,822
-Today really bummed me out.

192
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,188
It's sad to think
a kid could know

193
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:37,222
so little about her
parents feelings.

194
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,422
-Are you talking
about Dragon Kid?

195
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:40,855
-Hard to ignore.

196
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:43,755
I send stuff to my daughter too.

197
00:10:43,788 --> 00:10:46,422
Can't help but wonder
what my kid thinks of me.

198
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:54,755
-So, how are your
injuries doing?

199
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,655
-Don't tell me you're
worried all of a sudden.

200
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,922
-Well, the only
reason you got hurt

201
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,755
is that you were
trying to protect me.

202
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:05,022
-My endurance is
all I've got, right?

203
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,755
-As far as I can tell.

204
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:10,288
-So, uh, all that
data that popped up,

205
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:11,988
did you complete
that all on your own?

206
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:12,488
-Yeah.

207
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,355
-Digging all of this
stuff up by yourself

208
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,522
must have been one hell
of a rough road, huh?

209
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:25,655
-I've been searching
desperately for 20 years.

210
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:28,188
I watched my parents
get murdered.

211
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:32,122
That single day has been
haunting me for my entire life.

212
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:33,855
-You saw it then?

213
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:36,088
Did you get a look at
the murderer's face?

214
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:38,622
-I think I might have,
but I can't remember it.

215
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:41,088
My memories of that day
are pretty faded by now.

216
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:42,788
The only thing I can
still see clearly

217
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,388
is the tattoo on his hand.

218
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:46,522
-Tattoo?

219
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:49,388
-I've been chasing the
murderer for most of my life,

220
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,922
with only this mark to go on.

221
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,388
And then one day, I
just turn on the news

222
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,855
and there it is staring
me in the face again.

223
00:11:56,888 --> 00:12:00,022
-I hereby sentence the
accused, J.G. Benjamin

224
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:03,322
to 250 years of
solitary confinement.

225
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,222
Court is adjourned.

226
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:06,955
-Hold on, that mark, what is it?

227
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:08,188
I finally found you.

228
00:12:08,222 --> 00:12:09,722
I'm not letting you get away.

229
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:10,888
-Get back young man.

230
00:12:10,922 --> 00:12:12,688
-Not until he tells me
what those symbols mean.

231
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:13,688
You know.

232
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:17,155
Please tell me.

233
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,288
Ouroboros.

234
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,255
-Ouroboros?

235
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:23,122
What is Ouroboros?

236
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:25,488
-I had established a
link between this symbol

237
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:28,655
and some group called
Ouroboros, but the one lead

238
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:31,555
I had went up in smoke as
the man I stumbled across

239
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:33,788
went mad in prison
and eventually died.

240
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,655
It's been two
decades, and I still

241
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,622
haven't caught up with
my parents' killer.

242
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:41,955
If only I could remember
what the bastard looked like.

243
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:44,088
-Trust me, I get why
you're frustrated,

244
00:12:44,122 --> 00:12:45,822
but maybe you need
to ease off a bit.

245
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:47,955
You're not going to force
the memories to come back

246
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,922
and racking your brain
like this isn't helping.

247
00:12:52,588 --> 00:12:53,655
I wouldn't worry about it.

248
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:54,888
You're going to find the guy.

249
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:01,155
-Hey, hey.

250
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:01,722
Morning you guys.

251
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,588
It smells like a bar.

252
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,122
What do you say
we go for a walk?

253
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,455
-Oh, I'm in heaven.

254
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:19,455
Breath it in, sisters, that's
the smell of money in the air.

255
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:23,188
-This place is teeming
with high society types.

256
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:24,755
-Get a load of this over here.

257
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,222
-Yeah, sis.

258
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,355
I'd say this one is
ripe for the picking.

[doorbell ringing]

260
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:48,782
-I shouldn't have
been so careless.

261
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:52,849
-Oh please, shut up.

262
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:55,716
I'm trying to get some
friggin' sleep here.

263
00:13:55,749 --> 00:13:56,182
-Miss Agnes.

264
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:01,816
-Do you know how long I've
been ringing this bell?

265
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,649
-Thanks for going
through all the trouble.

266
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:10,616
-Well, believe me, I
didn't do it for your sake.

267
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,682
We need to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

268
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:14,482
This is the mayor's baby.

269
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:16,349
-Well, we better
not screw it up.

270
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,816
-So where is the baby?

271
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:18,849
-He's been pretty quiet.

272
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:21,249
I think he's still sleeping.

273
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,349
-Start talking.

274
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:24,016
How do we get in touch
with your family?

275
00:14:24,049 --> 00:14:26,582
-And don't even bother giving
us the runaround, honey.

276
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,816
I can smell lies.

277
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:32,316
-Leave him alone.

00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:34,049
-I don't have all day.

-Where are you two?

281
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,282
-Your daughter's a
little busy right now.

282
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,649
-Who is this?

283
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,749
-If you want your kids back,
bring 1 million stern dollars

284
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:50,416
to warehouse number three
at the West-Bronze Docks.

285
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:51,549
-What?

286
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,249
-And if you even think
of going to the cops,

287
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:55,349
the kiddies are dead, OK?

288
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:56,416
-Kidnapped them?

289
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,549
-How the hell could
you let this happen?

290
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:02,282
What are we going to do if those
people hurt the mayor's baby?

291
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,582
-What are we sitting around for?

292
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:04,749
We should just go get them.

293
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:06,082
-Are you crazy?

294
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:08,116
They're holding Pao-Lin and
the baby hostage out there.

295
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:08,982
-Don't worry.

296
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:09,682
I have a plan.

297
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:14,982
The kidnapper only
heard your voice.

298
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:16,349
When we get to
the meeting point,

299
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,982
you'll pose as the
kid's mother and keep

300
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,382
them occupied as
long as you can.

301
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,916
Then me and the
old man here will

302
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:24,516
rush in and snatch the kids.

303
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,982
-Damn it, don't over here.

304
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:30,049
-All right, lady,
hand over the money.

305
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:32,082
-You're the serial
kidnappers that everyone's

306
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:34,616
been talking about on
the news, aren't you?

307

-Oh man.

308
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:37,816
It's so crazy how famous we are.

309
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,182
-Although kidnapping
sounds so ruthless.

310
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:42,716
-Think about it, all we're
really doing is babysitting.

311
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:44,816
-The only thing is our
fees are a little high.

312
00:15:44,849 --> 00:15:46,582
-My children, are
they still safe?

313
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,782
I want to see that they're OK.

00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:49,616
-Hold it.

315

You're not their
mother, are you?

316

-Something's wrong.

317

I'm not smelling a lot of
green on this lady, sis.

-Don't screw with us.

00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:59,216
We can smell your
lies a mile away.

320
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,416
-You take care of Agnes.

321
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,816
Come back here.

322
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:10,782

00:16:14,382 --> 00:16:16,316
-My skirt is filthy.

00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,616
This is one of my best outfits.

325
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,816
You round up those
hussies, you hear me?

326
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:21,316
-Got it.

327
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:25,282
-That hurts.

328
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:35,082
Hey, I've seen you before.

329
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,782
Oh wait, you're a
hero, aren't you?

330
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:40,416
-Yeah, and what if I am?

331
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,016
-Doesn't smell like
it pays very well.

332
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:42,849
Go figure.

333
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,049
-That's none of your business.

334
00:16:44,082 --> 00:16:45,816
-Oh, I'm sorry.

335
00:16:45,849 --> 00:16:49,949
But come on, can't you look the
other way for little old me?

336
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:54,749
-Look, that's not going
to work on me, OK?

337
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:55,949
-Please, don't listen to him.

338
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:56,816
He loves it.

339
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,949
-Oh, get over yourselves.

340
00:16:57,982 --> 00:16:59,316
What do you think
I am, an idiot?

341
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,282
Damn.

342
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:10,416
-That's what you get for
letting your mind wander.

343
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:11,516
-Stop right there.

344
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:12,282
-Good idea.

345
00:17:12,316 --> 00:17:13,316
Ask them to stop.

346
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,982
I'm sure that'll work.

347
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:16,882
-Well, he's not sweating, is he?

348
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,582
He's sleeping through
his own kidnapping.

349
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,782
You smell like trouble, kid.

350
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:28,682
Spill it.

351
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,316
Are you a NEXT, like me?

352
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,516
-You?

353
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,949
-That's right, and the
same goes for my sisters.

354
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:36,582
Mary can sniff out
money from a mile away.

355
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,749
Lily has the knack for
sniffing out a lie.

356
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,249
And then I, of course,
have a nose for danger.

357
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:43,649
We decided to put our
powers to use and start

358
00:17:43,682 --> 00:17:45,582
a babysitting service.

359
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:48,849
And kids like you with your oh
so loving mommies and daddies

360
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,782
are always our best customers.

361
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,149
-My loving parents?

362
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:53,416
-Don't play dumb.

363
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,316
I mean just look
at that baby's hat.

364
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:59,216
The yellow marigold
is a symbol of health.

365
00:17:59,249 --> 00:18:01,182
-A symbol of health?

366
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:03,649
-It's obvious how much
your folks care for you.

367
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:08,216
I'm guessing they'd pay anything
to get you back safe and sound.

368
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:12,616
-Here Pao-Lin, wear this on your
road to becoming a famous hero.

369
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:15,049
-Oh come on, now, it's a
gift from your parents.

370
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:17,216
-But there's no way I'm
putting that thing on.

371
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:21,716
-I don't think I like
what I'm smelling.

372
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:24,082
-Mari, we got some
heroes butting in.

373
00:18:24,116 --> 00:18:25,916
-What did you say?

374
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,549
-Damn it, where the
hell did they go?

375
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:29,249
-They're coming.

376
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:30,549
What do we do?

377
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,749
-The scent of danger
is wafting in.

378

Start the car, were out of here.

379
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,382
We'll leave the girl behind.

00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,749
-But why?

381
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,716
-The kid's a NEXT.

382
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,849
She's a liability.

383
00:18:38,882 --> 00:18:39,349
-Huh?

384
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:46,082
-The baby is a NEXT too.

385
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:09,082
-Will you do something already?

386
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,116
-Undo these handcuffs,
and I'll think about it.

387
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:12,482
-Not going to happen, OK?

388
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:27,249
-Electricity won't
work against me.

389
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:42,149
-You don't want to lose your
special hat now, do you?

390
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,582
Come on, let's put this back on.

391
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,049
Don't worry buddy,
we're almost done.

392
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:56,282
-This is insane.

393
00:19:56,316 --> 00:19:57,982
They'll kill us all.

394
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:01,549
So much danger.

395
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:02,482
-We surrender.

396
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:03,816
-Want to see me go full power?

397
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:07,949
-Hang in there, Dragon Kid.

398
00:20:11,282 --> 00:20:11,882
-It's cool.

399

help from this guy.

-I didn't get to
do a thing today.

I hope it wasn't
too much trouble.

This?

Well, it's just something
my parents got for me.
