Why did I kill him?

-We can all agree that NEXTs
are the most advanced beings

160

some have allowed themselves

to fall under the influence
of much lesser humans.

They're an embarrassment.

00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:24,348
-Oh, and he would like to do so
on one of your live broadcasts.

168
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:26,682
Unless you want us
to sink your city,

169
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,915
you'll roll your cameras for us.

170
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:30,182
-What are we shooting?

171
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:33,548
-Mm, the greatest show ever.

172
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,682
-Are you a total moron?

173
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,382
Jake escaped because you
can defied Barnaby's request

174
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:39,582
and got in his way.

175
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:42,915
That's now how you
treat a teammate.

176
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:44,248
-You're right about that.

177
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,648
-Huh?

178
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:47,815
-I kept trying to convince him
we were a team, but in the end,

179
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,448
I was the one who
didn't trust him.

[comm buzzing]

182
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:23,682
KRIEM (ON TV):
Greetings, all you

183
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:26,082
hero-loving citizens
of Sternbild.

184
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:29,048
Today we'll be presenting
a special live broadcast

185
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,448
of Mr. Jake's seven
deadly matches.

186
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:32,815
-Seven what now?

187
00:09:32,848 --> 00:09:35,715
KRIEM (ON TV): But first, a
word from the man of the hour.

188
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:38,915
-I know how much you love
your so-called heroes,

189
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:42,182
but I'm gonna show you
how worthless they are.

190
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,715
-The rules are simple.

191
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:45,715
Heroes will be picked
at random and Mr,

192
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:47,948
Jake will battle
them one on one.

193
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,282
-Say what?

194
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,715
JAKE (ON TV): If any hero
manages to defeat me in battle,

195
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:55,748
I'll shut down my exosuits and
leave your fair city in peace.

196
00:09:55,782 --> 00:09:58,882
-Sounds great, but what
happens if all the heroes lose?

197
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,782
-Then I'll blow up
the support pillars

198
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,048
and destroy the whole place.

199
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:03,282
KRIEM (ON TV): You heard him.

200
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:05,948
The fate of the city now
lies with the heroes.

201
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:08,315
-Good luck, everybody.

202
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,382
KARINA: What is wrong with him?

203
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:11,915
NATHAN: This guy's
off his rocker.

204
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,915
First he kills his own
man and now this insanity.

205
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,048
-Actually, this could
work out perfectly.

206
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:17,615
NATHAN: Huh?

207
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:18,782
KARINA: What?

208
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:21,415
-As long as it's one on
one and nobody interferes,

209
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,548
I can beat this guy.

210
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,382
KRIEM (ON TV): And now
we'll spin the big wheel

211
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,948
to find out who's fighting
in match number one.

212
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,282
-You.

213
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:34,315
KRIEM: The honor of being the
first challenger goes to--

214
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,282
-Bingo.

215
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:37,882
The King of Heroes.

216
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,148
It's Sky High.

217
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,048
The best one's gonna die first?

218
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,215
Damn, that's gonna
ruin all my fun.

219
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:47,048
-As the King of Heroes, I
gladly accept his challenge.

220
00:10:47,082 --> 00:10:49,215
I will show him the
honor of a champion.

221
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,382
-Careful when you're flying.

222
00:10:50,415 --> 00:10:52,015
He might try to shoot you down.

223
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:52,948
-Shoot him?

224
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:54,815
-When we faced him
at the hideout,

225
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:57,682
he was firing laser beams
out of his fingertips.

226
00:10:57,715 --> 00:10:59,115
And they were
strong enough to go

227
00:10:59,148 --> 00:11:01,582
through thick concrete walls.

228
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:03,182
-I'm not worried in the least.

229
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:06,682
Despite his power, he can't
hurt me if he doesn't hit me.

230
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:08,982
I swear this to you,
Barnaby-- I will capture him

231
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,315
and bring him back to you alive.

232
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,011
-This sucks.

233
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,911
I can't believe we gotta follow
their orders and air this crap.

234
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:22,078
-What are you talking about?

235
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,044
This is television gold.

236
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:24,911
-Huh?

237
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:26,278
-Look, it's about to start.

238
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,178
-Hey, you change your recipe?

239
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:28,744
-Yeah.

240
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:30,078
Can you tell?

241
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:32,478
-Whatever you did, keep doing
it, 'cause this is great.

242
00:11:32,511 --> 00:11:34,078
[laughter]

243
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,144
Huh?

ANNOUNCER: Here he
comes now, the daring

245
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,244

00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:39,644
-Hear me, evildoer!

247
00:11:39,678 --> 00:11:43,211
You have broken our city's laws
and placed lives in jeopardy.

248
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,311
Jake, I am here to
bring you to justice!

249
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:46,711
[slurping]

250
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:47,778
Huh?

251
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:50,044
-Where does he get
off ignoring Sky High?

252
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:50,978
-Hear me, evildoer!

253
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,344
You have broken
our city's laws--

254
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,511
-I heard you the first time.

255
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:54,978
Just get on with it.

256
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:56,344
-Very well.

257
00:11:56,378 --> 00:12:01,144
But be warned, the day's wind
velocity is off the charts!

258
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,878
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): And so,
with the very fate of Sternbild

259
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:05,644
hanging in the balance--

260
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:07,344
-The battle royale
is about to begin.

261
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:08,811
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
That's my line!

262
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:12,744
-So without further
ado, let's go!

-Yaa!

KRIEM (ON TV): And Jet
Head strikes first,

00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:20,611
pummelling his opponent
with a flurry of attacks.

268
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:23,444
-I'll finish him before he
has a chance to fight back.

269
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:25,711
KRIEM (ON TV): Could
Mr. Jake be in trouble?

270
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:26,778
-Way to go, Sky High!

271
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:27,344
-Yeah!

272
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,511
Take him down!

273
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:30,744
-Come on, Sky High!

274
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,711
-Sky high!

00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,211
-Waa!

00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:42,178
KRIEM (ON TV): Oh no, Mr.
Jake's taken a direct hit!

277
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:42,744
-Yes!

278
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:43,678
-Kick his ass!

279
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:44,578
-Oh ho, he did it!

00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:45,144
PAO-LIN: Nice!

281
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:50,411
-Looks like you
challenged the wrong hero.

282
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,711
Now surrender at once.

283
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:57,111
-I actually felt
that last one, champ.

284
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,611
-Aah!

-How can you stand after
taking a hit like that?

288
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:13,044
-Huh?

289
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:14,644
I don't know what
you're talking about.

290
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:16,078
You never hit me.

[grunt]

292
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,678
-Checkmate, flyboy.

293
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,278
-Jake doesn't shoot lasers.

294
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,678
He creates force fields.

295
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:30,211
-You've gotta be kidding.

296
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,611
-Yee haw!

297
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,111
-Yaa!

298
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,178
-That's the King of Heroes?

299
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:40,611
Kind of a let down.

300
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:41,778
-He beat Sky High?

301
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:42,611
-I don't believe it.

302
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,111
-This can't be happening.

303
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,452
-I, I thought he
shot laser beams.

304
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:56,719
-No.

305
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,452
He uses defensive force
fields and attacks with them.

306
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:02,119
I guess someone
jumped to conclusions.

307
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:08,285
ANTONIO: Hey, they're
drawing the next card.

308
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,685
-Eenie, meenie-- and mo.

309
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,185
Ugh, Bull Tank of
the West Coast?

310
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,019
Seriously?

311
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,319
He looks like a cow.

312
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:19,619
-I'm gonna rip
that guy a new one.

313
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:23,019
-Rock Bison, this man
is very dangerous.

314
00:14:23,052 --> 00:14:24,919
Be careful.

315
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:25,985
ANTONIO: Don't worry.

316
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:27,919
Now that I've seen
his power, he's mine.

317
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,552
I'll bust through his force
field with brute strength.

318
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:32,685
AGNES (ON COMMS):
Good luck, Bison.

319
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,652
KRIEM (ON TV): It's time
for the second match.

320
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:37,152
How long will the
metal heifer last?

322
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:39,185
Oh!

323
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,119
There he goes!

324
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:40,852
[chuckling]

325
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:41,719
ANTONIO (ON TV): Gaa!

326
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,285
-Aw, come on, heroes.

327
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,885
Is that all you've got?

00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,985
-Nobody alive could
defeat you, Mr. Jake.

329
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,752
-Well, bring out the next loser.

330
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:06,152
-All right!

331
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,519
JAKE (ON TV): That
dumb ass who always

332
00:15:07,552 --> 00:15:08,985
has to pay for breaking stuff?

333
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:11,185
I can waste him
with my eyes closed.

334
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:12,919
Might as well draw
the next guy too.

-Say that to my face!

JAKE (ON TV): Oops,
I picked a team.

Isn't that just adorable?

Be seeing you boys.

00:15:28,185 --> 00:15:30,052
-I'm gonna go prep my suit.

340
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:32,119
-Eh, don't even bother
getting dressed.

341
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:35,185
I'm gonna end this
punk in no time.

Wait-- I know I was wrong
before and I'm sorry.

00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,185
Turn into me.

so I had to do what he told me.

-Forget about that.

350
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:04,985
Just tell us what you learned
about those powered exosuits.

-I'm getting to that, sir.

Chuckman to sneak in.

That'll teach those

when they don't
take us seriously.

There's more fun to be had.

-The stuffed animals
operate the exosuits,

359
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,119
and they only seem to
respond to her commands.

360
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:25,119
She was using some
kind of communicator

361
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,452
to relay her orders to them.

362

-You're saying that if we
can somehow jam that signal--

363
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:31,952

out of the equation.

Fine then.

It's intermission.

-Nice going, Miss
Agnes-- using ratings

496
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:15,385
as a ploy to buy us time
so we can jam the signal.

DOCTOR 2: We have to
stop the bleeding.
