ANNOUNCER (ON TV): I don't know
what to make of this, folks.

2
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:11,133
Perhaps pushed to
desperation, the murderer,

3
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:13,366
Kotetsu T. Kaburagi,
has just shown up

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,833
wearing Wild Tiger's
old hero suit.

5
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:19,966
-What's he planning to do?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,500
-Oh, that's just great.

7
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,366
He has to land on our roof.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,433
This guy is a real
pain in the ass.

9
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,800
-Yes, sir, he sure is.

10
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,766
-This building isn't
safe right now.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,600
We have to evacuate.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,800
-Everyone, please
try to remain calm.

13
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,233
Proceed in a single file.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,666
-All right, listen up, heroes.

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,366
I'm done with
running and hiding.

16
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:03,200
Let's do it.

17
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,100
[theme music]

18
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:39,814
-I'm going in, sir.

19
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:44,114
MAVERICK: Wait, let's see
what Kaburagi does first.

20
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,547
BARNABY: With all
due respect, sir,

21
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:47,414
it doesn't matter what he does.

22
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,314
I'll bring him in at any cost.

23
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:51,981
-If you've one flaw among
your admirable attributes,

24
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:53,881
it's your emotions, Barnaby.

25
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:55,014
You've got to be patient.

26
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,814
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): The murderous
NEXT has activated his powers.

27
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,881
But what can he expect
to do against six heroes?

28
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:04,647
-Don't worry.

29
00:03:04,681 --> 00:03:05,981
I have a plan.

30
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:07,847
-Well, let's see what you've
got up your sleeve, Kotetsu.

31
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,581
-All right, pay attention.

32
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,214
ALL: Huh?

33
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:28,681
-You remember this pose, right?

34
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:29,747
And look at this suit.

35
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:31,581
It's not ringing
any bells for you?

36
00:03:31,614 --> 00:03:33,681
Come on, I'm the
original Wild Tiger.

37
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,514
You know me.

38
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,881
We worked together on Hero TV.

39
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:38,781
-That's your brilliant plan?

40
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:41,014
-Seriously, you know
you guys recognize me.

41
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:42,047
Here, how about this?

42
00:03:42,081 --> 00:03:43,147
Wild Roar!

43
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,281
You remember that at all, huh?

44
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:46,581
Come on.

45
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:49,047
-You actually have the gall
to dress up as Wild Tiger

46
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,481
after everything you've done?

47
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,847
-What?

48
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,947
-Don't think you can fool us
with that cheap imitation suit.

49
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:56,981
-I'm telling you it's not fake.

50
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:57,881
Guys, it's me.

51
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:01,814
-What are you waiting for?

52
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,114
Capture the suspect.

53
00:04:03,147 --> 00:04:04,881
ALL: Yes ma'am.

54
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,547
-Playtime's over, pal.

55
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,714
Today's wind velocity
is off the charts.

56
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,714
-Just hold on a second.

57
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,147
Damn it, I said hold on.

58
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,214
-So annoying.

59
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,081
Stop dancing around, honey.

60
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,514
-Would you guys just ease
up and listen for a second?

61
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,714
-No one wants to hear
your excuses, lowlife.

62
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,247
-You're surrounded by heroes.

63
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,881
There's no escape.

64
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:48,347
-Calm down, will you?

65
00:04:48,381 --> 00:04:50,681
Just give me a chance here
and I can prove to all of you

66
00:04:50,714 --> 00:04:51,747
that I'm the real deal.

67
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,581
Starting with you, Dragon Kid.

68
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,414
Remember that time
you and I spent

69
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,914
babysitting the mayor's son?

70
00:05:02,947 --> 00:05:05,114
Well, I know that ever
since then, you've

71
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:07,247
been wearing that cute
little flower hair pin

72
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,714
that your parents
gave you, right?

73
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:10,547
-I only wear it when
I'm out of uniform.

74
00:05:10,581 --> 00:05:12,547
How do you know about that?

75
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:14,447
-And you, Blue Rose.

76
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,114
I haven't forgotten what your
first love was, that you always

77
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,281
dreamed of being a
singer, not a superhero.

78
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:21,647
-How could you know that?

79
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:23,414
-Origami.

80
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,147
Remember when we visited
the Hero Academy together?

81
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,547
You were doubting
if you were even

82
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,547
cut out for this
line of work, right?

83
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:30,714
-What?

84
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,347
-And you, Sky High, you
like sucking yolks out

85
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:37,414
of fried eggs like this.
[slurping] Am I right or wrong?

86
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:38,481
-Eh?

87
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:40,747
-Fire Emblem, you
shave your facial hair

88
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,814
and armpits three times a day.

89
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,181
-Oh.

00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,214
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): It's not
quite clear what's unfolding,

91
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:46,947
but the suspects
seems to be exposing

92
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,647
each heroes most
personal secrets.

93
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,781
-What's with this guy?

94
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:52,714
How does he know so much?

95
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:54,414
-You don't think he could be?

96
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,214
-Yes, you remember
now, don't you?

97
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,581
-You're a stalker.

98
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:58,247
-What?

99
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,081
Are you kidding me?

100
00:05:59,114 --> 00:06:00,481
These are all my
friggin memories

101
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:03,314
from all the time
we spent together.

102
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:06,314
You still don't believe
me after all I've said?

103
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,414
I mean seriously,
just look at me.

104
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,047
Do I really seem
like the kind of guy

105
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:11,314
who'd go and kill a person?

106
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:11,814
-Sort of.

107
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:12,247
-Yep.

108
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:12,747
-Uh huh.

109
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,114
-Sure do.

110
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,981
-Really?

111
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:17,747
-This is the end of
the road for you.

112
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,081
-No, he doesn't.

113
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:23,547
-Hm?

114
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,314
-Huh?

115
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:26,881
-Just look at him, you guys.

116
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:30,214
I don't think I can even
imagine him killing someone.

117
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:32,214
-Thanks, Blue Rose.

118
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:33,647
-It makes no sense.

119
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,347
I mean, if he really
is the murderer,

120
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:38,014
why stick his neck out like
this to prove his innocence?

121
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:39,647
-Don't be fooled.

122
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,181
He's trying to trick us
by gaining our sympathy,

123
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:45,181
but that's not going to work.

124
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:46,514
-Will you quit it, Bison?

125
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,681
I don't want to do something
I'll regret, especially

126
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:50,447
since you still owe me $20.

127
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,014
-Shut up, you lowlife.

128
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:00,214
-You have to believe me.

129
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,047
I'm innocent, I swear.

130
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:03,914
-This is the best
you can do, is it?

131
00:07:06,914 --> 00:07:09,981
Have you managed to
calm down yet, Barnaby?

132
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:10,481
Yes.

133
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,447
ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
Well, it looks

134
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:17,647
like this coldblooded killer
is no match for our six heroes.

135
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:23,114
-Thanks for the
boost, Mr. Kaburagi.

136
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:27,981
Mr. Maverick?

137
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,847
MAVERICK (ON PHONE):
You'll have to forgive me.

138
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:34,681
I just sent out
my company's hero,

139
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:37,214
but it looks like he
won't make it in time.

140
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,581
-Oh, no complaints
from my end, sir.

141
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,214
Thanks to the other
heroes, our show

142
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,681
just hit its highest
ratings of the season.

143
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,714
-Well, I'm very glad to hear it.

144
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:47,847
We'll have to put our heads
together and figure out

145
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,481
what we can do in the future
to boost them even higher.

146
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:54,914
-All right.

147
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:56,147
So what happens now?

148
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,747
You going to arrest me?

149
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:00,147
-You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

150
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,914
-Oh, he will once he's in jail.

151
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,347
-What happened to all of you?

152
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,581
Why?

153
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:15,714
Why don't any of
you remember me?!

154
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,214
ANNOUNCER: And there
you have it, folks.

155
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:24,747
Kotetsu T. Kaburagi
has been arrested.

156
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:25,247
-Wait.

157
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,747
ALL: Huh?

158
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,181
-My dad never killed anybody.

159
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:32,681
-Kaede, why are you here?

160
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:33,681
-She's your kid?

161
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,981
ANNOUNCER (ON TV): What's this?

162
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,714
A young girl has
suddenly appeared

163
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,581
and is pleading that
the suspect is innocent.

164
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:45,947
-Young lady, this man has
done very, very bad things.

165
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:48,314
-Those are nothing but lies.

166
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,014
-I understand how
you feel, sweetie.

167
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,814
But we need to take him away.

168
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:52,781
-No, no.

169
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:53,781
You can't.

170
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:54,681
You can't.

171
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,181
-Well, this is a pickle, huh?

172
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,081
-My dad.

173
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:03,047
Give me back my dad!

174
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:14,847
-Kaede.

175
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,314
-That girl.

176
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:31,214
-What the heck?

177
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:41,714
-Mr. Maverick?

178
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,214
-Miss Agnes, we've
got a problem.

179
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:45,347
Our signals been jammed.

180
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:46,514
Everything's down.

181
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:47,914
-What do you mean jammed?

182
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:48,714
What's causing it?

183
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:49,614
-I have no clue.

184
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,547
-Huh?

185
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:01,514
-Hey, wait a second
guys, what are we doing?

186
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,681
-What are we doing?

187
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:04,914
We're about to arrest
Tiger, of course.

188
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,781
-Yeah, but why would we do that?

189
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,914
-Well, because he killed
someone and-- huh?

190
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:13,514
-I'm not sure why,
but we were definitely

191
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,481
treating Wild Tiger
like a criminal.

192
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,381
I think.

193
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:17,381
-But why?

194
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,681
That would be
impossible, wouldn't it?

195
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:25,514
-And besides, why are
you dressed like that?

196
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:27,181
-Yeah, what's up with that?

197
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,514
You look weird.

198
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:30,514
-You know who I am?

199
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,247
Thank god.

200
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,347
You guys finally
remember me again.

201
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,214
-Dad, want to tell
me what's going on?

202
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,181
-Oh yeah, Kaede.

203
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:44,481
Um, what are you
even doing here?

204
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,181
-Why didn't you
tell me anything?

205
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,581
-Huh?

206
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,847
-You don't think you should've
told me that you were a hero?

207
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:56,447
-Oh, well, you see--
Look, sweetheart, I

208
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,214
wasn't trying to hide from you.

209
00:10:58,247 --> 00:11:00,747
I just didn't want you to
have to worry about me.

210
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,314
Yeah, you're right.

211
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:06,747
I'm sorry I lied to you.

212
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:09,614
-You can't treat me like
a little kid anymore.

213
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:11,547
-Now wait, all of
that aside, Kaede,

214
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:12,681
what's going on with you?

215
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,814
What was that ball of
white light just now?

216
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:16,114
-I don't know, dad.

217
00:11:16,147 --> 00:11:17,014
I didn't plan it.

218
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:18,214
It just happened.

219
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:20,081
-Well, you've got to be
replicating someone else's

220
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:23,614
power, but the question is who.

221
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,747
Do you think you've come
in contact with anyone new

222
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,314
recently?

223
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:28,181
-Let's see.

224
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:29,381
-I see.

225
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:31,314
You're one of Barnaby's
biggest fans, aren't you?

226
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:33,581
Well, thank you for
coming all this way.

227
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:36,481
-Oh, an old man on the first
floor of this building.

228
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:37,314
-Here?

229
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:39,314
Well, what did he look like?

230
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:42,114
-Um, he had glasses on.

231
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:45,447
Oh, and he was
wearing a bow tie.

232
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:48,581
-It was Maverick.

233
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,214
-Listen kids, I'm
sorry to interrupt,

234
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:52,047
but do you maybe want
to shed a little light

235
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,014
on what's going on around here?

236
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,481
-Albert Maverick is
behind this entire mess.

237
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:57,781
-Come again?

238
00:11:57,814 --> 00:12:00,281
-Maverick used his powers
to manipulate your memories.

239
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:01,647
He was playing you against me.

240
00:12:01,681 --> 00:12:03,147
[gasp]

241
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:04,647
-Our memories?

242
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,847
-Yeah.

243
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,914
But my kid here was able
to use her NEXT powers

244
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:11,147
to restore you all
back to normal.

245
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:14,047
-When did he manipulate
our memories though?

246
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,247
-Well, he did call
us all together.

247
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:17,781
Maybe it then?

248
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:20,347
-Was it just you guys or
was anyone else there?

249
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,014
-Miss Agnes was, and
people from your company.

250
00:12:24,047 --> 00:12:26,381
-So he was trying to
frame me by changing

251
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:29,014
the memories of everyone
who knew my real identity.

252
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:31,181
-I'm so sorry.

253
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:32,347
This is our fault.

254
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,414
-I should have put
two and two together

255
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,647
when brought up the fried eggs.

256
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:37,914
-Don't worry about it.

257
00:12:37,947 --> 00:12:40,381
I'm just glad that
you all remember now.

258
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:42,781
-Tiger, I--

259
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,547
-You're a good friend.

260
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:45,814
-Huh?

261
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,847
-Even with your
memories gone, you never

262
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:51,181
stopped believing in me.

263
00:12:51,214 --> 00:12:52,347
Thanks Blue Rose.

264
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:57,714
You, on the other
hand, you treated me

265
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,714
like a commonplace criminal.

266
00:12:59,747 --> 00:13:00,814
-Really?

267
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,781
My memory's still
a little spotty.

268
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:05,381
-I believe the word
you used was "lowlife."

269
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:06,747
Twice actually.

270
00:13:06,781 --> 00:13:08,214
-Let bygones be bygones, right?

271
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,081
I mean, is-- is this the little
girl we've heard so much about?

272
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,081
Introduce her already.

273
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,147
-Oh, how stupid of me.

274
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:16,714
Sorry for the late intro, guys.

275
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:18,347
This is my daughter, Kaede.

276
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,681
-Hi, everybody.

277
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,414
Gosh, it really is an honor.

278
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:22,381
-Hey, sugar.

279
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:24,247
-It's great to meet you.

280
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,581
-Thanks for saving us.

281
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:26,581
We're in your debt.

282
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:27,714
-Oh, it's OK.

283
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,814
Thanks for always
helping out my dad.

284
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,547
-You've got a good
head on your shoulders.

285
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,014
I like your spirit.

286
00:13:33,047 --> 00:13:35,081
-So where's Barnaby?

287
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,347
Is there any chance I
could meet him, dad?

288
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,347
-Oh, that's right.

289
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:39,814
I forgot about him.

290
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,214
-Were Barnaby's memories
altered as well.

291
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:42,847
-Most likely.

292
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,247
-I'll never forgive you.

293
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,747
You'll pay for killing Samantha.

294
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,381
-Hey, Barnaby.

295
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:07,359
-Barnaby?

296
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,126
-Easy now, handsome.

297
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,059
Just take a breath.

298
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:15,059
-It's a mistake.

299
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:16,559
Tiger didn't murder anyone.

300
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:17,792
-It's no use, you guys.

301
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,259
-Yeah, but--

302
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,992
-I need a repeat of
what you did earlier.

303
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,259
You think you can do it, kiddo?

304
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,592
-What?

305
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,192
-Barnaby's been brainwashed
by a very bad man, Kaede.

306
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:30,359
And right now, your power is the
only thing that can save him.

307
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:32,259
-You got it, dad.

308
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,859
-Just hang tight, Barnaby.

309
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,926
We're going to get your
memories unscrambled, OK?

310
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:50,359
-Whoa, uh, dad?

311
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:52,326
-The heck?

312
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,726
-Oh yeah, he
touched my shoulder.

313
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,559
-You've got a good
head on your shoulders.

314
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:58,326
I like your spirit.

315
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,592
-Idiot.

316
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:00,259
-Huh?

317
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,526
-That's just great.

318
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,826
Thanks to you, Kaede's
abilities have changed again.

319
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:04,726
-Me?

320
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,192
What did I do?

321
00:15:06,226 --> 00:15:08,892
-She's a Mimic, a NEXT who
copies the powers of anyone

322
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,226
she comes in contact with.

323
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,392
[gasp]

324
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:14,626
-I'm so sorry.

325
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,026
I had no idea.

326
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:16,926
-Damn it.

327
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,526
She was the only
shot we had here.

328
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,292
-Fools, every last one of them.

329
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,692
-Everyone else out of the way.

330
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,726
My business is with him.

331
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,692
-Listen, Barnaby.

332
00:15:30,726 --> 00:15:32,426
You're being
manipulated right now.

333
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,959
Maverick has been behind it all.

334
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,192
-I've heard enough!

335
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:46,859
-Calm down, Barnaby.

336
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:54,359
-Don't do this, handsome.

337
00:15:54,392 --> 00:15:55,559
He's your partner.

338
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:56,359
-That's right.

339
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:57,592
Try to remember.

340
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,426
-What are you talking about?

341
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,326
That man is a murderer.

342
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,326
-Barnaby.

343
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,059
-Don't interfere.

344
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:07,559
-Come on, Barnaby.

345
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,059
You've got to snap out of it.

346
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:10,692
-Let go.

347
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,559
Kotetsu Kaburagi, why
did you kill Samantha?

348
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:16,392
Answer me.

349
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:20,026
-Take care of Kaede if
anything happens to me.

350
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,592
All right, if that's
the case, I'll

351
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:24,326
just have to make you remember
whether you want to or not.

352
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,459
Let's go, pal.

353
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:26,426
Come and get me.

354
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,626
-Dad, you can't.

355
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,459
-Oh , no, you don't.

356
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:45,892
-It's too dangerous.

357
00:16:45,926 --> 00:16:46,792
-Yeah, but--

358
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,026
-It's all right.

359
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,392
Trust us, kid.

360
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,559
Your dad is a hero.

361
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,659
-Oh, uh, nothing to see here.

362
00:17:34,692 --> 00:17:36,292
I'm nobody suspicious
or anything.

363
00:17:36,326 --> 00:17:38,492
Uh, I know it looks bad, but--

364
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:50,892
-Wait, your memories.

365
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:53,659
Were you watching
that broadcast?

366
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,992
You remember me
again, don't you?

367
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,226
-Hey there, partner.

368
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,392
What took you so long?

369
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,326
-How did you get that
suit and that motorcycle?

370
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,326
-A black suit and
a red bike, huh?

371
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:23,159
No offense, but you looked
way better in the old suit.

372
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:24,626
You coming or what?

373
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,426
-Remember this?

374
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,326
You on the right,
me on the left,

375
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,359
chasing down all
those real bad guys?

376
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:06,659
-Shut up.

377
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,492
-Barnaby, relax, would you?

378
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:14,426
Hey, this is dangerous.

379
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,192
Eyes on the road.

380
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:23,892
-Hm?

381
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:26,892
What the?

382
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,892
[screaming]

383
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:37,359
-Wild Tiger.

384
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:38,859
-And Barnaby too.

385
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,326
-Hey, up ahead.

386
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:48,326
Aw crap.

387
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,026
This is where we first met.

388
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,526
Brings back some
memories, doesn't it?

389
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,059
You carried me in your arms
after saving me, remember?

390
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,292
-I would never do that.

391
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:40,492
-There's nothing to worry about.

392
00:20:40,526 --> 00:20:41,992
Those two are going
to be just fine.

393
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:52,992
-Hey, stop.

394
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:56,192
I said stop.

395
00:20:56,226 --> 00:20:59,426
Oh, would you cut
it out already?

396
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,859
Oops.

397
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,059
-You bastard.

398
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,859
So you're ready to fight?

399
00:21:03,892 --> 00:21:04,992
-It's not like that.

400
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,726
-Is that Tiger?

401
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,859
-No, It's the person we were
persuaded to believe was him.

402
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:19,192
-Who are you?

403
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:21,126
-You aren't getting off
with a few minor burns

404
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:22,326
after what you pulled.

405
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,959
-Now show me your power.

406
00:21:26,992 --> 00:21:28,659
Time to put our
cards on the table.

407
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,226
-All right, you impostor,
reveal yourself.

408
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:38,726
[gasp]

409
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,392
-Guess I have no choice.

410
00:22:01,426 --> 00:22:02,392
Let's do this.

411
00:22:16,092 --> 00:22:17,092
COMPUTER: Good Luck Mode.

412
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:20,692
Good Luck Mode.

KOTETSU (VOICEOVER):
Hi, I'm Kotetsu,

415
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,704
the member of
Tiger and Bunny who

416
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:15,770
has a mole on the
bottom of his foot.

417
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:18,004
Come on, Barnaby, hurry
up and remember me.

418
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:21,537
If you don't, I-- [sigh] Next
time on "Tiger and Bunny"--

Misfortunes Never Come Singe-ly.
