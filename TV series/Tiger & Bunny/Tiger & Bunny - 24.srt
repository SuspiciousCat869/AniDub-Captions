H-01 will replace every
hero in this city.

A glorious new age will begin.

hunk of junk a hero?

MAVERICK (ON RADIO):
Unless you defeat H-01,

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,500
you can't save anyone.

00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:29,666
Not this fair city, not one
of your precious friends,

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,700
not even your daughter.

15
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,600
If you want to be saved,
all you have to do

16
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:43,866
is reach up and flip
the deactivation switch

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,000
on your collar.

18
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:47,500
However, there is one catch.

19
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:50,566
The moment you flip your switch,
everyone else will blow up.

20

Doesn't it sound fun?

Barnaby are defeated by H-01.

on that one, Fire Emblem.

No matter how hard they try,
those idiots cannot defeat

32
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:09,810
H-01, and you're delusional
to think otherwise.

33
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:11,176
Now, the clock's ticking.

34
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,376
Make your choices.

35
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,043
-None of us will you give
you the satisfaction.

36

-You're sure about
that, Sky High?

37
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:25,276
One of your colleagues could
betray you at any moment.

-Dammit.

42
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,476
Screw our powers then.

-Kotetsu, don't.

44
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,043
-But Kaede needs me.

00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:56,043
-Watch out!

46
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,643
-That was way too close.

47
00:04:04,676 --> 00:04:07,276
-We don't stand a chance
without our powers.

48
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,643
-Then, we'll just have to hold
them off until we recover.

00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:16,276
-Come on.

Kick some ass, boys.

-I almost feel sorry for them.

52
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:23,476
They can only use their powers
for a limited amount of time.

53
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,043
On the other hand, H-01's
power lasts indefinitely.

Yet another reason why
those subhuman NEXT

00:04:30,543 --> 00:04:33,210

56
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:44,043
-What the hell are you doing?

57
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,043
-The technology that
runs that android

58
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:49,176
was originally developed
by Barnaby's parents.

59
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,443
They were very careful,
so all of their robots

60
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:53,110
were programmed to
shut down before they

61
00:04:53,143 --> 00:04:54,210
could harm any human.

62
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,110
However, seeing as how this
one can attack the heroes,

63
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:01,976
I presume it's built-in
safety protocol

64
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,876
has been disabled somehow.

65
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,876
So now, I'm trying to find the
master password to reboot it.

66
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,676
Understand now?

67
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,176
-Not a word.

68
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,676
No.

69
00:05:14,843 --> 00:05:17,810
-Why is Hero TV
still off the air?

70
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:21,043
-And why are we still unable
to contact any of our heroes?

71
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:23,576
-Mr. Mayor, where
could Mr. Maverick

72
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,410
be at a time like this?

73
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:26,143
-I'm sorry.

74
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,010
I-- I just don't know.

75
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,943
-What the hell do you
think you're doing?

76
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,010
Do you plan on
defending that murderer?

77
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:42,443
-I defend no one, nor do I
follow your code of justice.

78
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:46,376
I obey the voice of Thanatos.

79
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,210
I'll uncover your true
identity and the mastermind

80
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:51,843
behind this chaos.

81
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:52,343
-What?

82
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:14,376
-Sorry to keep you all waiting.

83
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,843
-Where have you
been, Mr. Maverick?

84
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,043
The meeting began
hours ago, and--

85
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,076
-Please, accept my apologies.

86
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,476
But I've just been
speaking with the heroes.

87
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,510
The heroes informed
me that they are

88
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:30,143
working on a special project to
bring down a terrorist group.

89
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,010
-Terrorists?

90
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:32,010
-What terrorists?

91
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,376
-Are these terrorists
behind all this?

92
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,376
-They are.

93
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,376
-My god, like when
Jake attacked us?

94
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,043
-Do you know if all
the heroes are safe?

95
00:06:41,076 --> 00:06:43,776
-At the moment, they are
in a very tough situation,

96
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,210
but they reassured me
that they were doing their

97
00:06:46,243 --> 00:06:49,476
very best to defend Sternbild.

98
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,143
Gentlemen, we must have
faith in our heroes

99
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:54,476
and patiently wait
for their return.

100
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,343
That's all we can do.

101
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,776
-Here it comes.

102
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,976
-Dammit.

103
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,410
At this rate, we're going
to be dead before our powers

104
00:07:17,443 --> 00:07:18,443
recharge.

105
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,843
-If they can't beat that
thing, then who can?

106
00:07:28,976 --> 00:07:29,743
-Dammit.

107
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:32,743
This isn't going how I thought.

108
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:34,276
-Go on.

109
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,176
Push it.

110
00:07:39,643 --> 00:07:40,476
-No.

111
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,476
You lousy coward!

112
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,243
-You have to think, Sky High.

113
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:46,043
Come on.

114
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:46,843
What should I do?

115
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,443
Even if one of the heroes
manages to survive this,

116
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:58,476
it's still better
than all of us dying.

117
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,210
-You're going to
betray us, Sky High?

118
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:02,676
-How could you?

119
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,610
-No.

120
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:04,643
Wait.

121
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:07,210
That isn't-- that's
not what I meant.

122
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:09,843
-So heroes, does that
change the equation?

123
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:12,243
-I don't believe that guy.

124
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:13,576
-Sky High, no.

125
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,076
-No way.

126
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,476
Not him.

127
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,543
-Yes, let it sink in.

128
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,743
-Because of what they
heard, they must think--

129
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:30,110
-So much for loyal friends.

130
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:31,543
Guess you were wrong about them.

131

Oh, looks like time's almost up.

132

They can't keep
running away forever.

133
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,776
-This really sucks.

134
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,910
-So if you're smart, you'll
press that little button.

135
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,876
-Please stop it.

136
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,076
Enough.

137
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,876
-One of your pals might
be pressing it right now.

138
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,510
-I can't take this anymore.

139
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:55,376
-All of you have been rivals
since the very beginning.

140
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,210
You cannot possibly
trust each other.

141
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,276
-We are rivals.

142
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,210
-Press it.

143
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:03,743
Hurry.

144
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:04,976
-Who would do it?

145
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,876
Who is the most vulnerable?

146
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,810
-Hey, Sky High!

147
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:11,243
What the hell, man!

148
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,910
-Those pathetic fools.

149
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:16,343
They don't know that they'll
die if they push their buttons.

150
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:19,510
I was never going to let any
of them walk out of here.

151

Those stupid NEXT freaks.

-Kotetsu!

-I guess this is the end.

anything happens to me.

Do it.

00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:15,004
Yes.

-Our powers are back.

00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,573
This is getting old.

166
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:03,106
-Kotetsu!

167
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,839
-Everything is going
according to plan.

168
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,839
-It appears you have
things under control.

169
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:09,939
-I do.

170
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:12,073
Even with their
powers activated,

171
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,306
H-01's speed and strength are
on a whole different level.

172
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,839
Which means it's time to rid the
world of these miserable NEXT.

173
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:19,906
-Yes.

174
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,439
I've just finished
making the arrangements.

175
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,639
When we're finished, it'll look
like they all died honorably

176
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:25,906
in the line of duty.

177
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,206
-You could keep
attacking all you like,

178
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:46,306
but it won't make
a scratch on him.

179
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,173
-Now.

180
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:53,906
-I'm on it, partner.

181
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:56,339
COMPUTER: Good Luck mode.

182
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:57,273
Good Luck Mode.

183
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:09,539
Three, two, one.

184
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,206
Tiger and Bunny over and out.

185
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,073
-We did it.

186
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:25,973
Huh?

187
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:26,639
-No way.

188
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,106
-Bunny!

189
00:13:14,573 --> 00:13:16,373
-No more.

190
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:19,273
-Why don't you just
go down, you bastard?

191
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,139
-Kotetsu.

192
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,439
-We're not giving up, and
we're not backing down.

193
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:36,939
You hear that, Tin Man?

194
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,673
It's going to be a
fight to the finish.

195
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:14,506
-I've decided.

196
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,639
-What an unfortunate turn
of events for you heroes.

197
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,073
It seems Blue Rose
has made up her mind.

198
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,439
Go ahead, Blue Rose.

199
00:14:24,473 --> 00:14:25,973
Reach up and push the button.

200
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,506
-I refuse to push it.

201
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,406
-What?

202
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,873
-I decided that I
believe in my friends.

203
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:43,173
Tiger and Barnaby, I
believe in them too.

204
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:47,006
-Are you telling me that
was your big revelation?

205
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,006
-Listen, guys.

206
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,873
We have to believe
they can win this.

207
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,273
We know how strong
they can be, so we

208
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,406
have to be just as strong.

209
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:04,206
You're all my friends, and I
trust any of you with my life.

210
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,806
That's being a hero.

211
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,206
-I believe in Tiger
and Barnaby too.

212
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,773
They can win this.

213
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:13,339
I know they can win this.

214
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:15,639
-Damn straight.

215
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:19,339
-If a hero can't believe in his
friends, then what good is he?

216
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:21,406
-Yeah, that's right.

217
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:24,406
And yet, I-- I doubted them.

218
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,539
-Thank you, Blue Rose.

219
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:30,439
And thanks again, all of you.

220
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,106
-Are you done yet?

221
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,506
All this trust and friendship
garbage is making me sick.

222
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,839
[chuckle]

223
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,773
-Go on H-01.

224
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,339
Slice those pair of
idiots into pieces.

225
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:07,039
-Dammit.

226
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:07,806
Nothing works.

227
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,273
-Kotetsu!

228
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:29,306
-Now, Bunny.

229
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,373
Take this guy out
with his own gun.

230
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:31,873
-What?

231
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,639
What about you?

232
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:38,173
-Don't worry about me.

233
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,973
I'll dodge the blast
before it hits.

234
00:16:40,006 --> 00:16:41,239
-But how?

235
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:41,906
-Just do it.

236
00:16:41,939 --> 00:16:42,406
Hurry.

237
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:50,706
I ain't got all day here.

238
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:55,173
Shoot him, Bunny!

239
00:16:59,139 --> 00:16:59,606
[click]

240
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,973
-I couldn't believe the
train crashed twice.

241
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,173
-They did it.

242
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:42,706
-Fabulous.

243
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:49,373
-Impossible.

244
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:52,473
How could my H-01
lose to a NEXT?

245
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,273
They'll all pay.

246
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,473
I'll kill every one
of those freaks.

247
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:20,873
Little girl.

248
00:18:25,139 --> 00:18:26,373
-I'm no little girl.

249
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:31,106
I'm the daughter of Wild Tiger.

250
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,106
Stay away!

251
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:37,073
-That's my power.

252
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:49,573
-Oh snap.

253
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:50,739
Thanks, Kaede sweetie.

254
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:01,606
Fire.

255
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,039
-Yeah.

256
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:25,473
-Let's go.

257
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:30,606
-Hey, we did it.

258
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:32,173
It worked.

259
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:32,673
Kotetsu?

260
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:39,206
Are you OK?

261
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:51,806
-Sorry, bud.

262
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:54,639
I just wasn't fast enough.

263
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:55,473
Shoot him, Bunny.

264
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,739
Guess it's hard to dodge like
that without any power left.

265
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,873
And it had happened during
our final attack together.

266
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,173
-What are you saying?

267
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:12,339
Why would your powers run out?

268
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:15,039
You still had plenty of time.

269
00:20:15,073 --> 00:20:20,706
-To be honest, my power can
barely last four lousy minutes.

270
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:22,706
You see, it's been
getting weaker.

271
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:23,606
-Weaker?

272
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,906
For how long?

273
00:20:25,939 --> 00:20:28,739
-It's been fading for
a couple of months.

274
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,173
It was pretty tough trying
to keep it from you, pal.

275
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:32,939
-Don't you think I
should have known?

276
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:34,639
Why did you keep it
a secret from me?

277
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:37,273
-Well, because I knew
you'd worry about me.

278
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,106
Didn't want that.

279
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:38,939
-Wait.

280
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:40,239
Is that why you were quitting?

281
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,039
So you're going to quit
being a hero just like that?

282
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,273
-Being a hero is unpredictable.

283
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:46,673
It's fine when
you're a young man,

284
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:51,039
but I'm getting too
old for this stuff.

285
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,906
-I'm so sorry.

286
00:20:52,939 --> 00:20:57,606
You were in bad shape this
whole time, and I didn't see it.

287
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:58,739
-You dummy.

288
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:01,139
That was the whole point
of hiding it from you,

289
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,573
so you wouldn't see.

290
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:07,206
[coughing]

291
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:08,273
Listen.

292
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:09,939
I-- I don't think
I'm going to make it.

293
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:10,939
-Stop talking.

294
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:11,773
Just lay still.

295
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:13,206
-But Bunny--

296
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,139
-I said stop it.

297
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,073
-Chasing after the
bad guys with you

298
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:19,706
and listening to
your lame lectures,

299
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,373
I loved every minute of it.

300
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:24,673
The truth is when you finally
started calling me Kotetsu,

301
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:27,239
you made me so happy I went
out on an all-night bender

302
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:28,539
to celebrate.

303
00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:29,639
-This isn't the end.

304
00:21:29,673 --> 00:21:31,206
Stop talking like that.

305
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:33,006
-Thanks for everything, buddy.

306
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,739
-Shut up, Kotetsu.

307
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,939
You're not dying, you hear me.

308
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:39,339
You're not the kind of
person who gives up.

309
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:40,706
You're optimistic dammit.

310
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:41,906
Act it.

311
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,039
Besides, I've been learning
to make fried rice,

312
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,673
and that's your favorite dish.

313
00:21:45,706 --> 00:21:49,773
So you have to live,
so you can try it.

No!

00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:52,506
-Whoa!

316
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:53,439
So close.

317
00:21:53,473 --> 00:21:54,906
You know something.

318
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,306
You've got really
long eyelashes.

319
00:21:59,473 --> 00:21:59,939
-Kotetsu!

320
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:03,039
Kotetsu!

[theme music]

00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:42,535
Keep working.

-I've input all the data.

Now, all I have to do
is decrypt the password.

-Hey, what's going
on over there?

327

Why'd Kotetsu's signal
drop off the map?
