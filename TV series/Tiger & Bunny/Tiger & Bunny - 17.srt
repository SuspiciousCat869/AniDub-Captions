at a book signing and had
him autograph it for you.

167
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:12,446
See?

168
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,779
-Oh!

169
00:08:15,812 --> 00:08:16,912
Thank you so much, Dad!

170
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:17,746
This is the best!

171
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:18,379
-Great!

172
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:19,579
Glad you like it.

173
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,212
Can I read you a bedtime story?

174
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:23,679
-That is not gonna happen.

175
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:33,112
-I can't believe my little
girl is already 10 years old.

176
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,012
She's practically a young woman.

177
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,512
No room for a dad, I guess.

178
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:44,312
-So what happened, Kotetsu?

179
00:08:44,346 --> 00:08:45,712
Gonna tell me?

180
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:46,979
-What?

181
00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,746
Nothing's happened, man.

182
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,846
-I thought you came here
to talk about something.

183
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,179
-Well, now that
I think about it,

184
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:56,346
it's not all that important.

185
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:57,946
It can wait.

186
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:58,846
-Oh yeah?

187
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,012
So why'd you come back home?

188
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,712
-Good question.

189
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:03,712
I'm not sure.

190
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,846
-Mom's really worried about you.

191
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,312
-Mm.

192
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:14,512
-Hey, you gonna
spill it or what?

193
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,146
A guy your age
isn't supposed to go

194
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,979
around getting his mother
all upset like this.

195
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:20,212
-Hey, what's your problem?

196
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:23,812
Are you saying I need
a reason to come home?

197
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:25,079
-That isn't what I said.

198
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:27,312
-Well, that's what it
sounded like to me.

199
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,046
Look, I'm sorry I barged
in on you like this,

200
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:30,879
but you're family.

201
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,479
Where else was I supposed to go?

202
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:34,546
-Why are you getting so upset?

203
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,379
I am not getting upset!

204
00:09:36,412 --> 00:09:38,279
I just want you
to leave me alone.

205
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,879
-Then why did you
bother coming back?

206
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:43,346
-I've got things I'm
trying to deal with, OK?

207
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,479
Is that so hard to--

208
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:48,579
-I can't help unless you
tell me what's wrong!

209
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:51,212
Stop trying to act
so tough, Kotetsu.

210
00:09:51,246 --> 00:09:55,312
Listen, back here, you're
not Wild Tiger, the hero.

211
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,479
You're Kotetsu Kaburagi,
my little brother, OK?

212
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,046
Your powers are getting weaker?

213
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,079
-Yeah.

214
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:06,579
The time limit that
I can use them in

215
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,846
is getting shorter and shorter.

216
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,646
At this rate, I'll
completely lose them.

217
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,246
When that happens, I won't
be able to be a hero anymore.

218
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,346
That's what scares me, and I
don't know what to do about it.

219
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,246
-Life would go on.

220
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,312
-I know there comes
a time when you just

221
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:29,579
have to accept your fate,
but-- dammit, not like this.

222
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,246
I've sacrificed a
lot to get where

223
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,912
I am-- a lot more
than I ever wanted to.

224
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:36,212
And for what?

225
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:40,312
So I can wake up one morning
and be put out to pasture?

226
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:43,479
-Why didn't you tell me
about this before now?

227
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,012
-I didn't want to
burden you with it.

228
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,779
-That's always been your way.

229
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,846
You've always tried to keep
everything to yourself,

230
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,779
even when you were a kid.

231
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:54,112
It's a bad habit.

232
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:56,246
Back when you first
discovered you had powers,

233
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,646
you did the same thing.

234
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,346
Agonizing over it won't
give you any answers.

235
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:03,579
Give yourself some time to rest.

236
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:06,679
That's why you came
home, isn't it?

237
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:07,246
-I suppose.

238
00:11:11,312 --> 00:11:15,846
-Kotetsu-- that's $2.

239
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,346
-Huh?

240
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,746
-One more thing--

241
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:25,912
-Yeah, what's up?

242
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,679
-Even if you do end
up losing your powers,

243
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:29,679
your life isn't over.

244
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:30,879
You have a lot to live for.

245

ANNOUNCER (ON TV):
He's done it again!

246
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,946
Barnaby has saved yet

247
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,212
from this high rise fire.

248
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:45,112
He continues to top
the charts this week.

249
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,546
-I think I can handle things
by myself for a while.

250
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,679
My ranking is not
what's important.

251
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:53,612
Protecting people at all times,
that's what we heroes do.

252
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,679
TOMOE: A hero has to
protect people at all times,

253
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,079
isn't that right?

254
00:11:58,112 --> 00:12:00,212
KOTETSU: Well, yes, but there
are more important things to--

255
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:01,512
-Then what are you waiting for?

256
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:02,579
You have to go.

257
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,846
-I can't just leave
you here like this.

258
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,179
[comm buzzing]

259
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:12,846
Fine, I'll go then.

260
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,812
Are you happy now?

261
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:19,879
TOMOE: Promise me, dear,
that no matter what happens,

262
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:23,146
you'll never stop being a hero.

263
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,612
I'm proud of you.

ANNOUNCER: And here
comes Wild Tiger!

265
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,079
The Crusher for Justice
has just saved two lives

266
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:38,979
by blasting through the
front of the building.

KOTETSU: Tomoe?

[footsteps running]

271
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:50,546
-I'm so sorry.

272
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,579
Her condition worsened
after you left.

273
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,279
-I guess this is it for me.

274
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,246
The end of the road.

275
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,712
Sorry, Tomoe.

276
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:15,079
I just don't think that I
can keep my promise to you.

277
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,305
KAEDE: Dad!

278
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:20,672
Dad, wake up!

279
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:21,539
Please!

280
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:22,305
Dad!

281
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:23,672
You have to help Grandma!

282
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:25,472
Something's happened to her!

283
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:26,372
-What?

284
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,872
Slow down a minute.

285
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,939
What are you saying
about Grandma?

286
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:30,605
Mom!

287
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,972
What happened?

288
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:33,739
Can you hear me?

289
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:34,439
What's wrong?

290
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:35,939
-Don't be so rough.

291
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:39,572
I'll be fine, I
just hurt my back.

292
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:42,072
I think it's because
the weather got colder.

293

[groan]

294
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:44,672
-What is it, Kotetsu?

295
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:45,505
What happened to Mom?

296
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,572
Is she all right?

297
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,072
-Uh.

298
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,072
-Sweetheart, you kind
of overreacted a bit,

299
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:56,105
don't you think?

300
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:57,105
-It's OK.

301
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,472
Don't be so hard on her.

302
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,005
She saw me on the floor and
got scared, like anybody would.

303
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,039
Sorry for that, Kaede.

304
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,039
-See?

305
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,239
Grandma's doing just fine.

306
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:08,539
You don't have to worry.

307
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,772
But you do have to
get ready for school.

308
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:12,239
-I want to stay.

309
00:14:12,272 --> 00:14:13,839
-Not when you have school.

310
00:14:13,872 --> 00:14:15,505
Now do as I say and get ready.

311
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:21,372
Don't be concerned, Kaede.

312
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:23,272
Like I said,
Grandma's just fine.

313
00:14:23,305 --> 00:14:25,472
Besides, I can take care of her.

314
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:27,172
Are you even listening
to me, young lady?

315
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:30,239
-You're the one
who never listens!

316
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:31,572
Why'd you come here?

317
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:32,572
I hate you, Dad!

00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:36,639

-I'm so confused, Tomoe.

321
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,472
I'm really lost.

322
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:48,905
It's awful.

323

I don't know what I did
to bring all this on,

324
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:54,305
but Kaede absolutely hates me.

MURAMASA: Can't believe
it's already been six years.

so I stopped by.

-Sorry for all the fuss.

329
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,472
Kaede got a little
panicked this morning.

330
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:09,805
-First you, now her.

331
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,005
They say the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

332
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,272
I guess they're right.

333
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,005
Let me ask you
something-- do you

334
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,305
know why Kaede got so upset?

335
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:21,205
-Uh, not really.

336
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:22,505
-'Cause she feels alone.

337
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:26,072
Mom is the only
one she has left.

338
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:29,005
Since you live in the city and
can't be around all the time,

339
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,572
she's afraid she's
gonna be abandoned

340
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,505
if she loses her grandmother.

341
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,272
She lives with that fear
every day of her life.

342
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:37,572
That's why she gets so
upset when even the smallest

343
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,239
thing goes wrong.

344
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,039
When you think about
it, Kaede was probably

345
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,539
never able to get over
the loss of her mother.

346
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,472
-That would explain a lot.

347
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:49,805
MURAMASA: I'm not trying to
blame you for the situation.

348
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,839
I mean, you have your
own life to live.

349
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:55,372
But Kaede is always
feeling lonely.

350
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:58,139
Just keep that in mind when
she acts the way she does.

351
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:10,339
-You're the one
who never listens!

352
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,639
-You're right, Kaede.

353
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,005
I guess Daddy never did try
to understand your feelings.

354
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,105
Huh?

355
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:23,605
What are you doing?

356
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,105
Stop that right now!

357
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,839
Mom, you should be lying down!

358
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:28,305
-Oh, I'm all right.

359
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:29,639
See?

360
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,172
-Come on, who cares about
those stupid cabbages?

361
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,739
It's too much stress!

362
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:36,472
This is what caused you to hurt
your back in the first place!

363
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:39,505
-I put so much effort
into raising these babies.

364
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,572
I can't just ignore them
when they're under stress

365
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,205
and not doing well.

366
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,239
It's the same way
I feel about you.

367
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,439
-I'm not a vegetable, mom.

368
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:57,472
-Please, if you can hear
me, please help Grandma,

369
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:58,939
I'm begging you.

370
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:00,705
I couldn't bear
it if I lost her.

371
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:01,605
I'd be alone.

372
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,205
-Mom, it's pouring outside.

373
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,372
Think we should go pick her up?

374

-Can somebody help me?

380
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,472
Is anyone out there?

381
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:48,972
-Yes.

382
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,472
Yes.

383
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:51,339
I see.

384
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,605
Well, thank you very much.

385
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,372
-What's up?

386
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,672
Do they know where she is?

387
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,972
-It looks like she left
school over an hour ago,

388
00:17:58,005 --> 00:18:00,972
and she hasn't gone to any
of her friends' houses.

389
00:18:01,005 --> 00:18:02,305
-That's bad.

390
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,205
And I still can't get through
to her on her cell phone.

391
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:06,539
I'm gonna go check out the area.

392
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,072
Kaede!

393
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,405
Where are you?

Kaede!

-Have you had any luck?

397
00:18:17,905 --> 00:18:18,839
-No.

398
00:18:18,872 --> 00:18:19,872
What about you?

399
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,205
-Not a trace.

400
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,439
The rain so heavy, nobody's
out, let alone Kaede.

401
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:29,505
I hope she was able to find
shelter inside somewhere,

It's Daddy!

00:18:39,305 --> 00:18:39,905
-Kaede!

408
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,105
-Answer me, Kaede!

409
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:42,605
Kaede!

410
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:47,972
No time.

411
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:49,239
I'll have to take my chances.

412

-Wait.

413
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:52,372
Even if you use your
powers, it won't do any good

414
00:18:52,405 --> 00:18:54,472
if you don't have any
idea where she is.

415
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:55,739
-I know that.

416
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,605
Now be quiet for just
a little bit, OK?

KOTETSU (VOICEOVER):
I'm almost out of time.

Kaede, please-- say something!

419
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:26,472

KOTETSU: Kaede,
are you in there?

-I'm here, Dad!

-I'm coming to get you!

429
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:45,172
I know you're scared, but I'm
gonna get you out of there.

Don't worry, everything's
gonna be fine!

I need more time.

-Dad?

KOTETSU: It's OK, Kaede.

436
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,239
Your dad is Kotetsu Kaburagi.

437
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:07,872
It'll take more than a little
storm to make me give up!

00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:28,372
You're safe now.

-(SOBBING) I'm sorry
I got in trouble.

I didn't mean to scare everyone.

-It's all right, Kaede.

450
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,939
I'm sorry as well, baby.

I'm sorry I wasn't
here for you more.

You barely had time to rest.

KOTETSU: I know, Mom.

455
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,972
But, uh, I'll rest when I
get back here in a few days.

457
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:02,672
KOTETSU: Well, I'll
be coming back just

458
00:21:02,705 --> 00:21:04,672
as soon as I turn
in my resignation.

460

What brought all this on?

461
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:10,539
KOTETSU: Oh, nothing
in particular, really.

462
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:11,672
MOTHER: Hmm?

463
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,172
KOTETSU: Well, there is
something in particular.

464
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:17,439
I decided I wanted to
spend more time with Kaede,

465
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:19,805
and I made her a promise.

466
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:20,772
Right?

467
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:21,372
Right.

-I see.

But, Kotetsu--

471
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:28,039
-I'm starting to become
vintage, Mom, let's face it.

472
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:28,539
-Huh?

473
00:21:31,705 --> 00:21:34,139
-I think it's time for me
to move on with my life.

-Dad, are you really
gonna come home soon?

478
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:43,972
-Yeah.

479
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,205
I'll be back very soon,
right after I quit my job.

480
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,439
-Do you swear?

481
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,439
Don't say it if you
don't really mean it!

482
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:50,639
-Oh, I mean it, sweetie.

483
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,739
Promise.

484
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:56,172
Watch out, you're
gonna hurt yourself.

-Huh?

488
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,372
You mean--

489
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,805
-I'll be waiting for you!

490
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,639
Here!

491
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,805
This is so you don't forget!

492
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,605
