1
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:30,817
Our story so far:

2
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,733
While chasing after
the White Rabbit,

3
00:00:32,817 --> 00:00:35,650
young Alice tumbled
into Wonderland...

4
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,025
There, she...

5
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,192
Was nearly drowned
in a sea of tears...

6
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:45,400
Was spun relentlessly
'round by the Mock Turtle...

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,358
Was brutally forced
to choke down a curry bun...

8
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,942
And shamelessly
erected her Eiffel Tower.

9
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,317
After this series of incidents,
poor Alice was growing

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
quite tired of Wonderland...

11
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:06,775
but if anything,
her trials were about

12
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,400
to become even more grueling.

13
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:13,483
Oh party train.

14
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,733
Damn and blast...

15
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,900
Where did that
White Rabbit get to?

16
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:48,150
And why the devil have
I shrunk to this size?

17
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:55,692
Ah...

18
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,150
so you have finally
located my hideaway.

19
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,442
Who are you?

20
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,567
I'm the Caterpillar,
of course...

21
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,608
I suspected this day
would come sooner or later.

22
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:10,733
I've waited for it
most eagerly.

23
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,317
Been waiting, have you...?

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,150
In that case, maybe you can tell
me what my next move should be.

25
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,858
I'm afraid I've no idea
what you're asking.

26
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,317
Quit dithering and
give me an answer!

27
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,483
The right side will
make you grow taller

28
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,525
and the left will
make you grow shorter.

29
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:36,942
Here in Wonderland,
that's just how things work.

30
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,025
More nonsense prattle!

31
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,442
The fungi.

32
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,650
The fungi?

33
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,400
The fungi.

34
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:52,900
One moment...!

35
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:54,317
What are you doing?

36
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,817
Suck here.

37
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,192
I beg your--

38
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,817
My...!

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,483
look at you, all grown up,!

40
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,692
Enough games...!

41
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,233
You will restore me
to normal!

42
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,317
I can't see why you would
want me to do that...

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,358
There are ever so many
pleasures only an adult

44
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,858
can properly enjoy.

45
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:22,900
Surely you don't want
to miss out on those.

46
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:24,608
Do as I say right now!

47
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,692
The fungi.

48
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:35,108
Can't we go about this
in a less intimate way?

49
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,692
Don't be such a killjoy...

50
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:39,733
Just relax and savor
the moment while it lasts.

51
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:40,983
Suck again.

52
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,483
This isn't right either!

53
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,067
Well...

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,817
That particular form comes with
its own unique pleasures also...

55
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,858
Why must you be so choosy?

56
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:01,275
Put me back at once...!

57
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:02,692
Or I will destroy you!

58
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:03,650
Yes...

59
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:05,192
fine, all right.

60
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:07,400
The Valley.

61
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:19,067
I'm no better off now that
I was before all this.

62
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,400
By the by, I was
wondering, Miss--

63
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:23,442
Oh, terribly sorry...

64
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,983
I don't know your name.

65
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,233
You didn't bother
to ask it until now.

66
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,858
Well, how could I with all
your babbling about becoming

67
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,025
larger and smaller and
then larger again...?

68
00:04:39,108 --> 00:04:41,233
And what good
would it have done...?

69
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,942
You yourself hardly seem
to know who you are anymore.

70
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:46,108
I do know...!

71
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:47,983
I am Ciel, Earl Phantomhive!

72
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:48,858
Oh...

73
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:50,317
so is that what you think...?

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,317
That doesn't seem
to fit, somehow.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,442
Well, it's true...

76
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,317
Now tell me where
the White Rabbit is.

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,900
Oh!

78
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:59,275
Why didn't you say that's what
you wanted in the first place?!

79
00:04:59,358 --> 00:04:59,817
You know?

80
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,942
Tell me!

81
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:05,525
I haven't the foggiest.

82
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,025
Quit toying with me!

83
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,525
This was a
colossal waste of time.

84
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:16,233
Nothing but a useless
conversation with a useless bug!

85
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,150
You think I'm useless, eh...?

86
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,608
I wouldn't say
that if I were you.

87
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,358
What good have you done me?

88
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,900
Have you forgotten that
I am the Caterpillar...?

89
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,983
My life is a whole series
of transformations...

90
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,817
First, I become a chrysalis...

91
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,108
and, following that change...

92
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,567
You know what happens...

93
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,942
don't you?

94
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,442
You become...

95
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:37,983
a butterfly?

96
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,858
You can come along
for the ride, Alice...

97
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:43,817
It's time to spread those
wings, don't you think?

98
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:45,858
Now!

99
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:53,483
What the--?

100
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:08,483
The more that you hurry,
the later you will become...

101
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,442
and the more closely you look,
the less you shall find.

102
00:06:11,525 --> 00:06:14,192
Young Alice can race about
on her White Rabbit hunt,

103
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:17,942
but I doubt their
paths will ever cross.

104
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:21,025
No use wondering why the
mushroom sprouted wings...

105
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:23,358
At any rate, Alice was
traveling once again,

106
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,900
moving swiftly
through the sky.

107
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,942
Quite a fast woman, our Alice.

108
00:07:03,983 --> 00:07:05,692
Would it have been too much
trouble to let me down

109
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:06,942
a bit nearer the ground?

110
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,900
Mr. Rabbit...!

111
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,067
Oh, Mr. Rabbit...!

112
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,400
Wherever are you, Mr. Rabbit?

113
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,025
Meow...

114
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,150
I insist upon
seeing all of you!

115
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:27,317
Come on.

116
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,567
I shan't converse
with half a creature!

117
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,025
Ah, but I am a creature
of halves and in-betweens...

118
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:34,900
Am I male or female?

119
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:35,983
Naughty or nice?

120
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,275
No one can say...

121
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,567
And so I dwell here
in the shadows.

122
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,858
Enough of your gibberish...!

123
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:42,317
Show yourself.

124
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,817
Is something troubling you?

125
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,275
Depending on the circumstances,
I might be willing to lend

126
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:49,650
a hand.

127
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:52,233
I'm sure you will be just as
useless as everybody else

128
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,108
I've met in this
wretched place.

129
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,900
Must you be so cruel...?! I've
come to show you the way,

130
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:58,983
and this is how you treat me?

131
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,817
You're here to help
guide me, are you...?

132
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,817
Ok,which way do I go?

133
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:11,900
Well...?

134
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,358
Which do I pick?

135
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,525
I myself would be rather
inclined to take both of them.

136
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:17,400
Two...

137
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:17,817
at...

138
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,192
a...

139
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:19,483
time...!

140
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,650
I couldn't possibly narrow
it down to just one!

141
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:22,733
I mean...

142
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,192
Both are delicious.

143
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,358
I'd love to sink
my teeth into them!

144
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,067
I was not asking about
your taste in men, you loon...

145
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,858
I just want to know which
of these two paths

146
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,483
I ought to take, alright!

147
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:38,400
Being loved is the
easiest path, of course...

148
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,608
yet I always choose
to be the lover.

149
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,942
I am but a poor, lost kitten.

150
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:45,275
Such is my fate.

151
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,192
First you say you're here
to show me the way,

152
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:49,317
then you tell me you're lost?

153
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,983
Love is a labyrinth
with many twists and turns.

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,442
How shall I
navigate this maze...

155
00:08:56,525 --> 00:08:58,192
when I have lost my thread?

156
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,900
I suppose I don't much
care where I end up,

157
00:09:02,983 --> 00:09:05,275
so long as it is some
place other than here.

158
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,442
It doesn't really matter
which path you choose.

159
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:10,317
Either way you go, you will only
find a madman waiting for you...

160
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,817
So take your pick.

161
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,692
I'm absolutely mad about both
of them...! Mad, mad, mad!

162
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,317
There is another option...

163
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,525
I could simply refuse
to choose either path.

164
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:20,775
Dear me...

165
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:23,358
Can you really afford
such indecision...?

166
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,650
That could be dangerous.

167
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:26,483
It's...

168
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,650
showtime!

169
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,358
Oh...!

170
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:30,358
How thrilling...!

171
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:31,900
Are you ready for this?

172
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,900
The threesome of
paths forms a Y...

173
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,192
Y!

174
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:40,567
Until the tangled
limbs become an M...

175
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,733
M!

176
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,067
When only one rod's left,
it becomes...

177
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,275
an I!

178
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,358
This cat loves to dance...

179
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,483
Wouldn't you like to watch?

180
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:05,525
Seems as if we can put to bed
all those annoying fears

181
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,442
of being lost,
wouldn't you say?

182
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:13,400
So my choice of paths has
dwindled down to one.

183
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:16,192
You're dead right about that!

184
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:19,108
And now I must continue
my hunt for true love...

185
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,483
My claws are itching
for a fresh catch.

186
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,192
And as there's no suitable
prey hereabouts...

187
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,358
Please do give the
White Rabbit my best.

188
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,817
Ta-ta! Meow!

189
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,608
Wait, come back here a moment.

190
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:32,942
What... now?

191
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,942
You mentioned something
about the White Rabbit...

192
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,067
So, do you know
where he's got off to?

193
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,192
Oh, I see.

194
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:40,150
Desperately longing
for him, are you?

195
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:40,858
I...

196
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,608
no...

197
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:42,858
That isn't what I said.

198
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,650
Just how badly do
you want to see him?

199
00:10:45,733 --> 00:10:46,692
Well, I...

200
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:47,733
I'm curious.

201
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:49,317
Of all the creatures
in Wonderland,

202
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,775
why are you seeking
the White Rabbit?

203
00:10:51,858 --> 00:10:52,942
Why...?

204
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:03,108
I'm after him because
he's my butler...!

205
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,567
As such, he belongs to me.

206
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,733
I merely want my
servant back, that's all.

207
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:08,942
That's not fair...!

208
00:11:09,025 --> 00:11:10,567
I want him, too, you know...

209
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,442
I am one of his beloved
pussy cats, after all.

210
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:15,442
Meow!

211
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,067
Feel free to
vanish again now.

212
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,817
Of course, if he prefers,
I'll play the role of tomcat,

213
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,608
and he can be the pussy...!

214
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,692
I'll do anything
for my darling!

215
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:27,525
Bloody poof,
sod off already!

216
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:30,983
More indecision...! You're
the one who told me to wait!

217
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,650
That's correct, I did, and you
never answered my question.

218
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:35,525
Where can I find
the White Rabbit?

219
00:11:35,608 --> 00:11:37,650
Never fear, Alice I've no
doubt you'll be seeing him

220
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:38,858
straight away...

221
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,692
Well, straight that way...

222
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,775
Simply keep heading
straight and then straight

223
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,150
and then straight some more...

224
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,150
You shall find
him eventually...

225
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,275
or perhaps you shan't.

226
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,608
I really must be going though.

227
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:49,983
Ta-ta!

228
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:58,525
The White Rabbit is
straight that way, he says...

229
00:11:58,608 --> 00:11:59,858
Huh.

230
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:03,858
The Cheshire Cat
never much cared

231
00:12:03,942 --> 00:12:05,733
for playing the
role of guide...

232
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,650
His interests lay elsewhere...

233
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,317
Indeed, he was a whore...

234
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,358
for attention, I mean.

235
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,108
With only one road
to choose from,

236
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,817
poor Alice was forced
to trudge forward.

237
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,442
Ciel...

238
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:21,900
in Wonderland.

239
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:26,650
Ciel in Wonderland.

240
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:51,275
There is no more room.

241
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,483
Yes, no more room at all.

242
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,025
Come, don't say that.

243
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,275
Have a seat.

244
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,858
I haven't said anything yet...!

245
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:04,692
What do you mean?

246
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,858
The Dormouse was talking
in his sleep again...

247
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,567
That's where
his name comes from...

248
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,817
always speaking endormi.

249
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,275
Greetings, and welcome
to the Mad Tea Party...

250
00:13:16,358 --> 00:13:18,358
If you haven't guessed,
I am the Hatter.

251
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:20,858
And my companion
is the March Hare.

252
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:23,233
Now, may I offer you
a cup of tea?

253
00:13:23,317 --> 00:13:23,900
I...

254
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:24,900
er...

255
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,650
I discern a suspicious
look in your eye...

256
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,275
There's nothing in it,
I assure you.

257
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:42,650
Nothing but a cube
or two of tasty sugar.

258
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:45,900
You can stop...

259
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:47,733
That's quite enough sugar.

260
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,483
Shhh...

261
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,358
Take a look at the cup.

262
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,483
What on Earth?

263
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:14,775
Memories are such
ephemeral things,

264
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:17,442
fading as quickly
as they appear.

265
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:18,858
Enough of your parlor tricks.

266
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,400
Oh...

267
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:21,483
my, my...

268
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,400
See how quickly the tea
is disappearing?

269
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,150
The ground is thirsty.

270
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,400
I don't want tea.

271
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,275
I want to know if you've
seen the White Rabbit.

272
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,650
An interesting question,
but I'm sure I don't remember.

273
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:36,317
And what about your guest over
there in the spectacles, eh...?

274
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,442
He's a rabbit
as well isn't he?

275
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:40,150
I'll thank you kindly
not to lump me in

276
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,983
with that disgusting beast!

277
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,942
Come now, a rabbit
is a rabbit...

278
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,567
Those ears suit you,
by the way.

279
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,775
I happen to be a hare,
you ignorant wretch...!

280
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:53,483
That white creature is
nothing but a common rabbit!

281
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,567
Oh...

282
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,233
All right,
all right, all right.

283
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,692
Gracious...!

284
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,275
Are all children as poorly
educated as you these days?

285
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,567
Rabbit or hare, what's the
bloody difference, anyway?

286
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,692
How many times must
I explain this to you?!

287
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:05,567
Enough of that.

288
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,025
On to more important question.

289
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:09,692
Tell me, why is a raven
like a writing desk?

290
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,358
Eh?

291
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:15,525
If you want to find the rabbit,
you have to pay the price...!

292
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:16,525
Now then...

293
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:17,692
You'd best start thinking.

294
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:20,567
You have a question
to answer, you know.

295
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,025
The quiz is now beginning...

296
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:23,567
The rules are simple.

297
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,233
When you know the answer, be
the first one to ring the bell.

298
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:29,692
All right...

299
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:31,900
Your first question: why is a
raven like a writing desk...?

300
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,983
You'll be given
two hours to answer.

301
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:34,858
That's long!

302
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:35,733
Ready?

303
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:36,983
Your time to think begins now.

304
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,858
You have thirty
seconds to go...

305
00:15:38,942 --> 00:15:40,692
29, 28, 27--

306
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,108
I say!

307
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,567
Pardon, March Hare, I was
under the impression that

308
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,775
your watch was broken.

309
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,650
Weren't you going to
take it in for repair?

310
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,317
14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6--

311
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,650
Hey!

312
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,567
The first one to
answer is Alice!

313
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,567
Both sound like they
start with an "r"

314
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:02,942
Da-dum-da-dum-da-duuum.

315
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:16,108
The right answer...

316
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,942
is that they are not
alike... at all.

317
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:27,900
Right answer, my arse...!

318
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:30,692
That wasn't at all a proper
quiz question, you fool!

319
00:16:30,775 --> 00:16:31,942
I beg to differ.

320
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:33,692
Indeed, you are the fool
for expecting everything

321
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:34,900
to have a clear answer.

322
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:35,983
Quite right...

323
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,525
real life isn't
nearly so sweet.

324
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:42,233
That's why we all crave a bit of
sugar to sweeten things up.

325
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,483
I told you, I don't care
for your tricks...!

326
00:16:50,567 --> 00:16:52,525
I'm through with
this den of lunatics...!

327
00:16:52,608 --> 00:16:53,775
Good day!

328
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,567
Have you been to visit
the Queen's castle?

329
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,025
No, I haven't yet.

330
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,650
In that case, allow me
to give you a warning...

331
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,358
You'd be better off staying
well away from the queen...

332
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,483
She is capricious,
selfish, and savage.

333
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,775
One can never know what
punishment she will dish out

334
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,525
at the slightest provocation.

335
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,317
It could be quite nasty.

336
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,608
Even so, she is
still worth meeting...

337
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:22,317
She holds the highest office
around here, doesn't she?

338
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,067
Well, yes, I suppose so.

339
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,775
I can't think of anyone higher.

340
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:28,317
Oh dear...

341
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,858
I know that sound.

342
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:31,108
What is it?

343
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,817
It seems they've come for you.

344
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,650
For Alice.

345
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,983
We present an invitation
from the Queen.

346
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,317
Yes, from the Queen, we present
an invitation for Alice.

347
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,192
An invitation from the Queen for
Alice we present to you today.

348
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,692
Right, then...

349
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:58,942
Let's go!

350
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:01,025
Hip, hip, hurrah...!

351
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,275
Hip, hip, hurrah...!

352
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:03,067
Hip, hip, hurrah...!

353
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,317
Put me down this instant!

354
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,608
I can walk on my own,
thank you!

355
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:07,400
Company...

356
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:08,358
halt!

357
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,442
So sorry, Alice.

358
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,858
Are you all right?

359
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,233
I'll be fine once I know where
the damn White Rabbit is?

360
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:18,442
Ah...

361
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,858
He was headed for
the castle, I think.

362
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,483
He runs away from me every
time I catch sight of him...

363
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,942
Well, he shan't be getting
anywhere this time...

364
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:28,858
You three shall escort me
to the castle immediately!

365
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,942
Yes, my young mistress.

366
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,317
If Wonderland were a chessboard,
the Queen's castle would be

367
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,775
on the eighth rank...

368
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,983
Whether Alice was the defender
or the attacker remained

369
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,108
an open question,
but, regardless,

370
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,567
her adventure was
nearing its end.

371
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,400
This place is strange.

372
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,358
I can't begin to guess
why I was called here.

373
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:20,942
Presenting Her Majesty,
the Queen of Hearts...

374
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,983
the most beneficent
of rulers...

375
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:24,733
sovereign among sovereigns...

376
00:20:24,817 --> 00:20:27,233
leader of all creatures
great and small!

377
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:30,275
Guardian of law and
administrator of justice!

378
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:32,817
And, um, er...

379
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,442
Provider of delicious stews and
overseer of rubbish pick-up...

380
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:39,275
All bow before
Her Glorious Majesty...

381
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:40,775
Theeee...

382
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,650
Queeeeeen!

383
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,442
Silence.

384
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:50,567
The trial will now commence...

385
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,067
Hear my ruling...

386
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,025
The accused, Alice,
is sentenced to death.

387
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,150
We will have order
in the court...!

388
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,775
Silence, everybody!

389
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,525
Off with her head!

390
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,233
Off with it immediately, I say!

391
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:08,483
Off with my what?!

392
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,233
Do you know, I have always
wanted to say that...

393
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,692
Why are you standing there?

394
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,233
I gave you an order, didn't I?

395
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,442
Uh-uh-uh-uh...

396
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,692
Yes, of course,
Your Majesty.

397
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:19,900
Stuff and nonsense!

398
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:21,358
I object to this fast!

399
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,525
You pass the sentence
first, with no accusation

400
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,775
and without
presenting evidence?!

401
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,233
Naturally.

402
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,567
Going through all of that
business is a waste of time,

403
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,108
and it's so dreadfully boring.

404
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:32,025
You can't behead me
because you're bored.

405
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:33,067
That's insanity!

406
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,025
Very well, if we must...

407
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:37,983
Go on and read the accusation,
then, just for form's sake.

408
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:38,858
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:40,150
For form's sake, Your Majesty!

410
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,400
Quite right.

411
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,692
It isn't for form's sake,
it's for justice!

412
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:44,858
Er, well...

413
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,108
all right...

414
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,608
At any rate, here we are...

415
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:51,733
"The accused, Alice, was born
on 14th December, 1875...

416
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,525
"And, let's see here...

417
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:01,525
Yes...

418
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,192
I do believe that's everything.

419
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,442
I object...!

420
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:06,983
What's my birthday got
to do with anything?!

421
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:09,192
Are you suggesting
my birth was a crime?!

422
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,692
You will be silent...

423
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:13,067
Or I shall hold you in contempt
and have you chucked out!

424
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,817
We-we will now call the first
witness to the stand...

425
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,775
Witness, you are ordered,
please, to approach the stand.

426
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:19,817
Yes.

427
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,108
Now, uh, miss, I believe
you have been wronged

428
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:27,483
by the accused.

429
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:29,358
Please tell your story.

430
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,317
It's awful...

431
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,775
so awful...

432
00:22:33,858 --> 00:22:35,900
I lost all of
my pretty colors...

433
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:38,317
I wanted to wear
a pink hat today...

434
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,733
with this darling flower on it.

435
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:44,442
But I couldn't, you see, because
a widow may only wear black,

436
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:46,150
day after day.

437
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:48,525
Which is because of her!

438
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,025
Because of me...?

439
00:22:50,108 --> 00:22:51,442
That's mad!

440
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:54,192
Would the second witness please
approach the stand now?

441
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,483
I tragically lost
the love of my life!

442
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,650
The very woman I had adored
since I was but a boy!

443
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,192
At the time, he gained
a friend in exchange,

444
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:04,400
but now he has been
lost as well!

445
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,483
Which is because of her!

446
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,775
Apologize now, I'll forgive you.

447
00:23:08,858 --> 00:23:10,775
Apologize for what?

448
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:12,817
I lost all the days
that could have been.

449
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:21,858
Still...

450
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,192
be that as it may...

451
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,942
I won't say it was
because of you, Alice.

452
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:29,025
Whether you say it or not,
the truth will remain the truth.

453
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,358
I lost my wings and
the power to fly!

454
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:37,692
Which is because of Alice.

455
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:39,442
And...

456
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:42,733
We finally found a warm,
comfortable place to call home!

457
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,525
We tried, but in spite of
all we did to protect it,

458
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:47,192
we have lost it once again.

459
00:23:53,608 --> 00:23:55,858
Which is because of Alice.

460
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,692
It is my sincere honor to call
the next witness, Her Majesty.

461
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:02,650
Very well...

462
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,442
I lost my life...

463
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:08,442
and, perhaps, something even
more important than that...

464
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,275
I lost my sanity.

465
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:16,483
See, Alice...

466
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,858
every last bit of this
was your fault...

467
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:22,817
How cruel of you to make
so many people unhappy.

468
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,317
I don't recall that.

469
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
Oooh...

470
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:28,608
You still have the gall
to claim innocence...

471
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:31,692
Even following all the evidence
you've seen in court today?

472
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:33,483
I have no memory of any of it.

473
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,150
Indeed...

474
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,733
Loss of memory
is your crime, Alice.

475
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:40,233
My crime...? But how?

476
00:24:40,317 --> 00:24:41,275
Now...

477
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:42,858
will the final
witness come forth?

478
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:49,192
Don't you remember
what I told you...?

479
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:53,233
Memories are such
ephemeral things, Alice.

480
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,942
You have entered
a dreamland...

481
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:59,025
a realm between
life and death...

482
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:03,650
a place where past and future
meet and blend together.

483
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,025
I don't...

484
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:07,358
remember.

485
00:25:07,442 --> 00:25:09,608
To come here,
you have to travel light.

486
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,483
Your memories were left
behind in the human world...

487
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:15,358
And now here you are,
a shell of yourself...

488
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:17,400
Poor lost Alice.

489
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,900
Am I Alice...?

490
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,358
The name seems wrong,
like a shoe that doesn't fit.

491
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:22,775
Very interesting...

492
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:24,525
Nice analogy.

493
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,275
Alice isn't right...

494
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,942
But I can't remember what
my name might actually be.

495
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:32,192
I told the Caterpillar
when he asked,

496
00:25:32,275 --> 00:25:33,775
but now I can't think of it.

497
00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:36,233
Thus proving my
judgment correct.

498
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:41,067
As ruled by her Majesty, the
Queen, the accused is hereby

499
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,900
found guilty on the charge
of losing her memories.

500
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,733
Her sentence will be...

501
00:25:45,817 --> 00:25:47,942
It's death, of course...

502
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:49,150
Now...

503
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,608
off with her head before
I am bored to death.

504
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:53,650
You can't.

505
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:54,942
I'm innocent, I tell you!

506
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:55,983
Are you...?

507
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,483
Show your proof.

508
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:58,983
Show your proof!

509
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,358
Show your proof!

510
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,817
Show your proof!

511
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,942
Show your proof!

512
00:26:04,025 --> 00:26:05,192
Show your proof!

513
00:26:05,275 --> 00:26:06,983
Show your proof!

514
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,567
Show your proof!

515
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,692
Show your proof!

516
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,858
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do!

517
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:16,817
Show your proof.

518
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,942
Proof that whatever else
you may forget...

519
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:23,567
you will remain yourself.

520
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,775
Now...

521
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:26,650
simply call my name.

522
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,983
Sebastian...

523
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,567
Call it louder.

524
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,108
Sebastian, Sebastian,
Sebastian, Sebastian!

525
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,233
Listen to me now,
Sebastian...!

526
00:26:40,317 --> 00:26:43,358
It doesn't matter if I lose
everything, I am still me!

527
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:45,817
I am always
Ciel Phantomhive...!

528
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,983
Now come to me, Sebastian!

529
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,858
Master!

530
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:08,775
That was well done
indeed, my lord.

531
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:09,983
I order you...

532
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,442
get me out of
here immediately!

533
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:13,858
Immediately...

534
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:15,400
yes my young lord.

535
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,192
Seize them quickly!

536
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,983
Hold on tightly.

537
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:42,733
So you're going home...

538
00:27:42,817 --> 00:27:44,192
at last...

539
00:27:44,275 --> 00:27:46,650
Let us meet again, Ciel.

540
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,483
In another dream.

541
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:58,025
The truth is, you never need
any proof at all...

542
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:01,483
You have only to evoke me
and give me my orders.

543
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,608
Simply call my name...

544
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:05,358
and I shall come.

545
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:12,983
"'Who cares for you'?

546
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,150
said Alice.

547
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,525
'You're nothing but
a pack of cards'...

548
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,942
At this, the whole pack
rose up into the air

549
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:23,692
and came flying down upon her."

550
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:28,650
She gave a little
scream of fright..."

551
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,233
And then...

552
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:35,150
she found herself lying in bed,
safe and sound in her own world.

553
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:43,358
It ends there.

554
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,358
Sweet dreams, young master.
