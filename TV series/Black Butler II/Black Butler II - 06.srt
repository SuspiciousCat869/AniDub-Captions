1
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,233
And now, master...

2
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:54,567
What is this?

3
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:41,858
Group attack...

4
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:43,150
Welcome to...

5
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,358
The Fierce Raking from Hell!

6
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:17,858
Good show.

7
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:19,525
You're all
exceptionally skilled.

8
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:32,358
It was like carrying a doll...

9
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,442
Running virtually unburdened.

10
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:35,775
Did you say something?

11
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:37,817
Only that it would be far,
far easier to carry you

12
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,483
if you were in a container.

13
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,942
Like a trunk, I'd say.

14
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,567
Is this any time to be joking?

15
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,858
My apologies, master.

16
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,067
Sebastian's amazing...

17
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,317
You know, Claude, I think
he may be better than you.

18
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,942
We should force him to crawl
on his belly like a dog.

19
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,483
What do you think?

20
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,900
Can you make
that happen, Claude?

21
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,483
What's that?

22
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,358
What's in there?

23
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,817
An instrument, maybe?

24
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,442
This is a surprise...

25
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:58,775
I certainly didn't expect
to see that here tonight.

26
00:04:58,858 --> 00:04:59,817
See what?

27
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,317
You know what that is?

28
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,608
My prince!

29
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,067
Wh-

30
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,442
What's happening?

31
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:50,817
Master, please cover your ears.

32
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,317
My ears?

33
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,442
Why?

34
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:55,108
What is that noise?!

35
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:56,650
I haven't heard it in awhile...

36
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,858
At least a hundred
years, I believe.

37
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,525
My lady!

38
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,733
It hurts my head!

39
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:20,817
I didn't drink that much.

40
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,942
I say...

41
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,150
what is this?

42
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:24,733
If you know something...!

43
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,067
Know what?

44
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,067
You damn crook!

45
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,733
Prince Soma!

46
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,275
Has everyone gone mad?

47
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,692
It is the music...

48
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:53,275
It seems to be
controlling them somehow.

49
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,650
Let's go...!

50
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,192
We need to get
back to the ball.

51
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:16,942
Don't worry, master...

52
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:21,358
Fortunately, one of my very few
friends is at the dance evening.

53
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:35,817
Oww-ee!

54
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,400
Oh, it's all quiet now!

55
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:42,483
That music doesn't
hurt me head anymore!

56
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,775
Knew I didn't have
that much to drink...

57
00:07:45,608 --> 00:07:47,692
Hey!

58
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,942
Why do we sound all funny?

59
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:52,025
Our lines don't fit the flaps!

60
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,775
Almost like
someone else's talking!

61
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:01,150
On your guard.
Here they come.

62
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,400
I am sorry.

63
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,317
Agni, stop this...!

64
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,983
Knock them all unconscious.

65
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,608
Jo ajna!

66
00:08:47,858 --> 00:08:49,567
Master, are you all right?

67
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,442
Fine.

68
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:51,900
Just shut your mouth and run.

69
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:53,275
Right.

70
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,442
Damn...

71
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:07,942
there are too many!

72
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,608
Prince Soma!

73
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:24,983
Prince Soma!

74
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,108
...Your Highness!

75
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,900
Are you alright, my Prince?

76
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:30,650
Yes, Agni...

77
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:32,108
but what is happening?

78
00:09:36,817 --> 00:09:38,650
The sound has changed.

79
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:41,608
Look, it's Sebastian!

80
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,567
I feel all
peaceful-like somehow.

81
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,775
It's very relaxing!

82
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:54,650
This is magnificent.

83
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:58,150
Sebastian's music is merging
perfectly with hers,

84
00:09:58,233 --> 00:10:00,692
transforming the
quality of the sound...

85
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:03,733
Her threatening, ominous
playing becomes a melody full

86
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,983
of warmth and kindness...

87
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,817
Such a complete change
is incredible.

88
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,400
We are blessed to be able
to witness such purity

89
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:12,650
in a performer...

90
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,525
True beauty,
utter transcendence,

91
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,858
thank you Sebastian!

92
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,775
He plays like
some sort of god!

93
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,275
The Earl certainly
knows how to entertain.

94
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:21,567
Bravo!

95
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,900
I still don't
understand what happened.

96
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:29,942
The performance
would not have been

97
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,608
the same without your help...

98
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,442
I'm grateful, my lady.

99
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:34,067
Hmph...

100
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,692
What a show off.

101
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,483
You're back, Ciel.

102
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:40,983
What is the instrument
she was playing?

103
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,442
An armonica...

104
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,733
It was popular
in the eighteenth century.

105
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,525
Some called it the "voice
of the angels." Others feared

106
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:50,275
that it disturbed the minds
of those who heard it.

107
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:52,150
Thus it fell into the
dark corners of history

108
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,775
as a demon's instrument.

109
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:56,358
Made by humans and called
a demon's instrument.

110
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:59,275
Yet its negative effects
didn't seem to reach you.

111
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,108
Yes...

112
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:01,775
I found it rather pleasant.

113
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:04,608
Why would someone play such
a thing at a costume ball?

114
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,983
As a diversion for my guests.

115
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,775
Ladies and gentlemen, please
accept my sincere apologies

116
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,108
for being late.

117
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,358
I'm Alois Trancy,
I'm so honored that you came.

118
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,442
Oh, so that's him!

119
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,650
He's young!

120
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,483
I see that you enjoyed the
entertainment while I was away.

121
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,025
I'm relieved that
it was to your liking.

122
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,317
That performance
was outstanding...

123
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,817
I must say, you have a true
talent for music, Sebastian.

124
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,942
I cannot accept such praise...

125
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,442
I am simply one hell
of a butler.

126
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:43,108
Yes, he is quite a servant...

127
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:45,650
You're lucky,
Earl Phantomhive.

128
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,608
He's merely a butler.

129
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:48,858
Master...

130
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,483
I'd like to have
a word with Claude if

131
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,483
it wouldn't trouble you.

132
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,525
It shouldn't
take terribly long.

133
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:54,525
He can do that...

134
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,150
Right, Claude?

135
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,525
Ten minutes, Claude...

136
00:12:57,608 --> 00:12:59,692
I want you to settle
this quickly...

137
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,108
If you can't do that...

138
00:13:01,192 --> 00:13:02,567
you'll be punished.

139
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,442
Yes...

140
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:04,942
your highness.

141
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:06,483
Fine, but do it swiftly...

142
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:07,567
Understood?

143
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,692
Why, yes...

144
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,525
my young lord.

145
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,900
You're nothing
if not persistent...

146
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:30,775
You've been hunting
my master most relentlessly.

147
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,358
My master ordered it...

148
00:13:33,442 --> 00:13:35,692
He instructed me to
"steal Ciel Phantomhive

149
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,692
from Sebastian Michaelis."

150
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,525
Nevertheless,
he is my young master.

151
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,150
Just the feel of him...

152
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:49,983
One rarely handles
something so fine.

153
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:53,400
I cannot abide the thought that
someone else has touched him...

154
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:55,317
It's enough to make me sick.

155
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,150
The sticky, clinging touch
of your vile spider web

156
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,775
has defiled him...

157
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,525
My master.

158
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,942
Ciel Phantomhive.

159
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,067
...his soul.

160
00:14:36,983 --> 00:14:38,650
What is this?

161
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,275
This is impossible...

162
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,108
My lord is empty.

163
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:30,358
That was the day you took him
from me, you underhanded thief.

164
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:33,817
You stole my precious
young master's soul.

165
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,858
It wasn't enough, though.

166
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:42,025
I needed more than the soul;
I needed the body, as well.

167
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,650
But then you came here.

168
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:47,108
Yes, I retrieved
his soul from you.

169
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,650
And yet, something
was not right,

170
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,400
he was still not
my young master.

171
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:10,983
Now...

172
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:14,483
young master
It is time to wake up.

173
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,817
Ciel Phantomhive
lost his memories.

174
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,483
He lost the pain
he had lived through.

175
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:44,942
My lord's soul, which I'd
so carefully cultivated.

176
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:46,525
As I thought.

177
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,817
You want a soul
that's known its revenge.

178
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,358
Even so...

179
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:56,317
I sense an extraordinary
attachment to him...

180
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,150
A fierce obsession
with the boy's soul.

181
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,483
Not surprising...

182
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,733
I am a demon after all...

183
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,400
You have a master of
your own, you should know.

184
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,608
Nurture a soul
and then feast upon it.

185
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,400
That is what we do.

186
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,983
Yes, I do know...

187
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:14,358
My master's soul is another of
the rare ones worth desiring.

188
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:15,525
But you...

189
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:17,275
Giving a soul
that's lost its memory...

190
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,358
A second chance at revenge...

191
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:21,567
No human soul is
worth the trouble.

192
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,400
That's where
you're wrong, I'm afraid.

193
00:17:23,483 --> 00:17:25,692
My master is unlike any
human you've known...

194
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,567
He's a very rare specimen.

195
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,483
You were right about
one thing, though...

196
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:36,192
I most definitely intend to
give him a second opportunity

197
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,983
to realize his vengeance...

198
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:39,150
But sadly...

199
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:40,983
I'm lacking something critical.

200
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:44,567
A worthy target.

201
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,483
What are your master's orders?

202
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,567
You said they were
to steal my master from me.

203
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,817
Is that all?

204
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,525
That and to make you suffer
an agony worse than death.

205
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:55,983
Is that so?

206
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,358
It would be pointless to obtain
Ciel Phantomhive without

207
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,983
his memories of
revenge fully intact.

208
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,817
I must steal a perfected version
of him, one who has known

209
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,608
his final vengeance.

210
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,025
Would you be
interested in a deal?

211
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,358
How is it, Ciel?

212
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:16,067
Does it bring
back any memories?

213
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,025
And what, exactly,
is eating bread stuffed

214
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:20,233
with curry supposed
to make me remember...?

215
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:23,775
Besides, I don't even
care for spicy foods anyway.

216
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,150
I'm sorry, my prince.

217
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,525
Although...

218
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:29,317
You know, the flavor
isn't all that bad.

219
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:39,567
--What are you doing?
--Hello, Lord Phantomhive...

220
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,942
So, how did everything
turn out in the end?

221
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:44,317
Wait, you've just been
hiding under the table?

222
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,442
You and your master shall
become the targets

223
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,150
of my lord's revenge.

224
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,400
And once Ciel Phantomhive
has gained that revenge,

225
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:29,983
we shall battle for his soul...

226
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,025
The seal.

227
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:34,192
We make our pact.

228
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:57,067
One minute...

229
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,275
That's all.

230
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:03,775
You're back, Claude!

231
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:09,692
What's the meaning of this?

232
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,608
I took care of it swiftly, just
as you ordered me to, my lord.

233
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,025
Quit playing games!

234
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:24,858
What is this?

235
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:26,817
This looks as if they've
been investigating me?

236
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:34,358
And my father as well...?
Then that means...

237
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,983
He is the one.

238
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,233
It's him!

239
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:40,358
Care to explain why
Sebastian's still alive?

240
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:41,608
You botched this...

241
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:42,900
How sad.

242
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,358
You failed me.

243
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,608
What shall I do...?

244
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:49,733
I'll have to punish you now.

245
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:55,067
Your Highness, you did not order
me to kill Sebastian Michaelis.

246
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,233
All the arrangements
have been made...

247
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,358
Day into night...

248
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,775
snow-white into crimson...

249
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,317
lies into truth.

250
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,733
Indeed...

251
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,650
I am a Trancy butler.

252
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,942
I will make one hell
of a feast out of you.

253
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:23,817
Ciel...!

254
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,775
Where are you? Ciel?

255
00:21:27,567 --> 00:21:28,650
Lady Elizabeth...

256
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,192
So, shall we dance?

257
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,150
Oh, hello my lord.

258
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,650
Forgive me for
bumping into you...

259
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,025
I was, I was just
trying to find Ciel.

260
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:46,192
What, is my Lord
actually going to dance?

261
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,525
Shut up!

262
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,608
That's new.

263
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,442
See, it is turning out
to be an interesting party...

264
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,025
Wouldn't you say so?

265
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,067
The young master's
actually dancing.

266
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,067
Blimey, never thought
I'd see that.

267
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,317
Come on, we should dance, too!

268
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,400
The young master
belongs to me.

269
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:18,442
There's Ciel!

270
00:22:20,025 --> 00:22:21,608
Ciel...!

271
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:22,692
Ciel!

272
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,150
Ciel Phantomhive.

273
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,650
Alois Trancy.

274
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,233
I swear...

275
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:34,483
I swear...

276
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:37,025
...I will make you mine.

277
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:39,108
...I will kill you.

278
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:16,358
Excellent, master...

279
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:19,608
At last you have found someone
deserving of your vengeance...

280
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,358
Let anger writhe within you...

281
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:23,858
Let your soul
boil with hatred...

282
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,275
Let us dance...

283
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,775
The dance of death...

284
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:28,692
the Danse Macabre.

285
00:24:29,942 --> 00:24:33,400
Next time: "Deathly Butler."
If I couldn't revel

286
00:24:33,483 --> 00:24:35,192
in your ravishing revenge...

287
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:37,817
what kind of black
butler would I be?
