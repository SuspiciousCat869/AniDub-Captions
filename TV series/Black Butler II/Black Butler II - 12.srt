1
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,067
My master's soul gained control
of Ciel Phantomhive's body.

2
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,233
By doing so, he was able to
enter into a contract with me.

3
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:11,192
Ciel Phantomhive's soul will
not see the light of day...

4
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,858
It is here, trapped and
powerless within this body.

5
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,900
And so it will remain until
my master's soul is released...

6
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:20,150
and our contract is fulfilled.

7
00:01:30,775 --> 00:01:33,025
What are the details
of the contract...?

8
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:35,067
What does Alois Trancy want?

9
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,525
That is a secret
between my master and me.

10
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:40,108
How presumptuous.

11
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:41,358
However...

12
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:44,025
I will give you one
piece of information...

13
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,775
My master does not want
both of you to live...

14
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,442
In accordance with his
wishes and our agreement...

15
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:51,858
one of you will end
your life as a demon.

16
00:01:51,942 --> 00:01:53,567
The struggle will
end when one of you

17
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,692
claims victory and the
terms of the contract

18
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,358
my master and I signed
have been met...

19
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,858
When this has happened...

20
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:03,233
my master will agree to release
Ciel Phantomhive's soul...

21
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:05,108
and after that...

22
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,442
Hannah...

23
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,733
What's to stop us
from killing you?

24
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:13,067
I will be suffused with
a shade of the noblest blue...

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,733
and your precious
Ciel Phantomhive

26
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:17,608
will come back to life.

27
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:26,400
This island of death
is a sanctuary for demons.

28
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:29,233
It seems your rage has left it
in a rather pitiable state,

29
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,317
Sebastian...

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,983
You should learn
to control your temper.

31
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,775
You brought us to
this place for a reason.

32
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,400
What do you expect of us?

33
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,900
This is an ideal location
for a battle...

34
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,442
You will engage in
a duel between demons.

35
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,567
How ridiculous...

36
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:48,442
Duel between demon butlers.

37
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:50,442
Yes, amusing, isn't it...?

38
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:53,483
To see two grown men act
like desperate children.

39
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,025
Then what happens?

40
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,108
My wishes will come true...

41
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,192
and when they do,
I'll die for real and Hannah

42
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,567
will eat my soul...

43
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,733
After that, I'll return
this body to you.

44
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,108
Return this body...

45
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,150
Huh.

46
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,233
I did a terrible
thing to you, Ciel.

47
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,650
Both Sebastian
and Claude love you.

48
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:15,525
I wanted to punish you for
living such a blessed life.

49
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:16,525
Love, eh...?

50
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,567
How childish.

51
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,900
Huh?

52
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:21,025
You don't understand
Sebastian at all, do you...?

53
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,317
Have you any idea how
he'll react when he learns

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,442
the details of the contract?

55
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,608
No human weapon known
is powerful enough

56
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,775
to fatally wound a demon...

57
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:56,150
That said...

58
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:59,192
a wound caused by a demon's
sword will never heal...

59
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:02,567
The damage done by
such a blow is permanent.

60
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,525
There is no hope for a soul
pierced by a demon's sword.

61
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,567
It will be utterly obliterated.

62
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,358
Now then...

63
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,733
A demon duel with
a single sword.

64
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,567
A singular sword to battle
for a singular soul.

65
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,442
When this is done,
I will sink my teeth

66
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,108
into the young master's soul!

67
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,025
I'll bite hard...

68
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:37,733
Deep.

69
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:38,733
And cruel.

70
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:40,150
The soul is mine!

71
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,192
A small space like this hinders
my ability to move freely.

72
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:51,900
But I can take care of that.

73
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:55,442
Let's widen this
space up a touch?

74
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:58,192
What now?

75
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,567
Come, master!

76
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:12,108
Damn you, Sebastian Michaelis!

77
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:35,025
The demon sword...

78
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,483
The Phantomhive soul...

79
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,567
I will have them both!

80
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,317
It's raining...

81
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,817
My, my...

82
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:56,775
I've already exacted
the revenge I so desired.

83
00:05:56,858 --> 00:06:00,108
With that achieved, I existed
for a singular purpose...

84
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,567
to have my soul
devoured by Sebastian.

85
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,192
But then Hannah and
I made our contract...

86
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,275
and your plans were foiled.

87
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:14,317
I can almost pity him.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,483
Fighting while
still in the dark.

89
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,983
He battles now not knowing
what will happen when he wins.

90
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,442
...not knowing the
truth of his reward.

91
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,317
It's over...

92
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,317
Your dreams of tearing the
young master are finished.

93
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,067
The young master has...

94
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,192
such...

95
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,108
a sweet soul.

96
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,858
The fight is over...

97
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:09,317
The battle for his
worthy soul has finally

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,567
reached its conclusion.

99
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,942
Even as I wither away...

100
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,775
I can smell his rich,
untainted fragrance.

101
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,775
You think that's the
young master's soul...?

102
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:20,692
You've got it wrong.

103
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,858
It is Alois Trancy's soul
that trifles with you...

104
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,733
and you'll die
as he intended.

105
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,067
Don't you see?

106
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,483
You've been under his
control this entire time.

107
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:31,858
Alois Trancy...

108
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:33,608
It was him?

109
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:38,275
My spectacles.

110
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,400
What?

111
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:40,233
I've...

112
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,525
a spare...

113
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,650
in my breast pocket.

114
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:54,483
You understand.

115
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:57,192
I've had a very long,
very idle life as a demon...

116
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:00,817
If Alois Trancy has managed
to spice it up a bit...

117
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,108
then perhaps I
underestimated his soul...

118
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,525
I might have taken great
pleasure in tearing it apart

119
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,525
piece by piece as well...

120
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:09,775
But now it's over...

121
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:11,108
Done.

122
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,525
You're remarkably talkative...

123
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:16,400
considering the
severity of your injury.

124
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,567
Yes...

125
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,650
But not for long, I fear...

126
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,692
My end is indeed at hand.

127
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:22,733
Well then...

128
00:08:22,817 --> 00:08:24,983
do you have any
last words to speak?

129
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,275
Yes.

130
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,983
Passion into insincerity...

131
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,358
Utter lies into abject truth...

132
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:35,817
A stray dog of
a boy into an earl...

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,567
That's what makes...

134
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,567
...what makes...

135
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,067
a...

136
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,400
butler.

137
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,192
A butler indeed...

138
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:00,108
but whose butler
did you die as, Claude?

139
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:01,608
No, Claude!

140
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:02,942
It's over now.

141
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:05,650
You're right...

142
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,025
It's all over.

143
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:09,525
Satisfied?

144
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:10,817
I don't really know...

145
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,233
I'm no longer
sure how I feel.

146
00:09:13,317 --> 00:09:14,442
But...

147
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:15,567
But?

148
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,775
Well...

149
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:19,442
Strange as it sounds,
that's fine with me.

150
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:35,483
Here we are, Sebastian...

151
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,067
The truth is right
in front of you now...

152
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,733
So what will you do...

153
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:41,442
when you learn everything?

154
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:46,525
At last...

155
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,275
we can know happiness.

156
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:51,817
Oh...

157
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,317
dear master...! Claude
finally acknowledged you.

158
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Hannah...

159
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:00,817
The terms of the contract
I made with my master

160
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,317
have been suitably met...

161
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,483
All you have to do
now is kill me...

162
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,775
Simply do that, and your young
master will have his body back.

163
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,942
However...

164
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:14,400
Even with his body returned...

165
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,400
You will find that Ciel
Phantomhive is as good

166
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,858
as a dead person to you.

167
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,858
My master and
I have succeeded...

168
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:22,692
our work is nearly done.

169
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,733
As for Ciel
Phantomhive, well...

170
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,608
The contract?

171
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:55,192
Tell me master,
what do you wish?

172
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:57,650
Do you want Claude's love...?
Or would you like to tear off

173
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,983
his limbs and force
him to serve you?

174
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:02,733
Did you hear that...?

175
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,275
They're approaching now.

176
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,733
Yes...

177
00:11:05,817 --> 00:11:10,275
in continued pursuit of Ciel
Phantomhive's noble soul.

178
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:11,567
I've decided...

179
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,942
I know how I would like
our contract to be concluded.

180
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:18,442
My desire...

181
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:21,275
is that neither of them
will gain Ciel's soul

182
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:23,192
You wish for a murder, then?

183
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,442
No...

184
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,900
that's not what I had in mind.

185
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:30,483
I finally saw Claude's love,
but it eluded me...

186
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,525
I want them to know
exactly how that feels.

187
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,900
She said that, to me...

188
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,608
my master would be
as good as dead.

189
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:41,817
This isn't what I expected.

190
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,025
Jim Macken...

191
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,192
Luka Macken...

192
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:52,733
Claude Faustus.

193
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,525
And Hannah Annafellows.

194
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,358
The four of us will
share a great love...

195
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,942
such as the world
has never known before.

196
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:18,650
Luka...

197
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,858
We're finally together.

198
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:20,983
Luka!

199
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,317
Brother!

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,358
We'll stay together forever...

201
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,650
with Hannah and Claude, too!

202
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:27,858
Yea...!

203
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,692
I'm not lonely anymore.

204
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:30,775
That's right...

205
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:32,400
No more loneliness.

206
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:34,608
We're home...

207
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:35,733
We're happy...

208
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,067
At last!

209
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:41,983
Master...

210
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,025
Master!

211
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:50,817
I served you even though it
meant becoming a lowly butler...

212
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,858
I remember...

213
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:56,233
Thank you very much
for waiting, master.

214
00:13:01,442 --> 00:13:02,650
Are you incompetent?

215
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,400
Lord...

216
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,983
what do you mean?

217
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,817
You somehow managed to make
this slop look like real food.

218
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,442
But it tastes like something
found in the rubbish bin.

219
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,900
I do apologize...

220
00:13:13,983 --> 00:13:16,442
I'll bring something
else right away.

221
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,858
You signed an official
contract with me...

222
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,733
Per that, you're now my butler.

223
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,400
I expect you to act like one.

224
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:23,775
Yes, my lord.

225
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:29,608
Damn demon...

226
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,567
That's right...

227
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,442
I am a demon.

228
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,983
How could I ever
hope to understand

229
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,525
the taste of human food?

230
00:13:41,608 --> 00:13:45,275
The only taste
I can understand...

231
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,900
is the taste of a human soul.

232
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,733
Good morning, young master.

233
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,150
Would you prefer
to make it even tighter?

234
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,817
No.

235
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:31,108
I've prepared
your tea, master.

236
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,567
This morning we
have New Moon Drop.

237
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,900
What is my schedule today?

238
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,650
It's open.

239
00:15:49,442 --> 00:15:50,983
It smells quite nice.

240
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:05,775
Come in.

241
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:07,608
Er...

242
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:09,067
pardon, master...

243
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,400
It's the Lady Elizabeth.

244
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:12,108
She's here, sir.

245
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:13,400
All right.

246
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,400
Excuse me.

247
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,025
As for the schedule...

248
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,650
I'll decide it.

249
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,400
I want both of you to
attend to the young master...

250
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,983
and make sure Lady Elizabeth
is comfortable.

251
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,192
Okay, Sebastian...

252
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,442
But where are you going?

253
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,692
I have some other
business to take care of.

254
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:43,983
What kind of business...?

255
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:45,608
Oi, what's going on here?

256
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,108
Ciel!

257
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:50,733
I-I can't breathe.

258
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,317
I missed you so much...!

259
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
You shouldn't deprive
a lady like that!

260
00:16:55,733 --> 00:16:59,567
And just look at that horrid
outfit...! Not cute at all!

261
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,525
Plain black like that
doesn't suit you one bit!

262
00:17:02,608 --> 00:17:04,650
No, perhaps not...

263
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,942
Maybe I'll change then...

264
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,900
I have done it before.

265
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,567
I don't understand
what you mean...

266
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,025
What is it, Ciel?

267
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,442
I'm confused.

268
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:15,317
Will you give me the honor
of a dance, my lady?

269
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,400
I'd love to!

270
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:26,817
Say, Ciel,...

271
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,150
where is your ring?

272
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:42,358
This music sounds strange.

273
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:44,567
The gramophone
must be broken.

274
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,317
Oh.

275
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,150
Whatever's the matter?

276
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,608
Oh, hello there,
Phantomhive butler...

277
00:18:02,692 --> 00:18:03,817
It's been awhile.

278
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,858
Hello...

279
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:06,442
I'm glad to see you
in good health.

280
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:10,525
Yes, I suppose I should thank
you for letting me slip away...

281
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,567
Still, I went along
with your little charade,

282
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,900
so we're even aren't we?

283
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:14,525
Yes.

284
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:16,025
I appreciate it...

285
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,775
and I've brought
something for you.

286
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:21,858
Easy, Ran-Mao.

287
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,733
My master will be away
from town for some time...

288
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:26,525
He sent me to say goodbye.

289
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:27,317
Ah...

290
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,942
I shall miss him terribly.

291
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,483
I have a message from him.

292
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:34,650
"I thought about killing
you, but I decided it was

293
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:36,442
too much of a bother...

294
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:37,900
You can do as you please...

295
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,317
However...

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Make certain to
keep out of my sight."

297
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,525
Oh...?

298
00:18:42,608 --> 00:18:45,400
So his memory returned, eh?

299
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:48,233
That's a happy ending,
isn't it, Ran-Mao...?

300
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,108
So...

301
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,108
he's leaving fair London Town?

302
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
What took you
so long, Sebastian?

303
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,358
I apologize.

304
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:33,650
We can leave now.

305
00:19:33,733 --> 00:19:34,817
Young master...

306
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,733
it's true then?

307
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:37,192
You're really leaving us?

308
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:39,233
Do whatever you like
with the mansion...

309
00:19:39,317 --> 00:19:41,108
You're free to stay
here if you want.

310
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:41,983
Or just burn it.

311
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,233
I don't really care.

312
00:19:43,317 --> 00:19:43,942
What?

313
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:45,317
We could never do that!

314
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Whyever not?

315
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:47,483
Because...

316
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:51,233
this place is
filled with memories!

317
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,150
Memories don't mean
anything in the end...

318
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,233
Or haven't I proved
that much already?

319
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,567
That's not true, Master!

320
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:27,983
I was curious to see what you'd
do when it was all over...

321
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:32,025
when the contract between
Alois and Hannah was fulfilled.

322
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,900
I have to admit
you surprised me...

323
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,442
Well done.

324
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,650
I never thought
you'd try to kill me.

325
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,567
I would help you
realize your revenge...

326
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,400
and in return
I'd have your soul.

327
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,608
That's why I served
you as a butler...

328
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,192
why I have remained
by your side all this time.

329
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:51,108
That's right...

330
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:53,525
but I'm still
very much alive.

331
00:20:59,233 --> 00:20:59,942
Yes, indeed...

332
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,108
You are alive.

333
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:03,442
not as a human...

334
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:07,400
but as a demon.

335
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:12,025
That day in the maze,
Alois Trancy signed

336
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,817
a contract with
Hannah Annafellows.

337
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,150
As my contract stipulated...

338
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,317
Ciel Phantomhive
will come back to life...

339
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,358
but now he will
live forever as a demon.

340
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,608
That's why I did what I did.

341
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,817
That was quite
a greeting you gave me...

342
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,442
You wanted to kill me
before I awakened eh...?

343
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:41,067
Before I could live as a demon?

344
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:41,942
No...

345
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:43,358
I had something else in mind.

346
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:44,983
Killing you wasn't my intent...

347
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,983
I wanted to see if you
truly had become a demon.

348
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,358
I see.

349
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:53,025
You wanted an accurate
assessment of the situation.

350
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:56,150
A proper consideration
for a proper butler.

351
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,400
So now here we are...

352
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:03,775
I shall never be able
to devour your soul.

353
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:05,025
That's right...

354
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,692
but there's more.

355
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:09,275
I gave you an order while
you were in the labyrinth.

356
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:20,483
to remain my butler
until you'd eaten my soul.

357
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,650
Indeed.

358
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:25,942
...I heard your order...

359
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:28,400
I understood and acquiesced.

360
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:31,317
I cannot eat your soul.

361
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I am a butler...

362
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:33,817
now and always...

363
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,567
...for a fellow fiend of hell.

364
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,442
Where shall we go now?

365
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,817
Do you know, I don't much care.

366
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,483
After all, you and I
already know where

367
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:24,192
we are ultimately
going to end up.

368
00:23:24,275 --> 00:23:29,650
I was always going there, as
a dead human or a live demon.

369
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:35,483
I feel good somehow...

370
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:39,275
as if released from a spell
I was under for a long time.

371
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:40,150
Yes...

372
00:23:40,233 --> 00:23:42,400
and in return for that...

373
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:44,983
I have been put under
an eternal spell.

374
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,233
You're my butler, Sebastian.

375
00:23:49,317 --> 00:23:51,900
I am simply one hell
of a butler...

376
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:54,358
for eternity.

377
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,400
And as before,
there is only one answer

378
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:58,108
that you will give me...

379
00:23:58,192 --> 00:23:59,483
You know it, don't you?

380
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:06,025
Yes...

381
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:07,733
my lord.
