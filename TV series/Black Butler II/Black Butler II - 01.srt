1
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,192
Darkness...

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,442
Darkness...

3
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,275
Darkness.

4
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:42,650
Darkness coils its
implacable fingers around me.

5
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,025
I am ever ensnared by it...

6
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:55,608
Its dark blades
pierce me to the core...

7
00:00:55,692 --> 00:01:00,108
I can feel them drawing out
every last drop of warm blood...

8
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,525
slowly.

9
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:02,567
Even so...

10
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,233
Even so...

11
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,483
I choose this.

12
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,192
So now...

13
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,400
I'll scream it.

14
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:14,483
Rend the darkness
with your voice.

15
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,192
I want this!

16
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:20,358
I want you!

17
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,400
Here we are, Master.

18
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,942
This morning's tea is Her
Majesty's blend from Ridgways...

19
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:20,400
Most excellent.

20
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,233
Aw, annoyed now?

21
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:48,650
No.

22
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:57,192
Please excuse me.

23
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:16,400
Hannah...

24
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:19,650
don't you find fried eggs
rather pathetic?

25
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,650
Nakedly exposed
for all eyes to see.

26
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,817
Indeed, they almost
look like eyes themselves.

27
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,900
But they'll never
become eyes, of course,

28
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:30,150
or anything but my breakfast.

29
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:33,733
All that possibility,
wiped out by me.

30
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:43,692
Hannah.

31
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:52,233
Yes, truly pathetic indeed.

32
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:59,108
Hasn't Claude
taught you any better...?

33
00:04:59,192 --> 00:05:01,317
A maid mustn't look
directly at her master.

34
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,692
It's rude.

35
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,108
Do forgive me...

36
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:09,108
Claude will be most upset
if I don't punish you...

37
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,608
so...

38
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,983
Clean this up at once.

39
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,150
Master, we're receiving
a have a guest today.

40
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,567
Arnold Trancy will be dining
at the mansion with us.

41
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,858
Only because
he wants my money.

42
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:47,275
This time a priest will
be at supper as well...

43
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:49,483
It seems he has certain
doubts about your time

44
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,233
"held hostage by the fairies."

45
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:53,483
No, Claude!

46
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:54,733
What do I do?!

47
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,900
I changed all the old
loon's decorations...

48
00:05:56,983 --> 00:06:00,150
The nasty curtains, the ugly
rugs, the old knick-knacks!

49
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:01,692
Please don't worry yourself...

50
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,608
I'll take care of it at once.

51
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,900
Everything.

52
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:06,358
Really?

53
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:09,942
Yes... my young highness.

54
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,192
One, two, three...

55
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:49,108
And now...

56
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:38,483
I transform day into
night, sugar into salt,

57
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:40,108
creatures into corpses...

58
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:43,233
and in this case,
I transform navy into golden.

59
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:48,150
"That's what makes
a Trancy butler." As you say.

60
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,192
That's my Claude.

61
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:54,233
As long as I have you, I don't
need those other useless clods.

62
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,358
One thing...

63
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:58,275
I prefer my roses
displayed like this.

64
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:05,858
O-lé!

65
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,275
The morons arrive...

66
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,650
I am deeply honored that you
made time in your busy schedule

67
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:19,650
to come today, Father...

68
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,983
Also...

69
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,942
I appreciate the presence
of the Viscount Druitt.

70
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,942
Of course. It was the
least I could do...

71
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,233
I am happy to oblige.

72
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,983
I owe dear Uncle Trancy
a great deal... Yes.

73
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:31,733
He lent me help
in trying times...

74
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:33,692
and when someone does
that, the Viscount Druitt

75
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,817
pays him back twofold...!
My devotion gives rise

76
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,400
to generosity!

77
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,900
Yes, quite.

78
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,983
At any rate, you asked me
to accompany you today because

79
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,983
you find the current head of
the Trancy house suspicious?

80
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,233
Yes.

81
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,817
My nephew, Alois Trancy,
was kidnapped soon after

82
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,150
his birth under
mysterious circumstances.

83
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,775
Out of despair, my
sister-in-law killed herself.

84
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,025
My brother
searched for his son.

85
00:08:58,108 --> 00:09:00,108
He looked everywhere...

86
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:03,150
And one day,
Alois returned home.

87
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,775
He had a new butler in tow.

88
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,650
But shortly afterwards,
my brother died

89
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,858
of a horrible infection...

90
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:15,442
Alois succeeded him
as the Trancy family head.

91
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:16,692
I see.

92
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,692
And the concern
is there's no proof that

93
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,400
he's Earl Trancy's
legitimate son?

94
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:22,858
That's exactly right...

95
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:25,775
but I know your holy eyes
will see the truth Father...

96
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,192
And you, Lord Druitt, had close
ties to the previous earl.

97
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:32,733
I would like you to uncover
who that child really is.

98
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:33,608
Uncle Arnold!

99
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,442
How good to see you!

100
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:41,692
Yes, Alois.

101
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,233
Oooh...!

102
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,400
But surely, God, thou has made
a most grievous mistake...!

103
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:48,775
Placing such great beauty in
someone so young as this boy?!

104
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,108
Yet I shall persevere...

105
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,942
and forgive thee for this
transgression, Lord...!

106
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,192
Amen.

107
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,942
Erm... uh, well...

108
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,525
Oh, my!

109
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:07,025
It all remains as it
was when Uncle Trancy

110
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:09,108
still lived among us!

111
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,692
The mansion's glittering
gold...! Bringing the legend

112
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:15,483
of Cipangu springs
to life again!

113
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:16,525
Yes...

114
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,817
I haven't changed a thing.

115
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,567
I've preserved it all
since Father's time...

116
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,483
I had to.

117
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:26,525
I couldn't lose the warm essence
of him the mansion contains.

118
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,692
I can tell you
loved him very much.

119
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:38,150
For a very long time,
I lived in a village...

120
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,275
The memory sickens me still.

121
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,858
To this day, I do not
know what it was called.

122
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:47,775
I don't even know how long
I remained there.

123
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:50,025
They worked me like a slave...

124
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,775
They didn't even
let me go outside.

125
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:54,317
You poor boy.

126
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,108
There was one other
child who was treated

127
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,817
in the same way I was...

128
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,067
It sounds silly, but I thought
of him as a younger brother.

129
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,525
And then one night...

130
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,067
one dark night...

131
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,525
What's happening?

132
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:21,483
What is it?

133
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,358
Inside the rippling flames...

134
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,858
the horror of dying screams...

135
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,942
there could only be one thing...

136
00:11:28,025 --> 00:11:28,817
darkness.

137
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,108
There you are!

138
00:11:34,358 --> 00:11:37,233
C'mon wake up.
What's wrong with you?

139
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:38,692
You can't be...

140
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,233
No...

141
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:45,025
Please, no...!

142
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:47,358
Don't leave me alone!

143
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:49,650
Please don't!

144
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:53,900
What happened to
the village that night?

145
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,692
That's something
I may never know...

146
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,025
But...

147
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,692
at least my father came
to take me home, finally!

148
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:02,108
I thought: "At last
I'm not alone...

149
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,567
I have a family to love me!"

150
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,650
Then he...

151
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,192
he left, too.

152
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,692
How terrible for you.

153
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,233
O Lord, I take it back!

154
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,233
I cannot forgive you after all!

155
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:16,150
Come now, Lord Druitt,
Despair is a sin.

156
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,108
Young man, I pledge
to help in any way I can.

157
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:20,275
I pray you find
solace in this world.

158
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:24,150
Thank you very much, Father.

159
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,858
But I know I'll manage.

160
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,733
Because I still have Uncle
Arnold after all, don't I?

161
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:31,942
Yes of course you do.

162
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,858
Uncle Arnold,
if I may say...

163
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:35,483
Yes, what is it boy?

164
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,275
Don't lean your face
so close to mine.

165
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,817
You have disgusting
old man's breath.

166
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:55,192
I can't stand
that damn brat!

167
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:55,942
Wait...!

168
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,858
Come back Uncle Arnold.

169
00:12:57,942 --> 00:13:01,442
I know you only came here
because you want money.

170
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:03,692
So here, you can have this!

171
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,108
I have no use for them.

172
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:07,983
I wouldn't feed a goat
with these moldy old notes.

173
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:10,775
Let's see,
deeds to some land...

174
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,900
Here, and horses, too.

175
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:13,692
Take all.

176
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,400
They're yours!

177
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:21,983
You! Pick all these up.

178
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:25,567
Look at him, Claude, like
a cow learning to dance...!

179
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,608
What a pitiful sight.

180
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,358
Waiting, Claude.

181
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,192
Master?

182
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,233
I want you to laugh, too.

183
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,233
There's a storm coming.

184
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,192
A storm has blown in.

185
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,733
What brings you to
our door at this late hour?

186
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,608
I've been caught outside
in this wicked storm...

187
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:25,900
I was hoping I might trouble
you for lodgings tonight.

188
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,692
Look at you!

189
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,317
You're so filthy...

190
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,525
You look just like
a drowned rat!

191
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,358
But still...

192
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,150
You do smell rather nice...

193
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:39,858
So...

194
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:41,650
What's your name?

195
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,275
This man will be
staying with us.

196
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,067
Understood, Claude?

197
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,567
Try this one...

198
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,067
Claude's cooking
is simply delicious.

199
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,775
Yes...

200
00:14:57,858 --> 00:14:59,692
it tastes quite nice...

201
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:01,400
However...

202
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,525
Please observe the speck of
sauce on the rim of the plate.

203
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:08,525
I assume it would have been
too great an inconvenience

204
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,150
to dab it with a cloth.

205
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,400
My apologies, sir...

206
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:14,525
I'll clear this.

207
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:16,817
I didn't realize a man who
doesn't remove his coat at

208
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,983
the dining table would have
such delicate sensibilities.

209
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:21,442
You flatter me.

210
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,525
Some hot water for you, sir.

211
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:37,442
May I ask why do you wear
a bandage over your eye?

212
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:40,733
It's nothing.

213
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,817
I'm impressed that
you can still work.

214
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:45,650
Hannah.

215
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,275
What are you doing in here...?

216
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:48,275
Tell me.

217
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:49,317
I...

218
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,275
I came to change the water.

219
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:52,858
Oh...?

220
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:56,150
Or perhaps you were seeking pity
by wearing that silly bandage

221
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,275
and acting pathetic
for our guest.

222
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,108
Get out of here now,
you stupid tart!

223
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:13,358
Very sorry...

224
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:14,692
Forgive her, sir.

225
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,275
Are you certain
she'll be all right?

226
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,275
Who knows...?

227
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:18,567
I don't care for her much.

228
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,150
She's such an embarrassment...

229
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,692
What is she thinking?

230
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,150
Well...

231
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,483
For that matter, I suppose
I don't often know

232
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,150
what anyone's thinking...

233
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:29,150
So!

234
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:30,775
What's in that
trunk of yours...?

235
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:31,483
Clothing...?

236
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:32,192
Sweets...?

237
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:33,275
Weaponry?

238
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:35,983
I'm jealous of you...

239
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,442
I bet you travel to all sorts
of fine places, don't you...?

240
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,983
I wish that I could
travel sometime.

241
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,775
This mansion's so dull!

242
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:45,317
It's dull?

243
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,150
But I've been told
something interesting

244
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:50,650
lies under this mansion.

245
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,983
Yes, like what?

246
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,567
We can strike a bargain...

247
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,483
Show it to me, and I'll
show you what's in this trunk.

248
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,150
Just follow me.

249
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:26,650
There...

250
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,858
That's it.

251
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,483
What, this? It's just tea.

252
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,650
It's "New Moon Drop."

253
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,942
People say that tea leaves
plucked at the full moon

254
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,483
give off a clear,
sweet smell...

255
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,650
These are the opposite,
however, having been plucked

256
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,150
at the new moon...

257
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,525
Their indistinct aroma
can bring a mind to total,

258
00:17:49,608 --> 00:17:51,775
bottomless darkness.

259
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:53,025
It has another name...

260
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:56,108
It is called the
"soul's temperature."

261
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:57,317
Not quite yet.

262
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,150
Oh?

263
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,275
No need to get prickly.

264
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:01,108
I promise I'll
show it to you...

265
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:02,358
But one thing first.

266
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:03,358
That's right.

267
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:05,483
First, you'll hand
over that trunk.

268
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,817
Sebastian Michaelis!

269
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:24,817
He's getting away!

270
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,192
Don't kill him!

271
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,858
I want him alive!

272
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,317
Catch him, Claude!

273
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:40,775
Do you value that
trunk above your own life?

274
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:41,983
Pity!

275
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,608
Ciel Phantomhive?

276
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:54,567
I finally have you...!

277
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,608
You're mine!

278
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,275
You're wrong about that.

279
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:01,317
I would never let
the likes of you touch him.

280
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,942
Somebody as vulgar as yourself,
isn't worthy to come anywhere

281
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,567
near this trunk,
nor will you ever be...

282
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,942
Your mere touch
would defile my young master.

283
00:19:09,025 --> 00:19:10,067
What?!

284
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,817
You put your feet on something
that's meant to carry food...?

285
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,692
What kind of butler are you?!

286
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,733
What kind of butler am I?

287
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,067
Why I am simply one--

288
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,358
No...

289
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:24,858
it's not quite
time for that yet.

290
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,775
You flee instead of fighting?

291
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,525
I believe I recall your ways...

292
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:39,942
Turning day into night...

293
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,400
sugar into salt...

294
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,317
navy into golden.

295
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,483
It seems I shall have
to transform golden...

296
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:48,983
Into black!

297
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,775
It's dark...

298
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,858
Claude, I'm scared!

299
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,025
Lights on!

300
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,067
Go after him...!

301
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,192
Quickly!

302
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,317
No, Claude, not you...!

303
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
You can't go!

304
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,692
Master...

305
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,108
Don't leave...

306
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't leave me.

307
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,233
Don't leave me alone...!

308
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:29,608
Please don't leave!

309
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:31,400
You can't leave me
all alone, too...

310
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:32,567
Please, Claude...

311
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,900
Don't go!

312
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,567
Of course, Highness...

313
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:39,275
We're companions.

314
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:41,025
I am not going anywhere.

315
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,067
Day and night...

316
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,817
Sugar and salt...

317
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,317
creature and corpse.

318
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,650
...defiled and immaculate-

319
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,483
No!

320
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,650
I know that other man
was right...

321
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,275
I am only a
brat--foul and vulgar.

322
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,358
You are more than that.

323
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:02,900
You are my master.

324
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:04,108
Oh be quiet...

325
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:05,900
I know you feel the same way.

326
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:08,358
Look at me.

327
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,108
I am still
your loyal servant...

328
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,775
There's no need to convince
me of your worth.

329
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,692
I grow hungrier each day...

330
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,817
You'll make
one hell of a feast.

331
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,525
Just forget about it...!

332
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,692
All of you...

333
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:26,650
You can be swallowed
by the darkness.

334
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,400
Young master.

335
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:58,025
Now...

336
00:23:58,108 --> 00:24:01,608
young master.

337
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,233
It's time to wake up.

338
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:15,025
It's been quite a while
since I've seen you all...

339
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:18,483
Pardon me, but you're
looking at me strangely.

340
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:19,608
Oh...?

341
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,900
Another butler, you say...?

342
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:23,817
I know it's warm outside,
but I never thought

343
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,775
it would affect peoples' minds.

344
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:29,775
I'm sure you agree there
is but one true butler:

345
00:24:29,858 --> 00:24:31,858
Sebastian Michaelis.

346
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:34,233
Next time: "Solo Butler"

347
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:37,025
If I couldn't stop a flood
and catch a giant tuna,

348
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,025
what kind of butler would I be?
