1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,817
At noon you have the
company's regular meeting.

2
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,775
And then at two o'clock,
your dance lesson with

3
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,483
Mrs. Hyatt begins...

4
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:23,358
Followed by your
political studies lesson

5
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:25,233
with Professor Macmillan...

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,150
That's all you have
for today, my lord.

7
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,067
Fine.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,275
One more thing.

9
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,108
We received this.

10
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:42,150
"On behalf of the Count Alois
Trancy, I write this day

11
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,900
to apologize for my master's
discourtesy at the ball

12
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:47,775
the other day and request
your most honored presence

13
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,608
at the ball to be held here
at the Trancy Mansion

14
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:52,733
tomorrow afternoon
at four o'clock."

15
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,108
Alois Trancy...

16
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,067
I will kill you.

17
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,483
Incidents in the English
underworld which most greatly

18
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:08,442
offend the Queen are judged in
darkness by the Phantomhive

19
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:11,733
family, the
"Queen's guard dogs."...

20
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:15,025
They are then erased in
darkness by the Trancy family,

21
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,942
the "Queen's spiders."

22
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,358
Both houses had the
Queen's trust as her

23
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,942
"villainous nobles"...

24
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:27,983
However, that distinction was
not enough for Alois Trancy.

25
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,858
Seeking to monopolize
Her Majesty's favor,

26
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:33,692
Alois spread the rumor that
the Phantomhive guard dog

27
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:35,900
was possessed by a demon.

28
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:38,567
At the time, the previous
head of the Phantomhives

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,858
was investigating a series

30
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:42,608
of mysterious
spontaneous combustions.

31
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:44,692
Alois alleged that the
crimes were the result

32
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:47,400
of Phantomhive's
demonic possession...

33
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:49,317
And so...

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,025
He took it upon himself
to purge them...

35
00:01:52,108 --> 00:01:54,817
...under the guise
of "exorcism."

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,525
Subsequently, Alois and
his butler destroyed

37
00:01:57,608 --> 00:02:00,317
all evidence of
their involvement.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,942
Records indicate that the spider
either erased peoples' pasts

39
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,942
or replaced them
with false ones.

40
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,067
They went to great lengths in
order to cover up their crime.

41
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,692
Yes, I received my orders
from Lord Trancy...

42
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,150
He told me to burn down
the Phantomhive manor...

43
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:20,983
and that I should sell off
the surviving child.

44
00:02:21,067 --> 00:02:23,733
Spare my life, I beg you!

45
00:02:23,817 --> 00:02:26,900
Through your actions,
you have damaged my pride...

46
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,525
and now you'll
atone with your death.

47
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:33,983
Alois...

48
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,983
you were behind it all...

49
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,608
for what you've done
I will kill you, too...

50
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,358
This time you'll
dance to my tune.

51
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:43,608
The "Dance Macabre."

52
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,192
The Dance of Death...

53
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:47,317
Indeed.

54
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,650
At least they have spared us the
trouble of inviting them here.

55
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,192
Let's prepare ourselves,
Sebastian...

56
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,025
It's time to duel.

57
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,525
Very good, master.

58
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:59,317
In that case, allow me to
alter the schedule slightly...

59
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,525
We'll attend the company
meeting as per usual.

60
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,275
I'll have your lessons
with Mrs. Hyatt

61
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,650
and Professor Macmillan
rescheduled for tomorrow,

62
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,192
at the earliest...

63
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,733
Today at four o'clock,
we will attend the ball.

64
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,650
And we shall fight to the death
with the house of Trancy.

65
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,358
Ciel!

66
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,150
I'm so glad you came.

67
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,317
Welcome!

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,275
Good afternoon, Lord Trancy.

69
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:59,567
It's most excellent
to see you, my lord.

70
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,025
Come with me...

71
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:05,442
We're holding a special party
in your honor.

72
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,025
What's this?

73
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,733
It appears to be
a dueling arena.

74
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,942
Here's an idea, Ciel.

75
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,733
Let's have our
butlers do the work.

76
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:16,233
They can dance in our places.

77
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,067
Whoever can keep dancing
the longest will

78
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,525
be declared the winner...

79
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:21,733
And the loser will have
to follow any orders

80
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,233
given by the victor...

81
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:24,483
What do you say, Ciel.

82
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,067
Do we have a deal, then?

83
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,025
We weren't alone in
our thinking, master.

84
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:30,317
It seems they've planned
a death match as well.

85
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,317
This sounds like exactly the
sort of party I had in mind...

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,525
I much prefer it to dressing up
in silly costumes anyway.

87
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,192
Sebastian, this is an order...

88
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:48,317
Win, and bring Alois Trancy
to stand before me.

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,483
But don't kill him.

90
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,067
I will take care
of that matter personally.

91
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,275
Yes indeed...

92
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,608
my young master.

93
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:56,608
Your Highness...

94
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:58,400
what are your orders?

95
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,317
Hmm...?

96
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,025
Ah...

97
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,900
I want you to make
Ciel Phantomhive mine.

98
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:10,567
And I want Sebastian Michaelis
to experience exquisite agony.

99
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,025
You can see to that,
can't you Claude?

100
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:14,983
Oh yes...

101
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,608
Your Highness.

102
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:28,108
We dance.

103
00:06:28,192 --> 00:06:29,775
Be still my beating heart.

104
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,608
C'est tres fantastique!

105
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,942
It's unbelievable...!

106
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,233
An ancient dueling arena
where legendary heroes

107
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:37,192
fought to the death...!

108
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,358
Oh!

109
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,442
This is tonight's ball...?
I am honored...

110
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,650
Never in my life have
I felt such excitement

111
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,150
to receive a party invitation!

112
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,567
Pardon, sir...

113
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,858
Might I inquire what brings you
to the mansion today?

114
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:50,358
Oh yes...

115
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,567
I am pleased to be attending
the Trancy costume ball...

116
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,233
I'm Aleister Chambers,
Viscount Druitt.

117
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:58,275
I'm afraid the costume ball
was last week, sir...

118
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,775
This afternoon's event
is a private affair...

119
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,900
for Earl Phantomhive alone.

120
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,483
Oh, good heavens...!

121
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,400
How could I have
mixed up the dates?

122
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:10,067
I'll just go home then...

123
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,067
But why did no one remark
upon my absence last week...?

124
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,858
Being a criminal really does
lower one's station in society.

125
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,983
A visage as clear as a lake's
surface...! If you but held

126
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,817
a steely-grey knife,
you could be one of

127
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,650
Valhalla's valkaryies...!

128
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,150
But no...!

129
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,192
Your dusky elegance and the
bandages covering your face

130
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:35,608
are better suited to
a beautiful demoness.

131
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,067
How satisfying.

132
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,983
You've proven yourself every
bit as clever as you look.

133
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:41,525
A dagger?

134
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,608
It's part of the
entertainment for the ball.

135
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:46,483
A party filled with blood-lust
and fraught with danger,

136
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,858
how exquisite!

137
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:51,275
I, Druitt, have ever served
the goddess of beauty.

138
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:54,733
I insist upon observing the
afternoon's events for myself.

139
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:58,650
Finally...

140
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,150
the stage is set
for our dance.

141
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:03,900
So begins the Danse Macabre.

142
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,817
Group attack...

143
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,192
Enjoy "The Bloody Washtub!"

144
00:08:07,275 --> 00:08:10,525
A three-pronged attack with a
dagger, a long-range weapon,

145
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,108
and a projectile weapon.

146
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,608
Oh my!

147
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,275
Group attack: transition
from "Bloody Washtub"

148
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:23,067
to "Cursed Vanity Mirror."

149
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,025
And now they all charge as one!

150
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:32,483
Your battle moves are as
well aligned as your faces.

151
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,400
Here you go.

152
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,150
Now you can be
together forever.

153
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:14,733
Oh my!

154
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:15,692
Good show!

155
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,942
Good show!

156
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:21,733
Bother...

157
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,900
Now I'll have to go to
the trouble of mending this.

158
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,400
No need for that.

159
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,817
You'll be full
of holes soon enough.

160
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,733
So much power!

161
00:09:39,817 --> 00:09:41,233
I see what you mean...

162
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,400
This certainly does seem to be
a very holey opportunity.

163
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,650
I shall make every effort
to repay you in kind...

164
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,442
for every last bullet.

165
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:24,775
That will do for now...

166
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,275
It's time for our tea.

167
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,358
My goodness...

168
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:29,400
Has it already gotten so late?

169
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,608
As I'm sure you
understand, I must see

170
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,442
to my master's refreshments.

171
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,108
We'll suspend
the match for now.

172
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:36,358
Of course...

173
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,442
May I make use of
your kitchen as well?

174
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:54,275
Desirable souls.

175
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:03,275
Luscious souls.

176
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:08,692
If souls do very in taste.

177
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,692
Then one, obsessively
pursued by a demon.

178
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:14,233
The soul like that
of Ciel Phantomhive.

179
00:11:15,192 --> 00:11:17,400
Oh, do excuse me.

180
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,317
It's just the way you were
looking at my master

181
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,025
was beginning to concern me.

182
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,942
I had the strangest feeling
that you were assessing

183
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,692
the flavor of his soul.

184
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,608
Make other dinner plans...

185
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:38,275
You won't lay a finger
on my master's soul...

186
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:39,900
Or give him any lip.

187
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,192
Ooh...!

188
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,233
Bravo!

189
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,442
Well, that was just
a whole lot of pointless.

190
00:11:56,942 --> 00:12:00,442
This afternoon we have puits
d'amor, crème pâtissière,

191
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:03,817
and raspberry jam in a
pastry made of pie dough.

192
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:06,942
To accompany, we have
a delicately brewed

193
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,358
Mariage Frères Eros tea.

194
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:18,608
Th...

195
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:19,442
th-th-th...

196
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:20,150
this...

197
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,608
is amazing!

198
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,025
The puits d'amour pairs rich
cream with the tartness

199
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:27,733
of raspberry in a satiny
ensemble so rare it seems

200
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:30,192
like water in the desert.

201
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:31,567
I thirst for more!

202
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,650
Without another taste,
I shall be forever banished

203
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:35,692
to the dusty Sahara
of the palate...

204
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:38,400
I beg you, my intrepid desert
guide, please show me

205
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,192
the path to the oasis!

206
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,358
Here we have a forêt noire...

207
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:46,317
This treat is comprised of
layers of chocolate sponge cake

208
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,275
and cherry compote finished with
a dressing of white cream.

209
00:12:50,358 --> 00:12:53,067
And with it we have a pot of
superfine Keemun tea shipped

210
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,025
in from the Qing Empire.

211
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,025
Fine.

212
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,650
Tr-Tr-Tr-Tr...

213
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,733
tr-tr...

214
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,233
Très bien!

215
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:04,108
This forêt noire combines
the rich aroma of chocolate

216
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:07,067
with the tart scent of cherry.
The flavors surge forth

217
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,400
like ocean waves,
landing on your tongue

218
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:11,067
with an overwhelming splash...

219
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,400
I would follow this taste
around the globe...!

220
00:13:13,483 --> 00:13:16,358
I would happily circumnavigate
the world to explore

221
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:18,192
its every exquisite nuance...

222
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:22,817
Conquistador of afternoon tea,
please show me the way!

223
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,900
Such a dilemma...

224
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:25,858
How can I choose
which is better...?

225
00:13:25,942 --> 00:13:27,108
I can't do it...!

226
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:31,192
I can't do it...! I must
go powder my nose!

227
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:34,858
The water closet
is that way, sir.

228
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:36,608
That man is certifiable.

229
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,317
Now, then...

230
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,692
let us resume.

231
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:46,650
Indeed.

232
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,608
Shall we dance?

233
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,775
Dance we shall...

234
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:51,983
But first...

235
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,150
Are you certain?

236
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,233
All right.

237
00:14:17,192 --> 00:14:18,442
What's he doing?

238
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,817
Goodness, look at that.

239
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,817
The ancient sword Lavateinn and
its curse of eternal darkness.

240
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,692
I never dreamed you
had such a fine article.

241
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:33,942
Naturally.

242
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:35,442
I thought your invitation
to dance deserved

243
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:38,275
a suitably grand response.

244
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:40,150
And now...

245
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,192
the Danse Macabre.

246
00:14:58,442 --> 00:14:59,817
What do you think
of Claude's sword?

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,067
Impressive, eh?

248
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,775
I'll admit it does seem
to be a fine weapon.

249
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,233
Perhaps you could give
me a little tour

250
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,400
of the Trancy manor...

251
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,233
If it isn't any trouble.

252
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:13,150
Do you need the
loo as well...?

253
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,775
I'll show you the way.

254
00:15:17,775 --> 00:15:19,067
Well, master...

255
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,650
I'm disappointed in you for
running off and leaving

256
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,733
the fight to your
butler like this.

257
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,817
I'm disappointed in you
for letting your eyes wander.

258
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:29,942
You know...

259
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,317
Your obsession with that
human's soul is getting you

260
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,733
into trouble...

261
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:36,275
I think it's beginning to dull
your demon instincts.

262
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,733
Oh, dear...

263
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,983
now how did that happen?

264
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,192
Ciel...

265
00:15:47,275 --> 00:15:47,942
What is this?

266
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:49,442
Where are you going?

267
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,817
I've seen enough of
their silly performance.

268
00:15:55,942 --> 00:15:57,983
Alois, Earl Trancy.

269
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,233
You have crossed a line.

270
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,775
You have robbed me
of my pride and have

271
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,442
disgraced and demeaned me.

272
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:05,150
I cannot accept this...

273
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,150
Thus, here and now,
I challenge you to a duel.

274
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:12,733
Oh, so you didn't just
want me to come in here

275
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:14,025
and piss with you?

276
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,650
These are the spider
threads of Trancy House.

277
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,358
They can cut through steel.

278
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:22,650
One careless movement and...

279
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,275
off with your head.

280
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,525
Just what I would
expect of a spider.

281
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,067
That's much better.

282
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,317
I feel quite
marvelously refreshed.

283
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:38,150
I've never actually had the
opportunity to duel before...

284
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:39,192
How do we proceed?

285
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,442
You'll have to tell me.

286
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,442
We stand back to back
and then begin walking

287
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:43,817
at the call of "allez."...

288
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,775
We pivot on the tenth step
and the duel begins.

289
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,900
Simple enough...

290
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:50,733
Sounds fun.

291
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:51,692
Let's do it.

292
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:53,692
Great Scott,
a real, live duel!

293
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,192
Allez...!

294
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:58,525
One...

295
00:16:58,608 --> 00:16:59,817
two...

296
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,942
three...

297
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:01,775
four...

298
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,108
fi--

299
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,483
Now, now, let's not
have any cheating.

300
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:10,358
Why, you!

301
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,858
You always lose
your temper so quickly...

302
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:27,817
Come; let's enjoy our dance!

303
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,650
Here we are,
Sebastian Michaelis.

304
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,983
Young master...

305
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:45,817
That's it...!

306
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,025
One, two, three...

307
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,317
One, two three...

308
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,108
Down you go!

309
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,233
Here we are, Ciel.

310
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,150
You'll finally be mine.

311
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:09,317
Sebastian wants so very
badly to devour your soul.

312
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,817
But he won't get to...

313
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,275
because, you see, I am going
to tear your soul to shreds

314
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,067
and feed it to the
spiders of my mansion...

315
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,317
Poor thing.

316
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,317
I know it's going
to irritate him terribly.

317
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,067
This is going to be
a lot of fun.

318
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,692
The soul of the queen's
guard dog isn't cheap...

319
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,650
A trifling little spider
like you could never

320
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,650
afford a taste...

321
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,775
But if you don't mind
having your legs ripped off,

322
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,025
then by all means, try it.

323
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:37,358
I see you still have enough
energy to be cheeky.

324
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:39,525
It's useless to keep
struggling...

325
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:41,567
Just give up and submit to me!

326
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:45,275
Submit?

327
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,692
I'm the one who has you.

328
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:51,567
Master!

329
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,733
How horrific!

330
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:15,275
Please, help me Claude!.

331
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:15,858
Help me!

332
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm dying!

333
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:17,900
Yes...

334
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:20,233
--Your High--
--Hold, Sebastian.

335
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,233
Until I've killed him,
stay back!

336
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:25,233
Very good, my young lord.

337
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:28,108
Die...

338
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:29,608
Alois Trancy.

339
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:30,900
Wait, please...!

340
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:32,942
I don't want to die...

341
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:34,233
It hurts...

342
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,108
please spare me, Ciel.

343
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,567
You're truly pathetic, Alois...

344
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,192
You killed my parents, and
you want me to spare you?!

345
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:41,817
Wait!

346
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,567
No, listen to me!

347
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,983
You don't understand...

348
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,692
You're being
tricked by a demon!

349
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,650
I'm telling you, believe me!

350
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:48,733
A demon?

351
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,442
My parents were
killed too, you know...

352
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:54,983
My family was burned to death
along with the whole village...

353
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:57,733
Someone stole them from me!

354
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:00,900
Can't you see that we're
basically the same...?

355
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,108
I promise, I won't
bother you anymore.

356
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,108
I'll apologize for everything...

357
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,525
Just please...

358
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:08,150
please spare me.

359
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,442
Please let me live!

360
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:19,983
Through your actions you
have damaged my pride...

361
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:22,275
and now you'll
atone with your death.

362
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,317
Please hurry, Claude.

363
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Help me!

364
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:28,858
You saved me!

365
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,483
Let go, bastard!

366
00:20:31,983 --> 00:20:33,275
Young master!

367
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,192
It's not over...!

368
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:49,442
I'll kill you!

369
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,317
Given the current circumstances,
I'm afraid I can't allow

370
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,108
this dance to continue...

371
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:58,733
Terribly sorry, but I believe
we'll have to excuse ourselves

372
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:01,317
for the remainder of the day.

373
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,858
Do you hear me, Claude?

374
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,567
Oh yes, of course...

375
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,317
I understand...

376
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,108
Another time, then.

377
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,442
Master, I suggest
we be on our way.

378
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:14,108
Now, first you run off...

379
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,025
Then you get yourself hurt...

380
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,358
I'm positively at
my wit's end with you, my lord.

381
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,608
Do you really hate
dancing that much?

382
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,983
Put me down, Sebastian!

383
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:25,442
Honestly now sir, how can you
possibly have the energy to

384
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:29,567
throw a temper tantrum like this
after losing all that blood?

385
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,317
It's the day of
a ball, after all...

386
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,358
Come now...

387
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:35,900
We'll dance our way,
into the sunset.

388
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:45,442
What happens when a soul is
obsessively pursued by a demon?

389
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:46,858
Claude...

390
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,442
what are you looking at?

391
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:49,650
Come on, do something!

392
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,942
Can't you see I've been
stabbed...? Quickly!

393
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,817
Help me, please!

394
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,817
He traded his soul for
a demon's power...

395
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,483
yet revenge only means
something to him if he wins

396
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:02,608
it with his own hand.

397
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:05,900
He knows blood and
death and darkness...

398
00:22:05,983 --> 00:22:08,233
but still, his soul is pure...

399
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:09,858
untainted...

400
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,025
immaculate.

401
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:12,858
What is it, Claude?

402
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,525
Day into night...

403
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:16,608
pleasure into pain...

404
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,067
this chance encounter...

405
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,733
into ecstasy.

406
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:23,775
Hoheo taralna, rondero tarel!

407
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:26,692
Hoheo taralna,
rondero tarel...!

408
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:28,817
Hoheo taralna, ron--

409
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:39,275
You look like you're staring at
maggots swarming on a pile of--

410
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,858
Introducing Jim Macken...

411
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:16,733
A grubby little urchin
with blond ringlets...

412
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:18,983
angelic hair in
such contradiction

413
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,067
to his lowly soul...

414
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,025
He found a new
name for himself...

415
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:25,733
Now meet Alois Trancy.

416
00:24:25,817 --> 00:24:30,317
Next time: "Divulging Butler" If
I couldn't whisper a few words

417
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,775
of love here and there...

418
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,150
well...

419
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,608
what kind of
a butler would I be?
