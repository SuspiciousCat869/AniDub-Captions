1
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,358
I can hear water running.

2
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:25,567
Light hits my eyelids...

3
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,567
I can feel it...

4
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,192
summer sunshine.

5
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:36,900
Where is this...?

6
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:40,025
Am I dreaming it?

7
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,900
The reflection
you see is no dream...

8
00:00:42,983 --> 00:00:44,817
It's the next chapter...

9
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,275
A golden afternoon.

10
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:49,733
And if I opened my eyes...?

11
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,608
What would I see
when I woke up?

12
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:57,900
It's time, my lord...

13
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,817
Open your eyes.

14
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:03,400
Sebastian...

15
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:07,650
You were sleeping very soundly.

16
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:22,692
Well, master...

17
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:25,358
we have very nearly arrived.

18
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,525
Now there is work to be done.

19
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:08,483
This area has been plagued
by floods for many years...

20
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:11,317
It is my hope that the addition
of new floodgates will restore

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,775
Phantomhive lands
to peace and safety...

22
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,317
Additionally...

23
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,317
I would like to thank all of
you for your continued support

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,150
in this grand endeavor.

25
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,983
I shall commit myself to
the task of flood prevention,

26
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,483
as my family has for
generations before me

27
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:26,983
in the hope of bettering
all our lives.

28
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:47,900
If you ask me, the earl's
speech was positively shameless.

29
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:49,692
Oh yes, And from what
I've been hearing,

30
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,317
that company of his
is making more money

31
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,108
than he knows
what to do with...

32
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:55,317
They're saying that...

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,358
That much...!

34
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:57,858
How indecent!

35
00:03:57,942 --> 00:04:00,150
I certainly hope the child
doesn't allow his vanity

36
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,233
to get him into
too much trouble.

37
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:04,900
I'd wager there is a man or two
who might wish differently

38
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:05,942
for the young lord.

39
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:06,692
Do tell.

40
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:08,192
Who might that be?

41
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,942
I would appreciate
any wisdom you can offer

42
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,900
from your vast experience.

43
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:15,150
Oh, not at all.

44
00:04:15,233 --> 00:04:17,067
I'm sure there's nothing
we three could possibly

45
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,192
hope to teach you!

46
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,400
Er... Heavens no!

47
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,483
And... by the way, my lord...

48
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:24,525
I recently caught wind
of a grand opportunity...

49
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:25,317
If you will...

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,525
Pardon us...

51
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,483
I'm afraid my master
has another engagement.

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,900
What tiresome people.

53
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:38,983
Ciel!

54
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,108
Elizabeth!

55
00:04:41,192 --> 00:04:42,442
I'm so very excited...!

56
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:44,317
Look at this, Ciel!

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,025
Whatever it is,
I can't see like this.

58
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,358
It's a deer.

59
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,692
A deer?

60
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:53,775
There's an elusive deer
living on a hill near here...

61
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:55,942
It's ever so rare!

62
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,692
Oh is it now.

63
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:02,358
A cute white stag
that makes people happy!

64
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,192
I've never heard of
such a thing.

65
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,900
There is a legend.

66
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:09,942
The elusive white stag of which
you speak is traditionally

67
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,608
considered a messenger
of the netherworld...

68
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:14,775
Those who receive his
message are supposedly

69
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,733
blessed with good
fortune and happiness.

70
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,608
Exactly...!

71
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,567
You know everything don't you!

72
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,858
Why thank you, my lady.

73
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,817
It nothing but
a stupid fairy tale.

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,233
No, I know it's true...!

75
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,983
There are witnesses
and everything!

76
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,108
Please, Ciel...!

77
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,567
Let's go and look for it!

78
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,650
Not today...

79
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,317
I'm too busy for this.

80
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,025
Not fair!

81
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:40,900
Elizabeth, please!

82
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:43,567
I say. It's terrible manners
to make your fiancée cry.

83
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,525
So do you think they're engaged
or only playing 'house'?

84
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,400
This could mean my
youngest niece still has

85
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:49,942
a chance with the earl.

86
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,150
Sebastian...

87
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,608
prepare a boat to sail.

88
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:53,858
Of course.

89
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,358
Lady Elizabeth.

90
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,900
There is another
floodgate downstream

91
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,067
that I'd like to inspect...

92
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,942
Perhaps you would favor me
with your gracious company?

93
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,067
I am told that
a legendary white stag lives

94
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,775
in this part of the country...

95
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,233
Have you heard tell of it?

96
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,025
Yes...

97
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,108
I have!

98
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,317
I'd like to come
with you very much.

99
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:29,567
Have you decided
upon one, my lady?

100
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,317
A simplistic style would be
best for boating...

101
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,608
but that one's just adorable...!
And I do love those frills...!

102
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:38,858
It's not fair...!

103
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:39,900
I don't want to choose!

104
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,108
I wish I could
wear both at once!

105
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,108
Please, lady, take all the
time you'd like to decide.

106
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,567
Yes miss!

107
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,650
I thought you'd planned
to head home, master.

108
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,275
Plans do change.

109
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,817
What this is my duty,
and I will see to it.

110
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,150
Managing the river...

111
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,567
participating in
dull socializing...

112
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,692
and keeping my
betrothed happy...

113
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:06,442
It is all my duty as the
head of house Phantomhive.

114
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:07,650
Besides which...

115
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,317
I can't let those nobles
underestimate me.

116
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,025
I'll go see to
the boat, master.

117
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:27,608
Oh...!

118
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:28,983
Lovely!

119
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
Oi, Sebastian...

120
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:34,400
how come they're all
gawking over there...?

121
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:36,025
It's not a bloody circus.

122
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:39,733
They're trying to find fault
with our young master...

123
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:42,442
He does have impressive number
of social enemies.

124
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,192
Enemies?

125
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,233
Dear! But why?

126
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,400
Many are looking for
personal gain...

127
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:49,525
For instance, if the lord's
engagement should break off...

128
00:07:49,608 --> 00:07:51,942
Not a break-up?!

129
00:07:52,025 --> 00:07:52,817
Now...

130
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,525
all of you behave yourselves.

131
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,692
Try not to come up with
any crackpot schemes.

132
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:58,150
Yes sir!

133
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,358
They mustn't break up!

134
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,483
Lady Elizabeth's the
only one for the master!

135
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,692
So we've got to help him
hold on to her!

136
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:07,483
Right...

137
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,817
let's take care of it...

138
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,067
We'll do anything
we can, agreed?

139
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,108
Hip, hip, hurrah!

140
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,400
Look...!

141
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,067
I saw something over there!

142
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:29,692
Here we go!

143
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,192
Yes, sir!

144
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,067
Drat...!

145
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,192
I was certain the stag
was somewhere over in

146
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,608
this direction.

147
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,233
I found a stag!

148
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,483
Look, I got 'im, uh-huh!

149
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,775
Here we go!

150
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:49,483
Surely you're joking.

151
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,525
Those look like
deer to you lot?

152
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:57,942
Enjoy your brief peace, Ciel...

153
00:08:58,025 --> 00:09:00,317
for, it is a transient
thing that, once lost,

154
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
one can never hope to regain.

155
00:09:05,775 --> 00:09:07,483
Ciel Phantomhive...

156
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,650
Your die has been cast.

157
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:10,733
So...

158
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,733
where will you place your bet?

159
00:09:15,358 --> 00:09:16,692
The current odds:...

160
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,150
six to one Lady Elizabeth
will find what she seeks;

161
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,150
four to one the
search will fail.

162
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:23,483
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen!

163
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,525
You heard him.

164
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,650
Bet on the long odds.

165
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:31,317
Step up and take a risk.

166
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,358
It's one-oh-eight to one
on the engagement ending.

167
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:36,942
So come right on up here
and place your bets!

168
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:37,983
What is he doing...?

169
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,983
Idiot.

170
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:43,358
And I had so hoped we'd be able
to find the stag by lunchtime.

171
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:46,192
If it wasn't hard to find, it
wouldn't be elusive, would it?

172
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,233
Yes.

173
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:48,608
I suppose you're
right about that...

174
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:50,150
Well...

175
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,317
we'll just have to eat lunch
and then go back to searching.

176
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,775
What do we have on
the menu today, Sebastian?

177
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,150
We have a delightful picnic
luncheon prepared...

178
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,900
There will be a shrimp salad
as well as a salmon pie...

179
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:02,858
and Cheshire cheese sandwiches
to round out the meal.

180
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:05,317
Say...

181
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,233
did anybody else hear
a strange noise?

182
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,025
Sincere apologies...

183
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,692
There seems to have been
an ever so slight mistake.

184
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:13,983
What is it, Sebastian...

185
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,400
That isn't like you.

186
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,192
Honestly...!

187
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:23,942
What blasted game
are you playing?

188
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,983
One moment more
please, my lord.

189
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,400
Things become even more
interesting when the butler

190
00:10:29,483 --> 00:10:31,567
makes an unprecedented mistake.

191
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,192
Will their engagement be broken?

192
00:10:33,275 --> 00:10:34,400
Will their passion fade?

193
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:35,650
Odds are sixty-to-one.

194
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,358
Place your bets now!

195
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:40,775
First off, the ingredients
have to be fresh...!

196
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,733
Catch it, trim it,
and eat it...

197
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,233
A premade pie is inexcusable.

198
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:48,067
And the pigeons I caught, we'll
be able to use them too, right?

199
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,317
Oh, we will...!

200
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,067
We just lightly roast
them with this beauty,

201
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,483
and the little lady's
sure to be all smiles!

202
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:56,525
Sebas--

203
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:57,275
--tian!

204
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,900
That hurt!

205
00:10:58,983 --> 00:10:59,942
Good gracious...

206
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,817
How many times
must I remind you?

207
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:06,567
I specifically said...

208
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,275
...that you were to behave.

209
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,358
Do I make myself clear?!

210
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:20,358
Oi...

211
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,358
downright impressive...

212
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:22,692
As ever.

213
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,942
If I couldn't make a simple
dish such as this...

214
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,900
well, then what kind
of butler would I be?

215
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:30,733
May I present fish and lobster
soufflé with roast pigeon

216
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,900
in the style of the Pyrenees.

217
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,775
It's so lovely...!

218
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,233
One moment though.

219
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,567
Isn't this different than
the menu you listed before?

220
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,442
I made some alterations to
showcase the local ingredients,

221
00:11:41,525 --> 00:11:43,192
my lady.

222
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:44,900
It looks so cute!

223
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:47,067
Indeed...!

224
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,817
Well done...!

225
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,608
Quite a feast...!

226
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:49,650
Cheers...!

227
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,067
Any young lady
would be delighted!

228
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,983
Step on up and place those
bets before it's too late.

229
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,483
A parfait with
fresh raspberries.

230
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:01,650
It's delicious!

231
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,400
The cream came straight
from a Jersey cow, my lady...

232
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:08,233
Thus it possesses a simple,
yet incomparably light taste.

233
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,317
I expect a lot from you,
but I never would have thought:

234
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,567
dairy farmer...

235
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,817
The image alone is enough
to make me smile.

236
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,150
Quite so, lord...

237
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:18,858
It is rather unusual...

238
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:20,733
There are few masters who
would ask their butler

239
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,567
to do such a thing.

240
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,775
Aww...!

241
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:26,025
The two of you make
simply adorable friends!

242
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:26,692
Wha...?!

243
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,275
He is not my frie--

244
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,567
The stag is nowhere
to be found...!

245
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,317
How positively bothersome!

246
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,942
Turn back?

247
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:42,942
No! Not yet!

248
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,192
All right.

249
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,192
It's peaceful...

250
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,733
serene...

251
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,233
quiet...

252
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:57,400
So why am I unsettled?

253
00:12:57,483 --> 00:12:58,817
What's the matter Ciel?

254
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,358
Nothing at all, lady.

255
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:01,983
Are you certain?

256
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:05,900
A bit further...

257
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,400
We'll find it!

258
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,108
The clouds grow
heavy with rain.

259
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:22,567
The skies part...

260
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,483
It looks as though Lady
Elizabeth will not find

261
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,108
what she seeks here today...

262
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:29,150
The betrothal seems
uncertain indeed...

263
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,817
Our current odds are...

264
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,108
Well, Ran-Mao,
Aren't you bold today...

265
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,900
You really believe they'll find
the mythical stag, do you...?

266
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:40,233
Ah, well.

267
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:42,525
I do love an exciting game.

268
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,775
Elizabeth...

269
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,775
You really ought to wait.

270
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:49,692
I just saw it!

271
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:50,942
Over there in the woods.

272
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:53,483
Even the stag
will seek shelter...

273
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:54,692
Let's go back.

274
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:55,525
No...!

275
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:57,067
I'm going to find it, Ciel!

276
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,525
Aren't you being
a bit unreasonable...?

277
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:02,483
We can look for it
whenever we like.

278
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,108
Better yet, we can hire people
and offer a reward...

279
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,275
But for now...

280
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:07,692
Do you know...

281
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,817
you're a complete...

282
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,025
A complete idiot!!

283
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,733
That's what you truly think?

284
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:16,817
What does it matter
what I think...?

285
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,275
You wouldn't understand what I'm
feeling anyway...! Never mind!

286
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,942
Elizabeth!

287
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:24,192
Aww...

288
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,233
You've gone and
made the Lady angry.

289
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:28,358
Does this mean it's over?

290
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,692
Lau!

291
00:14:29,775 --> 00:14:32,192
And here I bet on you
finding that white stag...

292
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:34,150
Do you insist on
disappointing me?

293
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,317
Why should I care about you?

294
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,025
"A true gentleman is charged
with pleasing his lady,"...

295
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:41,817
yes?

296
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,567
Being an English nobleman
must be such a bother.

297
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,775
I was born one.

298
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:47,692
It doesn't bother me
in the least.

299
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,400
But still...

300
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:52,858
my past...

301
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:56,067
I was born into
a disgraced family...

302
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,733
I have a duty.

303
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:00,942
All right, then...!

304
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,483
I've collected all my money.

305
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,192
We'll be going now.

306
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,067
We're headed after
Elizabeth, Sebastian.

307
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,025
Sebastian!

308
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:12,067
Yes, what is it now?

309
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:15,608
Lady Elizabeth's in trouble.

310
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:17,025
We have to help her!

311
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:37,317
Lady Elizabeth!

312
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,358
'old on tight, me lady!

313
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,067
No...!

314
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,317
You can't do that...!

315
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,858
Pull too hard and she'll
capsize, yes she will!

316
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,775
Elizabeth!

317
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:49,608
You came for me!

318
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:58,275
I saw the stag...

319
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,858
on the other side o--

320
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,525
Careful...!

321
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,233
Please, just don't let go!

322
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:05,775
I'm going to find it...

323
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,150
I am!

324
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,983
I'll find the stag.

325
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,567
Oh, Elizabeth...

326
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,858
why must you?

327
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:19,983
Whatever I have to do,
you will find happiness!

328
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,192
Master...

329
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,608
what shall we do?

330
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,067
She won't last long
like that...

331
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,858
Just look there.

332
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:32,900
An old-fashioned floodgate...

333
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:35,025
One my Master had
fully intended to begin

334
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:36,567
rebuilding next month.

335
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,025
It's sprung a leak...

336
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:40,317
When it bursts, the water
it's barely holding back now

337
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,067
will flow upstream, and this
whole area will be washed away.

338
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,858
Sebastian.

339
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,692
This is an order.

340
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,358
Stop it from flooding!

341
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:58,442
And Lady Elizabeth?

342
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:00,150
What would you have
me do about her?

343
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:02,150
Do I need to repeat myself...?

344
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:04,817
I'll protect Elizabeth.

345
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,983
That is my duty to do.

346
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,358
Yes...

347
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:10,900
my young lord.

348
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,900
Sebastian, what are you doing?!

349
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,317
I will protect you...

350
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,025
No matter what.

351
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,192
I have you!

352
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:21,650
Master.

353
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,817
It's good to see that
your with us...

354
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
my lord.

355
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,358
Ciel!

356
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:33,983
I'm sorry!

357
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,400
I'm so, so sorry!

358
00:18:35,483 --> 00:18:36,733
Hurrah!

359
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:37,942
I shouldn't have done that!

360
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,442
Please look at me.

361
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,775
I'm glad you're all right.

362
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:44,858
And you as well...

363
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:47,025
I'm glad you're alright.

364
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:50,108
Sebastian...!

365
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,442
Why in the hell did
you open the gate...?!

366
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:54,483
I ordered you to stop
the flood, didn't I?

367
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,483
Yes you did...

368
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,192
and I followed your order.

369
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,525
Are you joking?

370
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:01,483
I doubt we need to worry
about a flood here now...

371
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,067
Or in the future.

372
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:07,192
In order to restore the
proper flow of the river,...

373
00:19:07,275 --> 00:19:09,275
the dammed-up water
had to be released.

374
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,733
I guided the current
as necessary with

375
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,650
a bit of help
from the others...

376
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,692
Together we were able
to alter the river's course...

377
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:21,483
We showed it its way...

378
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,358
its rightful form.

379
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,733
"Rightful form?"

380
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:27,858
Yes...

381
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,275
How it flowed thousands
of years ago...

382
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,192
when the white stags
could still be found here.

383
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:34,192
Really...?

384
00:19:34,275 --> 00:19:36,108
But we didn't find
a stag, did we?

385
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,067
Don't worry...

386
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,358
I'm sure we'll find it someday.

387
00:19:39,442 --> 00:19:41,108
If you're still
looking for it...

388
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,650
It's right over there.

389
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,942
Is that really it?

390
00:19:50,025 --> 00:19:51,983
A white stag!

391
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,275
It's a hill figure.

392
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:57,233
Yeah, whas' that then?

393
00:19:57,317 --> 00:20:00,192
An ancient geoglyph cut into
the chalky rock of a hill...

394
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,025
The torrent earlier washed away
the surface of that hill...

395
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:07,483
revealing the art
hidden underneath.

396
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:10,108
This is the actuality
behind the legend.

397
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,025
It's amazing, Sebastian!

398
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:14,483
If I couldn't find
the legendary stag...

399
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:15,525
what kind of butler would I--

400
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:16,775
"The river does not change...

401
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:18,817
and yet you cannot step
in the same river twice,

402
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,067
for it is always flowing.

403
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,525
So it is with the
dwellings of man."

404
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,525
Tanaka!

405
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,025
It's been so long!
Where were you?

406
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,650
D-Don't tell me--

407
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,275
You were in there?!

408
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:31,400
With no one tending it,
the glyph became unimportant...

409
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:35,400
It withered and was eventually
forgotten as the years passed.

410
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:36,317
But now...

411
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,442
we've found it...

412
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:38,317
There it is...

413
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,442
back again...

414
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:41,317
How can I ever thank you, Ciel?

415
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,525
Why me...?

416
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,692
You were the one who
was looking for it.

417
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:45,608
One more thing...

418
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:46,817
Tell me...

419
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,317
was it fun?

420
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,317
I had fun...

421
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,817
It was a bit scary...

422
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,317
but it was a great day...

423
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,025
because I spent it with you.

424
00:20:55,108 --> 00:20:56,025
It's just...

425
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:57,358
well, your work...

426
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,150
You're always running
off to do something

427
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:00,858
or other for her majesty...

428
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,150
and then...

429
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:04,650
when you come back
you always look so upset...

430
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,900
and that's why...

431
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,650
They say that people
who see white stag

432
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,983
are granted happiness for
the rest of their lives.

433
00:21:12,067 --> 00:21:13,150
I want that for you.

434
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,067
Lizzie...

435
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,608
At last, you called me that!

436
00:21:18,692 --> 00:21:20,775
I want you to
remember this sight...

437
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,900
for the rest of your life.

438
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,483
Thank you...

439
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,775
Lizzie.

440
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:32,108
Congratulations...!

441
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:33,275
Oh Congratulations...!

442
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,358
Yes Congratulations!

443
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:37,525
And thank you!

444
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,358
Not this again.

445
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,067
Indeed...

446
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,608
That's not all...

447
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,317
Invitations and interviews,
my young lord...

448
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,692
You're quite popular...

449
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,817
It appears that the social
crowd can't seem to get

450
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,733
enough of you since
your day at the river.

451
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,400
What a bother.

452
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:37,525
It is a regrettable
necessity that you treat

453
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:41,442
these people well and
build connections, sir.

454
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:44,442
It'll be a novel experience
for our private customers...

455
00:23:44,525 --> 00:23:46,567
You could parley this
opportunity to expand into

456
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,525
the travel business
if you like.

457
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,483
Whatever.

458
00:24:06,567 --> 00:24:09,025
rightful form eh...

459
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:10,483
Yes.

460
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,483
I believe I just spotted
a flash of red...

461
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,358
Ugh...

462
00:24:15,442 --> 00:24:17,817
I have this hideous foreboding.

463
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,067
Ah...

464
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,025
You have not seen this
before, young master?

465
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:24,567
If you should find yourself
cornered, never fear...

466
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,150
Simply maintain eye contact,
back away, and call out

467
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,358
"Oh dear, have you
gained weight?"

468
00:24:31,442 --> 00:24:33,733
Next time: "Wench Butler"

469
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:36,733
If I couldn't provide an
accurate image for my master,

470
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:38,817
what kind of butler would I be?
