1
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:18,650
The year 2008 saw the release of
the now legendary Black Butler.

2
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,942
The show whipped
audiences into a frenzy.

3
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:45,358
Black Butler was an
unqualified success...

4
00:02:45,442 --> 00:02:47,108
Its dazzling characters...

5
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:48,733
stylish visuals...

6
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:52,442
and impressive action scenes,
combined with the beautiful

7
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:57,108
cruelty of its storyline
enchanted fans worldwide...

8
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:01,442
Its universal appeal resulted
in a global phenomenon.

9
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:09,608
Black Butler.

10
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,275
Black Butler.

11
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,025
Black Butler.

12
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:20,608
Black Butler.

13
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:26,233
I'm home...!

14
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,233
Mom, Mom I'm hungry!

15
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:32,650
Nagayama-en proudly presents
"Black Butler Rice Seasoning."

16
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,733
Young master,...

17
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,733
we also have a curry flavor.

18
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:45,192
And now...

19
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,025
in 2010...

20
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:50,692
the long wait is finally over.

21
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:53,275
The legend is reborn!

22
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,608
The epic story continues
when Black Butler II

23
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,733
is at last released
to the public.

24
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:04,067
I am Bardroy, in this program,
I shall be your guide

25
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,233
behind the scenes.

26
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:43,150
You know, I had no
interest in a sequel.

27
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,942
Why do the same
thing over again...?

28
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,608
It sounded redundant to me.

29
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,733
Yes, that's correct,
Master wasn't terribly keen

30
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:51,317
on the idea at first...

31
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,525
He believes sequels are no more
than recycled material...

32
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:56,275
and hardly worth making.

33
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:58,442
I only met with the studio
because it seemed rude

34
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:01,400
to turn them down
before hearing them out.

35
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:02,900
However...

36
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,317
When I got there, I found they
already had scripts ready.

37
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,525
They insisted that if I read
through them and still

38
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,192
was not interested,
they would concede defeat.

39
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,067
The producers waited anxiously.

40
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,233
I decided the story had
creative merit after all...

41
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:27,608
I guess it spoke to me.

42
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:28,900
My opinion?

43
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:30,858
I have none, sir.

44
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,150
I abide by my
master's decisions...

45
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:36,692
You see, I am simply
one hell of a butler.

46
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,442
And so the main characters
were on board...

47
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,650
However, the cast
was not yet complete...

48
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,692
There were still
others to be summoned...

49
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,858
the gifted supporting
characters without whom

50
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:48,442
the first series could
not have been created.

51
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Hi everybodyyyyyyyy...!

52
00:05:54,983 --> 00:05:56,608
Been awhile, hasn't it?

53
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:57,442
Excited?

54
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:58,358
Goodness, yes!

55
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,192
We're so happy to be back!

56
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:04,192
W...

57
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:04,650
W...

58
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:05,775
W...

59
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:08,900
Wonderful...! It's
simply marvelous...!

60
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:09,942
Black Butler...

61
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:13,650
part two...!
Now, to celebrate...

62
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:14,692
Let us toast...

63
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,525
To a television legend.

64
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:20,733
The idea of a sequel
seemed rather far-fetched...

65
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:21,567
Am I Right...?

66
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,067
Ran-Mao?

67
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,233
What with the
original ending, and all.

68
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,942
Actually, I suspect that is
precisely why they decided

69
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:29,983
to make a sequel.

70
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:30,650
Oh?

71
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,067
What do you mean?

72
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,650
Modern audiences are notoriously
difficult to impress...

73
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,900
I think developing a story
from an ending like that

74
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:38,483
will show true artistry.

75
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,733
I'm most interested to see how
they're going to bring it off.

76
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,692
Oh, me too...!

77
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,025
It's ever so exciting.

78
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,025
So...

79
00:06:45,108 --> 00:06:46,358
how did the first
series end, anyway?

80
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,567
Yea, I didn't bother to watch
any of the bits I wasn't in,

81
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,817
you know.

82
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,983
Some people never change.

83
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:03,858
Yes, of course
we're doing the sequel!

84
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:05,858
Ciel has been like
a younger brother to me...

85
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,567
I have to look
after him, you know.

86
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,900
With Agni's help.

87
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:10,692
Jo... ajna...!

88
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,942
We haven't shot any scenes
together with Ciel, yet...

89
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,317
but like my prince,
I look forward to

90
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,525
seeing our friend again.

91
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,150
No cameras, please!

92
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,358
I haven't been to make-up!

93
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,942
You can't film me yet!

94
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,108
And of course, the new storyline
wouldn't be complete without

95
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,817
a new villain or two.

96
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,983
Ciel and Sebastian will be
foiled by these gentlemen,

97
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,567
another master butler pair.

98
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes...

99
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:19,858
I'd seen the first series...

100
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,067
In the sequel, the boy I'm
playing has it in for Ciel.

101
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,567
Or maybe it's Sebastian,
I don't really know.

102
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm going to crush
that brat Ciel like

103
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,692
the wriggling maggot he is...

104
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,525
I do hope you enjoy it!

105
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:40,525
Tart...

106
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:43,483
I'd never heard of the show.

107
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,900
No, never...

108
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,067
It isn't really my bag.

109
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,067
Why should it matter...?

110
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,067
I'm only in it for the brass.

111
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,942
Good day, there...

112
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,192
My name's Thompson.

113
00:08:58,067 --> 00:08:59,150
I'm Timber.

114
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,858
And my name is Canterbury.

115
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:05,817
Impressive, eh...? They're
three distinct characters.

116
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,692
But there's only
one yours truely...

117
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,233
I've got three roles...

118
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,108
and my pay is only
for one of them...!

119
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:12,608
It's rather unfair.

120
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:16,650
What's that?

121
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,358
So, after an
interview, are you...?

122
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:19,275
Well...

123
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,983
can you give me
just a moment?

124
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:24,650
One...

125
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,108
two...

126
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:32,900
One...

127
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:33,525
two...

128
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:34,650
three...

129
00:09:58,442 --> 00:09:59,900
With all the
actors gathered...

130
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,525
the filming begins.

131
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,567
Well...

132
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,858
We're starting,
is everyone ready?

133
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,650
First on set we need the actors
playing Ciel Phantomhive

134
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,192
and Sebastian Michaelis.

135
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,317
We're starting with
your scenes, gentlemen...

136
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,358
Let's go!

137
00:10:27,442 --> 00:10:28,608
Hey welcome back!

138
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:30,150
Good to see you!

139
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,733
The first series was good,
this one will be better...

140
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:41,650
all right.

141
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:43,192
Well said.

142
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:49,400
I thought it was you.

143
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,942
I've been simply
dying to see you...

144
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,400
sweet Bassy!

145
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:55,733
So, Grell...

146
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,608
You've been pulling the
strings behind the scenes.

147
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:00,150
I've pulled nothing more
than the red strings of fate

148
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,733
that connect our hearts
together, Bassy!

149
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,775
This isn't the
blocking we discussed.

150
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,900
A clever lifting device,
but it does chafe a bit.

151
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:30,317
Rolling!

152
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,817
And, action!

153
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,900
You had best stay
away from my Bassy.

154
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:53,817
Or...

155
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,525
I'll have to use
my Death Scythe!

156
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,525
And, cut!

157
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:02,442
Give me a break...

158
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:03,650
that was gold.

159
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:05,733
Heavens, no.

160
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:06,942
It was absolute rubbish...

161
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:08,692
Let's try changing
the order up...

162
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,150
We'll have Claude come in
from the right before you.

163
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,275
You were excellent
in that scene, Hannah.

164
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,525
Whatever.

165
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,858
We had onscreen roles
in the first series,

166
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:22,233
but we're primarily
action directors...

167
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,858
I direct the men
for fight scenes.

168
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,067
And I do the same for
the women, when necessary.

169
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:29,275
I'm also Sebastian's
stunt double for the more

170
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:31,650
dangerous scenes in the show.

171
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,900
Likewise, I double
for Grell and Hannah.

172
00:12:33,983 --> 00:12:37,442
Of course, I handle the majority
of my stunts without a double.

173
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:40,525
Well, even if that is
the Phantomfive---...

174
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:41,608
I'm sorry...

175
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,358
Can you give me another go.

176
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:45,400
Even if that is the Funtom---

177
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:47,400
Even if that is the Hanto--

178
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:48,692
-the Shant---

179
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:52,483
Get it together,
you bloody amateur.

180
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:53,983
Dumb but well-meaning...

181
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,983
It's as if the part
was created for him.

182
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,192
He'll do perfectly.

183
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,025
Deep breaths...

184
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,192
Try to remain calm.

185
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,483
Phantomhive...!

186
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:01,858
Phantomhive...!

187
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:03,567
Phantomhive...!

188
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,817
Right!

189
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Well, even if that
is the Phantomhive way

190
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:07,817
of doing things...

191
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,108
I will still stand by Ciel.

192
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:14,317
Oh, pardon me.

193
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,567
Dreadfully sorry.

194
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,442
Well...

195
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:17,942
On to take six then, I guess.

196
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,442
So far, filming has gone well.

197
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,775
Everything seems to be
coming together neatly,

198
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:24,275
and spirits are high.

199
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,608
But complacency
is a dangerous thing.

200
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,442
One never knows when
disaster might be lurking.

201
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,025
An accident could
happen at any moment.

202
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:44,233
No...! The entire set has been
washed away by a fierce storm.

203
00:13:44,317 --> 00:13:45,775
What a tragedy!

204
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,233
Humans are fleeting
and insubstantial...

205
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:51,442
Mother Nature
will always triumph!

206
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,317
Our dreams have
been buried in water

207
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,358
like the legendary Atlantis.

208
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:56,858
I propose a toast...

209
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:58,358
To the cancellation
of filming...

210
00:13:58,442 --> 00:13:59,525
Salut!

211
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,692
You expect me
to read this rubbish...?

212
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,650
You prats clearly
have no understanding

213
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,317
of Claude's character.

214
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,275
I want to meet with the write--

215
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,692
Try filming now.

216
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:24,983
Call for an ambulance!

217
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:25,983
Hey give us a hand...!

218
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:26,858
Hurry, people!

219
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,067
Shut that off...!

220
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,317
There's nothing to see here-

221
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,442
Fortunately, the master
wasn't injured...

222
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,067
That's really all
that matters to me.

223
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,525
Sebastian, however,
was injured...

224
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:39,108
His right ankle was badly
fractured in several places.

225
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:43,400
Even so...

226
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,150
He returned to the set next
day, keeping the extent

227
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:49,192
of his injury a secret
until filming wrapped.

228
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,608
If I couldn't perform because
of some trifling injury,

229
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,692
what kind of butler would I be?

230
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:58,275
And now, home shopping with the
Grim Reaper Cultural Center.

231
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,650
Today our specialty item
is this state-of-the art,

232
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,692
high-performance pruning hook.

233
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:07,275
Its reach is unparalleled.

234
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:08,400
No plant is safe.

235
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,900
Huh?

236
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:13,192
And you needn't
worry about storage.

237
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,983
The pruning hook telescopes
at the touch of a button.

238
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,733
Order now and receive
this lawn mower free.

239
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,650
Call us now...

240
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:22,942
Just dial all fours...

241
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:24,775
You won't regret it...!
Pick up that phone soon.

242
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,275
Supplies are limited.

243
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,275
This is a product to die for.

244
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,275
Welcome to Lizzie's "I'm
Simply One Hell of a Fiancée!"

245
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:37,025
Hello everyone!

246
00:15:37,108 --> 00:15:39,025
I'm Elizabeth Ethel
Cordelia Midford...

247
00:15:39,108 --> 00:15:40,567
But you can call me Lizzie...

248
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,150
We have an
exciting program today.

249
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,150
We'll be taking you behind the
scenes of the show's filming.

250
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:49,733
I'm concentrating...

251
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:51,025
Get out of here.

252
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:53,150
Let me guess:
I'm interrupting your process?

253
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:58,442
I'm deadly serious.

254
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,400
And here we have an array of
snacks for the hungry actors

255
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,483
to nibble on during filming.

256
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:06,483
It looks like we've caught
Ciel having a biscuit.

257
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:07,775
How cute!

258
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:08,900
Huh.

259
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,858
This chap prefers Marmite!

260
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,692
I'm obsessed with it lately...

261
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,733
I down a jar a day,
sometimes two.

262
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,483
I simply can't help myself.

263
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,525
Last week it was
vegetable juice, right?

264
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:22,233
Care to tell us what
you're up to over there, Lau?

265
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:23,608
A Chinese mime.

266
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:24,817
Brilliant.

267
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,692
Please enjoy.

268
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:30,150
We're in for a treat!

269
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,858
Soma and Agni have brought
their homemade curry to share!

270
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,567
Agni poured his heart and
soul into making this curry...

271
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,150
Can you taste the love, Lizzie?

272
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,442
Oh, yes!

273
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:39,525
Sebastian!

274
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:42,233
Surprise...!

275
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:44,233
Happy birthday, Sebastian!

276
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,817
And of course we
have birthday cake.

277
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,858
The whole lot would've
mutineed if I didn't let them

278
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,275
have their celebration...

279
00:16:52,358 --> 00:16:53,567
Happy Birthday.

280
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,150
Well I...? Thank you very much.

281
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:58,067
Happy Birthday, Sebastian!

282
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,942
Why does that twit
director, Edward,

283
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,692
insist on acting like he's
god's gift to filmmaking?

284
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:06,567
From what I hear, he comes
from one of the noble families.

285
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,525
A bit good.

286
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,275
It looks lovely.

287
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:12,358
I'll take a piece.

288
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:13,692
You can't do that.

289
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:15,442
You need both of your hands
to work that camera.

290
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:17,400
But I want cake, too!

291
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:19,525
Next up...

292
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,150
Let's pay a visit
to the ladies.

293
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:24,983
Strip.

294
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,692
I can change my own
frock, thank you!

295
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,108
First on camera,
we have Ranmao.

296
00:17:34,775 --> 00:17:36,275
Doesn't she look ravishing?

297
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:38,483
Oh yes...

298
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,358
that's perfect!

299
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,692
Don't worry, darling...

300
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,192
You look adorable!

301
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,358
Here we have the
lovely Mey Rin.

302
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:54,525
She's usually so bashful,
but look at her now!

303
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:58,692
The two ladies together...

304
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,775
Cute, cute, cuuute!

305
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:04,900
Need something?

306
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:05,608
Er, no...

307
00:18:05,692 --> 00:18:06,567
Nothing!

308
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,942
Welcome to the CGI studio.

309
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:13,775
Take a look.

310
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:14,483
We're putting
together the graphics

311
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,817
for the train right now.

312
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:20,775
Hold on...

313
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,400
You look familiar somehow...

314
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:23,942
I feel I should know you...

315
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:25,817
The director wants you,
Abberline...

316
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,692
You'd best hurry.

317
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,817
Right...! Do excuse me.

318
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,025
Hey!

319
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:32,942
Honestly!

320
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,442
What complete drivel.

321
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,567
Oh, dear, I didn't know
the camera was rolling.

322
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,067
The script is great!

323
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,275
Oh, Grell...!

324
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,400
Can I have a moment?

325
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,900
I thought I made it clear...

326
00:18:48,983 --> 00:18:51,858
I will not be filmed
without make-up on!

327
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:00,692
I've always had
an ear for tunes...

328
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,150
So I thought to myself:
Black Butler II needs

329
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,733
an original theme song...

330
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:07,317
After speaking with Ciel and
Sebastian for inspiration,

331
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,692
I began composing.

332
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:10,817
The result was
most satisfactory.

333
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,317
We're called Dro and Cell...!

334
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,942
We're like no band
you've ever seen before.

335
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:18,483
We're here to bring the
music scene to its knees...

336
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,317
We've got more rock
than a mountain does...

337
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,942
This is the Dro
and Cell sound...

338
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,233
And our sound rules!

339
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:25,650
So...

340
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:27,442
I thought to myself,
"Pluto should stop."...

341
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:28,567
No boy...!

342
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,858
Bad boy...!

343
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:31,275
No b--

344
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,192
No, boy...!

345
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,317
Bad boy...!

346
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,775
Okay,boy...!

347
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:38,817
Good boy...!

348
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,942
Good boy...!

349
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:40,942
No, boy...!

350
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,150
Bad boy...!

351
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:43,525
Okay, boy...!

352
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:44,650
Good boy...!

353
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,858
No boy...!

354
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:49,108
Bad boy...! Okay, boy!

355
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,233
At last, it's ready.

356
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,150
Filming has wrapped.

357
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:03,817
The cast and crew have brought
all their skill to bear.

358
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,567
The long-awaited sequel is
at last ready to be released.

359
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,358
And now...

360
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,150
the legend reawakens!

361
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,608
Our story opens with Alois
Trancy, a young earl with

362
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:17,858
a mysterious past,
and his butler, Claude,

363
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:20,067
a man of dubious character...

364
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,858
Suddenly, Sebastian
appears on the scene...

365
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,358
What is he after...?

366
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:27,108
What do Alois and Claude
have to hide...?

367
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,733
And what the devil
has happened to Ciel?

368
00:20:29,817 --> 00:20:30,525
So many twists!

369
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:31,733
My heart's all aflutter!

370
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:32,900
I feel a bit daft.

371
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,358
I have no clue
what's going on.

372
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:35,608
Same here!

373
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,192
There is no doubt in my
mind that the audience

374
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:39,483
will be more than satisfied.

375
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,067
Of course it'll be a success...

376
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,067
I don't believe in failure.

377
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,150
The story continues
at a breathtaking pace.

378
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,567
You're a pathetic sod,
Ciel Phantomhive.

379
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,400
Might I ask who you are?

380
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,192
I'm coming, Ciel.

381
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,692
Hold on!

382
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,775
Intense Action

383
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:50,817
Oh...

384
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,567
my love...

385
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,233
Ciel...

386
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:53,275
Lizzie!

387
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,150
The Looming terror of death!

388
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:01,358
I don't want to fight you,
but I have no choice.

389
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:02,692
I'm done laughing...

390
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:03,608
Now...

391
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:04,942
Shall we dance?

392
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:10,317
A fated showdown!

393
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:27,858
Innocence...

394
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,317
Lost!

395
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:31,775
M-...

396
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,108
my young lord.

397
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:34,650
And...

398
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,692
The gravest crisis
London has ever seen.

399
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,483
Haven't you ever wondered
about your destiny...?

400
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,692
About your family's secrets...?

401
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,817
There's so much
you don't know.

402
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,358
So enlighten me.

403
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:09,150
I will never allow you
to triumph over the queen.

404
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,733
Right, Ranmao?

405
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,150
What's the meaning of this?

406
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,567
I've lied to you, Ciel.

407
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,733
My real name is
Vincent Phantomhive...

408
00:23:15,817 --> 00:23:16,775
Yes, that's correct.

409
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:18,317
I am your father.

410
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,983
Dad, stop this!

411
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,233
You can't kill him...

412
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:25,442
If you take
my brother from me...

413
00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:27,275
you'll have to kill me, too!

414
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:30,067
My son and grandson
fighting to the death...

415
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,317
I never thought
I'd see this dark day.

416
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,067
It's too late...

417
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,567
I must!

418
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,692
I've been looking for you.

419
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:39,900
I've missed you so
very much, little brother.

420
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,317
You've returned!

421
00:23:42,692 --> 00:23:44,942
Does this look
familiar to you?

422
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,483
My dear mother wore that
every day until she died...!

423
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:52,108
Does this mean you--...

424
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,608
No!

425
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:55,775
When this battle is over,
we'll return to our homeland...

426
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:57,067
Yes...

427
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,150
we will stand on the bank
of the Ganges again.

428
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:00,692
Yes, highness.

429
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,192
Sebastian...

430
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:17,567
I have come from the
twenty-third century...

431
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,525
I must tell you something...

432
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:22,483
You may not understand
at first, but I am your--

433
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:26,192
It's all right...

434
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:28,108
I know he will return
to me someday.

435
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:29,650
After all...

436
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,858
I am carrying his child.

437
00:24:31,942 --> 00:24:32,942
Day into night...

438
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,942
peace into terrible war...

439
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,900
the moon into the earth.

440
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,275
In the end, that's what
makes a Trancy butler.

441
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:47,692
Now, onward, Moon...

442
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:50,525
Plunge the Earth
into eternal darkness.

443
00:24:53,983 --> 00:24:55,567
This has progressed too far.

444
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,608
We cannot allow any more young
lives to be sacrificed,

445
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:00,025
Your Majesty.

446
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,775
The time has come for old men
like us to pick up the sword.

447
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:13,275
We shall give up our lives so
that they can have a future.

448
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:38,525
Preparing to deploy
game-changing humanoid

449
00:25:38,608 --> 00:25:41,317
weapon designed to
protect the capital.

450
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,775
And...

451
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:42,942
launch!

452
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:01,400
Deploying QV field
at maximum strength!

453
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,233
Engines full blast.

454
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:07,067
The moon never set on
the British empire.

455
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,608
The rest is up
to you, butler...

456
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,192
I wish you god speed.

457
00:26:24,358 --> 00:26:27,733
I wasn't able to serve you
until the end as I had vowed...

458
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,400
I hope you can forgive me...

459
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:35,692
...my lord.

460
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:43,067
Sebastian!
