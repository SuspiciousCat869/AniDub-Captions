1
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,692
Goodbye, young master...

2
00:00:27,775 --> 00:00:29,608
I hope you have a nice trip!

3
00:00:29,692 --> 00:00:30,942
Yes.

4
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,942
Now I expect you lot
to try and behave yourselves

5
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:33,858
while we're away.

6
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:35,900
A train trip sounds lovely...!

7
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,983
Oh fruit...! I want
to go on one sometime!

8
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,358
Finny!

9
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:42,483
Would you quit running
around like a bloody loon?!

10
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,525
I'm so sorry!

11
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:51,108
Is everything okay?

12
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,817
Don't touch!

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,692
That's a valuable
scholarly acquisition.

14
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,442
Do you have any idea
what it's worth?

15
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:04,567
It's a mummy.

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,733
Egyptian antiquities
are popular these days...

17
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,983
The moneyed classes have taken
an interest in their value

18
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,733
as collectors' items...

19
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,067
A mummy would be
prized indeed.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,275
Who would want to
collect that thing?!

21
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:17,650
Dear Lord...

22
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,317
Please forgive your children.

23
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,775
Pack it up immediately!

24
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:24,858
Right.

25
00:01:24,942 --> 00:01:27,483
And you best be careful!

26
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,150
I pray that no calamity
befalls you for your actions.

27
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,317
Master...

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,317
May I offer you
a cup of tea...?

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,608
I've always found the scent
of Williamson and Magor's

30
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,983
summer Darjeeling the perfect
complement to the view

31
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,025
from a train window.

32
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,567
Wouldn't you agree, sir?

33
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:35,150
Come, my lord...

34
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:38,108
We're meant to be acting
as if we're off on holiday...

35
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,067
We don't want
to be found out...

36
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,275
Please try to muster up
a bit of levity.

37
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,067
Yes, yes. I know.

38
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,358
You seem bothered of late.

39
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,983
Have the Trancys
so preoccupied you?

40
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,942
They haven't.

41
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,650
I am curious of course,...

42
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,983
but for the moment,
that's all.

43
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,942
The Queen's orders take
priority over all else.

44
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:03,942
That's Lord Ackroyd, then...?

45
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,775
And the kidnapped boy
was his only son?

46
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:08,108
Yes.

47
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,650
If the police are informed,
the hostage will be

48
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,025
summarily killed...

49
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:13,358
The instructions Lord
Ackroyd received indicated

50
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:15,650
he should deliver the
ransom on this train.

51
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,442
A ransom of five
thousand pounds, was it?

52
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,775
Is that the going rate for
a boy's soul these days...?

53
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,275
You humans have an interesting
way of pricing these things.

54
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:26,192
The man responsible for
the kidnapping must be

55
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,275
on the train...

56
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,733
We'll find him,
take him into custody,

57
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:30,983
and rescue Lord Ackroyd's son...

58
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,567
That should dispel
Her Majesty's distress.

59
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,192
Indeed.

60
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:50,108
It's the find of the century,
I'm telling you!

61
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,650
Yours truly discovered none
other than the pharaoh

62
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:56,358
Smenkhkare, hidden deep
within the Valley of Kings.

63
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,233
How crass for a man to brag
about robbing a grave.

64
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,150
I was fortunate enough
to meet the pharaoh

65
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,608
during his lifetime, actually.

66
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:07,733
I found him to be an affable
man of impeccable virtue.

67
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,650
It's odd...

68
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,733
Even taking into account
the desiccation,

69
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,858
his face is quite
different than I remember.

70
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,483
The mummy is a fake, then...

71
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,025
Perhaps that means the
archaeologist is our kidnapper.

72
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,733
I couldn't say, my lord.

73
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,150
The train that left St. Pancras
at nine o'clock will cross

74
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,858
the Cambridge-bound root
at Bedford at 10:18!

75
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,525
This is thrilling...!

76
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:32,358
A great moment!

77
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:33,942
Something not to be missed!

78
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:37,650
We reach Derby at one-oh-five!

79
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,567
Uh-oh! There will be
a slow-down. What with

80
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,692
the weather, the porters
will have a hard time of it.

81
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,317
Seven minutes at least!

82
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,858
Is he reading the timetables?

83
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:46,108
It appears so.

84
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,192
In fact, I'd say he's
developed an unhealthy

85
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,025
obsession with them.

86
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:53,900
Careful...!

87
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,442
You damned brat!

88
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,942
I see you're from Japan,
my good sir...

89
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:04,275
The scrollwork on your Furoshiki
wrapping cloth is exquisite.

90
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:05,192
Hands off...!

91
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,358
This is a family heirloom!

92
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,817
What does he have
inside there...?

93
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,275
Could he be hiding something?

94
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,525
I'm sorry, my boy...

95
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:15,858
He's so stubborn when
it comes to his things.

96
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,025
Please accept this
as an apology.

97
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,192
Thank you...

98
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:21,525
My lord has already
taken his tea.

99
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:22,442
Oh, of course.

100
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:23,983
I understand...

101
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,317
Would anyone else
care for one?

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I have plenty...

103
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:27,775
They're delicious!

104
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,400
Some have bonito flakes
and some have pickled plums!

105
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:32,067
Here, please
help yourself, sir.

106
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,317
I don't want your food,
old woman.

107
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,608
Everyone knows cholera
is rampant in Asia.

108
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,775
Are you trying to poison me?

109
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:38,942
Shoo, shoo!

110
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:40,275
You know nothing...!

111
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,525
That isn't true!

112
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,275
Please, calm yourselves...

113
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,525
Sir, don't you think it
ungenerous to adopt

114
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:47,817
that attitude when these
travelers have journeyed

115
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,483
so far to our great country?

116
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,942
Sod off, will you?

117
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,733
You English dog!

118
00:06:52,817 --> 00:06:54,108
And look here...!

119
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,275
This train will arrive
at a quarter past the hour.

120
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,567
A tattoo on a priest?

121
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,025
My, what a stir.

122
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,150
Everyone, please...!

123
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,192
Control yourselves!

124
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:12,108
Calm your tempers...!
Resume your seats!

125
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,650
I can understand why
you are all uneasy...

126
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:17,358
It's true that we're
transporting an assassin

127
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:19,983
on this train,
but you mustn't worry.

128
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,108
He is being kept under strict
armed guard at all times...

129
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,983
He's restrained
and unable to move!

130
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,858
But fear not.

131
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,608
Run!

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,150
I recognize him
from somewhere.

133
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
Oh...!

134
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,567
If it isn't the
Earl of Phantomhive--

135
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:50,775
Eel pie and mash
really brings back memories...

136
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,525
Traditional English food
just like Mum used to make!

137
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:59,858
I say, quite a fuss
back there, wasn't it?

138
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,358
Oh yes, A right stampede.

139
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,150
If only we knew
whose fault it was.

140
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,442
Should you be here...?

141
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:07,358
Sir Arthur is sure to
call you on the carpet

142
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,108
if he learns you dined with me.

143
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,358
Oh pish posh...

144
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,275
I didn't want
to pass up the opportunity

145
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,150
to get to know you...

146
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:15,858
It's something
I've waited for...

147
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:18,442
You see, my twin brother
spoke a lot about you.

148
00:08:18,525 --> 00:08:20,400
Twin brother...?

149
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,275
You mean there's more
than one of these idiots

150
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:25,108
wandering about the world?

151
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,025
I miss him...

152
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,692
I wish we could
share this meal today.

153
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,317
He would have enjoyed it.

154
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:34,358
He doesn't seem to know
about the kidnapping.

155
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,317
Is there a problem?

156
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,650
No...

157
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,567
It's nothing, young master...

158
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,858
Shall we?

159
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,108
Hold on, Ciel...!

160
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:07,233
If you don't rest between meals,
you'll ruin your stomach!

161
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,192
"If you wish to see your son
again, leave the suitcase

162
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:19,233
with the ransom money in
the very last lounge car."

163
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,567
All in all, there are quite
a few suspicious characters

164
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,400
on this train.

165
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,567
Yes...

166
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,483
A priest with a tattoo...

167
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,608
A sham archeologist...

168
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,442
A surly Japanese man...

169
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:33,233
A maniac obsessed
with timetables.

170
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:34,317
Quite a group...

171
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,317
I doubt our man
would want to stand out.

172
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,525
Let us not forget the assassin
who's traveling on board

173
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:39,733
as well.

174
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,567
Excuse me.

175
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,150
You're the porter I saw
back at the station...

176
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:55,858
What're you doing on the
train dressed as a traveler?

177
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,025
Damn!

178
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:58,650
He's the kidnapper!

179
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,025
Damn!

180
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,400
I can't get it!

181
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:14,442
Stop!

182
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:22,358
Don't let him go, Sebastian!

183
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:23,692
My Lord.

184
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,483
All right old man,
let's have the money.

185
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:35,483
I'd make it quick
if I were you,

186
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:37,733
or your precious
boy's life is over.

187
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:41,275
You would be better off
looking after your own life

188
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:42,608
at this juncture.

189
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:45,358
Hey, who the hell are you?!

190
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:48,608
Where are you keeping
your young hostage?

191
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:50,567
Well the boy's still
onboard the train...

192
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,650
But it's too late,
unfortunately...

193
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,942
You can't save him now.

194
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:55,733
Oh...?

195
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:56,983
Why is that?

196
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:58,567
I planted a bomb...

197
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,942
I set it to explode
as soon as the train stops.

198
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,567
My plan was to collect
the ransom money...

199
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:09,400
and then I'd celebrate
with some fireworks!

200
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,733
We have ten minutes left
until the train reaches

201
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,442
the next station.

202
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:21,983
Serves you right,
you lousy--

203
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:24,817
I have to hurry.

204
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,108
There's not much time.

205
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,317
I just heard one of
the cars has been decoupled?

206
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,192
Maybe we should
find out what's going on.

207
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:06,400
Wait Ciel, what do
you mean, you're heading

208
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:07,442
for the goods wagon?

209
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,150
Come back!

210
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,775
Sebastian will take
care of capturing

211
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:12,108
the kidnapper himself...

212
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,733
We only need to worry
about the child.

213
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,150
The kidnapper must've
disguised himself as a porter

214
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,900
to hide the hostage
in someone's luggage...

215
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:21,233
Let's see...

216
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:23,150
Only one piece of luggage
on board's big enough

217
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,567
to hide a boy.

218
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,692
That mummy's coffin!

219
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:28,150
I say?!

220
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,608
What's wrong?

221
00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:34,233
It's...

222
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,483
my stomach...

223
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,525
It's killing me!

224
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,025
This isn't right...!

225
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:44,275
I know I rested long enough
after eating.

226
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,692
Oh, I hope it's not cholera!

227
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:48,650
I'm leaving...!

228
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,900
Let's go!

229
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:52,025
You bastards...!

230
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,567
That's my wife!

231
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,942
Did you by any chance eat one
of those lady's rice balls?

232
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:59,108
Yes, and it was heavenly!

233
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,067
Is that it?

234
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,150
Help...

235
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,442
Just hang on!

236
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,650
Pardon me.

237
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,192
Listen carefully.

238
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,483
There is a bomb on this train
set to go off when we stop.

239
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,317
Under no circumstances
are you to break.

240
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,942
Wait what do you mean?!

241
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,400
Hold on, aren't you
Ciel's butler?

242
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,942
Where is my young master?

243
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:29,192
He went to the goods wagon.

244
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,192
Something about
saving a child.

245
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:31,900
I...

246
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,400
I have an announcement!

247
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,608
The points have been changed...

248
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,900
We're now bound for
a different destination.

249
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:42,108
We'll be passing over a bridge
that is no longer in use.

250
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,358
It won't be able to bear
the train's weight...

251
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:45,650
Our final stop...

252
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:51,067
will almost
certainly be Heaven!

253
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:55,733
Then we'd best see about
stopping this thing.

254
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:56,650
Oh, no...!

255
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:57,983
It can't be!

256
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,358
Ah, master...

257
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,192
I see you've wound up
as a hostage again...

258
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,817
I'm starting to think
you enjoy being captured.

259
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,400
Silence is a virtue.

260
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,775
So it was you after all...

261
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:13,775
Bloodbath Johnny.

262
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,442
What a coincidence to find
myself on the same train

263
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:21,192
as Jackknife Heyward.

264
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,567
You of all people ought to
know what I'll do to the kid

265
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,358
if my wishes
aren't complied with.

266
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,108
I'd be more than happy to
help stop the train myself...

267
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,483
but I'm afraid that's currently
inadvisable as there's

268
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:35,192
a bomb onboard that will
detonate if I were to do so.

269
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:39,358
And let's not forget the cholera
outbreak on this carriage...

270
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:42,358
Even if you get off now,
you may already be infected.

271
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,150
So I'm on a booby-trapped train
that's headed for a run-down

272
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:48,108
bridge, and there's
bloody cholera too?!

273
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,108
You know...

274
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:51,025
It's been
a rather busy day yes.

275
00:15:51,108 --> 00:15:52,733
I've had enough
of this charade...

276
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:55,067
Sebastian,
do something about it...

277
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,733
That's an order!

278
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:57,692
Yes...

279
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,358
my young lord.

280
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:01,483
Bugger!

281
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,567
To hell with your cholera
and your bombs...!

282
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,525
I'm getting myself
out of this mess!

283
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,733
Master--

284
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,067
Hold on!

285
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,108
This is too much for an
ordinary butler to handle!

286
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,275
At times like these,
we have no choice but to use

287
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,150
every resource
available to us.

288
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,358
We band together to take
a stand against evil!

289
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:21,608
Nice idea...

290
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:23,150
but it's nothing more
than wishful thinking.

291
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,775
That's not necessarily true.

292
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:27,942
I used to be
an assassin myself...

293
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,692
and a good one, at that...

294
00:16:29,775 --> 00:16:32,525
But after Johnny killed
somebody precious to me,

295
00:16:32,608 --> 00:16:34,942
I went straight
and became a priest.

296
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,900
As the Holy Book tells us...

297
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,192
"Ye are your own enemies."

298
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:44,483
It's time about time
I settle the score.

299
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,275
Unfortunately
I don't have a weapon.

300
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:48,692
And Facing Johnny
will be difficult without one.

301
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,442
Here, use this!

302
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:59,400
A treasure that's been passed
down through generations:

303
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:01,400
the Zantomaru...!
I brought it with me

304
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:04,233
to give to my son, who's
studying here in England...

305
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:06,733
but the honor of this
katana can best be served

306
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,150
by putting it to use right now.

307
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,733
There's the bomb as well...

308
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,275
You can leave that to me...!

309
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:15,817
I've used plenty of
time bombs in my excavations.

310
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,358
In general,
they have two wires,

311
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,858
a red one and a black one...

312
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,192
One is a dummy...

313
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,650
Cut the right wire,
and you disable the bomb...

314
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:28,358
if you cut the wrong one, then
kaboom...! Even so, do we have

315
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:30,942
enough time remaining
to locate the bomb?

316
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,567
Yes we do...!

317
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,150
This point up here is crucial.

318
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,150
We change it and enter
the High Peak Railway.

319
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,317
Then we change
the next point too...

320
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,817
With that, we gain twenty
whole minutes of extra time!

321
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,233
Excellent, everyone...!

322
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:52,400
If we all join forces,
we'll find our way out of this!

323
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,983
Not that I don't
appreciate the thought,

324
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,108
but I can handle
this by myself.

325
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:00,775
I say...! Butler!

326
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:05,150
Young people these days
are such show-offs!

327
00:18:10,608 --> 00:18:12,983
You're a stubborn prat, eh?

328
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,067
I'll take my master back now.

329
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:22,025
Yeah.

330
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:23,233
You can have him...

331
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,275
see, here you go.

332
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:25,942
Ha ha!

333
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,692
I win!

334
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:28,775
What the--?!

335
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:38,858
Here...

336
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:39,692
master.

337
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:40,317
You...

338
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,192
you're a monster!

339
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,108
So nice meeting
you mister assassin.

340
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,650
Good day.

341
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,900
Now, to take care
of that bomb...

342
00:18:58,108 --> 00:19:01,108
Maybe there are two red
or black wires as he says.

343
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,233
But I see no reason why
I have to choose just one.

344
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,233
Be careful...

345
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,900
There could have
been passengers!

346
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,150
Not to worry, lord...

347
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,608
That was merely the roof
of the dining car...

348
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,983
No human was hurt.

349
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:33,900
Well...

350
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,233
carrying on.

351
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,192
That was a close shave.

352
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,067
You managed okay.

353
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,608
I dare say I managed
beautifully young master...

354
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,817
If I couldn't handle three
crises simultaneously,

355
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,233
what kind of butler
would I be?

356
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,442
Well... well done, butler.
That was magnificent.

357
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:30,525
Oh yes that's right...

358
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,025
what should we do
about the cholera?

359
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:34,108
The whole train
could be infected by now.

360
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,067
There is no need
for concern, sir...

361
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,817
Anyone whose stomach
ails him should take this.

362
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,983
I've never heard of such
a cure for cholera.

363
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:43,900
Oh...

364
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,608
this is a digestive tonic.

365
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,650
And what good will that do?

366
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,233
Japanese tradition holds
that certain food pairings

367
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,483
can be harmful...

368
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,692
For example,
eel and pickled plum.

369
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,775
I imagine his agony stems from
nothing more than having

370
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,108
a pickled plum rice ball
following the eel pie

371
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,525
he greedily ate
in the dining car.

372
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:05,983
I'm cured...!

373
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,442
--I've been cured!
--Lovely...

374
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:09,775
Works that fast?

375
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,900
I suspect you're no
ordinary servant at all.

376
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,858
I'm simply one
hell of a butler...

377
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,275
It was no trouble.

378
00:21:30,608 --> 00:21:31,733
Be careful with that...!

379
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:32,983
You damn oaf!

380
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:41,525
Here.

381
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:44,233
My tea was spilled
in all the commotion.

382
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,317
A true butler should have
been able to sort that out

383
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,150
without the slightest
rocking of the train.

384
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,192
Quite so...

385
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,358
I see you took
some damage as well.

386
00:21:59,442 --> 00:22:00,442
What is that?

387
00:22:00,525 --> 00:22:02,067
If you want to
investigate my master,

388
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,650
simply come in
through the front gate.

389
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,108
You want to help
young Ciel, don't you...?

390
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,692
He so desperately
wants his revenge.

391
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:47,400
Yesterday was tiring,
even for me.

392
00:23:52,817 --> 00:23:54,108
What's this?

393
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,817
It's an invitation to a ball
at the Trancy estate, master.

394
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,192
A ball?

395
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,275
At the Trancys'...

396
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:15,233
So, you've invited us to
a ball at the Trancy mansion...

397
00:24:15,317 --> 00:24:19,483
Very well, I'm happy to let you
dance to my tune for an evening.

398
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,275
Butlerhood is a graceful,
subtle dance...

399
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:26,650
One to which I am obviously
much more accustomed than you.

400
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,067
Next time:"Beacon Butler"

401
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,650
Surely you jest...

402
00:24:30,733 --> 00:24:32,358
If I couldn't dance to that...

403
00:24:32,442 --> 00:24:34,858
what kind of butler
would I be?

404
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:39,483
One two thee, one two three,
one two three, one
