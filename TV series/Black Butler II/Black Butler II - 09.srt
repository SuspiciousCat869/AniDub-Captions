1
00:00:18,317 --> 00:00:22,192
My fellows of the deep,
beloved darkness...

2
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,942
Look here.

3
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,608
I present to you
Alois Trancy's soul.

4
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:34,525
So...

5
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,317
now that I have
obtained this...

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,025
what shall I do with it?

7
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:40,942
Close!

8
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,400
Wide of the mark.

9
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:49,733
Hannah?

10
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:53,692
The mansion's décor
seems to have changed.

11
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:59,608
Precisely correct.

12
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:04,275
I've transformed the
manor's color scheme.

13
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:07,192
Once navy, it is
now midnight blue.

14
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,358
The alteration itself
is a subtle one...

15
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,692
Only a select few
will notice.

16
00:01:14,483 --> 00:01:16,692
Their souls may be
fundamentally different,

17
00:01:16,775 --> 00:01:19,567
but look closely and you
will find a commonality.

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,775
The pasts that color them.

19
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,608
And that...

20
00:01:25,692 --> 00:01:27,608
is most useful.

21
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:32,858
Interesting...

22
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,483
so this is their move.

23
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:44,358
Trouble sleeping, my lord?

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,608
A bit, perhaps...

25
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,358
Yes.

26
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,067
It's this business
of killing someone...

27
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,275
it doesn't play out
as one expects.

28
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,192
I had thought the
process would be an easy one...

29
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:02,108
But as it turns out, I find
it difficult to kill like you,

30
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,692
without hesitation or honor.

31
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:07,067
I consider that
a high compliment, my lord.

32
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,400
Tell me a story so
I can fall asleep.

33
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:16,608
Well...

34
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:20,025
will a message from
Her Majesty do?

35
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:12,442
There's been a spate
of strange crimes in

36
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,025
the London area recently.
It seems someone has been

37
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:17,275
gouging out people's eyes.

38
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,150
The victims aren't all
of the same class,

39
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,233
but every last one
is a young boy.

40
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:22,942
Eye gouging.

41
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,275
How perverse.

42
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,650
Wait no, listen to me!

43
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,275
You don't understand...

44
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:34,358
You're being
tricked by a demon!

45
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:37,275
Can't you see that
we're basically the same?

46
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:39,192
Is there something
the matter, master?

47
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,150
It's nothing.

48
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,983
I don't know!

49
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,775
He just up and stuck
his fingers in me eyes...

50
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:54,567
Everything went red...

51
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,442
Now I can't see nothin'...

52
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:57,817
nothin'!

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,692
Can you describe
your attacker?

54
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,275
He was just a kid...

55
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,067
'Bout the same
age as I am...

56
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,442
Only this boy
looked plenty rich.

57
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:06,442
A boy?

58
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,525
That bloody bastard!

59
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,317
Sebastian.

60
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,650
Yes.

61
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,192
A demon has spent
much time building up

62
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:27,317
that soul stitch by stitch.

63
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,233
And now I intend to steal it.

64
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:32,650
But I must do so respectfully...

65
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,025
stitch by stitch.

66
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,483
We have several
witness reports.

67
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:41,483
Without exception,
they describe the attacker

68
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:44,233
as a richly dressed
young noble.

69
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:46,233
I'm being mocked, Sebastian.

70
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:47,900
Mocked by whom, master?

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Look.

72
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,942
I'll draw a line
between the Phantomhive

73
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,817
and Trancy estates...

74
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,483
Like so...

75
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:58,108
Then connect the various
scenes of the crimes.

76
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,608
A spider web...

77
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,067
Obviously, he's behind this.

78
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,108
It may be possible that his
butler is acting on his own.

79
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,858
So he survived...

80
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:10,483
He's persistent,
I'll give him that much.

81
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:11,775
Young master...

82
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:14,358
Trancy...

83
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,400
he is still alive.

84
00:06:19,858 --> 00:06:22,108
Sebastian, a butler always
answers his master's questions

85
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:24,608
truthfully and
without hesitation...

86
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:25,650
Am I right?

87
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,608
Quite right, lord.

88
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:30,900
You aren't hiding anything
about Alois from me, are you?

89
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:33,275
No...

90
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:35,150
I am not hiding
anything about Alois.

91
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,317
In that case--

92
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,817
The spider butler?

93
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,525
No...

94
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,733
Not now.

95
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,358
Please stay in here.

96
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,233
Why?

97
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,650
It's just for a bit.

98
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,317
You mustn't set foot
outside of this box...

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,275
Please, lord...

100
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:57,567
Stay put.

101
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,942
Fine.

102
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,400
First they lure us out here
with orders from the queen...

103
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:09,233
That's just the start.

104
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:11,442
Next, they rely upon
the ones sure to show up

105
00:07:11,525 --> 00:07:13,525
whenever there's
a soul-related issue.

106
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:20,817
Reapers.

107
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,358
Ugh...!

108
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:34,567
Come on...

109
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,150
You've got to be kidding me.

110
00:07:37,608 --> 00:07:38,608
Bloody hell.

111
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,150
It's totally useless now.

112
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:42,150
Forgive me.

113
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,525
I don't believe
we've met before.

114
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:44,317
We haven't...

115
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,442
Hi.

116
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:48,025
The name's Ronald Knox...

117
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,275
The next diehard Reaper!

118
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:54,983
Yeah...

119
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,067
sounds bleedin
ridiculous, I know...

120
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:59,025
It's just old man
Sutcliffe insisted I needed

121
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:00,442
a catch phrase...

122
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:02,317
I had a bird from
General Affairs come up

123
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,442
with something for me.

124
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,233
Oh, I shouldn't
worry overmuch...

125
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,442
both you and your
silly little catch phrase

126
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,400
are destined to be short-lived.

127
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:12,400
I assume you lot have gotten
involved because of recent,

128
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:16,483
unusual soul movements...?
Is that it?

129
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,817
Perhaps the soul
of one Alois Trancy

130
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,483
has proven unrecoverable,
for instance...

131
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,400
Eh?

132
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:23,733
Perhaps so.

133
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:28,775
I might have guessed
you'd be involved in this...

134
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:29,858
And here you are.

135
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,233
Hello Sebastian.

136
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,108
I've felt this before...

137
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:45,150
I was trapped someplace
like this for a long time...

138
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,942
I know I've
forgotten something...

139
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,442
but I can't figure what.

140
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:53,775
Whatever it is,
Alois and Sebastian know...

141
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,108
I'm sure of it...

142
00:08:56,775 --> 00:08:59,358
I'm the only one
who doesn't know.

143
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,442
What the--?

144
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,817
Can't you see
that we're the same?

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,650
Sod off...! I'm nothing like
you, you vile piece of filth!

146
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:28,650
You mustn't set foot
outside of this box...

147
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,317
Please, lord.

148
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,108
Bloody sod off!

149
00:09:33,858 --> 00:09:34,900
Damn you...!

150
00:09:34,983 --> 00:09:36,942
I'm the one who gives orders!

151
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:40,692
Go play at home, kids!

152
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:41,317
Hey!

153
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,608
You're a kid, too!

154
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:43,067
Yeah!

155
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,608
Go home!

156
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:45,983
What a bother.

157
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,775
Working overtime yet again...

158
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,525
All thanks to Grell!

159
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:52,025
So it's true.

160
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,233
Alois Trancy is dead...

161
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,317
Which means this
is the butler's game.

162
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,233
The spider's thread twines
around a snow-white soul...

163
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,442
One stitch at a time...

164
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,192
Row by row...

165
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,567
...until the web is complete.

166
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,275
Where are you Sebastian...?

167
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:12,442
I'll find you...

168
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,442
I will learn your secret.

169
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,692
Alois...?

170
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,650
There's no end to his mockery.

171
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:28,942
Come back!

172
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:33,317
A dead end...

173
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,275
That's as far as you--

174
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,442
Alois Trancy, there he is!

175
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,317
Idiots.

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,442
You're from Scotland Yard,
then...? Well, go after him...

177
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:44,400
He's escaping.

178
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:45,275
All right, Trancy.

179
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,400
Don't try to fight us.

180
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:48,692
What, wait you
think I'm Alois...?

181
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:49,983
Get your facts straight...

182
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,525
He's right over th--

183
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,817
Let's take him in.

184
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,608
Wait...!

185
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,067
Let me go this instant...!

186
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,317
Who do you bloody
people think you are?!

187
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:04,942
It's the maid
from the Trancy manor.

188
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:05,775
Look closely.

189
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,025
Are you quite certain?

190
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:07,858
Yes...

191
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:09,358
That is my master...

192
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:12,192
That is my master,
he is the Earl Alois Trancy.

193
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,442
Are you mad?

194
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:15,525
Forgive me for saying so,
but he seems to be

195
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,317
an extremely troubled youth.

196
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,817
It's a tragic tale...

197
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,608
My poor young lord was
subjected to repeated abuse

198
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:24,442
at the hands
of his late father.

199
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,358
The abuse took a toll on him...

200
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:29,817
I'm sorry to say it
affected his mind.

201
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,108
He despises the mark
carved into his eye

202
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,942
by the previous Earl Trancy...

203
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:38,317
Any time he sees a boy who
resembles his younger self,

204
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,275
that hatred manifests
itself like some monster...

205
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:43,692
It whispers...

206
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,733
"Take out their eyes."...

207
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:48,275
"Take out their eyes."

208
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:50,025
He took mine as well...

209
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:51,858
That's why I wear this.

210
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:53,525
How dare you, vile witch!

211
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:57,025
His eye is the best proof
of his identity.

212
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,108
Remove the patch from his eye.

213
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:00,400
Stop this!

214
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:03,608
No...

215
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:04,150
No...

216
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,275
You're wrong...

217
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,192
It's a sign of my contract.

218
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,983
My master is also
a victim in all this...

219
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:13,150
Please I beg you to show
him whatever mercy you can.

220
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,775
Take him in.

221
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,525
Let me go...! ..Stop this!

222
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:22,900
Sebastian!

223
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,025
All right!

224
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,942
Now then, let's
get this over with...

225
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,317
You can bet your ass
I'm not working overtime.

226
00:12:41,525 --> 00:12:44,192
Against two reapers,
even I'm at a disadvantage.

227
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,692
Blundering little fool...

228
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,567
I don't suppose it's
your intention to fell me

229
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,108
with your death
scythe, as well.

230
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:49,900
Oh...

231
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:51,483
did I take it too far...?

232
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:51,983
Right.

233
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:53,108
My mistake.

234
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:54,692
I'm at that
mischievous age, you know.

235
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,442
A grim reaper must always take
care to judge every situation

236
00:12:57,525 --> 00:12:59,150
swiftly and accurately...

237
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:01,275
Are those spectacles
just for show?

238
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,233
Sir, he's getting away.

239
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,442
My spectacles...

240
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,733
Where are they...?

241
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:12,983
I can't see.

242
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:13,983
Pardon sir...

243
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,317
Shouldn't we stop him?

244
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You fail to fully understand
the great importance

245
00:13:17,483 --> 00:13:19,025
of a reaper's spectacles...!

246
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,942
I'll have your scythe!

247
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:23,483
Oh dear...

248
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:25,358
I don't even know
where to begin.

249
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,025
Finished.

250
00:13:31,108 --> 00:13:32,942
Ciel Phantomhive...

251
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,150
I'll ensnare you
in my web...

252
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,483
Pierce your skin
with my teeth.

253
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,150
And while you
writhe beneath me...

254
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:51,650
I'll suck out that
delectable soul of yours.

255
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,650
Why not start by
telling me your name.

256
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,650
My name is Ciel Phantomhive.

257
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,442
Really, treating a nobleman
like a common criminal...!

258
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,108
What gives you the right
to do such a thing?

259
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:25,442
The Queen...!

260
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:27,358
Just get word
to her majesty...!

261
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:30,108
Or you can even contact
Sir Arthur if you have to.

262
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:31,567
They'll corroborate ev--

263
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,692
The poor lad's quite
far gone indeed...

264
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:40,150
Administer the
special treatment.

265
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:09,567
The world...

266
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,483
It's falling away...

267
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,650
Everything...

268
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:35,567
I apologize for not
simply sending someone

269
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,442
along to fetch you, Sebastian.

270
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:38,775
No need for apologies.

271
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:42,025
I found your invitation
easy enough to understand.

272
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,942
We're standing in the
exact center of the web

273
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:46,400
you lot so carefully created.

274
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:56,067
I am...

275
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,317
Ciel...

276
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,942
Ciel Phantomhive...

277
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,567
I am the Queen's...

278
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,442
Her Majesty's...

279
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:05,858
guard dog.

280
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:08,233
I don't have
a mother or father...

281
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,525
I lost them.

282
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,567
And how did you lose them?

283
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,900
The mansion...

284
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,067
it burned...

285
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,275
Indeed...

286
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,233
it burned to the ground.

287
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,775
The village you
grew up in burned.

288
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,400
I ran...

289
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:22,983
I ran down the corridor.

290
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,400
That's right...

291
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,233
you ran.

292
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:28,067
You ran down a path.

293
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,942
You ran through the village...

294
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:42,400
and then what did you find?

295
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:43,942
I found...

296
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,858
my parents...

297
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:48,275
They were dead.

298
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:49,108
Yes...

299
00:16:49,192 --> 00:16:50,650
You found your brother...

300
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:54,192
You found your brother,
and he was dead.

301
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,817
My brother?

302
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,108
You found him...

303
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,233
and then what happened?

304
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,817
The old men...

305
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,650
the old men took me away.

306
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:03,567
Yes...

307
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,900
The old man took you.

308
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,608
He humiliated me...

309
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:18,775
The Earl Trancy did.

310
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,608
Tran...

311
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,108
cy...

312
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,275
That's right.

313
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,275
The sheath that
holds a demon's sword.

314
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,400
What I don't understand
is why a being so powerful

315
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,983
would be obeying
someone like Claude.

316
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,483
Claude is...

317
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,650
We have a contract...

318
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,942
It doesn't matter one whit
if he's taken from me.

319
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,275
He's still my young master.

320
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,192
None of you can ever
hope to have so much

321
00:18:12,275 --> 00:18:14,483
as a taste of his soul.

322
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:15,942
First navy...

323
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,400
and then midnight blue...

324
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:19,567
There are...

325
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,942
two extremely
similar memories.

326
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:24,275
True...

327
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:27,358
none of us can ever hope
for so much as a taste...

328
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:30,525
Not while he's still
entirely your young master.

329
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:33,900
After that...

330
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:34,900
I...

331
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:37,733
I made a contract
with Sebastian.

332
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:41,150
Yes, someone made a contract
with a demon named Sebastian...

333
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:44,400
and then Sebastian
started a fire.

334
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:45,358
A fire...

335
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:46,900
Yes...

336
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:49,775
Sebastian made a contract with
your younger brother Luka...

337
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:52,525
And burned down your village.

338
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,233
Luka...

339
00:18:54,317 --> 00:18:55,567
village...?

340
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,025
That's right...

341
00:18:57,108 --> 00:19:01,400
Sebastian Michaelis and Luka
entered into a contract...

342
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,150
And you lost him...

343
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,983
Your only brother.

344
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,108
My brother...

345
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,192
Master!

346
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:41,317
Master...

347
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,692
Don't touch me!

348
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,275
My lord.

349
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,192
It was you all along,
wasn't it...?

350
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:52,400
You killed my parents!

351
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:53,483
It was you...!

352
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,900
Just admit it!

353
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:01,650
I didn't predict you
mixing their memories...

354
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,942
Your intention, of course, was
to merge the two soul as one.

355
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:05,858
That's brilliant.

356
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,983
It never occurred to me.

357
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,983
He's soaked to the bone...

358
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,025
What, did you dip him
in some sort of medicine

359
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,275
in order to confuse my master?

360
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,817
He's asked a question, master...

361
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,150
Shall I answer?

362
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,858
No, there's no need for that.

363
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,567
Yes, I know.

364
00:20:41,858 --> 00:20:42,942
This is an order...

365
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:45,442
Leave now and
stay out of my sight!

366
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,442
Didn't you hear him...?

367
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,233
A master's orders are absolute.

368
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,525
Are you all right?

369
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,525
I'm...

370
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,442
so weary.

371
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:18,775
Yes.

372
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:20,108
I...

373
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,192
I want to sleep.

374
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:27,442
Yes indeed...

375
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,442
my young highness.

376
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,025
I've delayed my duties...

377
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:37,233
Dinner should have been
prepared some time ago.

378
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:39,608
And now...

379
00:21:39,692 --> 00:21:41,192
look what's happened.

380
00:21:46,567 --> 00:21:49,733
Dinner must be made
as soon as possible...

381
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,942
but there's one thing
to do first...

382
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:54,775
I am a Phantomhive butler.

383
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:57,567
I must clear the spider webs.

384
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,775
That's plain.

385
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:32,108
You've returned.

386
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:33,442
Welcome home.

387
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:43,650
Golden into navy...

388
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:47,067
then navy transformed
into midnight blue...

389
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,692
and next...

390
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:52,442
Alois Trancy into
Ciel Phantomhive.

391
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,775
That makes...

392
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:56,108
one hell of a butler.

393
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,733
Draw him a hot bath
immediately.

394
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:01,858
Yes sir.

395
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,692
He'll catch cold
like this...

396
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:09,233
We need to warm up the young
highness--no--- young master.

397
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:10,775
See to it.

398
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:15,900
Ciel Phantomhive was in need
of a target for his revenge...

399
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:19,567
In the end, that target
was Sebastian Michaelis...

400
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,817
I see...

401
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,067
Rather amusing, really.

402
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:34,400
Next time: "Zero Butler"
If I couldn't handle this,

403
00:24:34,483 --> 00:24:36,817
what kind of butler
would I be...?

404
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,650
Certainly not
a Phantomhive butler!
