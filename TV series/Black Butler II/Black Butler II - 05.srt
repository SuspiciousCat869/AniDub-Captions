1
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,025
Here.

2
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:30,733
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,483
Agni's curry bread
is nutritious and tasty...

4
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,525
I'm certain that
you'll enjoy it.

5
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:38,692
Careful, it's hot.

6
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,567
Many thanks, good sir.

7
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:43,942
You!

8
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,775
Sebastian?

9
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:47,858
Mm, it's delicious!

10
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,317
It's really true?

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,900
No...!

12
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,692
Ciel has truly lost his memory?

13
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,900
"Earl Trancy"...

14
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:34,900
Just who is this fellow...?

15
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:37,650
And is Ciel really
going to attend as well?

16
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,608
Yes.

17
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:41,983
This is sudden...

18
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,733
I've tried to visit him
any number of times...

19
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:46,233
Why now?

20
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:48,900
Sebastian said Lord Phantomhive
wouldn't understand if you

21
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:53,192
and I showed up at his
door out of nowhere.

22
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:57,275
That makes sense, given what
Ciel's khansama told us.

23
00:02:57,358 --> 00:02:59,733
Ciel has no memory
of the recent past...

24
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:01,692
including when we met...

25
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,900
Sebastian said that to keep from
hurting Ciel, we should act

26
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:08,983
as if nothing's happened
until the memories return.

27
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,400
Yes...

28
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:13,108
Apparently he's made the same
request of everyone else

29
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,192
who knows Ciel.

30
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:30,358
"However far I fall, as long as
there's so much as a thread

31
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,275
left to me,
I'll use it to climb.

32
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,608
I'll take hold of it
and refuse to give up.

33
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,608
I am still human...

34
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:37,317
I can do that much"...

35
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,567
Ciel told me that.

36
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,942
Highness...

37
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:42,400
I will not give up either...!

38
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:45,025
I'm going to play my part
perfectly for Ciel.

39
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:47,192
No matter what,
he cannot catch on to us...

40
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,317
Do you understand, Agni?

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,733
Jo ajna, Highness.

42
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,858
A ball, a ball!

43
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,692
We're going to a ball!

44
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,400
A costume ball tonight!

45
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,192
We're going to a ball!

46
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,608
I'm so excited!

47
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:09,608
Yeah, and us servants are
even allowed to come too,

48
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,400
as long as we wear costumes...

49
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,608
Now there's a nice fellow...!

50
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,275
Er, what was the
bloke's name again?

51
00:04:15,358 --> 00:04:16,192
Uh...

52
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:17,942
Trumpet, or something?

53
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,233
No, it was "Lord Trancy!"

54
00:04:22,483 --> 00:04:24,733
Alois Trancy, eh...?

55
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,608
And the previous Earl
Trancy, you said he died

56
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:29,150
questionably three years ago,
is that right?

57
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:30,733
Yes.

58
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,733
Three years ago...

59
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:34,983
Father!

60
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,317
Mother!

61
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,900
Stop it!

62
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,400
Alois' mother
committed suicide...

63
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,442
He was kidnapped
when he was very young...

64
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:48,858
But then...

65
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:51,108
he returned home shortly
before his father passed away...

66
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:53,983
along with a mysterious
new butler...

67
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,108
Is that the whole of it?

68
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,233
Yes...

69
00:04:56,317 --> 00:05:00,192
His story seems
familiar somehow.

70
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:02,025
Indeed. It's a common one.

71
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,900
Right, we servants got to come
in through the back entrance.

72
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:15,525
See you this evening, master.

73
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,192
We've got some
brilliant costumes.

74
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,150
Wait 'til you see 'em sir!

75
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:34,442
The Right Honorable Earl,
Ciel Phantomhive...

76
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,608
We've been expecting you.

77
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,317
Claude Faustus...

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,483
the butler of this estate.

79
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:45,067
Please come in.

80
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:49,817
What's that?

81
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,483
Ah yes.

82
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:57,233
The Trancy coat of arms bears
a spider, so out of respect...

83
00:05:57,317 --> 00:05:58,817
We preserve their lives.

84
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,983
But of course.

85
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,983
Besides, when it
comes to spiders...

86
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,942
the harder you try to kill them,
the faster they cling.

87
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,317
Do come in.

88
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,942
Are you all right, master...?

89
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,233
What is it?

90
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:35,942
It's nothing!

91
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,025
Might my butler come with me?

92
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:39,358
Certainly sir.

93
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,108
Let's go.

94
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:40,942
Yes... quite.

95
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,358
Do forgive me, though...

96
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:45,067
I'm afraid my master is
currently away on business...

97
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,692
He shall return
in time for the ball.

98
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,942
Very well.

99
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,442
I've laid out some tea
and refreshments for you

100
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:51,608
in the drawing room...

101
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:54,233
Everyone else has
already arrived, sir.

102
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,858
Who is "everyone?"

103
00:06:57,442 --> 00:07:00,192
Ooh! Ciel!

104
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,692
Elizabeth?!

105
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:02,608
Ciel...!

106
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:03,733
It's just "Lizzie!"

107
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:06,317
We'd expected
you sooner, my lord.

108
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,317
Lau!

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,275
So you two were invited
to the ball as well.

110
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:13,108
Then surely she's here...

111
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:15,317
Who do you mean?

112
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,567
Madam Red.

113
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,150
I wouldn't think she'd
miss it for the world,

114
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,525
but I don't see her.

115
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:21,608
It's odd for her
to miss a costume ball.

116
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,150
This is precisely the sort
of thing she enjoys.

117
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,608
Yes, about that...

118
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,650
Please Lady Elizabeth,
do try tocalm yourself.

119
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,067
Ciel!

120
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:33,358
My...

121
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:36,483
It's so good
to see you, Ciel!

122
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,067
What in the blazes--...?

123
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,317
Who are you?

124
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Who am I...?

125
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,692
So it is true...!

126
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:44,650
Poor Ciel!

127
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:45,608
Are you mad?

128
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:46,525
Unhand me!

129
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:47,317
Oh dear.

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,567
Is that who I think it is?

131
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,400
Yes, Lady.

132
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:50,525
It's Prince Soma.

133
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:51,900
He'll ruin everything!

134
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,608
Oh, there's no need to worry...

135
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,650
The prince has a very
capable butler to help him.

136
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,567
Highness, you mustn't.

137
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,442
No!

138
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:02,025
Don't take me away from Ciel!

139
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,692
Who is this madman?

140
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,400
Apologies, my lord...

141
00:08:09,483 --> 00:08:11,858
Please meet my master,
the twenty-sixth child

142
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:13,567
of the king of Bengal.

143
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,233
This is Prince Soma
Asman Kadar.

144
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:19,108
Why did this "prince" begin
blubbering the moment he saw me?

145
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:20,983
Oh, Ciel!

146
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,983
It's all so overwhelming.

147
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:25,150
His Highness is deeply
moved to meet the founder

148
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:26,483
of the Funtom Company...

149
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:29,025
Where we come from, the
toys your company produces

150
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,400
are considered precious.

151
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:33,442
No matter what, I will
always have my memories!

152
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,858
As the prince said, those
toys are very deeply tied

153
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:37,400
to important memories.

154
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,733
The world may change, but our
friendship will never fade!

155
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,650
Memories regarding a
certain friend who was

156
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,900
dear to the prince
in his childhood...

157
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,525
But this friend...

158
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:48,150
It's too awful...!

159
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:49,692
I'm sorry...

160
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,733
my prince!

161
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:54,108
Agni!!

162
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,733
I fear there's nothing
we can do for them now...

163
00:08:58,817 --> 00:08:59,817
Young master...

164
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,233
I suggest that we retire...?

165
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:03,233
We need to prepare
ourselves for the ball...

166
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:04,442
Come along, now.

167
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,275
Ciel...!

168
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:09,858
Ciel!

169
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:15,067
What a strange pair.

170
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,025
Foreigners' traditions
can be baffling indeed, sir.

171
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,650
Sebastian, search this
mansion from top to bottom...

172
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:38,900
Understood?

173
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,358
My Lord.

174
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,358
That's shit...

175
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,192
and so is that.

176
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,233
This one too...

177
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:55,400
and this.

178
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,317
You have got to be joking...!

179
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,608
Ugh!

180
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:11,358
Is he here?

181
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:13,525
Lord Phantomhive has arrived.

182
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:16,358
I was choosing a costume...

183
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,692
You should do the same...

184
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,317
Perhaps this one.

185
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,108
Olé!

186
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:38,650
All of these costumes
are bloody useless!

187
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,608
Now, strip, Hannah.

188
00:11:22,192 --> 00:11:24,275
Claude, I assume
everything is in order.

189
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:25,025
Yes.

190
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,108
I transform them...

191
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,817
Day to night,
pleasure to pain...

192
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,692
and waltzes into requiems...

193
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,983
That's what makes me
a Trancy butler.

194
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,025
Welcome to my home,
Ciel Phantomhive...

195
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:38,317
I will show you a lovely time.

196
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:54,900
Ciel!

197
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:57,400
...You wear one of
these too, ok?

198
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,650
Fine.

199
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,275
Now we match!

200
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:13,067
Jingle, jingle!

201
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,192
You're not wearing
a costume, Highness?

202
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:17,817
Of course I am.

203
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,733
Sherlock Holmes
at your service.

204
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,942
Look, Master!

205
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,608
We're the three creatures
from The Journey to the West.

206
00:12:24,692 --> 00:12:26,067
I'm the magic monkey!

207
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,233
Do you like it master?
Pretty neat, eh?

208
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:30,692
We even had
a costume made for you!

209
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,275
Ta-da!

210
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,858
It's not happening.

211
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,192
Maybe just this part of it?

212
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,900
Tonight's party promises
to be an amusing affair,

213
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:47,150
don't you think, Ran-Mao?

214
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,233
This is an immaculate room.

215
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:02,567
Everything is perfect, from the
neatness of the bedclothes

216
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,817
to the placement
of the artwork.

217
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,942
I can tell how much care you
took to properly prepare it.

218
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,275
I find it most educational.

219
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,067
I'm pleased to be of help.

220
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,900
Though I find your willingness
to stoop to petty thievery

221
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:17,983
in service to your
master more impressive.

222
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,525
You flatter me.

223
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,400
I will not let you
have my master...

224
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,150
I am his butler...

225
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,275
Come hell or high water,
that remains.

226
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:33,108
My master's orders
are absolute.

227
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:36,192
You see, I'm one hell
of a butler too.

228
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,775
If you'll excuse me.

229
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:49,942
Maybe we should be
helping out, too.

230
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,650
We are servants after all.

231
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,608
That's a good idea.

232
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:55,650
We'll show them what the
Phantomhive household

233
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:56,525
is made of.

234
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,025
Are you with me?

235
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,150
Uh...

236
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,317
it was the meat...

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
I was choppin' it, you see.

238
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:13,483
I just wanted to help carry.

239
00:14:38,983 --> 00:14:40,567
Sorry.

240
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,400
Oi...

241
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,817
Those blokes are quite good.

242
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,858
Oh, wow...!

243
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:45,358
That's amazing!

244
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:47,608
Blimey.

245
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:49,483
Thank you so much!

246
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,858
Are you all right?

247
00:14:54,483 --> 00:14:55,858
I'm terribly sorry.

248
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh, it's nothing...

249
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:57,900
Don't worry about it.

250
00:14:57,983 --> 00:14:58,900
Oh...

251
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:00,733
I'd hate it if
I'd left a stain.

252
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:04,858
Please...

253
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:06,317
follow me.

254
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,775
All finished.

255
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,150
Finished?

256
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,692
Lovely, blue ring.

257
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:33,900
I wonder...

258
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,858
Does your soul turn this
color when you die?

259
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,317
What now?

260
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,108
That same blue.

261
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,525
The same lovely
color as your ring.

262
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:48,858
What are you on about?

263
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:51,733
I wonder, Lord Phantomhive,
if we were one...

264
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,067
If we were...

265
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,108
could I have that same
elusive blue for my soul?

266
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,150
Hiding a little secret,
were we?

267
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:08,067
Hey wait!

268
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:23,942
Honestly, what can
be done with you three?

269
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:24,483
Well...

270
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,692
we are sorry.

271
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,608
Very, very sorry.

272
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:28,858
My prince.

273
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:31,275
Ah, Watson...

274
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,317
they're done?

275
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,650
Who's Watson?

276
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,817
Me.

277
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:38,608
Oh...

278
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,317
the famous curry bread.

279
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,067
But how were you
able to make them?

280
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,025
Earlier, I took the liberty of
borrowing the mansion's kitchen.

281
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:46,775
If Ciel has a taste
of some of these,

282
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:49,067
perhaps his memory
will return...

283
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,567
At least, I hope so.

284
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:52,775
We can help them.

285
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,775
We can try to show the master
such a good time that

286
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:57,275
all his memories come
back to him, yes we can!

287
00:16:57,358 --> 00:16:58,483
Yes.

288
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,483
Excellent...

289
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,400
We will all
work together then!

290
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:04,150
Wait...

291
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,233
What's this I'm hearing?

292
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,983
The earl has amnesia...?
My goodness...

293
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,025
Where was I?

294
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,692
You just now realized?

295
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,358
Poor Ciel.

296
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,483
Where did he
run off to, anyway?

297
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:26,817
That's odd...

298
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,942
I feel like I've
been here before...

299
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:29,942
No...

300
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,692
that doesn't make sense.

301
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:53,733
Sebastian?

302
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:56,733
It's "New Moon Drop."People
say that tea leaves plucked

303
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:59,900
at the full moon give off
a clear, sweet smell...

304
00:17:59,983 --> 00:18:02,192
These are the opposite,
however, having been plucked

305
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:03,692
at the new moon...

306
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:05,983
Their indistinct aroma
can bring a mind to total,

307
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,067
bottomless darkness.

308
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,983
It has another name...

309
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:21,483
It is called the
"soul's temperature...

310
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,817
Sebastian!

311
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,317
Not quite yet.

312
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,525
No need to get prickly.

313
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:34,317
I promise I'll
show it to you...

314
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,067
But one thing first.

315
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,483
That's right.

316
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:44,358
First, you'll hand over that
trunk, Sebastian Michaelis!

317
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,025
Don't kill him!

318
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:07,608
I want him alive!

319
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:09,275
Catch him, Claude!

320
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,400
Ciel Phantomhive?

321
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,108
I finally have you...!

322
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,525
You're mine!

323
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:31,900
What's wrong?

324
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:38,483
Trouble breathing...?

325
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:40,025
Does it hurt...?

326
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:44,400
If you'd like, I'd be happy
to lick it all better for you.

327
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,983
--Let me lick your wounds.
--I've had enough.

328
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,067
Stop this farce...

329
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,025
Alois Trancy!

330
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,067
So you figured it out...

331
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,608
What a bore.

332
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:57,983
I figured if you got me alone,
you'd find the courage

333
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,067
to make a move.

334
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,108
That's why you followed me...?

335
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:03,442
Really?

336
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,358
Well, I can't allow you
to underestimate me.

337
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:15,733
My young master
is quite right.

338
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:22,067
Claude, I do believe
I gave you warning earlier...

339
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,317
Do you recall?

340
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,483
Now, now...

341
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,900
we only wanted to chat
someplace quieter.

342
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,025
Must be important
to do all this...

343
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:31,942
You're dressed up
like a woman...

344
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:34,275
What could you
possibly want so badly?

345
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:34,858
Simple.

346
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,400
I want you.

347
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:37,817
What's that mean?
"You want me."

348
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,858
It means precisely
what I said...

349
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,067
I want you...

350
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,358
You're mine,
Ciel Phantomhive...

351
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,567
and if you refuse...

352
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,192
Everyone in there
will be killed.

353
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,108
I've arranged
a small performance.

354
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:57,233
If that performance begins...

355
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,983
then they will die.

356
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:01,317
Every last one of them.

357
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,567
What will it be?

358
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,317
You may do as you wish.

359
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,442
You're sure about that?

360
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:24,192
Yes...

361
00:21:24,275 --> 00:21:25,567
if you can, of course...

362
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,900
Now, there's something
I'd like to ask of you.

363
00:21:27,983 --> 00:21:28,858
Is there...?

364
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,692
I will be happy to oblige...

365
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:34,150
Right after you bend down
and kiss my arse, that is.

366
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,817
I don't think it's your
arse that will be kissed.

367
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,942
Very confident, aren't we?

368
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:44,317
Getting cocky because your
butler has a little talent...

369
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,192
That's a mistake...

370
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,900
I have my Claude here...

371
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,608
You're not alone.

372
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:55,067
Yes, I expected as much.

373
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,442
You will abide by our
contract, Sebastian...

374
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:00,692
You will serve me...

375
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:02,400
You will protect me...

376
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,942
You will see that I stay
alive until I have achieved

377
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,692
my ultimate goal.

378
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:09,525
Of course.

379
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:10,858
I have been your loyal
servant since the day

380
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,817
our pact was made, master...

381
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,025
I will do anything you ask,
grant any wish you make...

382
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:18,483
until the day our
contract is fulfilled...

383
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:19,817
and I take your soul.

384
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,317
An excellent answer.

385
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,108
Hoheo taralna,
rondero tarel...

386
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:26,192
Now Claude.

387
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:28,025
You will get Ciel for me.

388
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:29,983
Sebastian, this is an order...

389
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,483
Do whatever it takes
to protect me...

390
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:33,983
Do not fail.

391
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:34,858
Yes...

392
00:22:34,942 --> 00:22:36,192
your highness.

393
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:37,900
Yes...

394
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:39,317
my lord.

395
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:15,400
My young master's soul
emits a heady aroma...

396
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:17,567
a scent that
intoxicates demons...

397
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,650
drives them mad...

398
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:20,650
impels them to battle...

399
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,983
Music shall play,
captivating all...

400
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:25,775
and secrets shall be revealed.

401
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,067
Next time: "Bedewed Butler"

402
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:31,400
Certainly I can resolve
a prickly situation

403
00:24:31,483 --> 00:24:33,025
in ten minutes, master...

404
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:36,233
Otherwise, what kind
of butler would I be?
