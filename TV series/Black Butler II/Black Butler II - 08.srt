1
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:17,025
Hoheo taralna, rondero tarel.

2
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:19,650
Hoheo taralna, rondero tarel...

3
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,733
Hoheo taralna, rondero tarel...

4
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:24,983
Hoheo taralna...

5
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:33,108
Pardon, master.

6
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:35,900
I'll change your bandages
if you'll allow me to.

7
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,692
You aren't of any use to me...

8
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,275
Get out and call Claude.

9
00:00:44,358 --> 00:00:45,692
Certainly master.

10
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,067
I'll go at once.

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,942
I've seen eyes like that before.

12
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:57,733
Eyes that make your skin burn.

13
00:01:01,483 --> 00:01:03,942
Excuse me, master...

14
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,483
Might I change your bandages?

15
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:13,317
That brat...

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,067
He could have done
a better job of stabbing me.

17
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,233
Indeed.

18
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:18,983
He used more force
than he could control,

19
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:21,275
and that threw
his trajectory off.

20
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:24,733
If he'd remained calm, he could
have managed a deeper wound.

21
00:01:24,817 --> 00:01:25,942
Interesting...

22
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:27,733
The way you say that
almost makes it sound

23
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,692
like you wish he had.

24
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:30,358
No...

25
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,150
It's not that.

26
00:01:33,608 --> 00:01:36,483
It's just that the clumsy
artlessness of the cut suggests

27
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:39,900
a certain purity.

28
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:41,483
Purity.

29
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,025
Yes.

30
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,317
Say, do you fancy
the smell of my blood...?

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,358
Does it make you want to feast?

32
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:51,567
Yes...

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,358
it certainly does.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,150
Now, if you'll
excuse me, my lord.

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,650
What...

36
00:02:01,733 --> 00:02:04,525
what was that?

37
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:07,358
A smile...? From Claude?

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,983
That's...

39
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,692
sickening...

40
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,400
You're out of bed?

41
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:26,692
Take me...

42
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:30,900
Take me...

43
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:32,317
I need to see...

44
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,150
Ciel...

45
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,858
I need to see
Ciel Phantomhive...

46
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,650
Take me to him!

47
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:27,692
Come back!

48
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:28,942
That's my father's!

49
00:05:33,983 --> 00:05:34,858
Cripes...

50
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:36,317
There's not much here.

51
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:39,108
Brother...

52
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,775
do you think this is medicine?

53
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,442
Chuck it.

54
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,692
I wonder if he'll be
all right without it...

55
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:46,942
I mean, do you think
he's going to die?

56
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,192
Eh, I doubt it...

57
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:49,983
Besides, what do
we care if he does?

58
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,775
He's a dotty old man.

59
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:57,025
What happened?

60
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,025
It was the baker.

61
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,775
He threw a stone at me.

62
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,108
That bloody sod!

63
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm okay.

64
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:13,025
It's not just him...

65
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,442
It's all of them...

66
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:15,358
They can...

67
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,400
They can all just drop dead!

68
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,858
As soon our parents died,
everyone treated us

69
00:06:20,942 --> 00:06:22,983
like nuisances.

70
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,608
I wish they'd die...!

71
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,400
Every last one of them!

72
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,942
I'm sure your wish
will come true, brother.

73
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:31,817
I know it will.

74
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,233
It's gotta...!

75
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:35,233
After all, you can eat
three kidney pies at a time...

76
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:37,567
and run faster than
Spring Heeled Jack...

77
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,108
Run, run, run,
run, run aaand...

78
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,400
jump!

79
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,442
Yeah, you can do terrific
stuff, so you'll get

80
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:45,150
lots of terrific wishes!

81
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:46,358
Listen...

82
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:47,692
Luka...

83
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,317
you have to stick with me
always from now on...

84
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,900
If anyone throws a stone
at you I'll throw a pile

85
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:53,358
of horse manure at them...

86
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:54,608
Understood?

87
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,067
Yes...

88
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,733
Your...

89
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,108
Highness.

90
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,692
What happened here?

91
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,775
They're all dead.

92
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:30,775
But how?

93
00:07:30,858 --> 00:07:32,525
That old man
with the medicine...

94
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:34,983
That sodding baker
who threw stones at you.

95
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,400
And that lady who used to
throw rubbish at our house.

96
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:38,650
Miz Lila.

97
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,983
And the rotten vicar who
would always spit on us!

98
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:44,775
And the shoe-shiner
who'd brag about his sweets.

99
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:47,358
Him too?

100
00:07:47,442 --> 00:07:50,108
All the bounders who were
so nasty to us are dead.

101
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:51,608
Every last one of them...!

102
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:53,358
Dead good and proper!

103
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,775
Everyone,
everything, is all gone!

104
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:57,400
Gone!

105
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,650
Come on...!

106
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,275
With them outta the way, all
their stuff belongs to us now!

107
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,692
Pearls don't
suit you, old lady!

108
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:25,733
You ever look in a mirror?

109
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:34,233
Luka...!

110
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:35,650
It's time to go home.

111
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,233
Luka?

112
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:43,650
Darkness.

113
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,400
Without a single
beam of moonlight...

114
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,900
So dark.

115
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:53,900
Luka!

116
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:55,858
There you are!

117
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,358
I was calling you.

118
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,900
Come on, wake up.
What's wrong with you?

119
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:08,817
No.

120
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,733
No...

121
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,608
Please, no...!

122
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,900
Don't leave me alone!

123
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,900
Please don't!

124
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:24,400
Quite a group today.

125
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,567
That's Her Majesty's
spider for you.

126
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,025
Ensnaring hapless innocents
like they're so many flies.

127
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:33,025
Poor things know
they're caught in his web?

128
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:36,567
He'll drain them of every
last drop of their purity.

129
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,317
Truly terrible.

130
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:41,525
Next!

131
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:47,275
Move on.

132
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,858
Your eyes disgust me, boy...!

133
00:10:07,942 --> 00:10:09,692
When I look at them,
I can scarcely think

134
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,192
of more than filthy rain water

135
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:17,692
Next!

136
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,192
There are these fairies, see.

137
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,608
All you have to do is
make a pact with them,

138
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,650
and they'll grant
you any wish you want.

139
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,483
Cut it out...

140
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,025
Are you a bloody idiot...?
Didn't you hear what

141
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,817
the old man is
going to do to us?

142
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,025
But...

143
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,817
How do you do it?

144
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,025
A spider's web
wet with morning dew.

145
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:01,900
Like a veil that
hides your true face.

146
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,567
Hoheo taralna...

147
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,192
rondero tarel.

148
00:11:15,817 --> 00:11:17,317
Useless story.

149
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:22,275
Is this snow?

150
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:25,983
Ash...

151
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:47,192
What is your wish?

152
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:48,025
Wish...?

153
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:48,775
What...?

154
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:49,608
What wish...?

155
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:50,567
I...

156
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,150
Your wish.

157
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,733
Why would you call me
if you didn't have one...?

158
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,192
Perhaps there is someone
you'd like to get even with.

159
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,233
I hated all the villagers.

160
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,692
But they're all dead...

161
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,692
And I don't care
about that old pervert...

162
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,192
I'll escape...

163
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:08,900
except I don't have
anywhere to go back to...

164
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,233
nowhere.

165
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:11,275
In that case...

166
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:12,983
you have no business
with me, do you?

167
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,567
Yes!

168
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,692
All right then, but you have
to tell me what your wish is.

169
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,067
Well?

170
00:12:23,692 --> 00:12:25,150
As I thought.

171
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,733
If you can determine a wish...

172
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,358
I shall make
a contract with you.

173
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:43,567
Hold on...!

174
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,400
Tell me, are you a fairy?

175
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,733
I am a demon.

176
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,650
A demon...

177
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:14,025
Finding a wish.

178
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:18,025
That became what
I never knew I didn't have...

179
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:20,067
A purpose for my life.

180
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,192
Another of my
dolls has broken?!

181
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,733
Yes...

182
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:27,025
I'm afraid that several more
have collapsed from infection,

183
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:28,567
my lord.

184
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,942
Don't you know how fragile they
are...? Soak the entire room

185
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,942
in anti septic solution!

186
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,483
I beg your pardon, lord...

187
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,275
I've prepared Jim
for you today.

188
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,692
Jim...!

189
00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,233
Is that filthy brat really
all you have to offer me?

190
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:59,067
Is this real?

191
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,317
You're him?

192
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:09,025
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

193
00:14:09,108 --> 00:14:11,358
...Forgive me, father dearest.

194
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,442
Sebastian Michaelis.

195
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:19,067
Is he a demon too?

196
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,442
Yes, that's right...

197
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,900
It was he who wiped out
your village pursuant to

198
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,317
a contract with
a certain individual.

199
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,900
And who might that be?

200
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,942
Sebastian has already
eaten his soul.

201
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,192
A demon killed him...

202
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,358
Luka.

203
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,358
Now there is Ciel Phantomhive.

204
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:41,817
He is the human party
to Sebastian's new contract.

205
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,317
With this particular
soul, Sebastian has

206
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,108
a singular obsession...

207
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:51,442
One fiercer than he should
by rights feel for his prey.

208
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,775
Hoheo taralna...

209
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,108
rondero tarel.

210
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,525
Hoheo taralna...

211
00:14:57,608 --> 00:14:59,025
rondero tarel.

212
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,650
I order you to make
this "Ciel" mine.

213
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:11,775
Master.

214
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:19,275
Oh, Father!

215
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:20,733
Father!

216
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,900
According to your orders,
master, I have freed the boys.

217
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:28,608
And I've seen
to the inheritance.

218
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:29,483
Fine.

219
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,108
But what about Ciel Phantomhive?

220
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,942
May I ask a question?

221
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,400
Why would you like to
possess Ciel Phantomhive

222
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:41,733
rather than kill Sebastian?

223
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,733
Simply killing
him isn't enough.

224
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,775
After death, he would just
peacefully rot into a skeleton

225
00:15:47,858 --> 00:15:49,400
in some patch of earth...

226
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:51,817
No, that's too good for him...

227
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,775
You see, I want him to know
an agony worse than death.

228
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,192
The boy's the key.

229
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:03,233
We'll use the 'young master
Ciel' he fancies so much.

230
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:05,108
Magnificent.

231
00:16:05,192 --> 00:16:07,858
Ciel Phantomhive is mine.

232
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:08,567
Mine...

233
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,442
and so are you, Claude.

234
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:12,692
Yes...

235
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,025
Your Highness.

236
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,650
Hello!

237
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,275
Who are you?

238
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:35,275
What a shame...

239
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:37,275
Babes in arms are
no fun at all...

240
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,233
We'll do this quickly, then...

241
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:40,442
Let's see...

242
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:41,608
Jim Macken...

243
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:43,067
that's your real name...

244
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,608
My, what a dreary name...

245
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,108
Well, no matter I suppose...

246
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:48,442
You are at death's grim door...

247
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,525
aren't you?

248
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,650
Now, normally I wouldn't
leave the office just

249
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,233
for something like this...

250
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:58,442
but, as it happens, we have
a teensy issue with your soul.

251
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:03,817
This looks bad.

252
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,983
Ugh, I knew it was a demon.

253
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,442
You're not just
a pretty face, then...

254
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,108
Where'd you get
something like her?

255
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,150
Hannah, kill ginger
here, would you?

256
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:18,400
Hot-blooded little
nipper, aren't you?

257
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:19,733
I don't want a fight.

258
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,942
I just want t--

259
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:35,108
All right, then, but I'd better
be paid overtime for this.

260
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:42,692
Claude...

261
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:45,900
Don't look at me!

262
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,858
You lot make me sick!

263
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,233
You demon...!

264
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:51,067
You're just like him!

265
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,983
Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,858
Don't say that!

267
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:02,650
"Yes...

268
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,567
Your Highness."

269
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,358
Yes...

270
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,067
Your...

271
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,108
Highness.

272
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:07,942
"Yes...

273
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:08,442
Your...

274
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:09,442
Highness."

275
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:10,067
Yes...

276
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,983
Your...

277
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,608
Highness.

278
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:14,275
I changed my mind...

279
00:18:14,358 --> 00:18:15,692
Say it...

280
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:16,692
Now!

281
00:18:18,858 --> 00:18:19,608
Yes...

282
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,025
Your Highness.

283
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,358
Would you do
anything to obey me?

284
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:40,442
Are you a pet?

285
00:18:40,525 --> 00:18:43,025
My loyal dog?!

286
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,192
I abide by our contract.

287
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,567
I'll make one hell
of a feast out of you.

288
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,067
That's all.

289
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,900
Then look at me like that...

290
00:18:51,983 --> 00:18:54,900
Not the way I would look
at some villager's face.

291
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:01,942
And not with the craving look
the old man would give me.

292
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,483
Look the way you
did that day...

293
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:07,233
Like I am all
you care about...

294
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:08,733
Please, Claude!

295
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:10,525
Hesitation into resolve...

296
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,358
passion into composure...

297
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,608
love into grave markers...

298
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:18,025
That, master, is what
makes a Trancy butler.

299
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:19,567
He's just hungry...

300
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,275
That's it...

301
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,108
I know that well enough.

302
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:25,108
My feelings are nothing more
than a poorly made sauce

303
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:26,608
clouding the flavor.

304
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:30,525
But...

305
00:19:30,608 --> 00:19:32,067
now I'm here.

306
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,275
A little maid like you
should know better than

307
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:52,108
to go causing me trouble.

308
00:19:57,067 --> 00:20:00,150
What are you trying
to do, master...?..

309
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,900
Why are you here?

310
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,483
Your goal is incomplete.

311
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,692
You do not yet
have Ciel Phantomhive.

312
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:12,192
It's just you now...

313
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,108
You're all that I have.

314
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,525
Come now, master...

315
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,442
Don't say such
ridiculous things.

316
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,400
Shut up...

317
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:18,900
shut up...

318
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:21,733
shut up...!

319
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,608
You're the only one...!

320
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:25,275
You're all that I have!

321
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:29,358
Hoheo taralna, rondero tarel...

322
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:31,442
You can't ever leave my side...!

323
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:32,275
Never...

324
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,275
not you...

325
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,817
please, Claude...!
Do you know...

326
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,025
I think you...

327
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,983
You're my highness!

328
00:20:51,108 --> 00:20:53,567
What a thing
to say to a butler.

329
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,400
Don't worry, master...

330
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,733
Have no fear.

331
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,650
Your's is a crass soul
who would give his love

332
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,858
to a butler...

333
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,942
I could hardly work up
an appetite for that...

334
00:21:19,025 --> 00:21:20,108
I'll keep you.

335
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,567
I can use your soul...

336
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,775
Indeed, I can.

337
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,817
So that's what's going on.

338
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:30,733
Yes...

339
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,233
that boy was slated
to die tonight,

340
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,775
but the soul ledgers
weren't affected...

341
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:35,942
Well...

342
00:21:36,025 --> 00:21:38,650
I did assume that
a demon was involved.

343
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,317
Will you be taking him,
grim reaper?

344
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,608
I just need to keep
the accounts balanced...

345
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:46,900
I'd just as soon watch
how this all plays out.

346
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:47,817
You see...

347
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,608
I think it will
be interesting.

348
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:52,650
So does that mean you have
not taken Sebastian's side?

349
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:56,483
"Taken his side?" Please don't
insult me with such an idea.

350
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:59,650
The only true way for me to
prove my love to dear Bassy

351
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,483
is with a death match!

352
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:36,358
I know it will.

353
00:23:36,442 --> 00:23:38,150
It's gotta...!

354
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:40,817
You can do terrific stuff,
so you'll get lots

355
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,067
of terrific wishes!

356
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:53,150
And now...

357
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,900
Shall we discover
your wish, my lord?

358
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,150
How did you enjoy your
first time plunging

359
00:24:15,233 --> 00:24:19,483
a blade into human flesh...?
Dear me, it's not like you

360
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,108
to be so indecisive, master...

361
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:25,275
Best not to show even
the slightest weakness...

362
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:26,983
You never know when
a demon might creep

363
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:28,817
in to take advantage.

364
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,775
Next time: "Hollow Butler"
If my daily fluid intake

365
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,567
wasn't at least two liters...

366
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,650
what kind of
butler would I be?
