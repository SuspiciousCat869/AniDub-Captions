1
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:19,775
Everyone is here, I trust?

2
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,942
For those who don't know, my
name is William T. Spears...

3
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:33,025
I'm your instructor...

4
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:34,233
here to mould you...

5
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,983
to whip you into shape.

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,525
I will be with you for the
duration of your training

7
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,108
as new recruits...

8
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:42,442
Should you find
something unclear,

9
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,900
feel free to come
to me with questions.

10
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:49,275
As my shift ends at six o'clock,
I'll answer any questions

11
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,275
asked before five thirty.

12
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:52,900
Now, to be--

13
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,442
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,025
Aren't you also
an instructor, Grell?

15
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,942
Oh, honey, you know
I'm not into children.

16
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:04,483
They just aren't my thing.

17
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:05,650
But you...

18
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,900
you I could nibble
on any day of the week.

19
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:12,275
It's been ever so long
since we were together.

20
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:12,942
Much...

21
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:13,317
too...

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,900
long.

23
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:17,817
The personnel department must've
collectively lost their minds.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,983
You know how much I love it when
you play hard to get, Will!

25
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,150
Recruits...

26
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,608
we'll start with a tour
of the facilities.

27
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,858
The higher ups compile a
soul collection list so that

28
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:44,608
we grim reapers can screen those
who have been marked 'to-die'.

29
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:46,900
Using our death scythes,
we check each individual's

30
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,108
memories--their
Cinematic Records.

31
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,108
A human's Cinematic
Record contains

32
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,317
his entire life experience...

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,942
Based on it,
we determine whether

34
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:57,900
that person deserves death...

35
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:01,733
and if he does, it falls to us
reapers to collect his soul.

36
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:06,025
Okay, but are there really any
humans who don't deserve death?

37
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,983
There are some capable
of benefitting the world.

38
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,442
People whose continued
existence may bring about

39
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:14,108
a desirable change in the
world are sometimes removed

40
00:02:14,192 --> 00:02:16,233
from the list and
allowed to live.

41
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:22,192
However, that is much more
the exception than the rule...

42
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,733
We merely double-check
the list to be certain

43
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:26,858
no grave mistakes are made.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
We follow orders
from on high...

45
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,650
We don't ask questions...

46
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,317
or make errors.

47
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:40,608
This is the
administrative department...

48
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:43,483
They oversee the To-Die list
and the souls collected.

49
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:49,442
Personnel, in charge
of Association staff.

50
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:52,358
General Affairs, in charge
of equipment and such.

51
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:57,858
I got a table at that
French restaurant.

52
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,608
My shift?

53
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,567
Nah, I'll be done
with time to spare!

54
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:04,317
Here's Collections.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,567
They actually harvest
the souls onsite.

56
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,900
And finally...

57
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:15,442
Spectacles.

58
00:03:17,775 --> 00:03:19,567
Right.

59
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,358
Bottom.

60
00:03:21,442 --> 00:03:22,442
Top-

61
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:23,983
Here they handle
all your glasses needs.

62
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:27,108
It is the backbone of the Grim
Reaper Staffing Association.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,525
Ooh...!

64
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,567
My heart always goes
wobbly at this sight!

65
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,858
Who's the old man?

66
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,233
That old man is the
department head.

67
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,233
Lawrence Anderson.

68
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:49,108
Most call him Pops.

69
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,567
Him, really...?

70
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,108
He's the legendary
craftsman who makes

71
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,525
all the reapers' spectacles?

72
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,150
So from now on,
we'll get to wear glasses

73
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,650
made by the master?!

74
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:59,317
I, for one, would like a new
pair as soon as possible...

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,942
These new-recruit
models are horribly dull.

76
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,150
You lads are nowhere near
ready to wear Pops's glasses.

77
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,275
You've got a long,
long way to go yet.

78
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,733
In this, he's correct.

79
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,692
Only those who have
passed the final exam

80
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:15,067
are permitted to wear
his spectacles.

81
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,275
Basically...

82
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:17,733
they're a sort of proof
that you have become

83
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,733
a full-fledged reaper.

84
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,483
The final exam, sir...

85
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,733
what's it like?

86
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,150
At the end of your
training period,

87
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,733
you will form groups of two...

88
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,317
Together, you will be
tasked with screening

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,942
and collecting a soul.

90
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:31,358
You will be judged on
efficiency and accuracy...

91
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:32,692
That is the exam.

92
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,192
Screening and collecting?

93
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,025
Right out of the gate?

94
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,442
I don't know about you...

95
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,317
This year's recruits
seem a bit spineless.

96
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,900
If they fail, we'll just
start over with a new group.

97
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,275
You're every bit as cold
and cruel as ever, Will!

98
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,400
Just like you were
on that magical day.

99
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:49,817
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,442
Surely you remember...

101
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,442
I know I could
never forget it.

102
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:58,650
Yes...! Our first time
together...! What pure bliss!

103
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,733
I would forget it
if I could, trust me.

104
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:04,192
Ah, but the memory is
forever etched upon my body...

105
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:06,567
I tremble at the very thought!

106
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:09,608
--Honestly!
--You thrust into me

107
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,567
from above and from below.
Face to face and behind!

108
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,442
I thought for sure
my body would give out!

109
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,817
We have tallied the results
from the practical portion

110
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,358
of your exam.

111
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:27,317
Grell Sutcliff, you have a
triple A in practical skills,

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,275
a B on written exams,
and a C in ethics,

113
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,650
giving you an A average.

114
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,192
William T. Spears...

115
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,108
you have straight Bs
in practical skills,

116
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:39,817
written exams, and ethics,
giving you a B average.

117
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,108
It's obscene...

118
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:44,608
I have an A average.

119
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:46,942
How can you possibly pair me
with that B-average cretin?!

120
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,525
I don't recall
asking for your opinion.

121
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,275
In case you weren't
listening properly,

122
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:54,192
the only as you received
were in practical skills.

123
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,275
I rather think that's
enough, don't you...?

124
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:59,317
Practical skills are more
important than anything else...

125
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Perhaps you'd like
a demonstration...

126
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:04,067
I can show you
my skills personally.

127
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,108
Don't be ridiculous.

128
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:06,233
Put that away.

129
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:07,733
You're already
on thin ice already.

130
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,900
You'd best not cause problems.

131
00:06:09,983 --> 00:06:11,150
It won't work...

132
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,233
I need to be partnered
with a real man,

133
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:15,567
one who can milk me
for all I'm worth.

134
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,150
The human is scheduled
to die one month hence...

135
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,650
You both shall spend that month
working together to determine

136
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,733
whether or not he deserves the
death that he's slated for...

137
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:27,608
Naturally, you're free to
present your conclusion

138
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:29,483
before the month ends.

139
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:32,150
Here is the data
you'll need on the target...

140
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,108
We wish you good luck.

141
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:34,942
Fine...

142
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,608
just don't get in my way.

143
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:37,775
Right...

144
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:39,567
I shall do my utmost...

145
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,525
I look forward
to working with you.

146
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,233
The living world
is always so filthy!

147
00:06:58,275 --> 00:06:59,317
I've found him.

148
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,942
That's our man.

149
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,483
That's Thomas Wallis...

150
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:05,317
Born in Bristol in 1775...

151
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,483
He's an aspiring novelist.

152
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:09,067
A novelist, eh...?

153
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,400
How dreadfully typical.

154
00:07:10,483 --> 00:07:11,983
He's probably poor
and talentless,

155
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:14,233
with no love life to speak of.

156
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:15,692
Well, that's that.

157
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,317
This one's cleared for death.

158
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,817
We should use all the time
allotted to investigate.

159
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,775
Oh my...

160
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,942
Mr. B average is talking back.

161
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,650
How fabulous.

162
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:43,233
Well, anything else to say?

163
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:45,483
They gave us a month
to complete the exam...

164
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:46,692
This is our first screening.

165
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,942
I think we should
observe him further...

166
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:53,817
If we make a mistake on this,
it could ruin both our careers.

167
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,692
You're a dreadfully dull.

168
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,983
Do what you like...

169
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,817
but I'm telling you,
it's a waste of our time.

170
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,067
So...

171
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,025
when is the collection
scheduled for, again?

172
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,567
In one month,
on December 16th...

173
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,483
at four o'clock
in the afternoon...

174
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,192
We should get to work.

175
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,650
Observation log
of William T. Spears.

176
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:22,358
Target Thomas Wallis is an
earnest, hard-working young man.

177
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,150
He spends each day working at
the printer's and each night

178
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:28,733
at the boardinghouse,
writing his novels.

179
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:31,108
He's submitted
his work to publishers.

180
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,692
But has had no success.

181
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,567
He works to support
his writing,

182
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,400
and he submits his
manuscripts to publishers...

183
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,442
That seems to be
his entire life.

184
00:08:57,608 --> 00:08:59,067
Hey, dullard!

185
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,442
What are you wearing?

186
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,067
Never mind my attire...

187
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,400
Now...

188
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:09,983
are you ready to stamp
the kid's file yet or not?

189
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:12,150
I've only been
at this for three days.

190
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:13,733
Isn't that enough...?

191
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,358
I'm tired of
the living world.

192
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:18,150
I haven't seen a single
attractive man here...

193
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,025
Hurry up and
make your decision.

194
00:09:20,108 --> 00:09:21,608
All right, I will.

195
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,567
Good afternoon...

196
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,817
Don't get up...?

197
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
I am William T. Spears
at your service, sir.

198
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:32,067
Uh...

199
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,317
What?!

200
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,192
You may wish to edit this.

201
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,025
Your prose is
a tad roundabout.

202
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:42,650
You know it's funny,
the publisher told me

203
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,358
pretty much the same thing.

204
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:47,358
What the devil
are you playing at?

205
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,400
You told me to hurry.

206
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:49,525
That's what I'm doing.

207
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:51,525
This isn't what I meant.

208
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:52,817
Are you an idiot?!

209
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,150
Nothing in the test
instructions forbids us

210
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,192
from contacting
the target directly.

211
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:58,442
Uh...

212
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,150
why are you walking
around with sickles?

213
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,150
They're death
scythes, actually.

214
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:06,442
Quit talking!

215
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,692
Oh, a death scythe...

216
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,483
hold on, do you mean
like the Grim Reaper

217
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,025
carries in all the legends...?

218
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:11,900
Is that it?

219
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:12,775
Yes...

220
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,567
Actually, we are grim reapers.

221
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:16,608
Huh?

222
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:18,233
Yes sir...

223
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,067
I'm afraid you're scheduled to
die in the very near future...

224
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,942
So we've come to
investigate whether or not

225
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:25,858
you really ought to pass away--

226
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:28,650
I should have killed you
the first time I saw you.

227
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,650
Again, none of the
instructions forbid us

228
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,150
from identifying
ourselves to the target.

229
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,150
Because only an
idiot would do so!

230
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,358
Ah...!

231
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:37,525
I understand now.

232
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:39,233
You're actors, aren't you?

233
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,900
And this must be some new
form of avant-garde theatre

234
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,817
with audience
participation, right?

235
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,650
Be quiet...!

236
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:46,233
Stay out of this, boy!

237
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:47,358
You're so pretty!

238
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,108
You were made to be onstage!

239
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,817
Your flame-red hair
and porcelain skin...

240
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,108
I've never seen a man
so beautiful in my life!

241
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,400
London truly is
a city of wonders!

242
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:01,275
Oh, yes!

243
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:03,525
All the world's a stage,
and I am a player,

244
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,442
navigating the brutal, bloody
battlefield that is love...

245
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:07,567
Yes...!

246
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,192
Man and man together
in a tragic play!

247
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:21,192
Thanks to your interference,
I wasn't able to investigate.

248
00:11:21,275 --> 00:11:25,108
Please, it's your fault
for talking to the boy!

249
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,442
I have to admit, though...

250
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,733
He seems a rather
promising youth.

251
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,567
There's something about him.

252
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:38,317
Grim reapers, eh?

253
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,608
The Story of Will
the Reaper continues.

254
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:49,525
The Story of Will
the Reaper continues.

255
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,858
Young Thomas began
a new novel.

256
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,233
And its title was...

257
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,067
...The Story of
Will the Reaper.

258
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,067
It was a tale of
a junior reaper and

259
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,733
his observations of human life.

260
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,442
Will watched dispassionately
as people died...

261
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:19,108
people whose souls were
neither good nor evil.

262
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:23,400
Until, one day, he fell
in love with a human maiden.

263
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:25,692
A maiden who was
destined for death.

264
00:12:28,442 --> 00:12:31,150
And so, Will found himself
caught between reaper law

265
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:33,358
and the dictates
of his own heart.

266
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:36,025
In the end, love won out,
and he tried to save

267
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:39,442
his sweetheart from
her predestined death.

268
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,400
Will's fast friend
aided the young lovers.

269
00:12:42,483 --> 00:12:45,275
"A fair skinned fellow reaper
with bright red hair...

270
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:51,067
Grell."He's a perceptive boy,
I'll give him that much.

271
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,567
The novel was accepted
for publication...

272
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,275
Thomas was given
a deadline for completion...

273
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,983
Four o'clock on December 16th.

274
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,983
That date sounds
familiar to me.

275
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,233
Yes...

276
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,192
it's the day
he's scheduled to die.

277
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,858
The reapers' efforts
were in vain...

278
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,733
The maiden died.

279
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,483
Will appealed to the god
who ruled that world...

280
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,650
He begged that the
maiden be allowed to live,

281
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:22,275
and offered his own soul
in exchange for hers.

282
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:25,067
And so it was agreed that
her life would be spared...

283
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,817
but there was one condition.

284
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:31,817
The maiden would have
no memory of Will.

285
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,442
Will could accept that.

286
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:36,108
He believed that even if all
memories of him vanished,

287
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:39,108
proof of their love would
remain in her soul.

288
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:41,733
No one could ever erase that.

289
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:46,775
And so, Will disappeared, and
the maiden was restored to life.

290
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:48,692
In time she fell
in love again...

291
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:50,358
She married and bore a child...

292
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,233
and she named that child...

293
00:13:52,317 --> 00:13:53,858
Will.

294
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,275
That's not a bad little story.

295
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,400
No...?

296
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:01,817
It's a masterpiece.

297
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,192
I believe it shall be regarded
as a literary classic.

298
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:13,358
Unfortunately, the book's author
will die at four o'clock today.

299
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,942
The soul of a
talented novelist...

300
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,067
Perhaps we should
let him live...

301
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,858
I could contact
the association--

302
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,358
There is no need to do that.

303
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:29,817
We shall collect
his soul as we were told.

304
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,317
We shall...?

305
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,775
Are you forgetting
the loophole?

306
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,942
We're allowed to make
special exceptions for souls

307
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,983
that are beneficial
to the world.

308
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,317
"Beneficial?" ...

309
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,733
That boy?

310
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:44,858
You said yourself that his
novel is a masterpiece...

311
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,983
a literary classic!

312
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,983
And on the basis of my own
evaluation of his novel...

313
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,983
you think we should
let him live...

314
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,942
Is that what you're
suggesting, Grell?

315
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:57,192
Yes it is...

316
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,233
What of it?

317
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,608
Honestly.

318
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,067
Excuse me...

319
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,317
Is there a problem?

320
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,442
No, no problem at all...

321
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,650
However...

322
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,858
You are mistaken in this.

323
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,233
Oh, is that what you think...?

324
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,025
I am mistaken...

325
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:16,358
I am mistaken?

326
00:15:16,442 --> 00:15:18,817
Those are fighting words.

327
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:28,025
Not bad.

328
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:29,400
I'd prefer not to injure you.

329
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:31,067
My grade might suffer.

330
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,442
Are you implying you held back
the last time we fought...?

331
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,525
Your B against my A...?

332
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:39,108
You don't stand a chance
in hell against me.

333
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:42,150
Having straight Bs still qualify
me to become a full reaper...

334
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,317
Besides...

335
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,567
You only received As
in a single subject.

336
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,233
You didn't fare so well
in the other areas.

337
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:51,650
Don't you mock me!

338
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:56,150
What--...

339
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,108
What's happening?

340
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:01,233
This time...

341
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:02,817
I'm on the receiving end.

342
00:16:04,192 --> 00:16:05,733
From above...

343
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,858
From below...

344
00:16:07,942 --> 00:16:09,317
Face to face...

345
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:14,817
And behind!

346
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,025
What is this...?

347
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,400
I've never known
this feeling before!

348
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,567
This must be love!

349
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,317
You may be right...

350
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,025
Perhaps he'll be a famous
author whose name

351
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:31,067
will go down in history...

352
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,608
Even so...

353
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:38,150
The world won't
notice his absence...

354
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,192
His life makes no difference.

355
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,900
It's nearly time...

356
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:47,608
We should be off now, come.

357
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:52,608
Don't...

358
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,233
leave...

359
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,275
me.

360
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,400
What happened?

361
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,775
Carriage hit 'im...

362
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:16,608
He ran right in front of it.

363
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:22,983
Pardon me.

364
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,942
I shall now begin the
collection of your soul.

365
00:17:37,192 --> 00:17:38,108
Oi...!

366
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:41,233
What are you doing
to the poor boy?

367
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:42,692
Huh?

368
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,067
My glasses!

369
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,692
I can't work without them!

370
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:10,233
Oh no!

371
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:19,358
Blast it!

372
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:20,983
These are Thomas's memories.

373
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,733
They're flowing into me!

374
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,192
Thomas...!

375
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,483
Thomas...!

376
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:32,942
Thomas!

377
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:38,692
How very rude...

378
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:40,650
First you get me all
got and bothered,

379
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,233
then you go off to play with
your little writer boy.

380
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,775
You should be more
careful with those.

381
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,442
Keep your hands off my man,
you dirty homewrecker...

382
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,775
or you'll wish you had.

383
00:18:58,858 --> 00:18:59,692
I'm not your man.

384
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,317
Now, let's take care of this.

385
00:19:05,442 --> 00:19:06,775
You may as well give up...!

386
00:19:08,025 --> 00:19:11,150
Now I know why they make
new recruits work in pairs.

387
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,733
Ooh, tying me up are you...?

388
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,525
It won't do you any good...

389
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:18,942
I'm afraid you really
aren't my type at all.

390
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,983
This is the struggle
of a dying soul.

391
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,733
This is the weight of a life.

392
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,900
Let's send him off now, Will...?

393
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,233
Shall we?

394
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:48,275
Here is to the first of many
collaboration, my darling!

395
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,150
I am not your darling.

396
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:23,400
Looks like there are other
teams working in the area.

397
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,608
My such a cold, cruel beauty.

398
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,442
How very fetching.

399
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,775
Congratulations.

400
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,192
You're officially full members

401
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,150
of the Grim Reaper
Association...

402
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:51,400
Now, go off and get yourselves
some proper spectacles.

403
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:04,775
At last, ravishing
reaper Grell emerges.

404
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,442
A deadly star is born!

405
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,608
Only those who have known
and measured the weight

406
00:21:11,692 --> 00:21:15,775
of a life are given
true reaper glasses.

407
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,025
Glasses of life.

408
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:24,650
Honestly.

409
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,983
Being saved one time by
you is the only blot

410
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,358
on my otherwise spotless
life's record.

411
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:30,233
Huh...?

412
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:31,400
Did you say something?

413
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,358
The final sounds
really difficult.

414
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,650
You have to sit there
and watch a human die.

415
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:36,900
Seems pretty rough to me.

416
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:39,358
Remember, it's just a job.

417
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:42,025
And there is no place
for emotion in a job...

418
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:45,192
We do our duty as grim reapers,
no more, no less...

419
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,358
We follow the orders
that come from on high.

420
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:49,817
We don't ask questions.

421
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,942
Or make errors.

422
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:54,108
How utterly delectable.

423
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:55,775
Oh, one more thing...

424
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:06,233
Be careful with your glasses.
