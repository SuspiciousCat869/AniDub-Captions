1
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,192
I know that the dream has died.

2
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:25,233
But why?

3
00:00:32,942 --> 00:00:34,858
Hoheo taralna.

4
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,192
I was kind enough to save
you, and you repay me

5
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:50,233
by trying to escape.

6
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:53,233
I won't let you.

7
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:55,942
You won't be going anywhere.

8
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,025
Your Highness.

9
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:05,192
My threads will bind you...

10
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:06,692
forever.

11
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,525
You are mine.

12
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,650
An insect cage?

13
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:27,733
Yes...

14
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:29,025
It's for this butterfly.

15
00:01:29,108 --> 00:01:30,567
With or without a cage...

16
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,192
I doubt it will be
going anywhere soon.

17
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:35,192
Are you talking back to me?

18
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:35,983
No.

19
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,192
I want more than a cage...

20
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,275
Flowers...! I want
it to be surrounded

21
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:42,025
by beautiful flowers...

22
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,733
That way it can sip up
nectar when it thirsts.

23
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:46,692
I shall see to it at once.

24
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,192
What is this...?

25
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:00,400
You lot are always whispering...

26
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,817
I wonder why that is.

27
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,317
They are ill-bred
and foul-tongued.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I have ordered them
to speak quietly so they

29
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:09,942
need not offend your ears, sir.

30
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,608
"Ill-bred and foul-tongued?"...

31
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,858
You wouldn't be implying
something about me, would you?

32
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:16,150
Never...

33
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:17,983
Such a thing
wouldn't occur to me.

34
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,858
If they whisper, I can't
know what they are saying.

35
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,192
And I don't like it!

36
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:28,858
From now on,
you will all speak up!

37
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,983
I cannot abide not
knowing what's on their minds.

38
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:34,650
Or his.

39
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:38,858
What dark thoughts
go through his head?

40
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:45,108
I'm finished.

41
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,817
I shall see to it.

42
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,692
How can I be certain that he
won't try to abandon me as well?

43
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,483
I should rip off his wings.

44
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,150
Then he would remain
by my side forever.

45
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,150
I have assembled all the items
you requested, Your Highness.

46
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,275
There are
bluebells everywhere...

47
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,858
It's just like...

48
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,608
like that other garden...

49
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,692
Is something wrong?

50
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:22,858
You did all this.

51
00:03:22,942 --> 00:03:23,692
Yes.

52
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,150
Incredible...

53
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,692
How can you know me
so well, Claude?

54
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,858
Please...

55
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,192
Say you'll always
do such things for me.

56
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,442
Indeed...

57
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:37,567
I am bound to do so as long
as our contract remains.

58
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,483
Always a price.

59
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:43,900
This garden is nothing more
than a contractual obligation.

60
00:03:43,983 --> 00:03:45,400
What is this...?

61
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,567
You lot are always whispering...

62
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,400
I wonder why that is.

63
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,192
If they whisper, I can't
know what they are saying.

64
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:57,525
And I don't like it!

65
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:59,483
From now on,
you will all speak up!

66
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,608
The master has a few
screws loose upstairs.

67
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:10,067
He's a bit of a head case.

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,317
A dim bulb, you might say.

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,442
That's enough...

70
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,525
There is work that
needs to be done...

71
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,650
Carpet the master's
chamber with red roses

72
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:18,400
to accommodate the butterfly.

73
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,275
The master is clearly mental.

74
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,025
Who needs a room full of roses?

75
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,317
You can do it yourself.

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,983
A proper butler delegates
the simpler tasks...

77
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,233
They are for lower servants.

78
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:33,442
Yes, he mustn't busy himself
with menial housework...

79
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:34,983
chores are beneath him.

80
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:35,858
Oh, really?

81
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,025
Beneath him, are they?

82
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:38,608
Your glasses are fogged up.

83
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:46,150
I realize you're acting
upon the master's orders,

84
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:49,275
but I think you may be
speaking a bit too loudly.

85
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:50,317
Leave us alone.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,067
My hair grows clockwise...

87
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,900
Can you tell?

88
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:54,233
Mine's anticlockwise...

89
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:55,983
I go this way.

90
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,650
Kinda strange how much the
master fancies Claude, eh?

91
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't understand the appeal.

92
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:13,067
Miss Hannah's better
looking, that's for sure...

93
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,358
Hello, Miss Hannah.

94
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,108
I see you three are
speaking this afternoon.

95
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,775
Yeah, the master
ordered us to.

96
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:22,775
We have no choice.

97
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:24,233
It's just wretched.

98
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:26,192
We must obey the master.

99
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:26,775
Ah...

100
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,108
roses?

101
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,150
That won't do...

102
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,942
Use this flower instead.

103
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,192
Miss Hannah's way stacked.

104
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:46,442
Some serious boobage.

105
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,525
I like how they jiggle.

106
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,317
If it wasn't for
Miss Hannah living here,

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,275
I would totally burn
down this mansion.

108
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:53,525
Burn it to ashes.

109
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:54,275
Oh, heck yeah.

110
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:55,525
In a heartbeat.

111
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,525
I have assembled all the items
you requested, Your Highness.

112
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,858
We're the ones
who assembled them.

113
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:11,858
That credit stealer.

114
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:13,483
The king of glory hogs.

115
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,400
There are
bluebells everywhere...

116
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,858
It's just like...

117
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:18,192
like that other garden...

118
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:21,650
The master was crying, huh?

119
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:22,775
Yeah, he was.

120
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:24,608
He was totally crying.

121
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,733
But it was kinda cute,
don't you think?

122
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,483
Yeah, it was a little cute.

123
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:30,317
Crying like a cute little kid.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,983
I can hear you.

125
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,775
You're more irritating
than a gaggle

126
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,067
of gossiping fishwives
'round a fire.

127
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,108
Your bloody prattle
hurts my ears.

128
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,317
Pipe down and get to work.

129
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,900
I try to guide the master.

130
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,567
My soul speaks
to him constantly...

131
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,567
whispering advice.

132
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,150
"Master," I call...

133
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,817
"That isn't the right path."
"You weren't meant to

134
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,317
go this way."

135
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,983
What are you doing?

136
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,108
I'm making sure that the
master doesn't become lost

137
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,317
in the forest.

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,525
But I'm already here,
watching over him.

139
00:07:15,608 --> 00:07:17,650
That's what worries me...

140
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:20,108
That he will lose himself
forever in the dark forest

141
00:07:20,192 --> 00:07:22,608
known as Claude Faustus.

142
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,692
You should think quite
carefully before betraying him.

143
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,067
Do that, Claude...

144
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,483
and I'll kill you.

145
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,233
I don't fear hollow threats.

146
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:37,233
Don't forget, you're
nothing more than a sheath.

147
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,025
An empty hole.

148
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,983
Yes, just a hole
for the fellows...

149
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:41,567
Hannah...

150
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,817
Annafellows.

151
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,900
Don't make me remind you
of your place again.

152
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:53,858
Demon.

153
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,067
You aren't the one
who should be by his side...

154
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,650
Not you, Claude...

155
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:02,983
That place belongs
to someone else.

156
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,775
Luka Macken.

157
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,108
See that swing over there...?

158
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,942
That's where we like to play.

159
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,942
My brother can even
swing on it standing up

160
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,567
and he isn't scared
or anything.

161
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,983
Amazing, huh?

162
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,733
Those kids will all
be gone after tonight...

163
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,983
won't they?

164
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,567
Yes.

165
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:34,400
Want to know something else...?

166
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,275
There used to be tons
and tons of bluebells

167
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:37,692
in this garden here.

168
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,733
Brother and I would
put them in our hair

169
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,983
and pretend we were girls...

170
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,275
Aren't I lovely?

171
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,483
We had such fun,
Brother and me.

172
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,775
No, Claude...

173
00:08:51,858 --> 00:08:54,067
You will never understand.

174
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,775
Such knowledge is
forever out of your reach.

175
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:03,067
A demon's only path to joy is
through the suffering of others.

176
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,108
Ah but these...

177
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,233
roses?

178
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:10,442
They won't do...

179
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,358
Use this flower instead.

180
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:28,025
Blue flowers to remind him
of a home forever lost.

181
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:37,233
The bluebell has a meaning
in the language of flowers.

182
00:09:37,317 --> 00:09:39,233
...an eternal bond.

183
00:09:45,317 --> 00:09:47,192
Did the creature die?

184
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,817
Life is so fleeting...

185
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,692
Here one moment, gone the next.

186
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:52,775
What now...?

187
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,317
Don't you want revenge?

188
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,983
Strike back at the spider
who did this to you...

189
00:09:57,067 --> 00:10:00,525
Alois Trancy--the spider
who wears a human form.

190
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:01,900
Take revenge on me...

191
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:03,233
be vicious and cruel...

192
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,317
Tear me apart...

193
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,942
and live.

194
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,983
Such an unstable soul.

195
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,108
Forever wavering.

196
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,942
This is the cruel soul with
which the demon's sheath

197
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,692
is so obsessed...

198
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:17,108
He's an amusing one,
I'll grant her that.

199
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:21,442
That isn't enough
for me, however...

200
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:23,817
I require more heat...

201
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,483
much more.

202
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,108
Help me...!

203
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:32,858
Claude, where are you...?

204
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:33,900
I need you!

205
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,733
What's happened?

206
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:40,275
No, don't!

207
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,483
Why not, Master?

208
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,233
It'll burn you alive...!

209
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,775
Claude, you can't go in there!

210
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:45,483
It's all right.

211
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,358
The fire will take you!

212
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,150
Go get water.

213
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:53,983
I can't lose you!

214
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:02,317
It's all right now...

215
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,942
The fire is out.

216
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,692
We'll have the
room back shortly.

217
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,525
I just wanted to burn it...

218
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:11,192
the butterfly...

219
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:12,900
Set it to rest, you know.

220
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:14,275
Like a funeral...

221
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:16,192
but the fire
got out of control.

222
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,483
A funeral?

223
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,233
Everything burned...

224
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:21,108
Everything.

225
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,233
Set the fire.

226
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,608
Put out the fire.

227
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,108
His soul dances like a flame.

228
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:31,817
Ah, master...

229
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,150
I do love how
heated you can be.

230
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,650
I love it as well.

231
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:40,775
I don't particularly love it.

232
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:41,942
Yeah, same here.

233
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:42,858
I might...

234
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,442
but only a little.

235
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,733
Delicious.

236
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:54,317
When your soul burns red-hot,
I can almost taste it.

237
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,358
Incredible...

238
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:56,858
It's like nothing happened.

239
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:58,400
Come to bed, master...

240
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,733
It would be best for you
to get some rest my lord...

241
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,525
before dawn breaks.

242
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:03,900
Stay with me.

243
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,983
Yes, Your Highness.

244
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,692
You can sit on the bed.

245
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,317
Say...

246
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,692
am I entertaining?

247
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,317
Yes...

248
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,483
very.

249
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,692
Enough?

250
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,775
Enough for now.

251
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,317
That line again?

252
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,567
You're quite impertinent...

253
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,692
for a butler...

254
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:34,150
You never give me
a straight answer...

255
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:37,233
You're always telling me "as
long as this" or "only if that."

256
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:40,733
Why can't you say "yes"...

257
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:42,942
Would that be so difficult?

258
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,692
You mustn't let your fire burn
too fiercely all the time...

259
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,692
You shall burn yourself
right out, master...

260
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,442
Do take care.

261
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:02,233
I dreamt for the
first time in a long while.

262
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:05,317
There was a butterfly
caught in the spider's web...

263
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,567
but it had no wings.

264
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,858
And that butterfly...

265
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:11,858
was me.
