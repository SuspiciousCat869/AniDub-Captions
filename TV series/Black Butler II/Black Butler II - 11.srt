1
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,317
I'll fall off...

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,108
I'll do it!

3
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:21,483
What is this...?

4
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,400
I...?

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,108
How did I come to be here?

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,358
And why?

7
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,358
Sebastian?!

8
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:39,358
I must find some way
to convince you to return

9
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:41,900
my young master
to me, as himself.

10
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:43,567
Fortunately, I can
be quite persuasive.

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,317
I wouldn't advise killing me...

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,150
If you do that...

13
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:47,817
I'll have to fall.

14
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,483
If you had not noticed,
Ciel Phantomhive's body

15
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,983
now belongs to my master.

16
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:58,150
Alois Trancy's soul was
taken into Ciel Phantomhive,

17
00:00:58,233 --> 00:00:59,400
absorbed by him...

18
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:01,067
It waited ever so quietly...

19
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,358
for the proper time
to reawaken.

20
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:05,233
The soul took advantage
of a weakness

21
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,108
in Ciel Phantomhive's heart...

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,858
It used this weakness to
steal Phantomhive's body

23
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:12,442
using his own eye.

24
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:15,233
The young master's body
is now Alois's hostage...

25
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:16,733
So our hands are tied.

26
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:18,733
I'm going to fall.

27
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,942
I'm going to fall
right off, Sebastian.

28
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:23,067
There's more to the
situation than that...

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,025
Your hands may be tied, but
your hearts aren't, are they?

30
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:28,775
Prepare yourselves.

31
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,275
I'm sending you on a journey.

32
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,108
Indeed?

33
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,608
Both of you are eager to
retrieve Ciel Phantomhive.

34
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,275
To do so, you must
journey through

35
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,942
the labyrinth of
Alois Trancy's heart,

36
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:43,192
following the painful twists
and turns that comprise it.

37
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:46,317
We're being sent
to collect stamps

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,525
hidden throughout the garden...

39
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,567
Why, this is
beneath our dignity.

40
00:01:52,525 --> 00:01:53,650
Come to me...!

41
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:55,650
And you had best
be quick about it...

42
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:58,733
unless you fancy the
bitter taste of defeat.

43
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:00,108
I suppose we must.

44
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:02,108
The only thing I will be
tasting is the sweet flavor

45
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,483
of Ciel Phantomhive's
young soul.

46
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,858
Must you be so
utterly distasteful?

47
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,067
That's what happened?

48
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,525
Alois has taken over my body?

49
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,692
I have his memories?

50
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,442
Memories...

51
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,733
My mansion burned...

52
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:57,608
No...

53
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:58,775
wait...

54
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:01,400
Is that a village burning?

55
00:04:01,483 --> 00:04:02,525
That's not right.

56
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,567
I don't know this place.

57
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,400
It was my mansion.

58
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:08,608
I was looking for
my mother and father.

59
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,192
A boy...

60
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,525
Who is he?

61
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:21,358
No...

62
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,567
this memory...

63
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,192
this memory isn't mine.

64
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,608
What've we here?

65
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:42,483
"Question:...

66
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,817
What is Alois
Trancy's real name?

67
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:49,067
I believe I can recall
the answer to that...

68
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,108
Alois's real name
was Jim Macken.

69
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:55,817
Wrong answer...

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,442
The garden is enchanted...

71
00:04:57,525 --> 00:05:00,025
It will repel those
who don't belong...

72
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,817
I'm glad to see
it works well.

73
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:04,942
The answer
"Jim Macken" is wrong...

74
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:06,983
His real name is Alois Trancy.

75
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,775
How's that...?

76
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,150
I thought that was the
name given to him by

77
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,650
the former Earl Trancy,
the man who defiled him.

78
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,858
True...

79
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,608
but however vile the
old man might have been,

80
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:27,233
Alois was still
taken by his new name.

81
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,483
Ah, so that's how
this game is played...

82
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,608
A thing is true only if
Alois Trancy thinks it is...

83
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,192
That complicates matters.

84
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,525
I'll be on my way, then.

85
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:51,942
Lovely...!

86
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,608
Squeeze his supple
flesh tighter! Yes...!

87
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:58,317
What a perfect shot...!
A perfect pose of agony!

88
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,483
So sexy!

89
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,733
Hello there...

90
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:07,275
Maybe just...

91
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,900
one more photograph?

92
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,025
You're a grim fellow.

93
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:19,733
Dead right I am.

94
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,525
"Question:...

95
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,567
What is Alois Trancy's
favorite thing to eat...?

96
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,983
That's easy enough to answer.

97
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,733
Greasy fish and chips.

98
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,983
Foolish...

99
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,567
What is the point of this?

100
00:06:36,983 --> 00:06:37,817
Brilliant...

101
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,108
Just brilliant!

102
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,025
See how well Claude knows me?

103
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,608
He doesn't hesitate...

104
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:45,192
He knows all of me.

105
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,900
Every last bit, right down to
the deepest, most tender parts.

106
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,400
Perhaps you should
be more careful...

107
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:57,275
Worried about
this body, are you?

108
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,817
This precious body...!

109
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,525
You like Ciel Phantomhive
more than me, too!

110
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,483
Why is he so special?

111
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,525
What does he have
that I don't...?!

112
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:08,692
Answer me, Hannah!

113
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,900
Answer me!

114
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,067
"Question:...

115
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,858
True or false: Alois Trancy
died a beautiful death,

116
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:18,150
as was his due...

117
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:20,983
His body was never
defiled by Earl Trancy."

118
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:24,983
What the devil is this about?

119
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,483
The actual answer
would be false.

120
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:28,650
Though...

121
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:29,858
the previous question
had nothing to do

122
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,400
with the real truth.

123
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,650
I need you.

124
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,400
I want to make you fly...

125
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,275
You would enjoy
that wouldn't you?

126
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,900
Bassy...!

127
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:42,358
I'll fly for you.

128
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,900
Farewell my love!

129
00:07:56,483 --> 00:07:57,608
Thought so.

130
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:09,442
Don't worry dear viewers,
I shall await your kind letter.

131
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,233
My suspicions were correct...

132
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,692
Whoever's writing these
questions is cheating.

133
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,150
Ridiculous...

134
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,692
This is a clown's maze.

135
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,567
I have to remember.

136
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,025
There was a fire.

137
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:28,108
My parents were killed.

138
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,817
And then I signed
a contract with Sebastian...

139
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
I vowed to get revenge...

140
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:35,567
To punish the people
responsible for it all.

141
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,358
Well, answer me!

142
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,483
What is it?

143
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,317
He's pitching
some kind of fit...

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,525
That little brat!

145
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,317
Now, Claude...!

146
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,192
Hurry up...!

147
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,233
I mean it...!

148
00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:57,567
Get up here...!

149
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:59,025
Stop dawdling...!

150
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,775
I gave you an advantage
in this game.

151
00:09:01,858 --> 00:09:03,567
Such pointless encouragement.

152
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,192
Next up...

153
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:09,858
"Repeat the phrase 'Yes, your
highness' three full times"...

154
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,275
Yes, your highness.

155
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:12,608
Yes, your highness.

156
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:14,817
Yes, your highness.

157
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,108
Silly.

158
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:24,233
Yes, your highness...

159
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:26,942
Don't you see, Hannah?

160
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,858
He's still my butler...

161
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:30,442
He loves me...

162
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:31,233
He does...

163
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,567
I knew he did...

164
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,317
Claude really does love me.

165
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,775
Master...

166
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,317
then why are you crying?

167
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,900
My lord...

168
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,275
only wait...

169
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,275
I will show you real love.

170
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:48,233
Young master!

171
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:52,692
That's right...

172
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:55,567
Sebastian and I learned that
the Queen was responsible.

173
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,275
She was the target
for my revenge...!

174
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:00,233
An angel was
involved, as well.

175
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,358
Wait...

176
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:07,483
What am I seeing...?

177
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,233
The angel is dead...

178
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,525
and the queen, too?

179
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,358
What does this mean?

180
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:13,567
Have I...

181
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,942
Have I--?

182
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,692
What's happening?

183
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,067
It's the labyrinth...

184
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,692
The maze is transforming!

185
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,900
This labyrinth was specifically
designed to follow

186
00:10:29,983 --> 00:10:32,067
the dictates of
your heart, my lord...

187
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,150
only now Ciel Phantomhive's
will is exerting itself.

188
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:36,608
His will?!

189
00:10:36,692 --> 00:10:37,525
"Question...

190
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:39,275
Ciel Phantomhive was wronged...

191
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,400
Has he already achieved
his revenge?"...

192
00:10:42,483 --> 00:10:43,900
This one is different.

193
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,275
Alright...

194
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,275
The answer is...

195
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,942
yes.

196
00:10:57,775 --> 00:10:59,442
Young master.

197
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:08,275
This is Bitter Rabbit--One
of Funtom's bestselling items.

198
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,400
Master...

199
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,567
you're up there now,
aren't you...?

200
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,692
Waiting...

201
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:26,233
Yes...

202
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,983
That's how it happened...

203
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:30,233
I got my revenge.

204
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:32,858
And as per the contract...

205
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,108
Sebastian took...

206
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,317
...no, he didn't.

207
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,733
"Question...

208
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:41,608
After the terms of the
contract were met, why didn't

209
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:45,442
Sebastian Michaelis eat Ciel
Phantomhive's soul?"...

210
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:46,858
Our contract.

211
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:55,942
I lost this arm temporarily and
the contract seal along with it.

212
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,275
Knowing all this,
the demon Claude Faustus

213
00:11:58,358 --> 00:12:00,192
seized the opportunity...

214
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:02,025
He took advantage
of the situation to steal

215
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:03,858
your soul from me.

216
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:14,900
A goose?

217
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:15,817
A silly goose...

218
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,567
of course.

219
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,483
That's my young master.

220
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:21,650
How dare you interfere, brat!

221
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,067
You bounder!

222
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,358
I'll kill you!!

223
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:29,400
Please stop this!

224
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,817
You'll hurt yourself as well...

225
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,108
Please be careful.

226
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,525
It's my game...

227
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,900
There are things I want
to ask Claude, too, you know!

228
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:37,900
Master...

229
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:38,692
look there.

230
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:39,858
See, it's Claude...

231
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:40,942
He's nearing the end.

232
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:43,025
He's reached the
final question station.

233
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,233
Finally...

234
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:46,775
at last, I can ask.

235
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:47,733
Tell me...

236
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,483
Why'd you do it, Claude?

237
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,775
"Final question: Answer this...

238
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,650
Why did Claude
murder Alois Trancy?"

239
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,025
All right...

240
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,775
I murdered him
out of passion...

241
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:01,983
I killed him for love.

242
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,400
It was the only way
that I could...

243
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,983
I needed you as
a tool to obtain

244
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,900
Ciel Phantomhive's soul...

245
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,108
That's the reason
why I murdered you.

246
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,067
Why...? Why Claude...?

247
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,150
You could have just lied...

248
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,192
You must have figured out how
the questions were created.

249
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,317
But you still...

250
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,567
you still gave that answer.

251
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,400
Sebastian.

252
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:31,775
That's right...

253
00:13:31,858 --> 00:13:35,400
In the end Sebastian saw
to it that I got my revenge.

254
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:37,192
Which means that my soul...

255
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,858
Why, Claude?

256
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,233
Young master!

257
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:45,567
Why...? Why are you
fighting me, Ciel...?!

258
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,692
How greedy must you be?!

259
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:50,608
Don't you have enough?

260
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:57,150
Of all people, Claude is dashing
to and fro trying to save you...

261
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,108
Now isn't that rich...?

262
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,483
Can't you even enjoy that?!

263
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,150
What more do you need?

264
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,900
Hush, don't cry.

265
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:05,567
Let me go!

266
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,400
Piss off!

267
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,900
There's no need to cry...

268
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:10,442
You'll always be the
best there is, big brother.

269
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,317
Back to the beginning, then.

270
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,942
"First Question"...

271
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:29,817
Why did Luka sign a contract
with Sebastian Michaelis?"

272
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,650
How should I answer this
when the question itself

273
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:33,275
is incorrect...?

274
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:36,150
The underlying assumption
here is quite wrong...

275
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,608
The contract was not
signed with Sebastian...

276
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,275
but Hannah Annafellows.

277
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,650
It was her...

278
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:44,317
Also known as the sheath
that holds a demon's sword.

279
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,275
Hannah, what is he saying...?

280
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,775
Luka signed
a contract with you?

281
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,025
Yes, master...

282
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,358
My soul desire is
to fulfill your wishes...

283
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,400
I delight in doing so.

284
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:01,442
In part because that is what
Luka, who sleeps within me,

285
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,900
wishes to do.

286
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,858
Demons have too much time...

287
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,650
I had more than
I knew what to do with.

288
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,275
Human souls were
merely food to me...

289
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:17,025
They were dull,
nothing more than sustenance...

290
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,400
But then that changed.

291
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,358
Wow, you really came!

292
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,317
I am here...

293
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,483
yes...

294
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,192
but shouldn't you
be afraid of dying, boy?

295
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:28,483
'Course I'm scared...!

296
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,608
I'm about to piss myself.

297
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:31,900
Then why call me?

298
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:35,317
Because, it'll make
my brother happy!

299
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,733
He was different...

300
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:40,483
Nothing at all like any
of the souls I'd eaten before.

301
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:41,067
Yes...

302
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,483
your highness.

303
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,400
He was wholly
devoted to his brother.

304
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,483
I was surprised.

305
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:52,483
I began to feel something
that I never had before.

306
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,025
He became...

307
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,817
precious to me.

308
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,358
Still, I was a demon...

309
00:15:59,442 --> 00:16:02,567
There was only one thing
I could do for him:

310
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,192
Grant his wish as the
contract stipulated.

311
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,858
And grant it I did...

312
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:11,317
Even if it meant
devouring his soul.

313
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,775
It's you.

314
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:21,900
You made my wish
come true like you said...

315
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,692
Thank you so much.

316
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:31,817
Nothing like that
had happened before...

317
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,733
It was the first time a soul
I'd eaten had been grateful.

318
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,192
"Question...

319
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,733
Was Claude Faustus aware
that Hannah Annafellows had

320
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:55,358
made a contract with
Luka?" The answer is yes.

321
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,733
So...

322
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,900
This Luka boy was in the
habit of calling the master

323
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:00,483
Your Highness, was he...?

324
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,192
How very fascinating.

325
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,233
Hannah was fiercely
obsessed with the soul

326
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,942
of Alois Trancy's
younger brother.

327
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,858
It was a queer way
of thinking for a demon...

328
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:12,775
It aroused my interest.

329
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,483
Is it true?

330
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,275
Master, I can still
see Luka within you.

331
00:17:20,358 --> 00:17:22,317
No matter how much
you despised me...

332
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,275
just being near
you made me happy.

333
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,775
That closeness was
almost enough for me.

334
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:28,817
I love him...

335
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,983
Luka.

336
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:32,192
But that's not
the whole of it...

337
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:35,358
I love my master,
Jim Macken.

338
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:36,733
Now master...

339
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:37,317
no...

340
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,317
brother...

341
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,775
sign a new
contract with me...

342
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:41,608
and then...

343
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:42,942
you'll be reunited...

344
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,025
both of you, inside me...

345
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,400
It's what we desire most,
both me and Luka.

346
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,358
"Final question...

347
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:58,192
Answer this: why did
Claude murder Alois Trancy?

348
00:17:58,275 --> 00:17:59,817
I'll say it again...

349
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,650
I killed you to
gain Ciel Phantomhive.

350
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,150
I won't fall for
the same trick.

351
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,483
Good evening, Claude...

352
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:30,025
So nice to see you.

353
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,983
Luka...

354
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,275
Hannah...

355
00:18:33,358 --> 00:18:34,733
I can be one with you...

356
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:37,567
the people who truly love me.

357
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,317
The people I should
love more than anyone.

358
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:44,608
It's Ciel!

359
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:46,525
Sebas...

360
00:18:46,608 --> 00:18:47,608
Sebastian...

361
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:48,858
I...!

362
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:49,775
Ciel...

363
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:51,192
Stop it!

364
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,900
What's happening?

365
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:54,983
Make him stop...! Do it!

366
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,692
Let go.

367
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:09,317
Sebastian!

368
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,900
So you fought your
way back at last...

369
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:16,817
Master.

370
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,400
Heee...

371
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:18,608
sawww youuu...

372
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,233
He saaaww you.

373
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,108
Youuu let him seee you...

374
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:28,025
You let him seeee!

375
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,858
Congratulations on the
young master's return.

376
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:33,192
But he never rescinded the
order for you to stay out

377
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,275
of his sight, did he?

378
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:36,650
You can't do anything.

379
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,608
Not where he can see you...

380
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:41,275
Enjoy a little rest;
it's a lovely garden...

381
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,025
I must be going.

382
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:45,233
Don't just stand there.

383
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:46,192
You did your part.

384
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:48,650
You helped me get my revenge.

385
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:49,692
This is an order...

386
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,608
Eat my soul right now!

387
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,608
Until the final moment when
you've devoured every drop

388
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:58,192
of my soul you
remain my butler.

389
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,233
Do you understand me,
Sebastian?

390
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,483
Forever yes, my lord.

391
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:10,483
You want Ciel...?

392
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,692
You do, Claude...

393
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,692
and you, Sebastian.

394
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:14,317
Well...

395
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,608
That's too bad...

396
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:19,317
I'll get rid of everyone
who doesn't love me.

397
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,858
Yes...

398
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:20,942
that's right...

399
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,233
all of you!

400
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:24,025
Young master...

401
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:27,192
I've found people
who actually love me...

402
00:20:27,275 --> 00:20:28,317
Luka...

403
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,775
and Hannah.

404
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:44,150
What's this...? Does he intend
to make a contract with Hannah?

405
00:20:44,233 --> 00:20:45,400
Young master!

406
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,192
Very well then...

407
00:20:47,275 --> 00:20:50,900
I suppose one must focus ones
energy on the proper target...

408
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,567
We have no other choice...

409
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,858
For the moment...

410
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:07,233
Now...

411
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,942
tell me that you love me.

412
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,983
I love you very much, master.

413
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,067
And...

414
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,317
give me a hug.

415
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,567
Certainly, lord...

416
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,733
Here you are.

417
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:29,275
This labyrinth is as
persistent as its owner...

418
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,275
and just as frustrating.

419
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:35,400
That's nice...

420
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,942
Love is so warm.

421
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:44,025
Master!

422
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,358
Master!

423
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:03,150
Claude...

424
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:07,025
You ensnared my heart with your
deceptive spider threads.

425
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,275
I wanted you to become
my eternal Highness.

426
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:17,525
More than anything...

427
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,525
I wanted your love.

428
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,442
The contract is complete.

429
00:22:28,483 --> 00:22:32,192
I have entered into an official
contract with Jim Macken.

430
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:34,983
And Ciel Phantomhive
along with him.

431
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,192
My master named me Sebastian
after his old family dog...

432
00:24:16,275 --> 00:24:18,983
and Michaelis after the
Japanese word mikaeri,

433
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,900
meaning "repayment."...

434
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:23,942
A contract is still
a contract, master,

435
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:26,275
even in another language.

436
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:29,442
Next time: "Black Butler"
If I didn't follow

437
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:32,733
my master's orders, what kind
of butler would I be...?

438
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:35,525
And if I didn't fight for
Ciel Phantomhive's soul--

439
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:39,733
a soul that is rightfully mine
what kind of demon would I be?
