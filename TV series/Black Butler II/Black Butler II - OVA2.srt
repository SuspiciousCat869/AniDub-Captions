1
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:18,317
Here we are, dear...

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,608
This is the Phantomhive manor.

3
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,942
It's always a pleasure
to see you, Lady...

4
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:33,775
Please, do come inside.

5
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:35,483
Thank you, Sebastian.

6
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:36,983
Ciel!

7
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:37,358
Ciel!

8
00:00:37,442 --> 00:00:38,692
Ciel!

9
00:00:38,775 --> 00:00:40,108
We've been expecting you...

10
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,483
Allow me, miss.

11
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:52,733
Here he is, dear...

12
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:55,108
Presenting Ciel,
Earl Phantomhive...!

13
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:58,067
Ciel, this is the new friend I
mentioned to you in my letter...

14
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,150
We met at a ball last month, and
I took an instant liking to her.

15
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,108
And I felt sure you'd
adore her as much as I do.

16
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,525
I could not wait
to introduce you,

17
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:07,692
so I brought her
along this afternoon.

18
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,942
What's an earl
to do with you?

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,983
Welcome to my estate, miss.

20
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:15,358
I'm Ciel, the head of
Phantomhive household...

21
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,858
I hope you'll find tonight's
ball an enjoyable experience.

22
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:21,775
Sebastian, see that she
has everything she needs.

23
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:23,317
Certainly, my lord...

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,358
Pleased to make
your acquaintance...

25
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:28,025
Sebastian Michaelis,
butler to the Phantomhives.

26
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:29,608
I am at your service...

27
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:32,108
We pride ourselves
on hospitality...

28
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,233
We shall offer every comfort.

29
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:35,567
And now...

30
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,483
welcome to Phantomhive Manor.

31
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:53,775
We have prepared
this guest room for you.

32
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,400
Lovely, you say...?

33
00:01:59,483 --> 00:02:00,442
Thank you...

34
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:02,358
I'm so pleased.

35
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:08,442
Over the generations, the
Phantomhives have furnished

36
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:12,150
this room with the finest
quality historic pieces.

37
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,692
You will find that everything
is suitable for a gentlewoman,

38
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:17,067
so please do make
yourself at home.

39
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:21,650
I see you admiring the
photographs on the mantle...

40
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,108
They are of the previous
earl, Vincent Phantomhive,

41
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:26,150
and his lovely wife, Rachel.

42
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,567
From what I understand,
they were prominent figures,

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,650
much loved by the
entire community.

44
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,692
They devoted themselves
passionately to worthy

45
00:02:33,775 --> 00:02:36,900
civil causes such as aiding the
poor and improving medical care

46
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,442
and infrastructure.

47
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,233
The Queen evidently placed a
great deal of trust in them...

48
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,192
You might ask my master
for further details

49
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:44,733
at tea this afternoon.

50
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:46,650
For now, please
make yourself --

51
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,067
If you'll please wait here...

52
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,275
There's a matter
I must attend to.

53
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,400
I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised.

54
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,525
It's this bloody
new burner we got.

55
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:04,733
The blasted thing won't work!

56
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,442
Please, miss, stay back.

57
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,025
My deepest apologies...

58
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,483
Are you injured?

59
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:16,067
That was a close shave, eh?

60
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,067
We came pretty near to startin'
a bloody great fire in there.

61
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,317
You did start a fire!

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,608
Are you all right...?

63
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,942
sorry, Sebastian...

64
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:26,942
Hello and who is this?

65
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,192
Miss?

66
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,192
Our visitor is a friend
of the Lady Elizabeth...

67
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:35,192
She will be one of our esteemed
guests at this evening's ball.

68
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,067
Oh my...!

69
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,358
How lovely!

70
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:40,483
It's always exciting
to have a fancy new guest!

71
00:03:40,567 --> 00:03:42,983
And she's a right pretty
little thing, isn't she?

72
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,650
I'm terribly sorry you
had to witness that scene,

73
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:52,233
even more so that you
were exposed to danger...

74
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,483
I can't possibly
apologize enough.

75
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:59,233
However, I do recall requesting
that you wait for me here...

76
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:01,858
Every household has its
secrets--certain places that

77
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,608
are not meant to be
seen by visitors.

78
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,192
Strolling, uninvited,
about somebody else's manor

79
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:10,025
strikes me as
quite inconsiderate.

80
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,400
However...

81
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,275
I certainly understand
the curiosity of the young...

82
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,983
Ah, I see.

83
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,525
It's your first visit
to such a large estate...

84
00:04:22,608 --> 00:04:25,108
and your inquisitive
nature got the best of you...

85
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:28,608
Rather similar to an innocent
puppy who knows no fear.

86
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:31,025
We still have
a little time before tea...

87
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:33,650
I'd be honored if you'd allow me
to show you around the manor.

88
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,275
We can assuage your curiosity.

89
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:38,317
Then with your permission,
I shall be your escort

90
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,108
for a guided tour...

91
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,650
May I take your hand?

92
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:50,858
Just in here, we have
the recreation room...

93
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,442
As you can see,
it is furnished with

94
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,942
a billiard table and
other gaming equipment,

95
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:58,233
as well as many of the
Funtom Company's products...

96
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:01,442
Our goal is to provide guests
with ample entertainment.

97
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,192
My...

98
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,567
who have we here...?
It isn't much, I know,

99
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,358
but do make yourself
comfortable.

100
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,442
As you can see, the
recreation room is furnished

101
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,025
with a billiard table and
other gaming equipment,

102
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,025
as well as many of the
Funtom Company's products...

103
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:21,567
Our goal is to provide guests
with ample entertainment...

104
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,900
Please come take a seat.

105
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,942
I'm sure you
will enjoy yourself.

106
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,942
Thank you for such a detailed
explanation of the room...

107
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,733
Though I must say
it sounds familiar,

108
00:05:29,817 --> 00:05:32,108
as if I've heard
it somewhere before.

109
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,400
If you please...

110
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,275
this man is Mr. Lau,
head of the English branch

111
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:38,192
of the Chinese trading
company Kunlun...

112
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,775
Mr. Lau, this is a friend
of Lady Elizabeth's.

113
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:42,942
She will be attending
the ball tonight.

114
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,442
Some advice, miss:
be careful...

115
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,483
Phantomhive Manor
is absolutely crawling

116
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,650
with dangerous beasties...

117
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:53,525
You wouldn't want to be
eaten by one, now would you?

118
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:57,358
May I present
to you our library,

119
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,567
the pride of the
Phantomhive estate.

120
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:04,233
The family heads have gathered
books for generations...

121
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:05,775
The result is
a library comparable

122
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:07,983
to those at any university--

123
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:11,942
Brilliant timing...!

124
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:13,608
I was growing ever so bored.

125
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:16,150
Please Prince Soma, we're in
the middle of your studies.

126
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,192
Agni...!

127
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:19,317
Everyone needs
a rest now and then.

128
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,192
And from what
I can see, it seems you

129
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,067
were studying
quite diligently.

130
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,525
Yes.

131
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,483
A friend of Lady Elizabeth's
is visiting today for tea...

132
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,942
She will also be attending
the ball later this evening.

133
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,525
Is this her, Sebastian?

134
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,567
Miss, please allow me to
introduce you to a friend

135
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,733
of my master's, the twenty-sixth
child of the king of Bengal,

136
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:41,483
Prince Soma Asman Kadar, and
his very capable butler Agni.

137
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,983
Namaste ji.

138
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,692
Prince Soma, Agni, this is--

139
00:06:44,775 --> 00:06:45,983
So beautiful!

140
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:46,858
Sire?

141
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:48,442
Oh...!

142
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,608
Hello miss, I'm Prince Soma...

143
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:52,483
I fancied you immediately...

144
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,900
Would you like to be
my handmaiden...?

145
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,400
Or, if you prefer...

146
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,025
my...

147
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,442
my wife.

148
00:06:58,525 --> 00:07:01,275
Oh, Prince Soma...! At
last...! You've finally found

149
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:02,692
your soul mate...

150
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:04,275
Your true love...!

151
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:08,025
Your happiness is mine,
and it almost overwhelms me...

152
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,608
O Kali, I implore you,
bless these two young people

153
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,733
and grant them a
long life together.

154
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,650
Agni!

155
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:18,400
I fear you may be making
the young lady uncomfortable.

156
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,775
Perhaps you could
propose at a later date?

157
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:25,358
It's almost time
for tea, miss...

158
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:26,858
You must be thirsty...

159
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:27,983
Shall we?

160
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:31,983
Today we have Nilgiri tea...

161
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,525
I expect you will appreciate
its refreshing aroma

162
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:35,817
and its rich flavor.

163
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,275
Nilgiri, eh...?
It brings back memories.

164
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,067
If I'm correct, Nilgiri
means "blue mountain."...

165
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,358
This blend fetches
an especially good price.

166
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:46,775
Accompanying the tea
is a Dundee Cake...

167
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:50,192
This treat is made from a batter
of rum and various dried fruits

168
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,108
studded with roast almonds.

169
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:52,775
Oh!

170
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,275
It looks delicious!

171
00:07:59,067 --> 00:07:59,942
It isn't bad.

172
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,358
Thank you, my lord.

173
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,108
I cannot help but
notice how you're

174
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:08,275
admiring that teacup, miss.

175
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:10,067
Is that--?

176
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,400
Oh my!

177
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:13,817
Yes, it's a Vienna Rose...

178
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,233
I thought the flower on the cup
would set off the loveliness

179
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,983
of the young lady to advantage.

180
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:18,650
Good heavens!

181
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,233
It's genuine?

182
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,817
Yes...

183
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,775
Apparently it was one of Empress
Maria Theresa's favorite pieces.

184
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:27,400
A fine item, befitting
the status of an earl...

185
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,608
I can scarcely imagine what
it would be worth on the market.

186
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:37,442
Oh goodness!

187
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:38,858
Oh, this is no good.

188
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,358
Indeed...

189
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:42,942
It would be criminal to chip
cup as precious as that one.

190
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,483
Sebastian, see that she's
all right and prepare her

191
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,983
a fresh change of clothing...

192
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:49,150
The frock in the dressing
room should do nicely.

193
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,483
That dress, master?

194
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:52,900
Are you sure?

195
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,108
Yes, It's fine.

196
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:55,442
Very good.

197
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,108
Pardon me, miss.

198
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,983
If you don't mind,
I'll help you inside.

199
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:06,775
Ordinarily I would never
consider intruding upon

200
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,317
a young lady's
dressing routine.

201
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,358
However, we have no
handmaiden to help...

202
00:09:12,442 --> 00:09:14,483
And this is an emergency.

203
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,567
I hope you can
forgive my rudeness.

204
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:30,317
There we are.

205
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,817
That should do nicely.

206
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,983
Perhaps the teacup was
too heavy for a young lady

207
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,483
as delicate as yourself...

208
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:42,483
I apologize for making
such a grievous blunder.

209
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,983
If it doesn't displease you, my
master would like you to have

210
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,775
this dress as a token
of our hospitality...

211
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,775
Please accept it
with our compliments.

212
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:55,275
Why would we go to
such lengths, you ask?

213
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:58,025
You are an honored visitor,
and the Phantomhives are famed

214
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,525
for taking care
of their guests.

215
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:02,025
Goodness, look at the time.

216
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,817
This evening's guests will
be arriving any moment now...

217
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,858
I must excuse myself, miss...

218
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:08,858
Would you be so kind
to wait in the guest room

219
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,400
with Lady Elizabeth?

220
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,650
Welcome to Phantomhive manor.

221
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,108
Sorry to barge in like this.

222
00:10:18,192 --> 00:10:19,900
Why, Inspector Abberline.

223
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:22,192
What brings the Yard
to my ball, inspector?

224
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:23,692
I'm here on patrol...

225
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:25,942
There have been a number of
suspicious disappearances

226
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,483
at balls lately...

227
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:28,942
Disappearances?

228
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:30,358
Yes, that's right.

229
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:33,025
The cowardly scoundrel
targets only young maidens...

230
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:35,400
It's simply unforgiveable,
but you can be certain

231
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,567
Scotland Yard will catch him!

232
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:45,150
So you have successfully
infiltrated their ranks...

233
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,733
Good.

234
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,358
To think it only took a month
for you to gain an invitation

235
00:10:48,442 --> 00:10:50,067
to Phantomhive manor.

236
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,108
That girl is bloody
fool for believing you

237
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:54,733
to be a respectable young lady

238
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:56,817
Well, you know your job...

239
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,275
Kill that damned butler
and bring Ciel Phantomhive

240
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,817
to me at once.

241
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,733
The butler uses strange
tricks, so watch out...

242
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:07,067
We will avenge Azzurro
and the Ferro family!

243
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,150
I suppose tonight we
shall find out just how

244
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,317
expert an assassin you are...

245
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,692
Mad Dog of Venezia.

246
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:21,567
So this is where
you disappeared to.

247
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,400
Forgive me, miss, but the
ball is about to begin.

248
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:30,983
Tighter...!

249
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,400
Make it tighter...!

250
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,567
Tonight is special...

251
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,400
I want to look my best!

252
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,317
I'm trying, my lady

253
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:41,025
Oh, hello my dear!

254
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,858
Look at my darling
new dress...!

255
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:44,608
Well...?

256
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,192
It's adorable... right?

257
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:48,483
Oh...!

258
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:49,525
And you...!

259
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,733
Ever so cute
as usuaual I see--...

260
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:52,942
That dress, uh...

261
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:00,900
It suits you so well.

262
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,817
You're a vision...! You have
to make certain that Ciel

263
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,692
sees you in it at the ball...

264
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,650
He'll think it looks beautiful.

265
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,358
My lady!

266
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:20,025
No need to be afraid.

267
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,317
So lovely, even in sleep.

268
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,317
After so long, you're mine...

269
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,233
I have you at last,
my darling song thrush.

270
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,483
Welcome to the
Phantomhive Manor.

271
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,192
Welcome to the
Phantomhive Manor.

272
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,067
She's vanished...

273
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,983
What do you mean?!

274
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,275
I don't know...

275
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:02,358
She's just gone!

276
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:03,442
Oh, my lady...

277
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,900
Escort Lady Elizabeth
to the guest room...

278
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,525
I'll be up shortly with a
glass of warm milk for her.

279
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,858
Alright.

280
00:13:10,942 --> 00:13:12,525
There, there my lady...

281
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:13,900
Let's go now.

282
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:20,192
I found signs that a
sleep-inducing gas was

283
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:22,692
pumped into the room where
the ladies dewelled.

284
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:26,108
So first he put her to sleep,
and then he carried her off...

285
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:29,317
He's a bold thief to act in the
middle of a party like this.

286
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,692
And he managed
to give you the slip.

287
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,442
I apologize, my lord...

288
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,817
but if I may remind you,
you had ordered me

289
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,567
to entertain this
evening guests.

290
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,900
Having a guest taken from my own
manor would tarnish my name...

291
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:45,317
not to mention my reputation
as the queen's guard dog...

292
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,025
Your orders Sebastian...

293
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,025
I want the girl returned.

294
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:49,858
Yes...

295
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,192
my young lord.

296
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:58,817
Alone at last,
my song thrush...

297
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,233
You stole my heart the day
I set eyes upon you.

298
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,192
From our very first
meeting, I knew...

299
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,525
I knew that someday
you'd be mine.

300
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,608
What a sinful little
bird you are...

301
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:11,442
inflaming my passions
with such wild abandon.

302
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:12,317
Don't worry, dear.

303
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,900
No one will find us...

304
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:17,400
We're safe here on the luxury
liner I built just for you...

305
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,733
I call it Song Thrush's Warble.

306
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,233
We're free, my love...!

307
00:14:21,317 --> 00:14:24,733
We can do anything...! Come,
let's run away to paradise!

308
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:27,233
You can go wherever
you'd like--alone.

309
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:28,317
The butler?

310
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,025
So you're our kidnapper,
Lord Druitt.

311
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:31,275
My mistress...

312
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:32,733
the goddess of beauty...

313
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,567
has dubbed me
Masque de Vicomte!

314
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,275
I'll be taking the
young lady back now,

315
00:14:39,358 --> 00:14:41,858
Mr. Masque de Vicomte.

316
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:44,067
Truest love is
often forbidden...

317
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,233
There is only
one thing to do...

318
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,192
say goodbye!

319
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:48,150
Ah...

320
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,442
so it's poison, then?

321
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,858
We'll go out together,
my song thrush...

322
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,483
to heaven, where
nobody can follow us!

323
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:58,983
Over my deadly body, dear...

324
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,358
She's not on the schedule
until tomorrow you see,

325
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,108
so I'm afraid you
can't kill her yet.

326
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:05,442
Hello, Grell.

327
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:07,608
Why, if it isn't my Bassy...!

328
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,233
What a coincidence,
running in to you.

329
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,733
I won't let you stand
in the way of our love!

330
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:22,900
Where did he go?

331
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,150
We're together.

332
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,483
There's nothing to fear.

333
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,358
The bugger means to take
the woman along with him...?

334
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:38,442
Well, what a
bloody great bother.

335
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:41,025
We who have been cruelly denied
our love on Earth shall be

336
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,858
wed at long last in Heaven...

337
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,650
Like Tristan and
Isolde right before us.

338
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:48,233
Let us pass from this
world together, my love...

339
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,733
Soon, eternity will be ours.

340
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,650
I believe I already told you.

341
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,233
Go anywhere and you
go alone... sir.

342
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:01,525
You amaze me, as always...!

343
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,358
My body thrills and throbs,

344
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:06,775
fueling my fight
with passion for you!

345
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:11,858
Oh, dear...

346
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:13,067
We're falling!

347
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,775
Sweet song thrush...!

348
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,150
Never forget me!

349
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,442
I looove--

350
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:34,942
Servant of a goddess
or not, a fop like that

351
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,733
never stood a change
against the likes of us, eh?

352
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:42,567
It appears she's
finally awaking...

353
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,567
You're all right...

354
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,650
Thank goodness.

355
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,525
What about little
ol' me, Bassy...?

356
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:49,025
I'm so exhausted
after all that fighting.

357
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,733
I may faint right
where I'm standing.

358
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,108
Won't you hold me?

359
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:54,817
Good grief...!

360
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,817
I cannot believe
I had to come out here.

361
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,025
Will?!

362
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,942
Must you always mess
about before actually

363
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,817
getting your work
done, Setcliff?

364
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,983
Oooh!

365
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:06,108
How I would love
to mess about with Bassy!

366
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,650
We could do some very messy
things together--Wait a second!

367
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:11,233
I am working!

368
00:17:11,317 --> 00:17:12,525
Here look!

369
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:19,358
Would you be kind enough
to tell me your name?

370
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,608
Why did you do that?

371
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:29,108
Punishment for incompetence.

372
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:31,108
This soul isn't
scheduled for death.

373
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,192
Eh?

374
00:17:32,275 --> 00:17:33,942
Look closely at the spelling...

375
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:36,150
The two names are
one letter off.

376
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,775
You have the wrong person.

377
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:38,942
Oh dear...

378
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,483
How silly of me.

379
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:41,817
Honestly...

380
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,483
I tire of having such
a thick-skulled employee.

381
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:46,650
We're leaving...

382
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,025
If we dawdle, the soul
we're actually scheduled

383
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,733
to reap tonight may be
stolen away as well...

384
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,192
by some demon.

385
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,858
Do try to be careful
on your travels...

386
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:58,317
I hear the sea at night
can be dangerous.

387
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,358
Start paddling,
on the double!

388
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:04,608
Must you always be
such a slave driver...?

389
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:08,275
Ta-ta, Bassy, my
scrumptious noodlekins!

390
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,608
Shall we head back now...?

391
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,192
The ball awaits...

392
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,275
Best to keep the events of the
evening to yourself, I think?

393
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:18,858
Oh, you poor dear...!

394
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,775
I'm so glad you're all right.

395
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,192
Come...

396
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,567
We should let her
rest for a while.

397
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,275
What a terrible ordeal for
such a delicate young lady.

398
00:18:32,358 --> 00:18:34,483
But she's so lovely
I can see why a man

399
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:36,192
would want to take her.

400
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,358
You really mustn't wake him.

401
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:05,983
He's reather quite exhausted...

402
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,733
While I was away, my
young master was forced

403
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:09,942
to entertain all the guests.

404
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:12,358
That's taxing enough, but
he also took great pains

405
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,358
to keep anyone from
learning what happened.

406
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:18,108
The excitement
has worn him out.

407
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:19,692
Sincere apologies...

408
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:20,858
my lord.

409
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,858
Miss...

410
00:19:24,942 --> 00:19:26,442
You look confused.

411
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,317
Is something wrong...? Perhaps
it would clear things up if I

412
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,442
told you that I listened to your
entire clandestine phone call.

413
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,150
Such a lithe figure...

414
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,108
and the heavy scent
of death rises from

415
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:38,067
your skin like perfume.

416
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,650
But still...

417
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:42,608
I admit the Ferros chose well
hiring you as their assassin.

418
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,483
You played a good game...

419
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:49,150
Using innocent Lady Elizabeth to
infiltrate Phantomhive manor.

420
00:19:49,233 --> 00:19:51,775
This explains your
awkwardness at tea today.

421
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,483
I'm glad I decided to
give you a private tour...

422
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:58,942
It enabled you to find
your way to this room...

423
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:02,317
where I can easily dispose
of you with nobody noticing.

424
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,900
Why, wherever do you
think you're going, miss?

425
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:11,567
Sebastian?

426
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,483
Have I been sleeping?

427
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:14,692
Yes indeed...

428
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:17,025
With your mouth hanging open,
I might add.

429
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,858
You could have
woken me up, then...

430
00:20:18,942 --> 00:20:20,650
or did you want a laugh...?

431
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,567
Our guest...

432
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,608
good evening.

433
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:24,608
She's come to offer her thanks.

434
00:20:24,692 --> 00:20:25,900
Oh, I see...

435
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,942
Well.

436
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,983
I'm sincerely sorry...

437
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,192
You suffered terribly
as a direct result

438
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:39,233
of the subpar
security at my manor.

439
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,775
As the head of
house Phantomhive,

440
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,650
I accept full responsibility
for this lapse.

441
00:20:45,317 --> 00:20:47,692
If you can forgive me,
please take my hand...

442
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:48,692
You see...

443
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,108
the evening is young still.

444
00:20:50,192 --> 00:20:52,817
The ball in your honor
has even yet to begin.

445
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:01,400
Happy Birthday!

446
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:07,275
I present to you all
today's guest of honor.

447
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,983
My, my what have we here?

448
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:16,108
That dress suits
you splendidly!

449
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,442
Look, dear...

450
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,192
All of these people
gathered here just for you,

451
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:21,442
to celebrate your special day!

452
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,525
My young master and
Lady Elizabeth have been

453
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,525
secretly planning
this all along...

454
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:28,608
A special surprise
party for your birthday.

455
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:31,192
Naturally, I assume the date
you gave Lady Elizabeth

456
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,567
wasn't your real
birthday at all.

457
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,400
Today has become
a celebratory day,

458
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,692
nonetheless...

459
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:39,108
Not only for Lady Elizabeth,
but for the entire

460
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:41,067
Phantomhive household as well.

461
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,025
Sebastian, here it is!

462
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,483
Thanks for waiting.

463
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:45,275
Oooh!

464
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:46,942
It's amazing!

465
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:48,525
I hope you like it, miss...

466
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,275
We were determined to prepare
you a memorable cake for you.

467
00:21:51,358 --> 00:21:52,608
All right Sebastian...

468
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,442
It's time for you
to start singing!

469
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:55,442
Me, sing...?

470
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:56,442
Lady...

471
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:57,483
I couldn't.

472
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:58,900
It's only proper
for someone to sing

473
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,192
when there's
a birthday cake...!

474
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,608
Please, Sebastian,
do it for my friend!

475
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:05,067
I can't possibly refuse
a request from you,

476
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,317
Lady Elizabeth...

477
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,567
I shall do as you wish.

478
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,858
It's your birthday my dear...

479
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:16,858
Older by one more year...

480
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:20,067
This special day you turn...

481
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,025
May you live out your dreams!

482
00:22:33,192 --> 00:22:35,025
Pardon me miss.

483
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:37,400
Your wrist must still hurt
from where I gripped it...

484
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:38,900
Let me assist you...

485
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,567
I'll cut off a nice little
bite for you to nibble upon,

486
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,900
shall I?

487
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:46,483
You must have some.

488
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,525
This was baked
especially for you...

489
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:49,400
Here, say...

490
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,067
Ahhh.

491
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:55,442
Ah, the dancing is beginning.

492
00:22:59,317 --> 00:23:00,692
Goodness, look at that.

493
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:03,192
It seems you and I are the
only ones without partners.

494
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:07,817
I'd be happy to lead
you through the steps

495
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,858
if you would care
for instruction...

496
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:13,108
I daresay you haven't
much experience with balls.

497
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:18,775
That's right...

498
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:20,233
Stay relaxed...

499
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,192
Imagine the calm you feel
when you're killing someone.

500
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:26,442
You look confused again...

501
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:28,483
You want to know why
I haven't killed you...

502
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,692
Well, I have my duties
as a Phantomhive butler...

503
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:34,400
which include making certain
this ball goes well.

504
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,483
I don't care much for
the idea of sullying

505
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,192
my perfectly planned ball
with human blood...

506
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,900
and my master
ordered me to offer

507
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:43,567
you true Phantomhive
hospitality.

508
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,317
For the moment, at least,
that means not killing you.

509
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,525
Come after him at any other
time, and you will die...

510
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:50,983
But for now...

511
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,692
as long as you're a guest
here, I'll continue to treat

512
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:55,650
you according to my
master's wishes.

513
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,983
Do you understand...?
If so, give a little yelp...

514
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,608
Say 'woof', just like a dog.

515
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,150
I'm glad to hear it...

516
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,817
This will remain a little
secret between us then...

517
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,192
Agreed?

518
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:13,525
Am I a colleague
of yours, you ask?

519
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:14,817
No, miss.

520
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,150
I assure you I am
no professional assassin...

521
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:18,900
I am one hell of a butler...

522
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,608
and nothing more.

523
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,108
So fun...

524
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:28,025
Lovely party.

525
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:33,650
I must say, Lizzie seems
quite taken with you.

526
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,400
And I'm glad to have
met you today as well...

527
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:38,275
I hope you don't mind,
but that dress belonged

528
00:24:38,358 --> 00:24:39,483
to my late mother...

529
00:24:39,567 --> 00:24:40,567
I want you to keep it.

530
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,692
It should be worn.

531
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,067
Pardon me...

532
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,775
Your carriage awaits, miss.

533
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:52,733
Thank you for celebrating your
birthday here with us tonight...

534
00:24:52,817 --> 00:24:55,108
I hope to see you again.

535
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:57,192
We'll always be more
than happy to offer you

536
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,567
the famed
Phantomhive hospitality.

537
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:01,400
For now...

538
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:02,900
I bid you goodnight.

539
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,983
That was quite a bother.

540
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,692
Apologies, my lord.

541
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:23,525
I'm bloody tired...

542
00:25:23,608 --> 00:25:25,108
Bring me some tea.

543
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,608
Sir.
