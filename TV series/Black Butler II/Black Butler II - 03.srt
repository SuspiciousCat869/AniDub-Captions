1
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:15,442
Have a nice evening...

2
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:16,650
Thank you.

3
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,483
Oh, I do hope they
I do come out well!

4
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,775
How could they not...?

5
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:27,608
After all you were
the subject, darling.

6
00:00:27,692 --> 00:00:30,108
Surely the likeness can be
nothing short of gorgeous.

7
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,150
Darling!

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,275
A lovers' song
destined to end in death.

9
00:00:46,858 --> 00:00:49,692
A lilting melody
singed by sparks of pain.

10
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,400
Wh- -Ellen!

11
00:00:58,775 --> 00:00:59,942
Ellen!

12
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,108
No...!

13
00:01:08,192 --> 00:01:09,525
Ellen!

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,817
Ellen...!

15
00:01:23,567 --> 00:01:25,483
Thus the music closes...

16
00:01:25,567 --> 00:01:28,442
The fierce,
fiery finery of death!

17
00:02:58,817 --> 00:03:02,192
This afternoon we have a green
tea from the Kangra Valley...

18
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,900
On the side you will
find a gooseberry

19
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,650
and elderflower jelly.

20
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:10,317
I suppose it'll do.

21
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm glad you find it
satisfactory.

22
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,108
When you're finished,
there is work to be done.

23
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:16,442
Oh?

24
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,400
People being burned alive...?

25
00:03:22,483 --> 00:03:23,650
Oh, yes...

26
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,733
That's to do with the rash
of crimes in London...?

27
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,025
I'm told there was
another last night.

28
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:31,275
There was...

29
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,317
Naturally, Her Majesty
grieves for those

30
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,692
who have been afflicted...

31
00:03:34,775 --> 00:03:37,025
and for her citizens,
who live in fear.

32
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,733
Is there something
else wrong, my lord?

33
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,983
"We find these events
most unsavory...

34
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,608
Our course is clear...

35
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:49,942
We shall again leave the matter
to 'the dog and the spider'."

36
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:51,650
That's an odd statement.

37
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,317
It sounds as if she's
saying this sort of

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,358
incident has happened before.

39
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:57,817
Yes sir...

40
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,692
And who is this 'spider'?

41
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,650
A mysterious nickname...

42
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,150
"Spider"...

43
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,608
I can't say I've recall ever
hearding of such a person.

44
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,567
There's no use
sitting here, anyway...

45
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,525
We'll see to the
queen's concerns...

46
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,983
That must always
be our priority.

47
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,275
We head for London.

48
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,733
I'll begin the preparations.

49
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:20,983
One more thing...

50
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,733
Be careful that Madam
Red doesn't catch wind

51
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:24,025
of what we're doing...

52
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,525
This is the sort
of thing she likes.

53
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:28,483
We don't need her
poking her nose in.

54
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,900
I doubt there's
any need to worry.

55
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:44,858
I don't like learning there's
a part of my family's past

56
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,650
of which I know nothing.

57
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:48,692
It's only natural.

58
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:51,067
You were forced to assume the
earldom at an early age,

59
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,567
my lord...

60
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,692
Surely there was much your
father was unable to pass on to.

61
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:58,400
I couldn't have asked for
a better opportunity, though.

62
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,400
If I can resolve a situation in
which my father was embroiled,

63
00:05:03,483 --> 00:05:05,567
word will spread throughout
the criminal underworld

64
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,567
like wildfire.

65
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:12,442
That should be what I need
to draw them out of hiding.

66
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,900
You intend to use yourself
as bait, my lord?

67
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:23,067
They began this
by hurting my pride,

68
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,275
but I'm the one
who's going to end it...

69
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:28,650
I'll drag them all into
the open and make them pay!

70
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,192
Nothing will stop me.

71
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:35,108
And what do you do if the
culprits have already parished?

72
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,858
Nothing changes...

73
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:38,108
I'll tear the truth
from their buried,

74
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,608
rotten flesh if I have to.

75
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:42,233
Simple as that.

76
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:43,483
Now that's my master...

77
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:45,275
A true Phantomhive.

78
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,858
The people have a theory...

79
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:52,442
They say the victims took too
much to drink and combusted.

80
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:54,233
The Yard doesn't go by gossip...

81
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:55,358
Go find some evidence!

82
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:55,983
Yes, sir!

83
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:57,442
Right away, sir!

84
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,150
--Let's go!
--Aye!

85
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,192
Having a little trouble,
are we, Sir Arthur?

86
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,483
Ciel Phantomhive!

87
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,983
Let's hear about the
investigation so far.

88
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,025
There's no progress
to mention as yet.

89
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:20,442
So how do these differ
from the previous incidents?

90
00:06:20,525 --> 00:06:23,067
Or perhaps everything
happened exactly the same...

91
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,442
There have been
similar crimes before?

92
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,025
So then you do know.

93
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,067
Actually, not until now...

94
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,608
You confirmed it.

95
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,608
Now that that's settled,
show me the old case file.

96
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,567
There's nothing left of it.

97
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,400
Nothing?

98
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:38,733
Not a page.

99
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:41,692
And even if there were,
I couldn't show it to you.

100
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:44,567
There aren't any records left?

101
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,483
Scotland Yard will find
who's responsible

102
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,942
for this and their motives...

103
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:50,067
We'll determine how it's
connected to the old cases,

104
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,775
as well.

105
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,442
You aren't needed here.

106
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:54,942
I hope you're right, sir...

107
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,442
Let's go, Sebastian.

108
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:06,233
Those round eyes so innocent
of this world's filth...!

109
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:09,317
That tail, childish
yet somehow noble!

110
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,108
Those paws,
pale-pink and perfect!

111
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:17,858
Chief Inspector...!

112
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:20,275
We didn't find
any notable evidence.

113
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:22,983
Master...

114
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,233
my apologies...

115
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:26,483
I was distracted
by these charming kittens...

116
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,525
Shall we?

117
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,483
Say good day to
your feline friends.

118
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:33,733
Who was he, sir?

119
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:34,858
A menace.

120
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,608
Also known as the
Queen's guard dog...

121
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:39,608
It seems he's
come back to London.

122
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,150
"The Queen's guard dog...?

123
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:44,192
Then does that mean he's...

124
00:07:44,275 --> 00:07:46,025
He's a most unpleasant man...

125
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,650
What shall we do?

126
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,608
Well if the Yard is no help...

127
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,817
then there's only
one thing to do.

128
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,900
Startled, the woman dropped
her copy of Bleak House...

129
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,525
"Careful!" she cried.

130
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,192
"You scared the
Dickens out of me!"...

131
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:06,192
Thank you.

132
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,775
That's all I have
this evening.

133
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,108
That was brilliant...!

134
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:11,150
Everything from the words
down to the delivery.

135
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,358
You're truly
a comic genius...!

136
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,067
The finest act I've seen
in quite some time!

137
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,567
That might have been the worst
joke I've ever heard in my life.

138
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,817
Which, in itself,
is something special...

139
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,025
I shall have to keep my end
of the bargain, shan't I?

140
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,650
What're you playing at?

141
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,275
I asked for a corpse
from the arson case.

142
00:08:31,358 --> 00:08:32,650
Indeed you did...

143
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,150
And here it is...

144
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,983
in this little vial.

145
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:38,775
Well, most of it.

146
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:41,150
I scraped up everything
I could from the crime scene...

147
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:44,108
After the fire was done with
the victim, there was nothing

148
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,858
left behind for me to
collect but these ashes.

149
00:08:58,275 --> 00:08:59,983
Look, my lord.

150
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,442
Pardon me.

151
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,025
I'm Turner, the photographer.

152
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,858
Excuse the intrusion...

153
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,733
I'm so sorry for your loss.

154
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:14,192
I've brought the last
picture that was taken

155
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,983
of your dear wife...

156
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,358
Here you are, sir.

157
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,942
She seemed like
such a nice woman.

158
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:23,108
Our condolences, sir.

159
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,692
She was truly beautiful.

160
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,567
Such a great loss.

161
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,692
My lord.

162
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,275
I've identified the substance
found in the ashes.

163
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,358
It matches the sample we
gathered from the photographer

164
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,650
and his wife.

165
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,775
These are flecks
of magnesium oxide...

166
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,567
a by-product of photography...

167
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,442
It's made from the flash
powder photographers use

168
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,275
to capture their images.

169
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:04,358
Photography...

170
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,733
eh?

171
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:07,775
I was able to obtain
information on the import

172
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,025
of such products from Mr. Lau.

173
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,233
Really, a butler and
a chemist, are we...?

174
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,775
Ah, Yes, you're right.

175
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,942
A shipment of magnesium did
indeed arrive at the Docklands

176
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,192
the other day...

177
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,900
Let's see, it was bound for...

178
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:20,775
a London portrait studio.

179
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:24,233
From the looks of it,
they're laying in quite a store.

180
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:26,900
They purchased an
entire ship's worth.

181
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,192
You have me curious...

182
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,400
What are you investigating?

183
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,067
Surely that's more
than they would need

184
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,567
for their flash powder.

185
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,025
Quite...

186
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:39,775
And in addition, the victims
had something in common...

187
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,442
I've taken a look at the
history of all those burned...

188
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:45,150
There's a connection
between the women...

189
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,942
They'd all recently had
their wedding photos taken...

190
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:48,983
Odd, no?

191
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,233
Let me guess:
at Turner's studio?

192
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:57,192
Let's get moving.

193
00:10:57,275 --> 00:10:58,775
This is no coincidence.

194
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,275
That couple is involved.

195
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,650
Yes, my lord.

196
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:07,942
Wh...

197
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:08,775
What are you doing?

198
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:09,942
You ogre...

199
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,775
Useless, hideous man!

200
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,192
Ever since I made the
mistake of marrying you...

201
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,275
I've waited...

202
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:22,608
Never a moment
of burning passion.

203
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,775
I'm done taking
portraits of happy women!

204
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:32,067
There's fire at last!

205
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,858
It's my turn for happiness!

206
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:46,567
Is that who I think it is?

207
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,108
It's Mrs. Turner from
the photography studio.

208
00:11:49,192 --> 00:11:50,108
Oh, yes...!

209
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,775
I'll find my happiness now!

210
00:11:54,317 --> 00:11:55,442
Master!

211
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,400
That camera must be
her ignition device...!

212
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,525
She has to be stopped.

213
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:01,942
Capture her!

214
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:02,983
Yes indeed...

215
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,233
My young lord.

216
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,108
That color...

217
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,858
I've seen it before...

218
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,483
So red.

219
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,733
I thought it was you.

220
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,233
I've been simply
dying to see you...

221
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:35,942
sweet Bassy!

222
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:48,858
So, Grell...

223
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,942
You've been pulling the
strings behind the scenes.

224
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:53,483
I've pulled nothing more than
the red strings of fate

225
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,317
that connect our hearts
together, Bassy!

226
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:01,067
How could you...?!

227
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,525
I'm so dainty!

228
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,442
Now, now, don't act
so offended...

229
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:05,608
You struck first.

230
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:07,233
I just took an
affectionate swipe at you

231
00:13:07,317 --> 00:13:08,483
out of excitement...

232
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,733
I didn't mean any harm.

233
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:11,650
I was only
following that pig.

234
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,400
You're after her too?

235
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:16,483
You're acquainted
with this freak then?

236
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:18,900
Regrettably, yes.

237
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:21,275
His job is to collect
souls of the deceased.

238
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:22,483
He's a grim reaper.

239
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,067
A grim reaper...?

240
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,733
It sounds as if you and he
might have something in common.

241
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,150
Really?

242
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:31,192
There has been
a recent spate of crime...

243
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:33,150
I imagine that's
what brought him here...

244
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,650
the sudden increase in souls.

245
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:37,192
I'm sure my workload will
decrease with you on the case,

246
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:37,567
though...

247
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,108
Se...

248
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:38,650
bas...

249
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,025
tian...!

250
00:13:40,108 --> 00:13:42,900
At last, our amorous
adventure can begin anew--

251
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:46,608
Let's spend this--

252
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,317
We don't have time
to fool with him...

253
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,942
Let's go!

254
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:50,483
Yes sir.

255
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,942
Uh-uh!

256
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:54,525
Leap through these flames...!

257
00:13:54,608 --> 00:13:57,525
Gather me in your arms and hold
me tight, dearest one--

258
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,442
Excuse me.

259
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:01,775
Please come back to me...!

260
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,483
Don't leave, Sebastian!

261
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,317
Evacuate the citizens
upwind of the fire!

262
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,608
Right!

263
00:14:08,692 --> 00:14:12,108
This town always seems
so easy to set ablaze.

264
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,608
There she is.

265
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:25,817
Aw, what a shame...

266
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,192
Did you let her get away?

267
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,442
Hello again, Grell...

268
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,192
Don't you have work
to be tending to?

269
00:14:32,275 --> 00:14:34,733
I am a hunter of love
seeking my favorite game...

270
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:38,192
That's the only work I care
about right now, my darling.

271
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,608
Besides, it's a slow night...

272
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,233
I only have one soul to reap.

273
00:14:42,317 --> 00:14:44,025
One only?

274
00:14:44,108 --> 00:14:45,817
Margaret Turner's time is up...

275
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,233
At five past midnight...

276
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:49,733
It says she goes on
a killing spree of sorts...

277
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:52,067
after which, she burns
herself to death...

278
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,775
She's the only soul
in the ledger...

279
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:56,525
No one else is scheduled
to be reaped by me tonight...

280
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:59,067
So I'm as free as a bird.

281
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,483
What about all the people
she's set on fire?

282
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,025
She uses fire of
a very special sort...

283
00:15:04,108 --> 00:15:07,275
When she kills people, their
souls are burned away with them.

284
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,192
Where did you go, Turner?

285
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,858
Up there...

286
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,358
She'll burn everything!

287
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,983
Now you'll all find
happiness too...!

288
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,192
Happiness all around!

289
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,358
Put down the barrel.

290
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,483
Oh so your another interloper
come to take away my happiness!

291
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,108
Have you taken leave
of your senses?

292
00:15:49,192 --> 00:15:51,608
How could you possibly
find happiness from this?

293
00:15:51,692 --> 00:15:52,858
I'll find it...!

294
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:53,983
My time has finally come.

295
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,567
He told me so!

296
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:03,275
Master!

297
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:04,358
Quite a development...

298
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:06,608
Who knew pigs could
climb so high?

299
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,817
A little brat like you could
never hope to understand

300
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,233
what it's like to be married
to a man you don't even love.

301
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:23,275
All I want is to feel burning
passion for a man...!

302
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:27,775
I'll find that, and I'll fry
anyone who stands in my way!

303
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,150
You're absolutely pathetic.

304
00:16:34,233 --> 00:16:36,192
Do something instead
of whining...!

305
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:38,192
Regrets accomplish nothing...!

306
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,650
Wallowing in self-pity
like that's despicable...

307
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,733
You're no better
than a filthy pig!

308
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:44,317
Your future's been stolen.

309
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,025
Your dreams have
been shattered...

310
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:48,025
You're left with
nothing but despair...

311
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,858
Yet you face the
reality and fight...

312
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,025
never once losing
your nobility.

313
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,942
Yes, that's it
my young master...

314
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,400
That's the quality of soul
I want to consume.

315
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,483
A pig...?!

316
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,817
A pig, am I?!

317
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,942
How dare you call me
something so foul?!

318
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,567
Now then I should be hurrying.

319
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,900
I believe you said Mrs. Turner
would burn herself to death

320
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,442
at five past.

321
00:17:12,525 --> 00:17:13,150
Wait a moment.

322
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:14,483
What are you getting at?

323
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,192
Following my lord's command...

324
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:18,567
He ordered me to capture her,
so that's what I shall do.

325
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,817
You've arrived at the
party too late for that.

326
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,650
I am never too late to follow
an order from my master...

327
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:26,108
If I was, what kind
of butler would I be?

328
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,650
Shall the two of us
get going...?

329
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,233
We have a task.

330
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,358
You want me to come along?

331
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:34,858
You might have noticed
my lord's surly demeanor...

332
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,900
I'm sure he'd make a
rather unsuitable model.

333
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,525
You'd make a marvelous
subject for a photo though,

334
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:41,983
but if you don't want to...

335
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:45,192
Allow me to show you
some of the more enticing

336
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,775
shots I've cultivated!

337
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,108
I'll roast anyone
who calls me a pig...

338
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:56,317
I don't care if you
are just a little boy!

339
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,358
How long am I supposed
to wait on you?

340
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:04,233
Come...

341
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,358
Sebastian!

342
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,150
Indeed...

343
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,358
my young lord.

344
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:10,067
You think talking
to yourself will help?

345
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:18,983
Impossible...!

346
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:19,733
Who--?

347
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,275
That's my butler...

348
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:22,358
...and some a freak.

349
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,483
Deadly efficiency.

350
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,608
That's my motto!

351
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,650
Stay out of this,
whoever you are!

352
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:36,442
What the devil...?

353
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,483
Why haven't you caught fire?

354
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,150
You're using the
grim reaper as bait, eh?

355
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,567
Very clever.

356
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,067
Take as many as you'd like

357
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,108
We ladies ripen like succulent
fruit with every photograph.

358
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,317
I can feel it now.

359
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,733
I'm about to burst like
a bright red berry!

360
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:07,817
It's pouring...

361
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,525
gushing...

362
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,400
right out of me!

363
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,858
What a marvelous feeling!

364
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,233
So enticing!

365
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:15,942
So exhilarating...!,
I'm the very Queen of fruits!

366
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,317
The ripest of the reapers...!

367
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,483
Yes!

368
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,817
Well then perhaps
I should bite you.

369
00:19:25,608 --> 00:19:26,192
Please...!

370
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:27,525
Please!

371
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:29,150
I expected you sooner.

372
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,692
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,483
I will burn you, boy!

374
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:36,817
How could you!

375
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,192
I could have done
much more had I wished...

376
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:42,608
I have orders to follow,
and follow them I shall.

377
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,067
Where did you come from...?

378
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,067
Who are you people?!

379
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,817
I'm simply...

380
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,442
one hell of a butler

381
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:52,775
I'm the queen of the reapers,
the ripest fruit there is!

382
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,983
Tell me everything...

383
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,317
From start to finish.

384
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,733
It was him...!

385
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:01,067
He was the one who
told me what to do...

386
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,483
And if I did...

387
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,733
he said I'd
find true passion...

388
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,525
He said the most
gorgeous men would fight

389
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,900
to the death over me.

390
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,358
And "he" would be...?

391
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,108
The one with the golden eyes.
He promised me!

392
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,442
I don't understand...

393
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,817
Her soul's burning
like her victims' did.

394
00:20:19,692 --> 00:20:21,733
Burning passion!

395
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:24,275
Happiness!

396
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:25,192
Hold on...!

397
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,608
--I want to know--
--Master!

398
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:30,442
My lord...

399
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:31,525
are you hurt?

400
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:32,608
I'm fine.

401
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,067
This doesn't make sense...!

402
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,525
It was right here
in the ledger.

403
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:39,942
How can the soul I'm
to collect just burn up...?

404
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,525
This can't be happening...

405
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,567
It's fundamentally wrong.

406
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,442
I must make my report
to Will, so, alas, this will

407
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,400
have to be our final photo.

408
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,275
Next time it'll be a more
intimate lovers' portrait,

409
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:54,358
Bassy...!

410
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:55,192
Toodle-oo!

411
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:57,233
Bye Bye

412
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:58,650
I'm sorry, lord...

413
00:20:58,733 --> 00:21:01,192
I know you asked me to capture
the Turner woman, but...

414
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:06,525
That's all that's left...?

415
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:09,442
Nothing but a pile of ashes.

416
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:11,358
I'll inform Her Majesty
that these murders were

417
00:21:11,442 --> 00:21:13,900
the work of a woman
crazed with longing.

418
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,525
I'm continually impressed...

419
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,150
Humans seem to be
capable of anything

420
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,150
when they are
desperate for love.

421
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,067
What a ridiculous waste...

422
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,275
All that for some intangible
concept like love.

423
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:29,900
Laughable, isn't it sir?

424
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,233
Pathetic as well.

425
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:34,525
Ah, well...

426
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:37,025
Not everything
has burned away.

427
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,650
Research this 'spider'...

428
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,608
It may have made
a move during this case.

429
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:43,025
I want to know everything
there is to know.

430
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,733
Yes my, lord.

431
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:19,692
Master.

432
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,858
Master.

433
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,192
Pardon me for disturbing
you during your sleep.

434
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:29,858
What is it?

435
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,358
Did you find something?

436
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,275
I visited the Museum.

437
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:34,858
This book looked relevant.

438
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,650
As we know, there was a previous
instance of live burnings...

439
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:41,942
During this time, there was
another family working behind

440
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,858
the scenes for the Queen,
like the Phantomhives do...

441
00:23:44,942 --> 00:23:47,483
They specialized in clean-up.

442
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:50,692
"Specialized in clean-up"
eh...? It's no wonder

443
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:53,650
Scotland Yard didn't have
any of the old records.

444
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:56,692
The family head passed away
three years ago...

445
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:59,650
but as I understand it,
his son has taken over.

446
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,733
They are known as
the Earls Trancy.

447
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,692
Trancy...

448
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,442
Could he be the spider?

449
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,608
By order of the Queen,
we've found ourselves

450
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:16,150
on quite the perilous
train journey...

451
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:19,442
I have a weapon perfectly suited
for this particular occasion...

452
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,733
It's hard as a rock...

453
00:24:20,817 --> 00:24:22,358
unwavering as steel...

454
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,608
monumental as a mountain...

455
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,775
Next time: "Terrorist Butler"

456
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:35,150
If I couldn't whip up a couple
homemade motion sickness bag

457
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,858
or two... what kind of
butler would I be?
