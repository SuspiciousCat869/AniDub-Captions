1
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:27,567
Young master...

2
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:28,775
good morning.

3
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,025
I know that smell.

4
00:00:35,108 --> 00:00:36,442
Is it Earl Grey?

5
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:37,858
Indeed...

6
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:40,400
My compliments to your
excellent nose, young master...

7
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,983
This morning we have
an Earl Grey Impérial.

8
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:47,400
It's most excellent, made from
the finest leaves available...

9
00:00:47,483 --> 00:00:49,567
A true masterpiece.

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,942
I believe it will be
perfect for you.

11
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,567
Your schedule this afternoon
is like a fresh field

12
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,900
of virgin snow...

13
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:03,108
Blank as an unlined page.

14
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:06,150
Today everything
shall be as you wish it.

15
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,067
What of Alois?

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,317
Where is he?

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,608
Whatever do you mean...?
It was your noble sword

18
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:13,525
that struck the blow
that felled Alois Trancy.

19
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:14,775
Is that so?

20
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:17,067
Does thinking on it
pain you, master?

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,108
He died because he
was weak, simple as that.

22
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,900
Oh, such
unwavering confidence!

23
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:29,942
Here is the nobility of one
who has subjugated others

24
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,442
all his life by right of birth!

25
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,275
Here are the legs
of one unused to walking...

26
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:40,233
so very slender and delicate.

27
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:44,150
Smooth skin,
soft to the touch.

28
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,525
Blissful.

29
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,442
What's that?

30
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:54,400
That...?

31
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:55,692
Likely just a cat.

32
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,317
That crash was
too loud for a cat...

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,567
Strengthen the
manor's defenses!

34
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,358
Indeed...

35
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:02,900
my young lord.

36
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:08,275
What a revolting display!

37
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,108
Such a strong kick...

38
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:12,358
blissful!

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,858
Honestly!

40
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:21,442
I shall investigate it...

41
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,567
First...

42
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,525
Hannah...!

43
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:24,775
Guard our lord.

44
00:02:24,858 --> 00:02:26,025
Yes.

45
00:02:34,692 --> 00:02:36,692
A storm has rolled in.

46
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,358
Ah, little one...

47
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:42,858
Fear not...

48
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:46,067
Master specifically told it
to stay out of his sight...

49
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,483
There's nothing
at all it can do.

50
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:55,483
The sweetbriars
are looking lovely...

51
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:58,483
Simply look at these exquisite
flowers, little one...

52
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:01,400
They are perfect
for my young master.

53
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:05,317
Yes, they suit my
young master quite well.

54
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,192
Yes, Oh...! It's
just too much!

55
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:17,983
He's just delicious!

56
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:21,733
Gorgeous, lovelorn Bassy!

57
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:24,192
oh...

58
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:25,858
my...!

59
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:28,692
Letting that Claude demon go
was a most excellent decision

60
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,067
on my part...

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,317
Just look at this photograph!
Absolute perfection!

62
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,442
What...? No...! Not now...!

63
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,483
Don't break on me.

64
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,275
My, when did you get here?

65
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,525
Funny, I was going
to ask you the same.

66
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:47,692
Well...

67
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,900
perhaps just one more.

68
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,900
Mmm, a marvelous pose.

69
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:41,942
Bassy...

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,108
I must admit, it is rather
odd seeing you prepare tea

71
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,733
just for me...

72
00:05:47,817 --> 00:05:48,525
I, uh...

73
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:49,817
I'm happy, of course...

74
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,442
But, well, I, uhhhhhh...

75
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:55,567
A cup of Suutei Tsai,
a Mongolian milk tea

76
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,775
flavored with rock salt.

77
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,108
R-rock salt?!

78
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,233
I've no doubt it will
be wonderfully stimulating

79
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:03,567
to feel the salt
in your wounds.

80
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,275
Just for you, I've doubled
the amount it calls for...

81
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,733
Doubled it again.

82
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,025
And thought...
why not double it yet again?

83
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:10,983
On second thought...

84
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,192
I...

85
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,650
Drink up.

86
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:22,358
The sharp pain of love!

87
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:23,650
I cannot stand it!

88
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:24,942
Ahhh!

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,317
I see...

90
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,817
So Claude is responsible for
the murder of Alois Trancy.

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,192
Yes...

92
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,025
and then he put together
a soul-infusing ceremony...

93
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:39,275
Two separate souls can
never be completely fused...

94
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,983
but pesky memories
can be overwritten.

95
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:45,192
Which means that now,
Alois Trancy--

96
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,067
--is the same as
your young master, yes.

97
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,692
Been turned into a ring...

98
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,733
a jewel thicker than
the thickest blood,

99
00:06:51,817 --> 00:06:53,567
more crimson than passion.

100
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,025
I can't say I understand...

101
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:01,358
Why bother fixating
on some little brat's soul...?

102
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:04,817
You would make a far simpler,
quicker meal, Bassy.

103
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:10,150
You sound like
someone else I know.

104
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,775
Just look at his face...

105
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:15,108
The slack, fatuous features
Claude wears perpetually...

106
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:17,108
There lies your answer.

107
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,150
Perfectly uniform.

108
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:27,275
Close-fitting, ivory teeth like
a row of fresh young skulls...

109
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:28,108
Smooth...

110
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,067
delicate...

111
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,483
enchanting.

112
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,192
Don't gag me!

113
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:36,608
Apologies, my lord...

114
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:37,775
Pardon.

115
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:38,692
I mean really?!

116
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:40,358
You call yourself a butler...?

117
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:43,275
Sebastian would never
do something li--

118
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,900
Your contract with him
is but a burden...

119
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,733
like chains
round your wrists...

120
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,483
Continued thoughts
of that demon will be

121
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,442
detrimental to your spleen...

122
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,983
He deserves naught but
your hatred, young master...

123
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,358
Sebastian Michaelis
is your sworn enemy.

124
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:00,692
I know that.

125
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,192
Break free of your fetters...

126
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,108
Let us sign a contract...

127
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,817
Then we shall get
revenge on that demon!

128
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,233
You presume too much.

129
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:12,650
I'm only here at all
because I have no desire

130
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,192
to return to that
wretched manor...

131
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,275
Dealing with
Sebastian is my business...

132
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:18,858
I don't need any
assistance from you.

133
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:20,608
Oh, don't you?

134
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:23,233
You're up against
a demon, after all.

135
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,608
You needn't come to
a decision right away.

136
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:34,150
In this mansion, the threads
of time itself are tangled up

137
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:36,067
in the spider's web.

138
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,608
He is such a proud young boy...

139
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,817
a truly reckless,
truly defenseless soul.

140
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:58,358
Ciel Phantomhive's
soul is a fine one ...

141
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:02,233
Yes a truly fine soul!

142
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,483
B-B-Bassy...

143
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:10,733
Come Grell.

144
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,025
Let's go.

145
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:12,608
Ooo-hh...

146
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:13,858
terribly sorry.

147
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,442
I have an appointment
with my hairdresser...

148
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:21,733
So...

149
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:22,817
so lovely!

150
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:25,442
Come here, camera.

151
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:26,733
Now, pose!

152
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,983
So you know, I plan
to strike approximately

153
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,358
eight additional
attractive poses today.

154
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,483
I can't pass this up...!
Eight more poses...!

155
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,900
Wait for me!

156
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:42,983
Thompson and company,
I have a task for you.

157
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:47,192
I want you three
to see to that demon.

158
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,650
I'm confused.

159
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:01,733
Why does that butler
call me 'young master'?

160
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:07,942
Is Alois really dead...?
And was it I who killed him?

161
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,525
And Sebastian...

162
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:11,233
why would he...?

163
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,025
Master!

164
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,233
Thank you, my lord...

165
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,692
It is your right to thrash me.

166
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:33,025
Do continue if
it pleases you...

167
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:34,650
I wish to help.

168
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:35,817
What now...?

169
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,817
Thrash you...?

170
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,108
Your eye...

171
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:43,817
Is there anyone in this manor
who's not completely insane?

172
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,567
What, were you going
to stay there all day?

173
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,650
Here we are.

174
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:23,942
Ugh...!

175
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,733
Oh my, what is
this horrible place?

176
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:28,275
Oh, but it could work...!

177
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:33,983
Imagine dear Bassy nude
amid the rubble...! Oh, my!

178
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:34,817
Oi, guv.

179
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,483
Care for a taste?

180
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:39,233
Hah...

181
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,192
a joke...! I could
never manage it.

182
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,108
It's been far, far too long...

183
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,483
Got cobwebs down there, I do.

184
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,400
Welcome, sirs, to the cursed
village of Arachnophile.

185
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:54,692
I thought this place had been
burned completely away...

186
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,317
How is it you're still here?

187
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,983
Ah...

188
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,025
I'm the only one who
was saved from the fire...

189
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,608
Saved by a demon.

190
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:08,067
He's filthy!

191
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,358
Go on, do it.

192
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:10,608
Kick 'im some more!

193
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,275
Bullyin' a poor, weak boy!

194
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,317
Ugh, it's slut!

195
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,317
She stinks!

196
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,608
Shut it, you...

197
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,358
Bloody kids.

198
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:24,442
I'm poor...

199
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,692
but I'm no weakling.

200
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:27,650
Oh, 'course not.

201
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:28,692
Sorry dear...

202
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:29,650
I can see it now.

203
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,442
You're a tough one aren't you.

204
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,400
You can hold your own, eh?

205
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:34,317
Yeah...

206
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,358
I'm real tough...

207
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:37,192
I promised my big brother...

208
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,650
I told him I'd be strong!

209
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,025
Everyone, everything,
all gone...!

210
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:45,025
Everyone,
everything, all gone!

211
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:47,233
But you seem
like a nice lady...

212
00:12:47,317 --> 00:12:49,483
How about I give you
a free ticket eh...?

213
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,775
Everybody minus one!

214
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:52,692
What?

215
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:53,483
Well...

216
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,650
I made me a contract.

217
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,358
With a demon.

218
00:12:57,442 --> 00:13:00,275
The way the boy told it, he'd
made some kinda contract with

219
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:04,233
a demon to make sure his beloved
brother's wish come true...

220
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,608
The price was
his very own soul.

221
00:13:06,692 --> 00:13:08,567
At first, I thought
it was nothing more

222
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,817
than some silly fairy story...

223
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,108
but then...

224
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,733
The fire came...

225
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,317
Everything the boy
had said was true.

226
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,608
I was the only one
who survived that day.

227
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,733
I've managed on
my own somehow...

228
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,817
But I guess that's
all over now...

229
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,233
Nice meetin' you--

230
00:13:51,692 --> 00:13:52,983
The game is afoot.

231
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,067
Huh?

232
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:01,150
Oh, nooo...! I've let the
second pose go to waste.

233
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:02,983
Clumsy, clumsy me!

234
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,483
I swear I won't miss
the next one, though!

235
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,192
Aaah...!

236
00:14:11,275 --> 00:14:13,275
Things are heating up
quite nicely.

237
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:17,067
Such long, graceful limbs!

238
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,692
Oh, do look out, darling!

239
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,067
What a cruel, insightful gaze.

240
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,525
And his ankles, peeking out
from the cuffs of his trousers!

241
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:31,733
One exciting
pose after another!

242
00:14:35,983 --> 00:14:36,942
Oh, dash it all...

243
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:38,608
Is it over already?

244
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:39,775
Your death scythe...

245
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:40,692
Now, Grell.

246
00:14:40,775 --> 00:14:42,275
What...?

247
00:14:42,358 --> 00:14:44,317
Certainly you can finish them
off more quickly by yourself.

248
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,025
Please just do it, Grell.

249
00:14:46,108 --> 00:14:46,858
Hmm?

250
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:47,942
You're incorrigible, Bassy.

251
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,025
Why are you always
doing this to me?

252
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,192
What a warm evening...

253
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:23,567
Well well, what do you know.

254
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,942
So that's what happened...

255
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,567
There's just no
accounting for demons.

256
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,067
More or less what I thought.

257
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,400
It is?

258
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:33,233
However...

259
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,567
That, I didn't see.

260
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,608
Um, uh, Bassy...!

261
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,567
You're demoning!

262
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,733
You're demoning!

263
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,692
I've seen enough of this.

264
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,900
I have a pressing
appointment...

265
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,317
With a spider.

266
00:16:01,983 --> 00:16:03,275
Grotesque...

267
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:04,942
What does he think he's
on about, putting his

268
00:16:05,025 --> 00:16:07,275
grubby fingers
all over my dinner?

269
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:08,900
Wait, Bassy.

270
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,692
Come back...!

271
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:14,025
I still have at least
two more photographs to take!

272
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,775
He's quick.

273
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:20,275
Young master.

274
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,692
Whatever's wrong?

275
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,025
I thought I saw him...

276
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,775
I thought Alois
was in the mirror.

277
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:29,400
Master...

278
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:31,150
are you hurt?

279
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,442
No, I'm all right.

280
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,192
Hannah...!

281
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,483
Clean this up at once...

282
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,650
I'll take the young master
to his bedchamber--

283
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,942
No, you see to
the cleaning, Claude.

284
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:39,983
Me, lord?

285
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:40,983
Now, Hannah...

286
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,192
let's go.

287
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:51,817
What's this...?

288
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,317
Hannah?

289
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
My lord...

290
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,317
I wonder...

291
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,067
What came over me just now?

292
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,025
I hate this mansion...

293
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,358
I want to go home.

294
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:06,733
To the Phantomhive estate?

295
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,692
I just want...

296
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,650
things to go back...

297
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:10,942
to the way they were.

298
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,067
Your eye is an odd color...

299
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,067
I can't explain it...

300
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,942
It's nostalgic somehow.

301
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:20,733
Master.

302
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:23,817
Watch closely.

303
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,233
I'll show you something.

304
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:34,983
What on earth is this?!

305
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,567
Is that...

306
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,900
me?

307
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,233
I'm suffering horribly...

308
00:17:43,317 --> 00:17:46,358
But how can I
be watching myself...?

309
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:49,442
What is that...? Is it...

310
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,525
is it my eye in there?!

311
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:57,567
That's right...

312
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,942
What you saw was
indeed your own eye...

313
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:03,067
Sleep well, master.

314
00:18:15,483 --> 00:18:16,567
What a surprise...

315
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,108
I thought you were
spying from a distance,

316
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:20,275
but here you are
at the front entrance.

317
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,317
My young master's
orders were specific.

318
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,775
He instructed me
to stay out of his sight...

319
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,942
It's certainly no
violation of his orders

320
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,942
if it's only you seeing me.

321
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,275
Now then...

322
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:37,900
I came tonight to
return this to you.

323
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,608
Another surprise...

324
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:56,358
A demon terminating a contract
is a most unusual occurrence.

325
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,608
I'm terminating nothing.

326
00:18:59,692 --> 00:19:02,067
You broke the contract first.

327
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,942
We swore to defer our battle
over the young master's soul

328
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,067
until it was fully cultivated.

329
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,275
That is, until after
he had had his revenge.

330
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,775
Our agreement was to use each
other for mutual benefit

331
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:14,525
until such a time.

332
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:17,733
My, my...

333
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:20,692
These spider mites
have discolored the leaves.

334
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:25,108
It seems my rose was infested.

335
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,233
A regrettable turn of events?

336
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:33,817
Indeed...

337
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,692
Now both roses are dead.

338
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,525
The contract's terminated...

339
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:40,192
Hear me now...

340
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:42,525
Come hell or high water,
I intend to devour

341
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:44,400
Ciel Phantomhive's soul...

342
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,942
You see...

343
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:49,108
I know now there's more to it
than its superior flavor...

344
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:50,775
It goes much deeper than that.

345
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:51,733
Yes...

346
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:54,233
In that you are correct.

347
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,775
We demons are
granted eternal life...

348
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:58,650
However, we grow weary...

349
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,025
We live so long...

350
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,942
far, far too long.

351
00:20:02,025 --> 00:20:04,983
And my young master's life lends
a certain spice to the world

352
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,192
upon which we glut ourselves.

353
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,525
His soul dwells in darkness
and yet remains unstained...

354
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,400
It charms us,
vexes us, tantalizes us...

355
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:14,567
frenzys us mad...

356
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,858
And now...

357
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:17,400
Now it's brought us to this.

358
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,442
A broken contract.

359
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,567
A fight between
demon and demon.

360
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,025
It's useless.

361
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,900
The young master is mine now.

362
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,983
For someone who has not
signed a contract with him,

363
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,525
you're awfully confident.

364
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:40,358
Oh, I'll get a signed contract,
don't you doubt it...

365
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:43,733
and once I have him,
I won't let him go for a moment.

366
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,983
This dinner knife is a bit
small to cut off your seal

367
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:57,192
and your arm along with it.

368
00:20:57,275 --> 00:21:01,442
Even so, I'm sure I can continue
to pervert your contract...

369
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,858
It's simple, really.

370
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,442
Sebastian!

371
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,192
Sebastian!

372
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,358
Sebastian!

373
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:18,692
Young master...

374
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:25,192
You're being summoned...

375
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:26,942
He knows you're here.

376
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,150
You've been seen...

377
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:29,567
and not just by me...

378
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,317
Such disobedience,
Sebastian Michaelis...

379
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,567
You're a disgrace
to butlers everywhere!

380
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,775
Sebastian, help me!

381
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,275
Please help...!

382
00:21:41,358 --> 00:21:42,817
Sebastian...

383
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,192
If you don't,
I'll climb all the way up!

384
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:48,442
I'll keep climbing...

385
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:49,650
I swear I will...

386
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:55,025
You had better get
here quickly, Sebastian!

387
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:57,275
I'll climb this thing

388
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,733
I'm Going straight
to the top...

389
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,025
Sebastian.

390
00:22:03,275 --> 00:22:04,650
You're wrong...

391
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:07,150
I have done nothing
to disobey orders yet.

392
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,608
That's not my lord.

393
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:11,900
No...

394
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:12,858
no, it's not.

395
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,150
It's my lord...

396
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,442
Earl Alois Trancy.

397
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:21,650
All the way up...

398
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:22,900
See?

399
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,150
I'll fall off...!

400
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,775
I'll do it...!

401
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,900
Do you hear me, Sebastain?!

402
00:22:35,442 --> 00:22:38,233
I'll fall all the way down!

403
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:15,567
And so, foolish demons
wander, hopelessly lost

404
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,858
in the labyrinth of
a distorted heart...

405
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:20,192
A convoluted path filled
with the suffocating

406
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:21,858
scent of roses...

407
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:24,233
A silverwork treasure chest
awaits them...

408
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:27,650
My pathetic lord,
sleeping all curled up.

409
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:28,400
Ah...

410
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:29,817
the alarm is ringing...

411
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,942
I must go and wake
him immediately.

412
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:36,733
Next time: "Crossroads Butler."
All right, butlers...

413
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:37,983
Are you ready...?

414
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,942
Let the games begin!
