1
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,150
It was another ordinary day
in the same ordinary room,

2
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:05,233
and young Alice was
growing rather bored.

3
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:06,900
The day dragged on.

4
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,400
Her financial report was
a dreary thing containing

5
00:01:09,483 --> 00:01:12,067
no murders, violence,
or tragic partings...

6
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,817
Nothing interesting at all.

7
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,608
What was that?

8
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:17,317
Did you say something?

9
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:20,025
No, my lord...

10
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:21,567
Nothing at all.

11
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,025
Very well, then...

12
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:26,025
Bring the tea.

13
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:27,650
Certainly, master.

14
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:46,150
What on Earth was that?

15
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:02,608
My eyes are
playing tricks on me!

16
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,400
Oh dear, look at the time...!

17
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:07,775
We've fallen two minutes, forty
seconds behind schedule already.

18
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,067
What...?

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,358
Why can't I catch him?

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,317
To think she fell
for such a trick.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,483
She pretends to have wits,
but she can be quite thick...

22
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,608
Pardon...

23
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,150
what I meant to say
was, "Poor Alice!

24
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,442
Whatever shall become of her?

25
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,858
I do so look forward
to finding out."

26
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:20,567
What is this place?

27
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,817
I don't recall ever seeing a
room like this below the manor.

28
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,650
This one's locked as well.

29
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,025
Oh dear, oh dear!

30
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:36,775
I'm late!

31
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:37,608
I'm late...!

32
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:38,608
So very late!

33
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:39,942
Stop this instant!

34
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,108
Three minutes,
ten seconds late.

35
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,150
That git...

36
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,692
He flat-out ignored me!

37
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,858
He ignored me and
he locked the door!

38
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,025
Aww...!

39
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:02,858
Look...!

40
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,400
Isn't it adorable?!

41
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:06,525
Quite so, my lady!

42
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,608
I know that voice...

43
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:10,525
Alice!

44
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:16,775
I... er...

45
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:17,983
You look startled!

46
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,817
But surely you recognize
my lady, the Mouse.

47
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,567
I am her maid, the Dodo.

48
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,942
So cute, so cute, so cuuuuute!

49
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,483
Now, why are you wearing
such plain clothes, Alice?

50
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,275
They're not the least bit cute.

51
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:33,817
It's what I always wear...

52
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,900
but more to the point,
who's this Alice?

53
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:37,817
Come now, don't be
such a silly goose.

54
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,317
You're Alice, aren't you...?

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,900
My teacher at Mouse School
told me, when in the country,

56
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,775
do as the country folk do...

57
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:46,358
And if you're in Rome,
do as the Romans do.

58
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,775
And if you're a mouse,
stay far away from cats!

59
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:51,858
I'm afraid I didn't
quite catch all that...

60
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:53,567
Something about us
being in Rome?

61
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,733
What are you on about?

62
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,317
We're in Wonderland,
not Rome, obviously.

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,900
Now, once you're properly
dressed, we'll have some tea.

64
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,233
What do you mean, "Wonderland"?!

65
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:03,817
What?!

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,358
What the devil's happening?!

67
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,567
Um...

68
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,400
would you care for some Eat Me?

69
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:21,442
That's what this little
cake is called, you see.

70
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:24,442
Simply adorable!

71
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:29,817
It doesn't look like any cake
I've ever laid eyes on...

72
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,900
You're sure
it's actually edible?

73
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:34,650
I'm told its flavor
is most amusing...

74
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:37,567
I have the utmost confidence
you'll enjoy every crumb of it.

75
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,567
Lovely...!

76
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,733
Let's eat it!

77
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,483
Lizzie, wait...!

78
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,233
Be careful.

79
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,358
No!

80
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:48,858
It's lovely indeed...!

81
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:50,275
Oh and the flavor!

82
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,233
It tastes of lemon meringue
pie, gâteau au chocolat,

83
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:55,067
Victoria sponge cake, scones,
cottage pie, and roast hare,

84
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,358
with just the slightest hint of
lobster curry for good measure.

85
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,317
Sounds tasty.

86
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:04,858
What's wrong...?

87
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:05,900
Do you feel all right?

88
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:06,733
What is it, Lady?

89
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:07,233
It's...

90
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:08,358
it's just...

91
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:10,233
I have a curious feeling.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,650
Lizzie!

93
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,025
What happened to me?

94
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,317
Oh, my Lady Mouse!

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,483
Lizzie!

96
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,608
I cannot possibly
be cute if I'm this big!

97
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,817
Lizzie, please stop crying!

98
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,858
It doesn't matter a whit
if you're big or not.

99
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:08,650
You are still adorable
as ever, my lady!

100
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,192
I shan't be able to wear the
boots I purchased yesterday...

101
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,650
And they were ever so cute!

102
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,317
Should that really be
your main concern right now?

103
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:20,733
Let's see...

104
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,442
Will something here help?

105
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,150
Um...

106
00:07:23,233 --> 00:07:24,817
Perhaps "Drink Me" will.

107
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,650
That wasn't there before!

108
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,817
How can you be certain?

109
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,275
Perhaps you didn't
look closely enough.

110
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:35,483
Let's try it.

111
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,733
I'll do anything I have
to save my lady...!

112
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:39,150
I am her dodo maid...!

113
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:40,400
It's my duty!

114
00:07:43,942 --> 00:07:44,942
Very well.

115
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:48,275
Lizzie...!

116
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:48,942
Here, drink this!

117
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:49,608
It's tiny!

118
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:50,942
Tiny!

119
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,233
I'll do it...

120
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,650
I shall drink this
strange potion

121
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,900
in the name of
all things adorable!

122
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,483
My lady the Mouse often
found herself in hot water

123
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,275
when she failed to listen to
others and tried to squeak by

124
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:07,775
on her own wits.

125
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:10,817
The journey through Wonderland
has only just begun...

126
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,150
and I fear our poor
little Alice may have

127
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,942
her work cut out for her.

128
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,233
Alice...!

129
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:29,983
We're over here...!

130
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:31,775
Row quickly, c'mon!

131
00:08:38,525 --> 00:08:42,317
She's returned to
normal--normal size, anyhow.

132
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,108
Catch...!

133
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,192
Row...!

134
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:44,983
Catch...

135
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,108
Row...!

136
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:46,900
Catch...!

137
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:48,025
Row!

138
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:48,942
Catch...!

139
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,025
Row...!

140
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:50,942
Catch...!

141
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:51,983
Row...!

142
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:52,858
Catch...!

143
00:08:52,942 --> 00:08:53,858
Row...!

144
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:54,733
Catch...!

145
00:08:54,817 --> 00:08:56,108
Row!

146
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,442
'Ello, Alice!

147
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:02,817
You're looking right knackered.

148
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,483
Don't worry.

149
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,775
Shore's not far off!

150
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:06,400
No need to be
looking so glum.

151
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:08,525
We're all smiles
here, we are!

152
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:09,775
Speak for yourself.

153
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:12,025
Tell me, what's on the
other side of this lake?

154
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,067
Lake?!

155
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,983
Oh, I say!

156
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,150
Is this a lake?

157
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:15,983
The sea, I thought.

158
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:17,317
Was that a mistake?

159
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
You'll have to forgive 'er.

160
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:19,858
This is clearly a river.

161
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,317
I've known for a while
that we're on the Nile!

162
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,150
The Nile?

163
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,358
So will we meet a crocodile?

164
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:25,317
That's just a whim.

165
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,483
They're all in the Thames.

166
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,733
Just give it a break
for heaven's sake.

167
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:30,942
"Splashing of water...

168
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,942
as the great frog
makes his jump...

169
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,525
into the old lake."

170
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,108
You mean this place
truly is a lake?

171
00:09:38,192 --> 00:09:39,025
Not the sea.

172
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:39,900
It was a mistake!

173
00:09:39,983 --> 00:09:40,817
Your wits have gone!

174
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Put your thinking caps on!

175
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:44,775
The only place
this wet is the Amazon!

176
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:45,942
Bloody dodos!

177
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,025
Would you quit
spouting all that rubbish?

178
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,108
But... um...

179
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:50,858
I'm the only dodo here...

180
00:09:50,942 --> 00:09:52,025
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,150
You can say whatever
you like, of course!

182
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,275
So sorry!

183
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,025
Look...!

184
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,358
I see the White Rabbit

185
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,150
He's amazing!

186
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,483
See how fast he's running?

187
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,983
This must be land,
and not a lake after all!

188
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:17,650
One thing we know for certain:
if a rabbit is in the lead,

189
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,567
a turtle is sure
to follow soon!

190
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,150
Stop at once, Sebastian...!

191
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,275
You are not leaving me here!

192
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,983
I'd recognize
that voice anywhere.

193
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,525
The Puppy!

194
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:35,483
Look sharp, you two.

195
00:10:35,567 --> 00:10:35,983
Sir...

196
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,233
yes, sir!

197
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,608
Why all the fuss if
it's only a puppy?

198
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:48,525
Here he comes.

199
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:49,942
Hold on to your hats!

200
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,150
That is no puppy!

201
00:10:57,942 --> 00:10:59,317
Oh dear, oh dear!

202
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:05,358
Alice!

203
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,442
It's salty...

204
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:09,567
The ocean...?

205
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,442
Oh, right...

206
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,775
it's Lizzie's tears.

207
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,858
Sebastian...

208
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,483
Though Alice claimed
not to care for the water,

209
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:20,567
many suspected that she
avoided it because

210
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,775
she couldn't swim a stroke...

211
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,067
However, she did excel
at being kidnapped,

212
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,900
attacked, and drowned.

213
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:30,317
Frankly, she might have had more
consideration for her rescuers.

214
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,608
I'll catch cold
if I don't dry off...

215
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,275
I need a change of clothing.

216
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,358
I had no choice.

217
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,483
I am not dressed like this
because I want to be!

218
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:14,858
And who might you be speaking
to, my playful little robin?

219
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:19,067
I have so looked forward
to meeting you.

220
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:21,775
Unhand me!

221
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:22,942
Playing coy, are we?

222
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:23,900
How charming...!

223
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,150
Now...

224
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,650
stop fighting and dance
with the Mock Turtle.

225
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:27,858
Not a chance!

226
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,650
Oh...! This is terrible...!

227
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,442
You won't join me
in a dance...?

228
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:34,108
How can you be so cruel?

229
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,775
When it's so blatantly
obvious you dressed

230
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:37,650
in such a pretty
frock to seduce me!

231
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:39,108
I am not seducing you!

232
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,233
Ah...!

233
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:41,733
Can this dear little
robin be forgiven

234
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:44,025
the un-robinlike sin of pride?

235
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,233
No...!

236
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:46,567
I fear not.

237
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,233
Even if Her Majesty
forgives it, I never shall!

238
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,608
And now, my lady...

239
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,400
your hand, please?

240
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:53,733
Wait a moment...

241
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,692
There's a queen in
this country as well?

242
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,108
But of course there is...

243
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,400
The Queen of Hearts is
a woman of exquisite beauty

244
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:00,858
and great charm...

245
00:13:00,942 --> 00:13:04,483
You wish an audience with
her...? Then be a good girl.

246
00:13:08,608 --> 00:13:11,692
Now, lady, may I
have this dance?

247
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:21,817
Un...

248
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,400
deux...

249
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:23,358
troi...

250
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:23,942
Un...

251
00:13:24,025 --> 00:13:24,358
deux...

252
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,108
trios...

253
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,358
Very good...

254
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:28,900
You're doing splendidly.

255
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,858
May I inquire when this
humiliation will be over?

256
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:38,275
When your dancing is as
pretty as your frock...

257
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:39,692
robin.

258
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:42,650
Dancing is an essential skill
for a maiden to posse--

259
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,692
Stop there.

260
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:47,275
We'll go back
to the beginning...

261
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:50,275
At this rate, you shall never
be able to meet Her Majesty.

262
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:52,358
Although I must confess
I'd love to dance

263
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:56,025
an eternal waltz with you, my
scrumptious little pound cake.

264
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,775
Now, lift up
that pretty face...

265
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:05,317
Show everybody at the ball
how ravishing you are.

266
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,942
Bugger...

267
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,525
This is disgraceful.

268
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,858
How is it disgraceful...?

269
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,983
Flowers were meant
to be admired.

270
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:26,025
The more people who see them,
the more beautiful they become.

271
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,442
Sebastian?!

272
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:32,817
You mustn't allow yourself to
be distracted, sweet robin...

273
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,692
Now...

274
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,067
concentrate.

275
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:39,150
I'm finished dancing...

276
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,358
Let me go...

277
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:42,317
I have to find him
and follow him!

278
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,567
My lady...!

279
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,983
Why chase a rabbit,
of all things...?

280
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,275
Because...!

281
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,108
Well...

282
00:14:48,192 --> 00:14:49,108
I...

283
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,067
Yes?

284
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,108
It doesn't signify.

285
00:14:51,192 --> 00:14:52,525
Now stop spinning me!

286
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:53,442
But I can't.

287
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,983
I must keep going...

288
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,150
and even if I could stop,
I wouldn't!

289
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,358
What?!

290
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,650
It's too glorious to
stop...! Yes, that's it!

291
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:06,108
This spin is a metaphor...

292
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:08,650
The physical reflection
of my feelings for you.

293
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:13,275
Becoming...

294
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,483
dizzy...

295
00:15:15,983 --> 00:15:17,317
Can you feel the
transcendence?

296
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,067
I can almost see
a flock of angels

297
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,733
flying through the night sky!

298
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,192
You are the fruit
of paradise lost!

299
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,192
I would give anything to
spend the rest of my days

300
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:29,067
under your spell, admiring
your heavenly beauty.

301
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,567
Please stop now...

302
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,483
I feel sick.

303
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,108
I shall show you...

304
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:39,150
You will feel the true depth of
my feelings...! Lobster...

305
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,858
Quadrille!

306
00:15:49,942 --> 00:15:52,817
Her body was slender as a twig
and as light as a feather.

307
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,942
When thrown by an
overexcited dance partner,

308
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,900
she could go
quite a distance...

309
00:15:56,983 --> 00:16:00,900
And so Alice flew
far, far away.

310
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:02,900
So beautiful!

311
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:05,692
Ciel...

312
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,025
in Wonderland.

313
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:10,858
Ciel...

314
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,233
in Wonderland.

315
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,650
Where am I...?

316
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:34,942
The air is so--

317
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:40,608
What is this...?

318
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:42,150
A potato?

319
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:57,650
What is this place?

320
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,025
What a strange
question to ask...

321
00:17:03,108 --> 00:17:04,233
This is my palace.

322
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:05,983
I am the duchess...

323
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,233
and this majestic personage
is my esteemed cook!

324
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:14,400
Turmeric, coriander, cloves,
cinnamon, cardamom, cumin,

325
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,692
fennel, anise, caraway...

326
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,983
and most important of all...

327
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,192
Spicy black pepper!

328
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,317
I've only begun...

329
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
The ultimate curry will
not be perfected until

330
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:34,275
I have added another
three thousand spices!

331
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:39,275
Excellent!

332
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,025
I would expect
nothing less from you...

333
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,483
And now our final act...

334
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,525
the kitchen maid Alice!

335
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,650
Enough of this lunacy!

336
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,317
Come now, why are you so upset?

337
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,442
Have you been eating
too much chili powder?

338
00:17:52,525 --> 00:17:54,067
That simply won't do...

339
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,317
Less chili powder, more ginger,
and most importantly...

340
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,525
Black pepper!

341
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:03,067
Yes!

342
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,317
That's it!

343
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,733
Feel the invigorating
spice of Mother Nature!

344
00:18:06,817 --> 00:18:09,192
Would you bloody stop?!

345
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,442
Oh, I'm forgetting
one member of the household.

346
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:15,942
Mee-ow!

347
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:16,692
Oh lovely.

348
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:17,733
Another one...

349
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:18,858
Just what I need.

350
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:21,233
When did the
perverted freak get here?

351
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,275
Meow.

352
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:24,317
What are you on about?

353
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,650
It's always been here...

354
00:18:25,733 --> 00:18:28,108
And it's a Cheshire Cat,
not a freak.

355
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,483
Meow!

356
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:37,192
Meeoooow.

357
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:39,650
Well, I've never heard of
a cat that grins like that.

358
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:40,317
Ridiculous.

359
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,983
All cats grin...

360
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,733
You don't know much about
anything, do you Alice?

361
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:45,775
Meow.

362
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,692
Cats are no
different from people...

363
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:50,692
If you only treat them kindly,
they will gladly offer you

364
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:51,942
their affection in return.

365
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:53,608
Quite right, quite right...

366
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:55,525
and most importantly...

367
00:18:55,608 --> 00:18:58,150
Black pepper!

368
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,650
I thought I told you...

369
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:03,900
To stop it!

370
00:19:03,983 --> 00:19:06,192
The relationship between
a master and her servant

371
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:09,150
is built upon the giving of
kindness and affection...

372
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,942
Why, even a high-born Duchess
such as I and a lowly

373
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,108
kitchen maid such as
yourself might develop

374
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:16,192
a deep friendship that
transcends station.

375
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,317
Bravo, Duchess, bravo!

376
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,900
Talking to you is pointless.

377
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:21,775
I'm leaving this place!

378
00:19:23,025 --> 00:19:24,483
Maid!

379
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:29,358
Wasting food of any kind
is absolutely unacceptable!

380
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:31,192
You must heed
the duchess's words...

381
00:19:31,275 --> 00:19:34,150
Every morsel that we receive
is a gift from the gods ...

382
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,900
We cannot waste even one
grain of black pepper.

383
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,608
You need to be punished...

384
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:39,400
Cook...!

385
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:40,733
See to it at once!

386
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,108
Jo ajna!

387
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,567
Take that!

388
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,483
It's a spicy curry bun
I prepared in advance

389
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:56,525
for just such an
occasion as this one.

390
00:19:56,608 --> 00:19:59,733
If you already made it, what
were you mixing all the spices?

391
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,858
Never mind such
trifling details.

392
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:04,942
The important thing now
is that you eat.

393
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,483
Well, Alice...?

394
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:08,942
My cook makes extraordinary
curry buns, do you not think?

395
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,775
That's a surprise...

396
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,400
It's quite good, actually.

397
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,400
Oh my, is something amiss...?

398
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:18,900
Stomachache, perhaps?

399
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,483
I might know.

400
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,608
Is this like what happened
to Lizzie earlier...?

401
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,650
She ate strange food as well.

402
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:44,942
Oh no...

403
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:47,317
What's happening?

404
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,567
We must help her!

405
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,317
Or we could run.

406
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,442
Precious lives
were lost today.

407
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,608
I'd like you to erect
a gravestone for them.

408
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,358
Jo ajna...

409
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:07,733
One other thing, Duchess.

410
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:09,733
There isn't much time before
your next appointment...

411
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:12,692
You've received an
invitation from the queen.

412
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:13,692
All right...

413
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,692
Then, let us be on our way.

414
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,400
Farewell, Alice!

415
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:22,733
Where are you going?

416
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:25,900
Come back here and
return me to normal!

417
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,817
In through the roof, then out
through the roof again...?

418
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,567
What dreadful manners...

419
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,567
Poor Alice's appearance had
become exceedingly embarrassing.

420
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,775
However, much to her chagrin,
still greater disgrace

421
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:43,150
awaited her in Wonderland.

422
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,733
I cannot believe the
nerve of that butler.

423
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,108
Leaving his master
without permission!

424
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,817
He'll notice me
then simply ignore me...

425
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,858
What happened to the
"butler aesthetic" he likes

426
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:14,775
to talk about, so bloody much?

427
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:18,317
You there, in the Eiffel Tower!

428
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,775
Halt at once!

429
00:22:19,858 --> 00:22:21,067
What's that?

430
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,192
No, no, not up there.

431
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,692
Look down here...!

432
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,733
Here...!

433
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:26,567
In the shadow
of your right shoe!

434
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,150
And who are you?

435
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:33,025
A Lizard policeman who
happens to be passing by...

436
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,650
Pleased to meet you.

437
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:39,192
I've been looking all over
for the White Rabbit...

438
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,400
Have you seen him anywhere?

439
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:42,275
So, you got
separated from him...?

440
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:44,358
That means you're
lost here in Wonderland...

441
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:46,275
This is serious.

442
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,358
Well...

443
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:48,775
I suppose so.

444
00:22:48,858 --> 00:22:50,067
It will be all right...

445
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,067
Not to worry...

446
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,317
I'm here to help you,
young Alice.

447
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,317
Well...?

448
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,358
Do you know the way?

449
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:01,608
Hmm...

450
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:02,775
Yes or no?!

451
00:23:02,858 --> 00:23:05,108
Hmm!

452
00:23:05,192 --> 00:23:06,858
...I'm terribly sorry.

453
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:07,942
What a blunder...

454
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,858
It seems I've
brought the wrong map.

455
00:23:09,942 --> 00:23:12,817
Do you always go about making
promises you can't keep

456
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,108
You should check inside your
hand before you get yourself

457
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,108
into more trouble
than you already are.

458
00:23:17,192 --> 00:23:18,192
My hand?

459
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,775
What on earth are
you talking about?

460
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:24,608
What's this?

461
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:27,400
It's a magic candy that
will make you feel quite nice...

462
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:30,525
If you eat it, something
interesting is sure to happen.

463
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:31,900
True...

464
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:33,692
It seems something interesting
always happens when

465
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:36,108
one eats or drinks
in this place.

466
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,983
But will I grow
larger or smaller...?

467
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,358
Either way, I'll be able
to get out of this building.

468
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,150
That's the ticket...!

469
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,317
Go...!

470
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,817
You can do it!

471
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,983
Hang in there, Alice...!

472
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,692
The world is yours...!

473
00:23:50,775 --> 00:23:52,817
You can do anything
you set your mind to...!

474
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,358
Go, Alice, go!

475
00:23:58,192 --> 00:23:59,442
What now?

476
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:00,900
Oh, dear...

477
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,525
she's let that lizard talk
her into eating the candy...

478
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,108
Honestly, Alice,
such gluttony...!

479
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:07,358
What just deserts...

480
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:08,608
ahem...

481
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:10,692
I mean, adventures, lie
in store for our heroine

482
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:12,483
as she travels forward?

483
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:15,483
What the devil is happening?!!!

484
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:18,025
Alas, we must wait
until Part Two.

485
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:24,900
Yet to come...

486
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:27,358
advice from a
mysterious Caterpillar...

487
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:30,525
a mushroom that toys
with both body and mind,...

488
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,775
a reunion with
the Cheshire Cat...

489
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:34,900
and a Hatter's mad tea...

490
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:37,192
Never a dull moment,
dear Alice.

491
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:39,108
Next time on Black Butler...

492
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:40,650
Ciel in Wonderland...

493
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,525
Part Two

494
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:46,067
You see, I am simply one
hell of a White Rabbit.
