SO NOW LET IT
BE REVEALED!

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.088
[ROARS]

00:07:52.088 --> 00:07:54.090
All: AAH!

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.192
[ROARS]

00:07:56.192 --> 00:07:59.829
YES! THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:01.798
INCREDIBLE!
THAT'S GOTTA BE

00:08:01.798 --> 00:08:03.933
THE
LUCKIEST DRAW
I'VE EVER SEEN.

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:06.503
I THINK THAT DRAW
WAS MORE ABOUT
FAITH THAN LUCK.

00:08:06.503 --> 00:08:08.238
YOU SAID IT, BUD!

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:09.739
KAIBA LISTENED
TO HIS HEART,

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.674
AND IT PAID OFF
FOR HIM BIG TIME!

00:08:11.674 --> 00:08:12.976
PEGASUS,

00:08:12.976 --> 00:08:15.512
YOUR CARD PROPHESIZING
HAS FAILED YOU,

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:18.781
AND NOW YOUR TOON DRAGON
WILL FAIL YOU AS WELL!

00:08:18.781 --> 00:08:21.217
[BOTH DRAGONS ROARING]

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:22.752
WOW, I'VE NEVER
SEEN A MONSTER

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.822
GO UP AGAINST
A WIGGED-OUT VERSION
OF HIMSELF BEFORE.

00:08:25.822 --> 00:08:28.725
[THINKING] NORMALLY,
THIS CLASH WOULD END
IN A DRAW,

00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:30.960
BUT I DON'T KNOW ALL
THE RULES TO TOON WORLD,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.328
SO I CAN'T BE SURE.

00:08:32.328 --> 00:08:34.998
OH, THIS IS GOING
TO BE SUCH FUN!

00:08:34.998 --> 00:08:37.800
A BLUE EYES ATTACKING
HIS TOON COUNTERPART?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.003
THERE'S NO END
TO THE ZANY ANTICS

00:08:40.003 --> 00:08:41.471
THAT COULD ENSUE
FROM THIS!

00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:43.173
WRONG. THIS ISN'T

00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:46.142
ONE OF YOUR HARE-BRAINED,
AFTER-SCHOOL CARTOONS!

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:48.144
YOUR TOON
WON'T ESCAPE THIS!

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:50.146
OH, NO! HEH HEH HEH!

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:51.915
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT HERE.

00:08:51.915 --> 00:08:53.149
YEAH. PEGASUS!

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:54.150
GRR!

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.387
HA HA HA!

00:08:57.387 --> 00:09:00.456
BLUE EYES, ATTACK
WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT!

00:09:00.456 --> 00:09:02.625
WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.795
[ROARS]

00:09:13.099 --> 00:09:14.601
NO WAY!
HMPH!

00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:16.436
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:18.605
THAT TOON
JUST STRETCHED
OUT OF THE WAY!

00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:19.872
[SNARLING]

00:09:19.872 --> 00:09:22.175
YOU SHOULD'VE WATCHED
MORE CARTOONS, KAIBA.

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:25.612
THE CUDDLIEST CREATURE
NEVER, EVER GETS HIT.

00:09:25.612 --> 00:09:29.015
IN 3,013 EPISODES
OF <i>FUNNY BUNNY,</i>

00:09:29.015 --> 00:09:32.619
RUFF GRUFF McDOGG
NEVER LAID A PAW
ON OUR CUDDLY HERO.

00:09:32.619 --> 00:09:35.488
NO, HE WOULD TRY AND TRY,

00:09:35.488 --> 00:09:37.957
BUT NEVER
WOULD HE SUCCEED.

00:09:37.957 --> 00:09:39.993
SUCH A CLEVER
LITTLE RABBIT.

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:43.663
UGH!

00:09:43.663 --> 00:09:45.298
AND MY CREATURES
WILL EMPLOY

00:09:45.298 --> 00:09:47.767
THE SAME CLEVERNESS
EVERY TIME YOU ATTACK,

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:51.638
BECAUSE AS LONG AS
MY TOON WORLD CARD IS OUT,

00:09:51.638 --> 00:09:53.339
EVERYTHING I THROW
WILL BE JUST AS HARD

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:55.975
TO PIN DOWN
AS MY TOON DRAGON!

00:09:55.975 --> 00:09:57.310
KAIBA WILL GET CREAMED

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.345
IF ALL OF HIS OPPONENTS
ARE NOTHING BUT TOONS!

00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:00.947
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

00:10:00.947 --> 00:10:02.649
JUST 'CAUSE PEGASUS
INVENTED THE GAME

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.350
SHOULDN'T MEAN HE CAN
USE SOME SUPERCARD

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.286
THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT.

00:10:06.286 --> 00:10:09.155
YUGI, YOU EVER HEAR
OF TOON WORLD?

00:10:09.155 --> 00:10:11.024
WELL, ALL I KNOW
ABOUT IT

00:10:11.024 --> 00:10:13.192
IS THAT IT WAS NEVER
PUT INTO CIRCULATION.

00:10:13.192 --> 00:10:14.661
IT WAS TOO POWERFUL.

00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:17.196
I GUESS PEGASUS
MUST HAVE THE ONLY ONE.

00:10:17.196 --> 00:10:19.299
THAT SOUNDS
REAL FAIR.

00:10:19.299 --> 00:10:20.800
HOW CAN ANYONE
BEAT PEGASUS

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.269
WHEN HE HAS
CARDS LIKE THAT
AT HIS DISPOSAL?

00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:25.938
NOW, WHERE WERE WE,
KAIBA BOY?

00:10:25.938 --> 00:10:28.174
AH, YES,
IT WAS MY TURN.

00:10:28.174 --> 00:10:29.809
HMM.

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:31.477
[THINKING]
NOW LET'S SEE HERE.

00:10:31.477 --> 00:10:33.813
HE'S FOLDED HIS HANDS,
SO I CAN NO LONGER

00:10:33.813 --> 00:10:37.183
LOOK THROUGH HIS EYES
TO SEE WHAT CARDS HE HOLDS,

00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:39.085
BUT PERHAPS I CAN
LOOK ELSEWHERE.

00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:41.988
YOU SEE, A DUELIST
OF KAIBA'S EXPERIENCE

00:10:41.988 --> 00:10:45.124
HAS LONG SINCE MEMORIZED
HIS ENTIRE DECK,

00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:47.460
EVERY MONSTER,
EVERY CARD.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.561
SO I DON'T NEED TO LOOK
THROUGH HIS EYES

00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:50.063
TO SEE WHAT CARDS
HE KEEPS.

00:10:50.063 --> 00:10:52.198
I SIMPLY NEED TO
LOOK THROUGH HIS MIND.

00:10:52.198 --> 00:10:54.300
I'LL PLAY THIS.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.135
A NEW ADDITION
TO TOON WORLD.

00:10:56.135 --> 00:10:57.937
THE SHINE PALACE!

00:11:00.306 --> 00:11:01.474
UGH!

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.681
LUMINOUS, ISN'T IT?

00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:12.118
AND IT MAKES
FOR QUITE A HANDY
PLOT TWIST.

00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:13.953
YOU SEE,
THE SHINE PALACE

00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:16.456
RAISES MY TOON DRAGON'S ATTACK
BY 500 POINTS.

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:19.359
THAT STILL WON'T
BRING THIS STORY
TO AN END.

00:11:19.359 --> 00:11:21.961
I BEG TO DIFFER,
KAIBA BOY.

00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:23.463
I THINK THAT
I'VE JUST WRITTEN

00:11:23.463 --> 00:11:26.032
THE FINAL CHAPTER
OF YOUR DEFEAT!

00:11:26.032 --> 00:11:29.469
THE LIGHT ENERGY
MY TOON DRAGON ABSORBS
FROM SHINE PALACE

00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:31.104
MAKES HIM STRONGER
THAN YOUR BLUE EYES.

00:11:31.104 --> 00:11:33.039
OBSERVE.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:35.875
WHAAA!

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:38.778
WHAA!

00:11:38.778 --> 00:11:40.480
WHAA!

00:11:44.384 --> 00:11:46.219
I'M NO
CARTOON EXPERT,

00:11:46.219 --> 00:11:47.954
BUT EXPLODING
VOLCANO BICEPS?

00:11:47.954 --> 00:11:49.255
THAT'S BAD,
RIGHT?

00:11:49.255 --> 00:11:50.390
HMM.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.392
UGH.

00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:55.762
BLUE EYES
TOON DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:11:55.762 --> 00:11:57.530
WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:11:59.465 --> 00:12:01.367
NOT SO FAST!

00:12:01.367 --> 00:12:04.804
ACTIVATE MAGIC CARD!
NEGATE ATTACK!

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.610
SO THAT WAS THE CARD
HE PLAYED 2 TURNS BACK.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.445
[THINKING]
CLEVER MOVE, KAIBA,

00:12:12.445 --> 00:12:15.848
BUT DON'T FORGET
THE DEFENSIVE MAGIC
OF NEGATE ATTACK

00:12:15.848 --> 00:12:19.185
REMAINS ON THE FIELD
FOR JUST ONE TURN,

00:12:19.185 --> 00:12:21.788
WHEREAS THE THREAT
OF MY TOON DRAGON
WILL ENDURE.

00:12:21.788 --> 00:12:24.257
MY TURN NOW.

00:12:24.257 --> 00:12:25.191
[THINKING] I BOUGHT
SOME TIME,

00:12:25.191 --> 00:12:26.325
BUT I WON'T
BE ABLE TO BLOCK

00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:28.461
THAT TOON DRAGON'S
ATTACK AGAIN.

00:12:28.461 --> 00:12:30.530
I HAVE TO DESTROY
THAT COMIC MONSTROSITY

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.798
HERE AND NOW.

00:12:31.798 --> 00:12:32.965
OTHERWISE,

00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:35.034
NOT ONLY WILL I HAVE
LOST THIS DUEL,

00:12:35.034 --> 00:12:36.636
BUT I'LL HAVE LOST
MY ONLY CHANCE

00:12:36.636 --> 00:12:38.438
OF WINNING MY BROTHER'S
SOUL BACK.

00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.506
I HAVE TO TRUST
IN MY DECK,

00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:42.308
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

00:12:43.776 --> 00:12:45.144
PERFECT!

00:12:45.144 --> 00:12:47.380
GO, SHADOW SPELL!

00:12:49.615 --> 00:12:50.683
AAH!

00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:58.224
NOW, NOT ONLY
CAN YOUR TOON NOT MOVE,

00:12:58.224 --> 00:13:01.294
BUT HIS ATTACK POWER
IS LOWERED BY 700 POINTS.

00:13:03.996 --> 00:13:06.866
[THINKING] HOW DARE
KAIBA SHACKLE

00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:09.435
A FREE AND WONDROUS SPIRIT
SUCH AS MY BLUE EYES TOON!

00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:11.370
IT'S LIKE IMPRISONING
JOY ITSELF.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.639
HE WILL PAY FOR
INTERRUPTING MY FUN!

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:15.141
[ROARS]

00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:17.677
LOOKS LIKE TOONS
DON'T ALWAYS GET
THE LAST LAUGH.

00:13:17.677 --> 00:13:19.712
BLUE EYES,
WHITE LIGHTNING
ATTACK!

00:13:19.712 --> 00:13:21.781
[ROARS]

00:13:21.781 --> 00:13:24.817
[WHIMPERING]

00:13:29.188 --> 00:13:30.590
HEY, ALL RIGHT!

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.992
KAIBA SENT THAT TOON
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD!

00:13:32.992 --> 00:13:36.462
HE PULLED IT OFF.
IMPRESSIVE.

00:13:36.462 --> 00:13:38.631
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND

00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:41.367
THAT NOTHING WILL
STOP ME FROM RESCUING
MY BROTHER, PEGASUS,

00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:43.903
EVEN DESTROYING
MY OWN BLUE EYES?

00:13:43.903 --> 00:13:47.139
AW, KAIBA BOY!

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.442
YOUR TREASURED
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGONS

00:13:49.442 --> 00:13:51.911
MEAN SO VERY MUCH
TO YOU, DON'T THEY?

00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:53.880
WELL, AS CREATOR
OF DUEL MONSTERS,

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.049
I'M TRULY TOUCHED
BY YOUR DEVOTION.

00:13:57.049 --> 00:13:59.418
BUT...

00:13:59.418 --> 00:14:02.021
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
THAT THE SAME DEVOTION

00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:04.790
IS NOT RETURNED
BY THE BLUE EYES?

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.126
FOR AS YOU'LL SEE...

00:14:07.126 --> 00:14:09.428
THEY ARE NOT SO LOYAL!

00:14:09.428 --> 00:14:13.032
UGH!
GO, DRAGON
CAPTURE JAR!

00:14:13.032 --> 00:14:15.268
THIS WILL MAKE 2 BLUE EYES
THAT I'VE STOLEN FROM YOU,

00:14:15.268 --> 00:14:16.969
WON'T IT?

00:14:16.969 --> 00:14:18.704
HOW YOU MUST HATE ME.

00:14:18.704 --> 00:14:20.640
HA HA HA!

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.275
[ROARS]

00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:24.377
NO!

00:14:29.815 --> 00:14:31.751
UGH!

00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:33.920
NOW ALL OF YOUR DRAGON'S
DEFENSE POINTS

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.690
HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO MY JAR,
WHERE THEY'LL BE AT MY DISPOSAL,
KAIBA BOY.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.294
I CAN'T LET PEGASUS STEAL
ANOTHER ONE OF MY DRAGONS
WITH THAT JAR.

00:14:41.294 --> 00:14:43.629
I NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO DESTROY IT.

00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:48.134
UHH...OK, PEGASUS.

00:14:48.134 --> 00:14:49.802
I'M PLAYING THIS
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:14:53.472 --> 00:14:56.409
THEN FOR MY TURN,

00:14:56.409 --> 00:14:58.911
I'LL PLACE THIS MAGIC CARD
FACE DOWN...

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:02.648
AND BRING OUT THE DRAGON PIPER.

00:15:02.648 --> 00:15:04.617
DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:04.617 --> 00:15:06.752
THAT COULD
ONLY MEAN ONE THING--

00:15:06.752 --> 00:15:09.121
PEGASUS IS PLANNING
TO DRAW MY DRAGON

00:15:09.121 --> 00:15:10.690
UNDER HIS CONTROL.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.025
HEH HEH HEH.
YOU READ MY MIND.

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:14.327
UGH...

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:15.528
AND SOON, I WILL
MAKE HIM A TOON,

00:15:15.528 --> 00:15:18.497
JUST LIKE I DID
YOUR OTHER BLUE EYES.

00:15:18.497 --> 00:15:21.667
AND THEN THE FUN WILL BEGIN
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:24.003
NO WAY. NOT IF
I CAN SHATTER

00:15:24.003 --> 00:15:25.805
THAT DRAGON PIPER
RIGHT HERE.

00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:28.774
I'M INVOKING THE POWERS
OF THE SWORDSTALKER.

00:15:28.774 --> 00:15:32.345
NOW ATTACK THE DRAGON PIPER.
VENGEANCE STRIKE!

00:15:32.345 --> 00:15:35.514
HEH HEH HEH. DID YOU
FORGET ABOUT THE MAGIC CARD

00:15:35.514 --> 00:15:37.350
I JUST PLACED, DID YOU?

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.618
AAH...

00:15:38.618 --> 00:15:41.153
IT'S A LITTLE DOODAD
CALLED DOPPELGANGER.

00:15:41.153 --> 00:15:43.689
IT CAN COPY ANYTHING
ON THE FIELD.

00:15:43.689 --> 00:15:47.526
I THINK I'LL HAVE IT COPY
YOUR CRUSH CARD.

00:15:47.526 --> 00:15:51.931
AND NOW I'LL INFECT
MY DRAGON PIPER WITH IT.

00:15:51.931 --> 00:15:53.766
OH, NO.

00:15:53.766 --> 00:15:56.235
BUT KAIBA'S JUST DECLARED
AN ATTACK ON THAT DRAGON PIPER.

00:15:56.235 --> 00:15:58.938
AHH, HIS STALKER WILL BE
CHARGING RIGHT INTO A TRAP.

00:15:58.938 --> 00:16:00.506
AAAAHHHH!

00:16:00.506 --> 00:16:02.041
HEH HEH HEH.

00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:06.112
AND IT'S TOO LATE FOR HIM
TO DO A SINGLE THING ABOUT IT.

00:16:09.506 --> 00:16:11.942
HURRY UP AND CALL OFF
YOUR ATTACK, KAIBA!

00:16:11.942 --> 00:16:13.444
IT'S A TRAP!

00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:14.645
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:17.114
I'M AFRAID THIS IS
FAR WORSE THAN A TRAP.

00:16:17.114 --> 00:16:20.050
ARRGGGHHH!

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.686
THIS IS A VIRUS,

00:16:22.686 --> 00:16:24.688
AND IT INCAPACITATES

00:16:24.688 --> 00:16:26.323
EVERY ONE OF KAIBA'S MONSTERS

00:16:26.323 --> 00:16:29.059
THAT HAVE MORE THAN
1,500 ATTACK POINTS,

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:31.962
INCLUDING THE ONES IN HIS DECK.

00:16:31.962 --> 00:16:35.099
ALL OF MY CARDS
ARE BECOMING INFECTED.

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:37.968
HEH HEH HEH HEH. THAT'S
WHAT YOU GET, KAIBA BOY,

00:16:37.968 --> 00:16:40.137
WHEN YOU STACK YOUR DECK
WITH MONSTER CARDS

00:16:40.137 --> 00:16:42.906
THAT ALL HAVE MORE THAN
1,500 OFFENSE POINTS.

00:16:42.906 --> 00:16:44.541
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:46.944
KAIBA'S GETTING DONE IN
BY THE SAME CARD

00:16:46.944 --> 00:16:48.579
THAT HE TRIED
TO BEAT YUGI WITH.

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:49.913
THIS CAN'T BE IT.

00:16:49.913 --> 00:16:53.584
THAT CRUSH CARD TOTALLY
OBLITERATED HIS DECK.

00:16:53.584 --> 00:16:55.586
ALL OF MY CARDS GONE.

00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:59.289
THIS IS THE ONLY ONE LEFT
THE VIRUS DIDN'T AFFECT.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:01.625
SO IT'S THE ONLY
CARD I CAN PLAY.

00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:06.230
I'VE USED REBORN THE MONSTER
TO REVIVE SAGGI THE CLOWN.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.998
IT'S YOUR LAST MOVE,

00:17:07.998 --> 00:17:10.167
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND IT
REVIVING A CLOWN?

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:12.169
OH, YES, THAT'S RIGHT, KAIBA.

00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:14.671
HE'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO
WITH MY VIRUS STILL ABOUT.

00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:17.674
SHAME, WHEN YOU CONSIDER
ALL THAT'S ON THE LINE.

00:17:17.674 --> 00:17:20.277
MOKUBA...

00:17:20.277 --> 00:17:23.313
I'VE TRIED MY VERY BEST.

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:25.349
YOUR BEST FAILED YOU.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:26.650
BICKURIBOX...

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.385
EMERGE AND ATTACK!

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.956
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:36.627 --> 00:17:37.728
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:37.728 --> 00:17:40.998
FORGIVE ME, MOKUBA.
I AM SO SORRY.

00:17:40.998 --> 00:17:41.999
UHH...

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:44.067
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:47.704 --> 00:17:49.640
All: HUH?
NO WAY.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.375
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:54.778
THERE ARE NO MORE CARDS
YOU CAN PLAY.

00:17:54.778 --> 00:17:57.381
THEREFORE, YOU LOSE, KAIBA BOY.

00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:59.183
OHH...

00:17:59.183 --> 00:18:01.652
AND YOU'VE LOST MUCH MORE
THAN JUST THIS DUEL,

00:18:01.652 --> 00:18:03.220
HAVEN'T YOU, KAIBA?

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.988
YOU'VE LOST
THE ONLY CHANCE YOU HAD

00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:06.857
AT RESCUING YOUR BABY BROTHER.

00:18:06.857 --> 00:18:10.861
YOU LET HIM DOWN,
BUT DON'T WORRY, MY DEAR FRIEND.

00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:12.629
I WILL SPARE YOU THE AGONY

00:18:12.629 --> 00:18:15.332
OF CARRYING ON IN THIS WORLD
WITHOUT HIM.

00:18:15.332 --> 00:18:17.067
WHAT IS THAT?

00:18:17.067 --> 00:18:20.838
IT IS THE FINAL FATE
OF YOUR SOUL, SETO KAIBA.

00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:22.473
AHH...

00:18:22.473 --> 00:18:25.375
AAAAHHHH!

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:28.145
[THINKING] HEH HEH HEH.
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME.

00:18:28.145 --> 00:18:30.948
A PLACE OF SOLITUDE
AND SECLUSION.

00:18:30.948 --> 00:18:33.016
AND WHILE YOUR SOUL IS AWAY,

00:18:33.016 --> 00:18:35.619
YOUR BODY WILL BE EMPLOYED
AS MY OBEDIENT SERVANT.

00:18:35.619 --> 00:18:36.954
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:18:36.954 --> 00:18:39.289
AH, THE BROTHERS KAIBA.

00:18:39.289 --> 00:18:41.291
ONE IN EACH HAND,

00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:43.327
BUT EVEN THOUGH YOUR CARDS
ARE SO VERY CLOSE,

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:45.929
YOUR SOULS HAVE NEVER BEEN
FURTHER APART.

00:18:45.929 --> 00:18:48.499
AT LEAST WHEN I HAD
MOKUBA LOCKED UP,

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:50.634
YOU WERE BOTH STILL LIVING
WITHIN THE SAME DIMENSION.

00:18:50.634 --> 00:18:52.302
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:18:52.302 --> 00:18:55.272
BUT NOW YOU'RE WORLDS APART.
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:18:57.352 --> 00:18:58.954
TAKE AWAY THAT EMPTY SHELL.

00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:01.756
TEACH IT TO WASH DISHES
OR SOMETHING. HEH HEH.

00:19:05.861 --> 00:19:07.662
OK, TELL ME
I DIDN'T JUST SEE

00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:08.763
WHAT I THINK I SAW.

00:19:08.763 --> 00:19:09.764
KAIBA.

00:19:09.764 --> 00:19:11.700
HE'S GONE, TOO.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.469
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS ONLY TRYING
TO HELP HIS LITTLE BROTHER OUT.

00:19:14.469 --> 00:19:16.271
[SOBS]

00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:17.305
YUGI...

00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:19.040
HE WAS LIKE US.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.444
JUST WANTED TO SAVE
SOMEONE HE CARED FOR.

00:19:22.444 --> 00:19:24.045
WHY, PEGASUS?

00:19:25.647 --> 00:19:29.017
WHO ARE YOU TO TOY WITH
OUR FRIENDS, OUR FAMILIES?

00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:32.654
I WON'T LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH IT.

00:19:32.654 --> 00:19:35.924
[THINKING] HEH HEH HEH. JUST TRY
AND STOP ME, LITTLE YUGI.

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:37.359
HMM?

00:19:40.695 --> 00:19:42.998
YU-GI-OH!

00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:52.974
[THINKING]
WELL, I DO BELIEVE
I'VE JUST SENSED YUGI

00:19:52.974 --> 00:19:56.044
TAPING INTO THE POWER
OF HIS MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:19:56.044 --> 00:19:57.345
EXCELLENT.

00:19:57.345 --> 00:19:59.781
[DEEPER VOICE] PEGASUS,
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:01.816
TILL I PUT AN END
TO YOUR GAMES.

00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:04.085
YUGI BOY, DON'T FORGET

00:20:04.085 --> 00:20:07.455
THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO MAKE IT
THROUGH THE REMAINING ROUNDS
OF THIS TOURNAMENT

00:20:07.455 --> 00:20:09.858
TO EVEN WIN THE PRIVILEGE
OF CHALLENGING ME.

00:20:09.858 --> 00:20:12.694
REST ASSURED,
I'LL BE AT THE FINALS,

00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:15.263
BUT THE TRUE PRIVILEGE
WILL BE DEFEATING YOU

00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:18.333
AND UNDOING ALL THE
EVIL ACTS YOU'VE COMMITTED
AGAINST MY FRIENDS.

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:19.701
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:23.438
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR
FINEST EFFORTS, YUGI BOY,

00:20:23.438 --> 00:20:27.008
AND WONDERFUL PERFORMANCES
FROM ALL OUR FINALISTS.

00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:30.178
YOU TRULY ARE
THE BEST OF THE BEST,

00:20:30.178 --> 00:20:33.481
THE CRèME DE LA CRèME.
HEH HEH HEH.

00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:35.417
[THINKING] BUT EVEN SO,

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.919
WITH THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM EYE,

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:40.689
NOTHING WILL KEEP ME
FROM VICTORY.

00:20:40.689 --> 00:20:43.024
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:20:43.024 --> 00:20:46.294
NOT EVEN YUGI
AND HIS MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:20:46.294 --> 00:20:48.296
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.
