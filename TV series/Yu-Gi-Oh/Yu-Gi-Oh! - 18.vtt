MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST GIVE UP.

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.233
[DOGGIE WHINE]

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.334
NAH! NO WAY, MAN!

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.336
I'M NOT A SCARED
LITTLE PUPPY.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.571
AND FOR SERENITY'S SAKE,
I'VE GOTTA STAY IN THE GAME!

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:20.974
I HAVE TO TRUST
IN THE CARDS...

00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:22.409
AND IN MYSELF.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:24.244
HUH?

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:25.378
Joey, thinking:
TIME WIZARD!

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:27.514
THIS CARD I GOT FROM YUGI

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:29.349
HAS PULLED MY RUMP
OUT OF THE FIRE BEFORE.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.284
LIKE IN MY DUELS
WITH MAI AND REX RAPTOR.

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:34.020
WHEN I FOUGHT REX, IT EVEN
FOSSILIZED HIS DINOSAUR.

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:37.657
MAYBE IT'LL HELP ME AGAIN.

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.026
YEAH, MAYBE IT CAN
BLOW THOSE ZOMBIES AWAY!

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.196
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO LOSE?

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:45.699
I PLAY TIME WIZARD!

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:48.368
HUH?
HUH?

00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:49.569
[THINKING]
TIME WIZARD?

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.571
APPARENTLY THE DWEEB'S
SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.040
HIS TIME MAGIC COULD
AGE BONZ'S ZOMBIES

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:55.942
RIGHT INTO THE DUST!

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.244
SPIN--TIME ROULETTE!

00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:01.748
BOSS, HELP ME.

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:03.984
DON'T WORRY.
DON'T YOU KNOW TIME ROULETTE

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:06.353
IS TOTALLY
A GAME OF CHANCE, BONZ?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.121
IT'S ALL A MATTER OF LUCK.

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:11.257
SO, IF YOURS IS BETTER,
YOU WON'T BE WIPED OUT. SEE?

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:12.926
AAH!

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:16.529
COME ON, TIME WIZARD.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:17.931
NO, YOU CAN'T.
NO, YOU CAN'T.

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:18.932
NO, YOU CAN'T.
NO, YOU CAN'T.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:23.303
THIS IS IT!

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.871
UHH!

00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:26.906
HUH?
HUH?

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:28.575
OOH...

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:30.910
GRR...

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:35.115
WHAT?! NO WAY!

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.250
BOSS, I WON!

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.887
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA DIG
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, BONZ.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.256
NOW HIS TIME WIZARD
AND FLAME SWORDSMAN

00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.925
WILL VANISH INTO A TIME WARP
IN THE SKY.

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:47.394
NO! DON'T GO!

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:48.962
[ROAR]

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:52.599
AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.601
HALF THE ATTACK POWER
OF THOSE MONSTERS

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.403
GETS DEDUCTED
FROM JOEY'S LIFE POINTS.

00:08:58.138 --> 00:09:00.206
HA HA HA HA!
WANT ME TO PLAY A CARD?

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:01.808
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
DEFEAT YOURSELF?

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.177
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I'D
TAKE THIS BIG A HIT

00:09:04.177 --> 00:09:05.779
IF I LOST THE SPIN
AT TIME ROULETTE.

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:08.048
POOR JOEY.
I'LL GIVE YOU A FREE TURN.

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:10.216
THROW MY ZOMBIES
ANOTHER TASTY MORSEL.

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.018
[ROAR]

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:13.653
[THINKING]
I CAN'T WIN AN ATTACK.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:15.889
I'LL PLAY THIS
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:17.357
GO DRAGON ZOMBIE!

00:09:18.158 --> 00:09:18.825
Keith: HOLD IT.

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:19.826
HUH?

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.262
WHY JUST DEFEAT HIM
WHEN YOU CAN HUMILIATE HIM,

00:09:22.429 --> 00:09:23.430
THE WAY PEGASUS DID ME?

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:26.199
BEEF UP YOUR ZOMBIES,
AND YOU CAN WIPE HIM OUT

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.167
IN A FEW TURNS.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.668
PLAY THE KING OF GHOSTS!

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:30.503
I HEAR YOU, BOSS.

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.441
PUMPKING,
RISE FROM THE GRAVE!

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:38.912
Joey: WHAT <i>IS</i> THAT THING?

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:41.114
Bonz: IT'S THE PUMPKING,
THE KING OF GHOSTS!

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:45.318
WHAT DOES IT DO?

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.487
OH, THE PUMPKING HAS
A VERY SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:09:49.022 --> 00:09:52.625
ECTOPLASMIC
FORTIFICATION!

00:09:54.561 --> 00:09:55.228
ECTO-WHOZIS
FORTA-WHATSIS?

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:57.564
ECTOPLASM
IS THE GHOSTLY SUBSTANCE

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:00.033
THAT GIVES MY ZOMBIE
MONSTERS THEIR POWER,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.168
AND PUMPKING,
AS THE KING OF GHOSTS,

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.003
CAN PUMP UP THEIR
ECTOPLASMIC ENERGY

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:07.140
AND THEIR ATTACK POINTS
BY 10% EACH AND EVERY TURN.

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:09.709
OH, NO.

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.277
AND AS THEIR ATTACK
POWER GROWS,

00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:13.046
THEY BECOME GIANT ZOMBIES!

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.182
DRAGON ZOMBIE, ATTACK
WITH DEADLY ZOMBIE BREATH!

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:19.953
[ROAR]

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:23.723
THAT DEFENSE MONSTER
WAS MUCH TOO WEAK.

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.726
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
SOMETHING STRONGER
TO DESTROY?

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:27.861
YOU WISH.

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:28.995

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:36.469
POWER UP MY ZOMBIE ARMY
AND ATTACK!

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:40.073
HUH. WELL, SO MUCH
FOR ARMORED LIZARD.

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:42.408
OH, THIS IS SO COOL!

00:10:43.243 --> 00:10:44.444
BOSS, YOU'RE GIVING ME
GREAT ADVICE!

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.213
Keith, thinking:
NAH, JUST GOOD ADVICE
SO FAR, BONZ.

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:50.016
BUT YOU'VE GOT ONE CARD
THAT'LL DEMOLISH THE DWEEB.

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.619
MAN, I CAN BARELY
DEFEND MYSELF.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.521

I'M WIPING THEM OUT

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:04.397
HE'S RIGHT.
I'M DONE FOR.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:08.902
Bonz: DEADLY ZOMBIE BREATH!

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:10.103
AAH!

00:11:10.904 --> 00:11:12.505
OHH. THAT DRAGON'S
BAD BREATH IS KILLING ME.

00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:17.010
I LOSE ANOTHER WARRIOR,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:18.678
AND HIS ZOMBIES
ONLY GET STRONGER.

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:20.380
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:23.716
COME ON! THROW ANOTHER CARD
FOR MY MONSTERS TO DEVOUR!

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:26.886
[THINKING]
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY TO BEAT HIM.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.121
YUGI WOULD KNOW.

00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:29.289
Yugi: JOEY!
Tristan: JOEY!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:31.558
HUH?

00:11:33.393 --> 00:11:34.194
YUGI! YOU'RE REALLY HERE!

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:35.795
GRR.

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:36.930
BLOCK 'EM.
[BOTH GRUNT]

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.399
WHAT KIND OF DUEL
ARENA IS THIS?

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.668
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHY IN THE WORLD

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.870
DID YOU ACCEPT A DUEL
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.171
YEAH, LIKE
I HAD A CHOICE.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.140
THOSE 3 CREEPS THERE
GANGED UP ON ME

00:11:47.674 --> 00:11:49.075
AND FORCED ME INTO
THIS CRAZY DUEL.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:50.510
WHOA!

00:11:50.944 --> 00:11:51.611
All: HUH?

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:52.879
Tristan:
THIS DUEL'S OVER.

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:54.681
THAT'S NOT
UP TO YOU, CHUM.

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:56.382
I SAY IT IS.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.751
YOU WANNA STOP IT,
YOU GOTTA GET PAST ME.

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:00.186
MY PLEASURE!

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.688
AAH!

UHH!

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:06.859
Yugi:
TRISTAN!

00:12:08.428 --> 00:12:09.095
TRISTAN, ARE YOU--

00:12:09.596 --> 00:12:10.396
Keith: HOLD IT.
HUH?

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:13.099
REMEMBER,
IF YOU LEAVE THE ARENA,
YOU FORFEIT THE DUEL,

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:15.635
AND ALL YOUR STAR CHIPS
BELONG TO ME.

00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:16.869
WHAT?

00:12:17.237 --> 00:12:18.238
THE DUEL
IS ILLEGAL
ANYWAY.

00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:19.639
RIGHT, TéA!

00:12:19.973 --> 00:12:20.640
WRONG, TéA.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.542
WHEN HE THREW DOWN
HIS STAR CHIPS,

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:24.310
HE ACCEPTED THE DUEL.
HA HA HA HA!

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:26.579
IN THAT CASE, JOEY--

00:12:27.447 --> 00:12:29.048
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO BEAT
THESE PUNKS.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.317
AND IF YOU'RE
GONNA NEED A LITTLE

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:33.987
ADDED MOTIVATION,
TRY THIS!

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.422
HUH? SERENITY.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.424
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY.
YOUR SISTER.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:39.892
YOU'RE DUELING
FOR HER.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.027
THANKS, MAN.

00:12:41.995 --> 00:12:43.196
Keith:
SO, WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.431
YOU GONNA CUT
AND RUN, DWEEB,

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.367
OR YOU GONNA PART
WITH YOUR STAR CHIPS

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:48.001
THE HARD WAY?

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.004
HEY, I'VE HAD IT
UP TO HERE WITH
YOUR SMART REMARKS.

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:52.605
SPILL!
WHO ARE YOU, ANYWAY?

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.308
DON'T YOU KNOW?
THEY CALL ME BANDIT KEITH.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:57.377
YOU'RE BANDIT KEITH?

00:12:58.311 --> 00:12:59.512
I'VE HEARD THAT NAME
SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.447
YEAH, HE'S
THE INTERCONTINENTAL
CHAMPION,

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.916
THE GUY THAT KAIBA
TOLD US ABOUT.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.852
HE'S ONLY LOST ONE
DUEL MONSTERS CHALLENGE,

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.221
AND THAT ONE
WAS TO PEGASUS HIMSELF.

00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:09.389
OH.
OH.

00:13:09.756 --> 00:13:10.957
HUH. NO WONDER
SKULL FACE THERE

00:13:12.225 --> 00:13:13.426
HAS OUTSMARTED ME
AT EVERY TURN.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.129
WHICH IS WHY YOU OUGHT
TO JUST PACK IT UP

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:17.530
AND GO HOME, DWEEB,
'CAUSE I'VE GIVEN

00:13:18.064 --> 00:13:19.666
MY LITTLE PAL BONZ HERE
THE PERFECT STRATEGY.

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:22.835
YOU COULDN'T BEAT HIM
WITH EVERY CARD
IN YOUR DECK.

00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:25.538
NOBODY'S
GONNA GET INSIDE
PEGUSUS'S CASTLE

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:27.740
EXCEPT
BANDIT KEITH AND US.

00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:29.542
YOU FOUGHT
YOUR LAST DUEL, JOEY.

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:31.744
YOU'RE ABOUT TO JOIN
THE OTHER ZOMBIES

00:13:32.045 --> 00:13:32.845
IN THIS GRAVEYARD FIELD.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:34.747
A GRAVEYARD FIELD?

00:13:36.082 --> 00:13:38.284
Bonz: COME ON.
PLAY YOUR NEXT CARD
OR REST IN PEACE.

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:40.253
HMM? SERENITY.

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:42.789
FOR YOUR SAKE,
I'VE GOTTA WIN!

00:13:45.258 --> 00:13:46.859
NO! ALL YOUR HOPES
AND ALL YOUR DREAMS

00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.127

I'LL KEEP
MY DEFENSES UP

A WAY TO ATTACK!

BROADCAST YOUR STRATEGY.

00:13:55.468 --> 00:13:56.135

BONZ HAS A SPECIAL CARD
IN HIS DECK

00:14:01.341 --> 00:14:02.542
THAT'LL RENDER ALL
YOUR DEFENSES USELESS!

HE CAN'T POSSIBLY

IN DEFENSE MODE
WILL ACTIVATE THE TRAP!

AND YOU STILL
CAN'T STOP ME FROM RAISING

IF ALL MY DEFENSES
ARE BLOCKED,

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:12.478
THEN I'LL JUST HAVE
TO TAKE TO THE OFFENSE.

IS GREATER THAN MINE.

INFERNO FIRE BLAST!

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:25.324
ALL RIGHT!
NICE MOVE, JOEY.

00:15:26.526 --> 00:15:27.727
NOW HE CAN'T RAISE
HIS MONSTERS'

ATTACK POWER
ANY HIGHER!

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:31.697
AND SINCE PUMPKING
WAS ALREADY A GHOST
FROM THE START,

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:33.900
HE CAN'T USE THE CALL
OF THE HAUNTED

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.168
TO BRING HIM BACK.

YOU STILL GOT MORE
THAN ENOUGH ATTACK POWER

00:15:40.573 --> 00:15:41.774

OFF FOR GOOD.

WAS NO MATCH FOR ME.

THAT I'VE GOT LEFT

IS BATTLE WARRIOR,

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:20.046
AND HIS ATTACK POWERS
ARE WAY TOO LOW.

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:22.448
WELL, ARE YOU GOING
TO PLAY OR SURRENDER?

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.851

SOME WAY

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:26.686

HE'S IN A BIG JAM, TéA.

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.690
ATTACKING THE ZOMBIE ARMY
DOESN'T DO ANY GOOD,

00:16:32.592 --> 00:16:34.193
AND THAT TRAP CARD
BLOCKS ALL HIS DEFENSES.

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:36.262

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.031

YOU'RE YUGI, RIGHT?

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.244
WELL, MAYBE YOU BEAT KAIBA,
BUT THE STRATEGY I GAVE BONZ

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:52.378
IS JUST PERFECT.

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.046

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:02.355
OK. YEAH.

YEAH, THIS IS...THE ONE.

00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.328
[THINKING]
THIS MUST BE THE CARD
YUGI WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.731
SHIELD AND SWORD
IS A MAGIC CARD

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.399
THAT SWAPS THE ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:17:14.133 --> 00:17:15.301
OF EVERY MONSTER
ON THE FIELD!

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:17.970
IF I CAN TAKE AWAY
THE ZOMBIES'
ATTACK POWER

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.205
BY FLIPPING IT
TO DEFENSE,

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:21.841
HIS MONSTERS
WON'T BE ABLE
TO STOP MY NEXT CARD!

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:23.309
YEP. IT'S MY ONLY CHANCE.

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:25.077

SO, IT'S THE ONLY MOVE
YOU HAD LEFT, HUH?

00:17:31.417 --> 00:17:32.818
AND THEN I ADD
THIS MAGIC CARD

NO WILL OF THEIR OWN.

HAS DROPPED TO ZERO!

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:57.209
AND MY BATTLE WARRIOR'S
ATTACK AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:17:57.843 --> 00:17:58.511

UHH! WITH THEIR
ATTACK POINTS AT ZERO,

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.689
THE ZOMBIES CAN'T
COME BACK TO LIFE.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.057
HOW COULD I LOSE?

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:13.192
ALL RIGHT!

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:37.350
YOU'RE HOPELESS, DWEEB.

THE GAME OF DUEL MONSTERS

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:41.320
IS ALL ABOUT KEEPING YOUR
OPPONENTS OFF BALANCE.

ALL THAT MATTERS,

IN SUCH A BIG HURRY
