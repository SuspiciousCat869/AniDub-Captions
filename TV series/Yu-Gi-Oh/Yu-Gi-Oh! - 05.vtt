Announcer: PREVIOUSLY
ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:08.940
SAY GOOD-BYE TO EXODIA!

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.611
THOSE WERE THE EXODIA CARDS
THAT MY GRANDPA GAVE ME.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.279
GREETINGS, DUELISTS.

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.915
I AM MAXIMILLION PEGASUS.

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:19.117
IT IS MY GREAT HONOR
AND PLEASURE

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:21.653
TO WELCOME YOU ALL
TO THE DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:22.721
[THINKING]
IF GRANDPA'S HERE,

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.156
I'D BET MY DUELING GLOVE

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.557
HE'S HIDDEN AWAY
IN THAT CASTLE.

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:27.359
BUT I'LL NEVER BE
ABLE TO GET IN THERE

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.994
WITH ALL THE GUARDS
AROUND.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.329
[THINKING]
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO WIN ENOUGH STAR CHIPS

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.631
TO GET INSIDE.

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.933
WHEN THE SKIES LIGHT UP
WITH FIREWORKS,

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.668
THE DUELS WILL BEGIN.

00:00:36.668 --> 00:00:37.803
Joey: THERE HE IS!

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.138
"WELCOME," SAID THE SPIDER
TO THE FLY.

00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:42.207
TIME YOU ANSWER
FOR WHAT YOU DID
ON THE BOAT, WEEVIL.

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:47.312
YU-GI-OH!

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:53.718
IT'S TIME TO DUEL.

00:00:57.622 --> 00:00:59.424
MAYBE IF YOU WERE
SMART ENOUGH

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:02.394
TO STEAL THE TOURNAMENT
SECRET NEW RULES LIKE I DID,

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:05.363
YOU'D BE GETTING
A FIELD POWER BONUS
INSTEAD OF ME.

Yami Yugi: FERAL IMP,
MAGIC LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:14.072
Téa: YUGI'S ATTACK DIDN'T
EVEN PHASE THAT THING.

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:16.608
ATTACK NOW--
WITH ANY MONSTER--

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:19.311
AND YOU WILL INSTANTLY
ACTIVATE THIS TRAP CARD.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.914

I CREATE A NEW MONSTER!

MY ARMY OF INSECTS JUST
KEEPS GETTING BIGGER!

00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:28.520
I'M GOING TO WIPE OUT
ALL YOUR MONSTERS

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.322
IN ONE BUG BLITZKRIEG!

00:01:30.322 --> 00:01:31.656
Yami Yugi:
THAT'S RIGHT, WEEVIL,

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:33.391
PUT ALL YOUR MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.528
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M COUNTING ON.

00:01:36.528 --> 00:01:39.164
Weevil: NOW, MY PET,
POWER UP YOUR LASER CANNON.

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:40.866

WH-WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:46.071
WEEVIL, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.039
SET A TRAP CARD.
WHAT?!

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.475
WHILE YOU LOADED THE FIELD
WITH YOUR BUG MONSTERS,

00:01:50.475 --> 00:01:52.777
I PREPARED
A SPECIAL SURPRISE...

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:54.980

HOLD YOUR FIRE!

00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:59.651
Yugi: TOO LATE,
WEEVIL. YOU ALREADY
ORDERED YOUR ATTACK

00:01:59.651 --> 00:02:01.152
ON MY DARK MAGICIAN,

00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:04.122
AND MIRROR FORCE
WILL DEFLECT IT
RIGHT BACK AT YOU!

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:05.891

I HAVE PLENTY OF TRICKS
UP MY SLEEVE.

THROUGHOUT THIS
WHOLE DUEL, WEEVIL,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.393
BUT I'M STILL HERE
WAITING FOR THE STING.

SINCE YOU'RE NEW
TO THIS WHOLE DUELING
TOURNAMENT THING,

I'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS
SIMPLE FOR YOU.

00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:39.711
OH! BUT THIS LITTLE BUG
WON'T STAND A CHANCE

FEROCIOUS MONSTERS.

OH, WELL,

00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:46.017
I'LL PLAY HIM
IN DEFENSE MODE.

[THINKING]
HEH HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.023
HMM. THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN A NICE BLUFF,

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:54.025
BUT I STILL
HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN

00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:56.027
ABOUT THE TRAP CARD
YOU PLAYED.

00:04:56.027 --> 00:04:58.863
WITH THIS TRAP CARD,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO ATTACK ME

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:00.298
WITH ANY OF YOUR MONSTERS.

00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:02.333
HE DIDN'T TRAP ME THEN,

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.502
AND HE'S NOT GONNA
TRAP ME NOW.

00:05:04.502 --> 00:05:05.770
WEEVIL'S TRAP CARD
WILL ACTIVATE

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.305
AS SOON AS I CALL
AN ATTACK,

00:05:07.305 --> 00:05:10.475
AND IT'LL DESTROY
ALL THE MONSTERS I HAVE
ON THE FIELD.

00:05:10.475 --> 00:05:13.778
BUT WHAT IF
I GET MY MONSTERS
OFF THE FIELD FIRST,

00:05:13.778 --> 00:05:15.680
AND THEN DESTROY
WEEVIL'S TRAP?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.315
THAT'S IT!

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.184
I'LL SPRING YOUR TRAP,
WEEVIL.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:23.054
BUT FIRST...THE MONSTER
RECOVERY CARD.

00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:24.189
IT ALLOWS ME
TO CALL BACK

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.424
ALL THE CREATURES
I HAVE ON THE FIELD.

00:05:26.424 --> 00:05:28.927
MONSTERS, RETURN
TO YOUR CARDS!

00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:32.530
NOW YOUR TRAP
HAS NOTHING TO SNARE,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.366
AND ONCE MY MONSTERS
ARE ALL SAFELY BACK
IN MY DECK,

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:38.169
THE RECOVERY CARD
ALSO LETS ME DRAW
A NEW HAND.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.040
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS SACRIFICE

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.608
ONE OF MY
WEAKER MONSTERS,

00:05:43.608 --> 00:05:45.210
AND YOUR TRAP
IS SPRUNG.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.012
KURIBOH, ATTACK!

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:52.984
YEAH!

00:05:56.955 --> 00:06:00.625
TRAP CARDS ONLY WORK
WHEN THEY CATCH YOU
BY SURPRISE.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.027
NEXT TIME, DON'T
GIVE YOUR PLAN AWAY.

00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:06.030
HEE HEE HEE HEE.
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.532
I DIDN'T!

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:09.234
I DON'T GIVE
A BEE'S BEHIND

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:11.236
ABOUT THAT STUPID TRAP!

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:13.238
I TRICKED YOU INTO
RECALLING YOUR MONSTERS

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:15.707
SO YOU COULDN'T
ATTACK THIS!

00:06:19.744 --> 00:06:22.147
[THINKING]
IT'S JUST A SIMPLE
LITTLE LARVAE MOTH.

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:24.449
THAT TINY CREATURE
CAN'T BE MUCH
OF A THREAT.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.251
WHAT'S WEEVIL UP TO NOW?

00:06:26.251 --> 00:06:27.452
HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:29.988
SURE, HE'S JUST
A LITTLE SLUG NOW,

00:06:29.988 --> 00:06:31.990
BUT THE COCOON OF EVOLUTION
WILL CHANGE ALL THAT.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.191
WHAT?!

00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:35.126
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?!

00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:39.864
EWW.

00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:44.836
EWW. THAT'S
JUST GROSS.

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:47.105
WEEVIL'S BUG IS
SEALING ITSELF
IN A COCOON.

00:06:47.105 --> 00:06:48.673
[THINKING]
I TOLD THOSE CHUMPS

00:06:48.673 --> 00:06:51.109
WEEVIL WOULD TURN
THIS DUEL AROUND.

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:54.612
BEHOLD MY COCOON
OF EVOLUTION!

00:06:54.612 --> 00:06:55.980
HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA!

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.684
WITHIN THAT COCOON SITS
MY TINY LITTLE LARVAE MOTH,

00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:01.519
AND OVER THE NEXT 5 TURNS

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:04.155
HE WILL UNDERGO
A STARTLING TRANSFORMATION...

00:07:04.155 --> 00:07:06.424
FROM HARMLESS
CATERPILLAR

00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:08.426
TO UNSTOPPABLE
GREAT MOTH!

00:07:08.426 --> 00:07:09.894
THEN I'LL CRACK
YOUR COCOON

00:07:09.894 --> 00:07:11.162
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.

00:07:11.162 --> 00:07:13.097
EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, YUGI,

00:07:13.097 --> 00:07:16.000
FOR MY COCOON OF EVOLUTION
GETS A FIELD POWER BONUS

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.702
FROM THE WILDERNESS
AROUND US,

00:07:17.702 --> 00:07:19.671
INCREASING
ITS DEFENSE POINTS.

00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:21.172
IT'LL BE SO STRONG,

00:07:21.172 --> 00:07:24.142
YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO SCRATCH ITS SURFACE!

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:26.177
JUST 5 MORE TURNS, YUGI.

00:07:26.177 --> 00:07:29.214
IN 5 TURNS
MY GREAT MOTH
WILL FULLY EVOLVE

00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:30.648
AND FINISH YOU OFF.

00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:33.017
[THINKING]
IF WHAT WEEVILS SAYS
IS TRUE,

00:07:33.017 --> 00:07:35.153
I'D BETTER ACT FAST.

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:38.056

BIGGER AND STRONGER

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:40.124
WITH EACH
PASSING SECOND.

00:07:43.085 --> 00:07:44.886
[THINKING]
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY

00:07:44.886 --> 00:07:47.489
TO BREAK OPEN
THAT COCOON NOW.

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:50.525
I CAN'T LET THAT MOTH
GET TO ITS FIFTH STAGE
OF EVOLUTION.

00:07:50.525 --> 00:07:53.829
DO I HAVE A CARD
THAT'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO STOP IT?

00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:55.030
HMM...

00:07:57.332 --> 00:07:59.134
GIA, THE FIERCE KNIGHT!

00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:03.739
[HORSE WHINNIES]

00:08:05.774 --> 00:08:07.976
SHATTER THAT COCOON!

00:08:10.145 --> 00:08:12.614
THE FIELD POWER BONUS
MAKES IT TOO STRONG.

00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:14.616
THAT'S ONE TURN DOWN!

00:08:14.616 --> 00:08:16.118
CARE TO TRY AGAIN?

00:08:16.118 --> 00:08:18.487
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:08:18.487 --> 00:08:21.123
[THINKING]
WEEVIL'S COCOON IS
GONNA BE TOUGH TO CRACK,

00:08:21.123 --> 00:08:22.758
AND FOR EACH ATTACK
THAT FAILS,

00:08:22.758 --> 00:08:24.626
MY LIFE POINTS
GO DOWN.

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:25.627
OH, NO.

00:08:25.627 --> 00:08:26.828
HANG TOUGH, YUGI.

00:08:26.828 --> 00:08:27.996
YOU'LL POP
THAT PUS BAG.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:29.197
HA HA HA HA.

00:08:29.197 --> 00:08:31.133
JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE LAUGHING AT?!

00:08:31.133 --> 00:08:33.735
ALL THAT STUPID CHEERLEADING
YOU'RE DOING.

00:08:33.735 --> 00:08:35.637
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE YOUR YUGI

00:08:35.637 --> 00:08:36.805
STILL HAS A CHANCE.

00:08:36.805 --> 00:08:38.907
OF COURSE HE DOES!

00:08:38.907 --> 00:08:40.675
DON'T LISTEN
TO HER, TéA.

00:08:40.675 --> 00:08:42.544
ANY DUELIST THAT'S
EVER GONE UP AGAINST

00:08:42.544 --> 00:08:44.079
WEEVIL'S COCOON
OF EVOLUTION

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:45.714
HAS BEEN
TOTALLY TRASHED.

00:08:45.714 --> 00:08:47.382
ALL OF THEM?
ALL OF THEM?

00:08:47.382 --> 00:08:50.118
BUT YUGI'S GOT US
TO HELP HIM BEAT IT.

00:08:50.118 --> 00:08:52.120
[THINKING]
HMMPH! HE'LL NEED
A WHOLE LOT MORE

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.688
THAN YOU LOSERS.

00:08:53.688 --> 00:08:55.090
HEAR IT GROWING?

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.926
THE MORE TIME YOU WASTE,
THE MORE POWERFUL IT BECOMES.

00:08:57.926 --> 00:09:00.295
[THINKING]
IF I DON'T COME UP
WITH SOMETHING QUICK,

00:09:00.295 --> 00:09:02.130
I'M NOT JUST GONNA
LOSE THIS DUEL,

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.200
I'LL LOSE MY ONLY CHANCE
TO SAVE MY GRANDPA.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.602
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:09.938
TICKTOCK,
TICKTOCK.

00:09:09.938 --> 00:09:13.441
JUST 4 MORE TURNS UNTIL
MY ULTIMATE INSECT EMERGES.

00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:15.343
THEN YOU CAN
STOP WORRYING ABOUT

00:09:15.343 --> 00:09:17.145
HOW YOU'RE GOING
TO DESTROY <i>IT,</i>

00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:20.415
AND START WORRYING
ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING
TO DESTROY <i>YOU.</i>

00:09:20.415 --> 00:09:22.517
HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA!

00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:25.287
[THINKING]
MAYBE I SHOULD
PREPARE A DEFENSE

00:09:25.287 --> 00:09:27.055
IN CASE I REALLY CAN'T
STOP THAT THING.

00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:30.826
HA! YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR TURN.

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:32.594
NO DEFENSE WILL SAVE
YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:09:32.594 --> 00:09:34.429
ONCE MY MOTH IS OUT!

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.101
[THINKING]
I HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:41.603
TO TURN THIS DUEL
AROUND.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:42.737
WEEVIL'S PRETTY
CONFIDENT

00:09:42.737 --> 00:09:44.406
THAT WHATEVER'S GROWING
IN THAT COCOON

00:09:44.406 --> 00:09:45.874
IS UNBEATABLE,

00:09:45.874 --> 00:09:48.610
BUT THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOME WAY TO
POP THAT THING OPEN

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.145
AND WIPE THAT SMIRK
OFF HIS FACE.

00:09:50.145 --> 00:09:51.646
BUT HOW?

00:09:51.646 --> 00:09:53.181
HANG IN THERE, YUGI.

00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:54.916
YOU GOTTA WIN THIS
FOR YOUR GRANDPA.

00:09:54.916 --> 00:09:56.117
HE'S COUNTIN' ON YOU.

00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:58.153
I KNOW HE IS.

00:09:58.153 --> 00:10:00.222
THEN YOU CAN'T KEEP
LETTIN' THIS LITTLE CREEP

00:10:00.222 --> 00:10:01.590
PUSH YOU AROUND.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.226
YUGI, YOU GOTTA GET
FIRED UP!

00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:05.427
[THINKING]
WAIT. THAT'S IT!

00:10:05.427 --> 00:10:06.995
GET FIRED UP.

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:08.396
SO DO YOU GUYS
SIT AROUND

00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:09.764
AND WORK UP
THESE LAME CHEERS,

00:10:09.764 --> 00:10:11.366
OR DO THEY JUST
COME TO YOU?

00:10:11.366 --> 00:10:12.701
I MEAN,
DON'T YOU REALIZE

00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:14.002
THAT YOUR
PEP TALK NONSENSE

00:10:14.002 --> 00:10:16.771
ONLY DISTRACTS YUGI
FROM THE GAME?

00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:18.273
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

00:10:18.273 --> 00:10:19.708
I BET NO ONE'S
EVER EVEN WANTED

00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:20.842
TO BE YOUR FRIEND,

00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:23.545
LET ALONE CARE ENOUGH
TO CHEER YOU ON.

00:10:23.545 --> 00:10:25.447
FRIENDS HAVEN'T
HELPED YUGI ANY.

00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:26.481
HE'S LOSING.

00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:27.482
HUH?

00:10:29.117 --> 00:10:30.252
YEAH!
YES!

00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:31.786
HEY!
ALL RIGHT!

00:10:31.786 --> 00:10:33.588
WELL, MAI,
FROM THE LOOK
ON YUGI'S FACE,

00:10:33.588 --> 00:10:34.689
I'D SAY THAT
HAVING FRIENDS

00:10:34.689 --> 00:10:36.625
JUST DID
HELP HIM OUT.
SO THERE.

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:37.626
[THINKING]
BRAT.

00:10:37.626 --> 00:10:38.627
WHAT
POSSIBLE IDEA

00:10:38.627 --> 00:10:39.628
COULD YUGI
HAVE GOTTEN

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:41.630
FROM THESE
MENTAL MORONS?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.131
GO, CURSE OF DRAGON!

00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:45.333
TAKE FLIGHT!

00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:48.069
[SCREECHING]

00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:50.305
AND...I'LL COMBINE IT...

00:10:50.305 --> 00:10:52.674
WITH THIS MAGIC CARD.

00:10:52.674 --> 00:10:54.643
ATTACK
WITH DRAGON FLAME!

00:10:57.646 --> 00:10:59.748
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?!

00:10:59.748 --> 00:11:01.449
YOU KNOW
YOUR LITTLE FIREFLY

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:02.851
CAN'T HURT MY COCOON.

00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.552
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:11:04.552 --> 00:11:05.854
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:11:05.854 --> 00:11:08.323
WHOEVER SAID I WAS
AIMING FOR YOUR COCOON?

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:10.825
I COMBINED MY
BURNING LAND MAGIC CARD

00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:12.427
WITH MY CURSE
OF DRAGON

00:11:12.427 --> 00:11:15.430
TO DESTROY THE FOREST
ALL AROUND YOUR COCOON.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.598
NO FOREST?

00:11:16.598 --> 00:11:19.434
THAT MEANS I LOSE
MY FIELD POWER BONUS!

00:11:19.434 --> 00:11:21.736
EXACTLY. YOUR COCOON
WAS TOO TOUGH

00:11:21.736 --> 00:11:23.438
TO ATTACK DIRECTLY,

00:11:23.438 --> 00:11:25.006
BUT WITHOUT ITS
FIELD POWER BONUS,

00:11:25.006 --> 00:11:26.942
IT'S JUST
A BIG TARGET.

00:11:26.942 --> 00:11:28.443
AAH!

00:11:28.443 --> 00:11:30.946
NOW LET'S TRY THIS
AGAIN.

00:11:30.946 --> 00:11:32.747
GIA, THE FIERCE KNIGHT,

00:11:32.747 --> 00:11:33.949
ATTACK!

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:38.586
HE DID IT!

00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:40.522
POPPED IT OPEN
LIKE A ZIT!

00:11:40.522 --> 00:11:42.524
HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH.

00:11:42.524 --> 00:11:45.026
[SUCKING SOUNDS]

00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:46.528
HUH?

00:11:46.528 --> 00:11:47.529
HUH?

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.531
IS IT STILL ALIVE?

00:11:49.531 --> 00:11:51.232
Joey: I'VE GOT
A BAD FEELING

00:11:51.232 --> 00:11:53.568
WE'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT.

00:11:56.418 --> 00:11:57.385
HUH?

00:11:57.385 --> 00:11:59.321
SEE ANYTHING?

00:12:02.457 --> 00:12:04.960
IT'S STILL--
IT'S STILL MOVIN'.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.428
YOU'RE SURPRISED?

00:12:14.136 --> 00:12:16.138
HEH HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH!

00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:18.140
IT MUST'VE
EVOLVED ENOUGH
TO SURVIVE.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.141
UNH!
OH!

00:12:19.141 --> 00:12:21.143
I TOLD YOU
WEEVIL WAS GOOD.

00:12:21.143 --> 00:12:23.645
I'M IMPRESSED THAT
YOU PIERCED MY COCOON, YUGI,

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:26.214
BUT STILL, YOU WERE UNABLE
TO STOP THE EVOLUTION

00:12:26.214 --> 00:12:29.151
OF MY ULTIMATE INSECT--
THE GREAT MOTH!

00:12:29.151 --> 00:12:31.620
BUT I THOUGHT
IT TOOK 5 TURNS.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:32.954
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:12:32.954 --> 00:12:34.823
SO YOU STOPPED HIM
ONE TURN EARLY.

00:12:34.823 --> 00:12:37.125
HE'S STILL STRONG ENOUGH
TO BEAT YOU.

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.994
OH, NO.

00:12:38.994 --> 00:12:40.896
[THINKING]
HA! I NOTICE THAT
THE LITTLE DWEEBS

00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:42.397
AREN'T CHEERING NOW.

00:12:42.397 --> 00:12:45.167
THE GREAT MOTH IS
AN UNBEATABLE CREATURE.

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:47.269
THEY CAN CHATTER
FROM THE SIDELINES
ALL THEY WANT,

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:50.071
BUT IT WON'T HELP YUGI
ONE BIT.

00:12:50.071 --> 00:12:53.041
WEEVIL TURNED
THIS MATCH AROUND
ONCE MORE,

00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:55.076
BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP.

00:12:55.076 --> 00:12:56.278
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:12:56.278 --> 00:12:58.580
SO, YUGI, FEELING
OUTCLASSED YET?

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.282
OR PERHAPS
YOU'RE ENJOYING

00:13:00.282 --> 00:13:02.551
YOUR FIRST MAJOR-LEAGUE
DUELING LOSS. HEH HEH...

00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:05.520
HMM. YOU MAY HAVE
GOTTEN YOUR PRIZED
MONSTER

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.655
ONTO THE FIELD, WEEVIL,

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:07.856
BUT I'LL STILL
FIND A WAY

00:13:07.856 --> 00:13:09.558
TO SQUASH
THAT OVERSIZED BUG.

00:13:09.558 --> 00:13:11.793
HEH! YOU'LL PAY
FOR THAT STINGING JAB

00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:14.029
WITH YOUR LIFE POINTS!
DUEL!

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:18.300
GREAT MOTH, TAKE FLIGHT!

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.901
SO BE IT.

00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.170
WE'LL SETTLE THIS
IN THE SKIES!

00:13:24.172 --> 00:13:27.108
[THINKING]
HEH! YUGI'S DRAGON
IS NO MATCH

00:13:27.108 --> 00:13:28.443
FOR MY GREAT MOTH,

00:13:28.443 --> 00:13:30.612
AND NONE OF
HIS LAND MONSTERS
HAVE THE ABILITY

00:13:30.612 --> 00:13:32.480
TO ATTACK ME
IN THE AIR! HEH HEH.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.351
BUT WHICH PUNY CREATURE
SHALL I OBLITERATE FIRST?

00:13:36.351 --> 00:13:38.553
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME
I PAY BACK YOUR KNIGHT

00:13:38.553 --> 00:13:40.589
FOR DEMOLISHING
MY COCOON.

00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:41.723
[THINKING]
MY KNIGHT!

00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:43.225
HE'S THE HEART
OF MY ATTACK FORCE.

00:13:43.225 --> 00:13:45.894
THERE'S NO WAY
I CAN AFFORD
TO LOSE HIM.

00:13:45.894 --> 00:13:47.395
THIS IS IT, YUGI.

00:13:47.395 --> 00:13:49.664
MY GREAT MOTH WILL
CRUSH YOUR DEFENSES,

00:13:49.664 --> 00:13:50.765
SLAY YOUR KNIGHT,

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:53.902
AND BLAST YOUR DRAGON
FROM THE SKY.

00:13:53.902 --> 00:13:56.571
NOT IF I CAN HELP IT,
WEEVIL. UNH.

00:13:58.106 --> 00:14:00.508
BUT THAT'S JUST IT,
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:03.178
MOTH HURRICANE ATTACK!

00:14:03.178 --> 00:14:05.113
NO! MY BEAVER WARRIOR!

00:14:05.113 --> 00:14:07.115
MY DEFENSE.

00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:08.583
IT'S HOPELESS.

00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:11.086
NOTHING CAN STAND AGAINST
THE GALE-FORCE WINDS

00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:12.587
OF MY MOTH HURRICANE.

00:14:29.104 --> 00:14:32.474
IF I HAVE
2 COMPATIBLE MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD,

00:14:32.474 --> 00:14:34.576
I CAN USE MY
POLYMERIZATION CARD

00:14:34.576 --> 00:14:37.445

WHAT?! NO.

ITS HURRICANE ATTACK,

IT RELEASES TONS
OF THESE TINY
TOXIC PARTICLES.

00:15:17.085 --> 00:15:19.220
AND YOUR PRECIOUS

YOU'VE ONLY WON
A BRIEF REPRIEVE,

IS ONE YOU WON'T BE ABLE

KEEPS HIS MIND
ON THE GAME.

SEE THIS COMING?

BE VERY DIFFICULT

TO CHEAT.

BENDING THE RULES

00:18:12.877 --> 00:18:14.211
WOULD HELP YOU
WIN THIS MATCH,

00:18:14.211 --> 00:18:16.314
