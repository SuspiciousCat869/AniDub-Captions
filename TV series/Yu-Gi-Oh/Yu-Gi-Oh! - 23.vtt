00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.665
NOT THE OTHER WAY
AROUND.

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:54.534
I DON'T NEED
TO SEE YOUR HAND.

00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:57.270
BUT I THINK YOU NEED
TO BE TAUGHT A LESSON,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.306
AND I'LL BE HAPPY
TO MAKE MY NEXT PLAY

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:01.107
PAINFULLY INSTRUCTIVE.

00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:03.843
[THINKING] THIS COMBINATION
OF SAGGI THE DARK CLOWN

00:08:03.843 --> 00:08:05.345
AND THE CONTAGIOUS
CRUSH CARD

00:08:05.345 --> 00:08:07.647
SHOULD HELP ME INFECT
YUGI'S LIFE POINTS.

00:08:09.349 --> 00:08:10.517
UNH!

00:08:12.185 --> 00:08:15.388
BEHOLD...
SAGGI THE DARK CLOWN!

00:08:15.388 --> 00:08:19.392
HEH HEH HEH!
HEH HEH HA HA!

00:08:19.392 --> 00:08:21.361
SAGGI THE DARK CLOWN?

00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:23.029
[THINKING]
I WAS EXPECTING KAIBA

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:25.632
TO SIC HIS BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON ON ME.

00:08:25.632 --> 00:08:28.501
HE KNOWS SAGGI IS NO MATCH
FOR MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:30.537
WHAT'S HE UP TO?

00:08:30.537 --> 00:08:32.672
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY
TRAP CARDS EARLIER

00:08:32.672 --> 00:08:34.407
WHEN I GOT A LOOK
AT HIS HAND,

00:08:34.407 --> 00:08:36.676
BUT HE MIGHT'VE DRAWN
SOME NEW ONES BY NOW.

00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:39.346
THE ONLY WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE
IS TO ATTACK...

00:08:39.346 --> 00:08:42.349
BUT I DARE NOT RISK
MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:44.317
DARK MAGICIAN, RETURN!

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.621
ALL RIGHT! GOOD CARD.

00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:50.523
GAIA THE FIERCE KNIGHT.

00:08:50.523 --> 00:08:52.525
HE WIPED THE FLOOR
WITH SAGGI

00:08:52.525 --> 00:08:54.127
IN MY FIRST DUEL
WITH KAIBA.

00:08:54.127 --> 00:08:57.097
AND HE WILL DEFEAT SAGGI
ONCE AGAIN.

00:08:57.097 --> 00:09:00.700
GAIA THE FIERCE KNIGHT

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.168
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:05.972
[HORSE WHINNIES]

00:09:05.972 --> 00:09:07.173
[GALLOPING]

00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:17.951
YOUR DARK CLOWN HAS
BEEN VANQUISHED, KAIBA!

00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:21.721
VANQUISHED AND SACRIFICED
ARE 2 VERY DIFFERENT THINGS,
YUGI.

00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:24.724
LOOK AGAIN.

00:09:24.724 --> 00:09:25.892
NO!

00:09:25.892 --> 00:09:27.360
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.328
[HORSE WHINNIES]

00:09:28.328 --> 00:09:29.396
GAIA!

00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:31.264
NOT JUST GAIA, YUGI.

00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:33.767
NO!
MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:35.835
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE,
KAIBA?

00:09:35.835 --> 00:09:37.637
IT'S REALLY QUITE
INGENIOUS, ACTUALLY.

00:09:37.637 --> 00:09:40.907
KNOWING THAT
YOU COULDN'T RESIST
ATTACKING MY DARK CLOWN,

00:09:40.907 --> 00:09:43.877
I INFECTED HIM WITH
THE CRUSH CARD VIRUS.

00:09:43.877 --> 00:09:45.378
A CRUSH CARD?

00:09:45.378 --> 00:09:47.847
BY DESTROYING
THE INFECTED SAGGI,

00:09:47.847 --> 00:09:49.816
YOU RELEASED
THE CRUSH CARD VIRUS--

00:09:49.816 --> 00:09:53.153
A VIRUS THAT IS
SO HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS
TO DUEL MONSTERS

00:09:53.153 --> 00:09:55.622
THAT EVEN AS I SPEAK
THESE WORDS,

00:09:55.622 --> 00:09:58.291
IT IS INFECTING ALL
BUT THE WEAKEST CARDS

00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:00.860
IN YOUR PRECIOUS
DUELING DECK.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.829
NO, MY CARDS!

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:04.330
HA HA HA!

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.100
THE ONLY MONSTERS UNAFFECTED
BY THE CRUSH CARD VIRUS

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.837
ARE THOSE
WITH AN ATTACK POWER
WEAKER THAN 1,500.

00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:14.307
LOOKS LIKE I'VE BROKEN
THE HEART OF YOUR CARDS,
YUGI.

00:10:14.307 --> 00:10:15.842
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:22.114
Yugi, thinking:
THAT CRUSH CARD KAIBA USED
TO INFECT MY DECK

00:10:22.114 --> 00:10:25.251
MAKES IT SO I CAN'T USE
ANY MONSTERS WITH MORE
THAN 1,500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:26.485
WELL-PLAYED,

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:28.287
BUT IT WILL TAKE
MORE THAN A VIRUS

00:10:28.287 --> 00:10:29.755
TO WIN THIS DUEL, KAIBA!

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:30.956
HA HA HA HA!

00:10:30.956 --> 00:10:33.993
YES, I EXPECT
THAT IT WILL, YUGI.

00:10:33.993 --> 00:10:37.096
ACTUALLY,
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SUBJECTING YOU

00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:39.598
TO A WIDE ARRAY
OF DEBILITATING CARDS.

00:10:39.598 --> 00:10:40.733
HUH.

00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:42.935
KEEP TALKIN' THE TALK,
BIG-MOUTH KAIBA.

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.571
JUST DON'T FORGET
THAT YUGI BEAT YOU
LAST TIME.

00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:48.440
YEAH, AND NOW YUGI'S
AN EVEN BETTER DUELIST.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.876
YES, BUT LAST TIME
HE DIDN'T HAVE
A CRUSH CARD

00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:53.879
FORCING HIM TO PLAY
JUST MAGIC CARDS
AND WEAK MONSTERS.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.014
YOU'RE KIDDIN'.

00:10:55.014 --> 00:10:56.882
HE'S ONLY ALLOWED
TO PLAY MAGIC CARDS

00:10:56.882 --> 00:10:58.384
AND HIS WIMPIEST CREATURES?

00:10:58.384 --> 00:11:00.219
HE'LL STILL WIN.

00:11:04.323 --> 00:11:05.524
HEH HEH HEH.

00:11:05.524 --> 00:11:07.626
THIS IS TURNING OUT
TO BE QUITE THE SHOW.

00:11:07.626 --> 00:11:11.196
ALL I'M REALLY MISSING
IS A HOT DOG AND
A BAG OF POPCORN.

00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:12.765
OH, WELL, FROM
THE LOOKS OF THINGS,

00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:14.433
THIS DUEL ISN'T GONNA
LAST LONG ENOUGH

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:16.101
FOR ME
TO ENJOY 'EM ANYWAY.

00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:19.772
BESIDES, GETTIN'
THE LOW-DOWN ON THESE
CHUMPS' DUELING STRATEGIES

00:11:19.772 --> 00:11:21.807
IS PLENTY FOR ME
TO SNACK ON.

00:11:21.807 --> 00:11:23.375
YOUR TURN, YUGI.

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:26.312
LET'S SEE HOW YOUR
DISEASE-RIDDEN DECK
SERVES YOU NOW.

00:11:26.312 --> 00:11:29.281
YOU MAY HAVE INFECTED
THE BODY OF MY DECK,
KAIBA,

00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:30.950
BUT IT IS THE <i>HEART</i>
OF THE CARDS

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.052
THAT WILL SEE ME THROUGH
THIS CONTAMINATION.

00:11:33.052 --> 00:11:34.219
HUNH.

00:11:34.219 --> 00:11:36.455
[THINKING]
THE SUMMONED SKULL.

00:11:36.455 --> 00:11:38.123
BUT I CAN'T USE HIM

00:11:38.123 --> 00:11:41.660
BECAUSE HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE OVER 1,500.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.262
KAIBA'S CRUSH CARD
WOULD INFECT HIM

00:11:43.262 --> 00:11:45.097
THE SECOND I LAID HIM
ON THE FIELD.

00:11:45.097 --> 00:11:46.165
FACE IT, YUGI.

00:11:46.165 --> 00:11:47.933
TO CONTINUE PLAYING
IN THIS DUEL,

00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:50.402
YOU'LL HAVE TO SERVE UP
YOUR WEAKEST MONSTERS.

00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:52.171
UHH.

00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:53.272
[THINKING]
HE'S RIGHT.

00:11:53.272 --> 00:11:56.542
FOR NOW,
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:58.711
SILVER FANG,
DEFENSE MODE!

00:11:58.711 --> 00:12:00.946
AND HIS ATTACK POINTS
ARE LOW ENOUGH

00:12:00.946 --> 00:12:02.615
TO MAKE HIM IMMUNE
TO YOUR VIRUS.

00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:04.216
YOUR TURN.

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:07.286
IRONIC THAT A WOLF
WILL BE THE FIRST OF
YOUR SACRIFICIAL LAMBS,

00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:08.821
BUT SO BE IT.

00:12:08.821 --> 00:12:11.957
[THINKING] AH,
THE SECOND OF MY 3
BLUE-EYES WHITE DRAGONS.

00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:13.525
JUST ONE MORE NOW,

00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:14.960
AND THEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.596
WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP ME
FROM VICTORY.

00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:19.932
SOON, WITH ONE
EARTH-SHATTERING BLAST,

00:12:19.932 --> 00:12:22.001
I'LL DEFEAT YUGI
FOR THE LAST TIME.

00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:23.602
AND ONCE I'VE FINISHED HIM,

00:12:23.602 --> 00:12:25.270
I'LL GO AFTER PEGASUS

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.475
AND RESCUE MY BROTHER
FROM HIS DEMENTED GRIP.

00:12:29.475 --> 00:12:32.044
BUT WHILE I'M WAITING
FOR MY THIRD BLUE-EYES,

00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:35.180
I'LL CLEAR THE FIELD
OF YUGI'S RABID BEAST.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.952
BATTLE OX, AWAKEN

00:12:39.952 --> 00:12:42.621
AND LET LOOSE
THE DOGS OF WAR!

00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:45.224
[GROWLING SOFTLY]

00:12:45.224 --> 00:12:46.158
HUNH.

00:12:46.158 --> 00:12:47.559
AXE SLAM-ATTACK!

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:49.361
[ROARS]
[HOWLS]

00:12:51.864 --> 00:12:54.099
YOUR PUPPY
HAS BEEN PUT DOWN.

00:12:54.099 --> 00:12:55.601
UNH!

00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.669
IT'S COOL.

00:12:56.669 --> 00:12:58.771
JUST A MINOR SETBACK,
NO BIG DEAL.

00:12:58.771 --> 00:12:59.872
[THINKING]
COME ON, YUGI.

00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:01.573
I KNOW YOU CAN WIN THIS.

00:13:01.573 --> 00:13:03.075
NO ONE'S EVER BEATEN YOU
IN A DUEL,

00:13:03.075 --> 00:13:04.576
AND NO ONE EVER WILL.

00:13:04.576 --> 00:13:06.111
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:13:06.111 --> 00:13:08.280
YOUR PITIFUL DEFENSES
CAN'T EVEN WITHSTAND

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.349
THE CRUDE ASSAULTS
OF MY BATTLE OX!

00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:12.785
HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO
PROTECT YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:13:12.785 --> 00:13:14.453
WHEN YOUR DEFENSES
ARE DEMOLISHED

00:13:14.453 --> 00:13:16.121
AND YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT
TO SHIELD YOU

00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:18.090
AGAINST MY EVEN MORE
POWERFUL MONSTERS?

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.826
I GUESS WE'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

00:13:20.826 --> 00:13:22.261
HA HA HA HA!
KAIBA'S RIGHT.

00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:24.096
BUT HOW CAN I DEFEAT
ANY MONSTER

00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:27.032
WHEN HIS CRUSH CARD
FORCES ME TO PLAY
MY WEAKEST CREATURES?

00:13:27.032 --> 00:13:29.401
YOU SHOULD ACCEPT YOUR FATE
FOR NOW, YUGI.

00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:32.004
AFTER ALL, YOU'LL HAVE
THE REST OF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

00:13:32.004 --> 00:13:33.706
TO BROOD OVER THIS DEFEAT.

00:13:33.706 --> 00:13:35.941
[THINKING] NO.
I CAN'T GIVE IN
TO HIS TAUNTING.

00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:37.943
I'VE COME HERE
TO RESCUE MY GRANDPA,

00:13:37.943 --> 00:13:41.313
AND I CAN'T LET
KAIBA DEFEAT ME.

00:13:41.313 --> 00:13:43.649
GRIFFORE!

00:13:43.649 --> 00:13:46.251
GO!
I SUMMON YOU!

00:13:53.225 --> 00:13:57.229
LET'S SEE YOU DEAL
WITH THIS ATTACK, KAIBA.

00:13:57.229 --> 00:13:59.198
HMM, A GRIFFORE.

00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:02.301
I THINK YOU'VE MADE
A GRAVE MISCALCULATION,
YUGI.

00:14:02.301 --> 00:14:04.303
HIS PATHETIC DEFENSES
ARE NO MATCH

00:14:04.303 --> 00:14:05.804
FOR MY BATTLE OX.

00:14:05.804 --> 00:14:06.939
HEH HEH HEH.

00:14:06.939 --> 00:14:08.774
WHOEVER SAID THAT
I WAS GOING TO BE

00:14:08.774 --> 00:14:10.809
PLAYING HIM IN
DEFENSE MODE, KAIBA?

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:12.144
HUH?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.713
I'M ATTACKING
WITH MY GRIFFORE...

00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:17.082
WITH THE HELP OF MY
HORN OF THE UNICORN.

00:14:17.082 --> 00:14:20.586
MAGIC LIGHTENING,
COMBO ATTACK!

00:14:20.586 --> 00:14:23.922
[ROARS]

00:14:23.922 --> 00:14:26.291
YOUR BATTLE OX
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

00:14:28.594 --> 00:14:29.695
ALL RIGHT!

00:14:29.695 --> 00:14:31.597
I'M FEELING A COMEBACK
IN THE WORKS.

00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:32.798
STELLAR MOVE!

00:14:32.798 --> 00:14:34.266
GOOD SHOW! THAT WAS
A BRILLIANT PLAY

00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:35.768
AT A CRITICAL
JUNCTURE.

00:14:35.768 --> 00:14:37.469
YEAH, YUGI,
GREAT MOVE!

00:14:37.469 --> 00:14:39.338
IMPRESSIVE, YUGI,

00:14:39.338 --> 00:14:40.606
USING A COMBO ATTACK

00:14:40.606 --> 00:14:42.708
TO COMBAT THE PERILS
OF MY VIRUS.

00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:45.611
BUT I'M AFRAID THAT THERE
ARE SOME HAZARDS IN MY DECK

00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:47.179
THAT ARE SIMPLY INEVITABLE.

00:14:48.313 --> 00:14:50.048
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:51.583
[THINKING] AT LAST!

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:55.053
NOW ALL I NEED IS
A POLYMERIZATION CARD
TO MERGE THEM ALL.

00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:57.723
PREPARE YOURSELF FOR
ULTIMATE ANNIHILATION, YUGI.

00:14:57.723 --> 00:15:01.126
BUT FIRST, I'M INVOKING
THE MYSTICAL ELF.

00:15:04.062 --> 00:15:05.597
Kaiba: YOU SEE, YUGI...

00:15:05.597 --> 00:15:07.766
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'VE LEARNED IN
MY MATCHES WITH YOU

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:09.601
IT'S THAT YOU HAVE
AN UNCANNY ABILITY

00:15:09.601 --> 00:15:12.070
FOR SNATCHING VICTORY
FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.274
BUT I DON'T INTEND TO GIVE YOU
SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY.

00:15:15.274 --> 00:15:17.442
WHICH IS WHY I'VE SUMMONED
THE MYSTICAL ELF

00:15:17.442 --> 00:15:19.011
TO REINFORCE
MY LIFE POINTS...

00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:21.213
BY 300.

00:15:21.213 --> 00:15:24.216
[THINKING]
I'VE NEVER SEEN KAIBA DUEL
SO METHODICALLY BEFORE.

00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.852
EVERY MOVE HE PLAYS
IS SO PRECISE.

00:15:26.852 --> 00:15:28.654
HE'S LEAVING NOTHING
TO CHANCE.

00:15:28.654 --> 00:15:29.955
IT'S AS IF TO HIM

00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:32.191
THIS WERE A BATTLE
OF LIFE AND DEATH.

00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:36.128
[THINKING]
SOON, LITTLE BROTHER.

00:15:36.128 --> 00:15:38.764
SOON I'LL HAVE COMPLETED
PEGASUS' TWISTED LITTLE TASK

00:15:38.764 --> 00:15:41.767
AND THEN NOTHING WILL STOP ME
FROM RESCUING YOU.

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:44.837
SOON.
ONCE I DEFEAT YUGI.

00:15:44.837 --> 00:15:46.238
BEHOLD...

00:15:46.238 --> 00:15:48.273
UNH, UHH!

00:15:48.273 --> 00:15:51.543
THE MIGHTY BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:15:51.543 --> 00:15:53.912
[ROARS]

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.349
[ROARS]

00:15:57.349 --> 00:15:58.417
[GASPS]

00:15:58.417 --> 00:15:59.484
All: OHH!

00:15:59.484 --> 00:16:02.487
NOW, YUGI,
YOUR FATE BELONGS TO ME.

00:16:02.487 --> 00:16:05.490
TAKE FLIGHT, BLUE-EYES
WHITE DRAGON! RISE!

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.559
[ROARS]

00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:11.930
GO,
WHITE LIGHTENING ATTACK!

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.399
[ROARS]

00:16:15.934 --> 00:16:16.969
UNH!

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.609
UHH!

00:16:30.078 --> 00:16:31.879
ALREADY MY BLUE-EYES
HAS YOU COWERING.

00:16:31.879 --> 00:16:33.615
AND THIS IS ONLY
THE BEGINNING.

00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:36.351
SOON, YOU WILL KNOW
WHAT FEAR IS.

00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:38.086
HMPH!

00:16:38.086 --> 00:16:40.088
I DON'T FEAR
YOUR BLUE-EYES, KAIBA.

00:16:40.088 --> 00:16:41.990
I'VE DEFEATED HIM
BEFORE.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.492
AND WITH MY GIANT
SOLDIER OF STONE
GUARDING ME,

00:16:44.492 --> 00:16:46.461
I'LL MANAGE
TO DEFEAT HIM AGAIN.

00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:49.063
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:16:50.798 --> 00:16:54.035
YUGI, WHEN YOU BATTLED
MY BLUE-EYES BEFORE,

00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:55.903
THEY WERE 3
SEPARATE DRAGONS--

00:16:55.903 --> 00:16:56.971
FORMIDABLE, YES,

00:16:56.971 --> 00:16:58.773
BUT NOT INVINCIBLE.

00:17:00.875 --> 00:17:03.378
BUT NOW I'VE FOUND A WAY
TO MERGE THEIR POWER,

00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:06.180
COMBINE THEIR ATTACK POINTS
TO CREATE...

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.383
UHH, UNH!

00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:11.052
A MONSTER WITH POWER
BEYOND IMAGINING!

00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:12.287
HUNH!

00:17:12.287 --> 00:17:14.722
NOW I CREATE A DUEL MONSTER
WITHOUT PEER...

00:17:14.722 --> 00:17:16.190
WITH ATTACK FORCE SO GREAT

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.360
THAT NO MONSTER
CAN STAND AGAINST HIM.

00:17:27.702 --> 00:17:29.137
[ROARING]

00:17:29.137 --> 00:17:31.372
I CREATE THE BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:17:31.372 --> 00:17:32.974
[ROARS]

00:17:32.974 --> 00:17:35.376
[THINKING] SO THAT'S WHY
HE DIDN'T PLAY HIS
BLUE-EYES AT FIRST.

00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:37.345
HE WAS WAITING TO MERGE
THEM ALL TOGETHER.

00:17:37.345 --> 00:17:38.913
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:38.913 --> 00:17:41.649
YUGI MOTO,
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

00:17:41.649 --> 00:17:44.819
NOTHING
CAN SAVE YOU NOW.

00:17:47.088 --> 00:17:49.290
THAT MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS
ARE OFF THE CHARTS.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.292
YEAH, HOW COULD
ANY CREATURE
IN YUGI'S DECK

00:17:51.292 --> 00:17:52.293
BEAT THAT THING?

00:17:52.293 --> 00:17:53.795
THAT KAIBA!

00:17:53.795 --> 00:17:55.963
HE'S BEEN SETTING YUGI
UP FOR THAT BEAST

00:17:55.963 --> 00:17:58.299
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:00.902
[ROARS]

00:18:00.902 --> 00:18:02.203
HEH HEH.

00:18:02.203 --> 00:18:03.838
YUGI IS DONE FOR.

00:18:03.838 --> 00:18:05.873
KAIBA HAD THAT LITTLE TWERP
ON THE ROPES,

00:18:05.873 --> 00:18:07.375
AND NOW THIS
ULTIMATE BLUE-EYES

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.143
IS GONNA KNOCK HIM
OUT OF THE RING.

00:18:09.143 --> 00:18:11.045
[THINKING] THIS
CAN'T BE THE END.

00:18:11.045 --> 00:18:12.113
IT JUST CAN'T.

00:18:12.113 --> 00:18:13.881
YUGI WILL FIND A WAY
TO COME BACK.

00:18:13.881 --> 00:18:15.383
I KNOW IT.

00:18:15.383 --> 00:18:17.885
[THINKING] KAIBA
HAS REALLY PLAYED
A BRILLIANT STRATEGY:

00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:19.487
SETTING ME UP
WITH THAT CRUSH CARD,

00:18:19.487 --> 00:18:21.589
HOLDING OUT FOR ALL 3
OF HIS BLUE-EYES,

00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:23.024
AND AT THE SAME TIME,

00:18:23.024 --> 00:18:25.693
WHITTLING DOWN
MY LIFE POINTS
TO A SPARSE 400.

00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:27.128
NOW HE'S GOT ME CORNERED

00:18:27.128 --> 00:18:29.530
AND STARING DOWN
THE TOUGHEST MONSTER

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.032
I'VE EVER FACED.

00:18:31.032 --> 00:18:33.801
YUGI, HOW I SAVOR
THIS MOMENT.

00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:36.037
THIS IS THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR

00:18:36.037 --> 00:18:37.538
EVER SINCE YOU HANDED ME

00:18:37.538 --> 00:18:39.974
MY FIRST AND ONLY
DUEL-MONSTERS DEFEAT.

00:18:39.974 --> 00:18:43.044
PREPARE YOURSELF
TO SEE THE POWER OF
MY CREATURE UNLEASHED.

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:44.278
HUNH!

00:18:44.278 --> 00:18:45.313
[ROARS]

00:18:45.313 --> 00:18:46.981
BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE WHITE DRAGON,

00:18:46.981 --> 00:18:48.983
NEUTRON BLAST ATTACK!

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:53.821
NO!
MY STONE SOLDIER!

00:18:55.223 --> 00:18:58.159
YOU'RE LUCKY
YOUR STONE SOLDIER
WAS IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:02.029
Joey: WHOA! AT LEAST
YUGI DIDN'T LOSE
ANY LIFE POINTS.

00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:04.031
[THINKING] STONE SOLDIER
WAS THE LAST OF MY DEFENSES.

00:19:04.031 --> 00:19:06.033
MY BLUE-EYES
ULTIMATE DRAGON

00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:08.369
ATOMIZED YOUR CREATURE
TO DUST, YUGI.

00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:10.538
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO STAND AGAINST IT.

00:19:10.538 --> 00:19:12.240
YOU SHOULD CONCEDE.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.242
HUH.

00:19:14.242 --> 00:19:15.309
NO, YUGI.

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:16.744
YOU CAN
WIN THIS.

00:19:16.744 --> 00:19:17.745
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:17.745 --> 00:19:19.113
WE ALL BELIEVE
IN YOU.

00:19:19.113 --> 00:19:21.048
YOU GOTTA REMEMBER WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTIN' FOR, YUGE--

00:19:21.048 --> 00:19:22.116
THE HEART OF THE CARDS,

00:19:22.116 --> 00:19:23.718
JUST LIKE YOUR GRANDPA
TAUGHT YOU.

00:19:23.718 --> 00:19:25.820
YOU'VE NEVER LET
ANYONE DOWN BEFORE,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.122
AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOUR GRANDPA DOWN NOW.

00:19:28.122 --> 00:19:29.223
UHH!

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.495
YUGI!

00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:37.532
[THINKING] GRANDPA,
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

00:19:37.532 --> 00:19:40.001
I HAVE TO KEEP
FIGHTING FOR YOU.

00:19:40.001 --> 00:19:41.002
HMM?

00:19:42.203 --> 00:19:44.372
NO, KAIBA.

00:19:44.372 --> 00:19:46.607
I WILL NEVER SURRENDER
TO THE LIKES OF YOU.

00:19:46.607 --> 00:19:48.009
THAT'S IT!

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:50.545
THAT'S THE KIND
OF DETERMINATION
I EXPECT FROM YOU.

00:19:50.545 --> 00:19:51.813
FIGHT ON.

00:19:51.813 --> 00:19:54.048
GATHER EVERY LAST BIT
OF YOUR STRENGTH, YUGI.

00:19:54.048 --> 00:19:55.383
I PREFER TO TAKE YOU DOWN

00:19:55.383 --> 00:19:57.051
WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING
YOUR HARDEST.

00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:58.686
[THINKING] EVERYTHING
RIDES ON THIS LAST CARD:

00:19:58.686 --> 00:20:00.388
THIS DUEL,
THIS TOURNAMENT,

00:20:00.388 --> 00:20:01.823
MY GRANDPA.

00:20:01.823 --> 00:20:03.257
BUT AS HOPELESS
AS IT SEEMS,

00:20:03.257 --> 00:20:05.460
I STILL HAVE TO BELIEVE.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.295
[THINKING]
GOOD LUCK, YUGI.

00:20:07.295 --> 00:20:09.063
[THINKING]
YOU CAN DO IT, PAL.

00:20:09.063 --> 00:20:10.097
[THINKING] BELIEVE.

00:20:11.132 --> 00:20:12.133
[ROARS]

00:20:12.133 --> 00:20:14.135
KICK BUTT, YUGE!

00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:16.404
[ROARS]

00:20:16.404 --> 00:20:17.638
IT COMES TO THIS.

00:20:17.638 --> 00:20:19.907
SO DRAW YOUR CARD
AND FACE YOUR FATE.

00:20:19.907 --> 00:20:22.076
[THINKING]
HEART OF THE CARDS,

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:23.478
GUIDE ME.

00:20:23.478 --> 00:20:25.546
LET'S FINISH THIS,
KAIBA!
