00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.946
HEY, YOU'RE ONLY
DUELING FOR THINGS.

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:38.447
BUT FOR
YOUR INFORMATION,

00:07:38.447 --> 00:07:40.850
SOME OF US FIGHT FOR
THE PEOPLE WE LOVE.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.151
YOU'LL SHOW HER, JOEY.

00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:44.086
SHOW HER WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO DUEL FROM THE HEART.

00:07:44.086 --> 00:07:45.087
DUEL!
DUEL!

00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:47.189
HMM...

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.691
SO TO START
THE GAME OFF,

00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:50.860
MASAKI,
THE LEGENDARY SWORDSMAN.

00:07:53.963 --> 00:07:57.833
THE FIELD POWER BONUS
WILL BRING HIS POWER
UP OVER 300 POINTS.

00:07:57.833 --> 00:07:59.802
HEY, I MADE
MY FIRST MOVE!

00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:00.936
HMM.

00:08:00.936 --> 00:08:02.738
MMM...

00:08:02.738 --> 00:08:03.839
HUH?

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:04.840
HMM?

00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:08.611
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:10.279
DIVINING MY CARD.

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:11.981
I HAVE
TO MYSTICALLY CHOOSE

00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:13.482
WHICH ONE
OF THEM'S THE BEST.

00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:16.385
HUH? WHAT ARE YOU,
A PSYCHIC?

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:19.221
AND THE BEST CARD
WOULD BE...

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:22.892
HMM. THE HARPY'S LADY!

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:31.634
HER STRENGTH IS BOOSTED
BY THE MOUNTAIN'S
FIELD POWER BONUS.

00:08:31.634 --> 00:08:32.835
I'LL STILL TAKE IT ON.

00:08:32.835 --> 00:08:35.004
ATTACK!

00:08:35.004 --> 00:08:37.006
[ROARING]

00:08:37.006 --> 00:08:38.540
JOEY, WAIT!

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.976
LAND MONSTERS ARE
AT A DISADVANTAGE
TO FLYING MONSTERS!

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.215
MONSTERS
THAT CAN FLY

00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:47.583
HAVE A MAGICAL
RESISTANCE

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.919
AGAINST MONSTERS
THAT CAN ONLY WALK
ON THE EARTH.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.587
SO JOEY BLEW IT
ALREADY?

00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:54.056
NO, BUT HE ATTACKED
TOO SOON--BEFORE
HE THOUGHT ABOUT

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:55.491
WHAT HER MONSTER
WAS CAPABLE OF.

00:08:55.491 --> 00:08:56.959
[SCREAMING]

00:08:58.227 --> 00:09:00.229
Joey: MY SAMURAI'S SUSHI!

00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:03.766
Mai: OH, CARDS,
SPEAK TO ME!

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:05.634
MMM...

00:09:05.634 --> 00:09:07.736
AND I'LL CHOOSE AGAIN

00:09:07.736 --> 00:09:09.338
WITHOUT LOOKING.

00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:11.473
HUH? HOW'S
SHE DOING THAT?

00:09:11.473 --> 00:09:12.741
HE'S
LOSING IT!

00:09:12.741 --> 00:09:15.411
GUESS THAT MOP HEAD
WASN'T FOR THIS DUEL.

00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:16.779
HEY, JOEY!

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:19.481
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE
DOING BEFORE YOU MOVE AGAIN!

00:09:19.481 --> 00:09:21.016
Joey: HOW CAN SHE
READ THE CARDS

00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:22.484
WHEN THEY'RE
LYING FACE DOWN?

00:09:22.484 --> 00:09:23.819
[LAUGHS]

00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:25.521
Mai: MY LITTLE CARD TRICK
HAS MADE THIS KID FORGET

00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:28.724
EVERYTHING HE EVER KNEW
ABOUT DUEL MONSTERS.

00:09:28.724 --> 00:09:32.061
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS JUST
KEEP PUSHING HIS BUTTONS.

00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:33.062
WHAT DO I DO?

00:09:33.062 --> 00:09:37.099
MAYBE THIS ONE,
TIGER AXE!

00:09:37.099 --> 00:09:40.069
MY FIELD POWER BONUS
SHOULD RAISE
ITS ATTACK POWER!

00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:43.072
SO IT CAN TAKE ON
THE HARPY'S LADY
HEAD TO HEAD.

00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:44.473
YOU'RE NOT THINKING!

00:09:44.473 --> 00:09:46.308
IT'S STILL RESISTANT
TO MAGIC!

00:09:46.308 --> 00:09:49.845
RIGHT. TIGER AXE
IS ANOTHER HANDICAPPED
EARTH-BASED MONSTER.

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:51.780
[SCREAMING]

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.248
[ROARS]

00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:56.151
AHH.

00:09:56.151 --> 00:09:58.587
HMPH. IT'LL TAKE
STRONGER MONSTERS

00:09:58.587 --> 00:10:01.657
THAN YOUR LAND-BASED WIMPS
TO BEAT MY HARPY'S LADY.

00:10:01.657 --> 00:10:03.258
NOW I'LL PLAY
THIS LOVELY CARD

00:10:03.258 --> 00:10:04.860
WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.995
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT.

00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:07.629
IT'S AN EQUIPMENT
MAGIC CARD

00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:10.466
THAT WILL HELP ME DEFEAT
<i>YOUR</i> NEXT CARD IN ONE TURN.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:12.601
AGAIN WITH ALL
THAT PSYCHIC STUFF?

00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:14.903
Joey: CAN SHE SEE
MY CARDS, TOO?

00:10:14.903 --> 00:10:16.405
SINCE I CAN'T SEE
WHAT SHE'S PLAYING,

00:10:16.405 --> 00:10:17.606
I GOTTA GET DEFENSIVE.

00:10:17.606 --> 00:10:20.609
RUNNING SCARED, HUH?

00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:22.644
WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU
MY SURPRISE--

00:10:22.644 --> 00:10:25.948
CYBER SHIELD, TO JUICE UP
MY HARPY'S LADY.

00:10:25.948 --> 00:10:27.950
[SHRIEKING]

00:10:35.057 --> 00:10:37.726
[GROWLS]
Joey: NO!

00:10:37.726 --> 00:10:39.461
HOW'S SHE DOIN' THAT?

00:10:39.461 --> 00:10:41.730
HA HA HA HA.
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.165
IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING,

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:45.334
THE NEXT CARD
YOU WERE THINKING OF
WON'T WORK EITHER.

00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:47.636
MAI HAS E.S.P.
IT HAS TO BE IT.

00:10:47.636 --> 00:10:49.138
I'M GONNA LOSE
THIS DUEL MATCH

00:10:49.138 --> 00:10:52.074
AND THE CHANCE
TO SAVE MY SISTER.

00:10:58.038 --> 00:11:00.307
HA HA HA.
THIS GAME IS MINE.

00:11:00.307 --> 00:11:02.209
YOU CAN'T WIN AGAINST ME.

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:04.011
SHE'S RIGHT.
SHE'S TOO MUCH FOR ME.

00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:07.181
SETTLE DOWN.
JOEY, REMEMBER WHAT
MY GRAMPA TAUGHT YOU

00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:09.183
ABOUT HOW TO PLAY
DUEL MONSTERS.

00:11:09.183 --> 00:11:10.517
DON'T LET HER
RATTLE YOU.

00:11:10.517 --> 00:11:12.219
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO PSYCH YOU OUT.

00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:15.455
HMM. STAY OUT OF THIS!

00:11:15.455 --> 00:11:17.491
HUH?
YOUR BRAINLESS
CHEERLEADING

00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:19.860
ISN'T GOING TO HELP <i>HIM</i>
AGAINST THE SUPERIOR POWER

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.361
OF MY HARPY LADIES.

00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:22.963
DON'T YOU GUYS GET IT YET?

00:11:22.963 --> 00:11:25.632
FRIENDSHIP DOESN'T
WIN DUELS, NEVER WILL.

00:11:25.632 --> 00:11:26.733
IT HASN'T HELPED HIM.

00:11:26.733 --> 00:11:28.335
HE'S DEFEATED,
AND HE KNOWS IT.

00:11:28.335 --> 00:11:29.570
NOT TRUE.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.738
NO? I BEG TO DIFFER.

00:11:31.738 --> 00:11:33.574
THERE CAN BE
ONLY ONE CHAMPION.

00:11:33.574 --> 00:11:35.175
ON THIS ISLAND,
IN THIS GAME,

00:11:35.175 --> 00:11:37.477
SOMEONE CAN BE
YOUR BEST FRIEND TODAY

00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:39.813
AND YOUR WORST ENEMY
TOMORROW.

00:11:39.813 --> 00:11:41.415
ONCE THE COMPETITION
FORCES YOU

00:11:41.415 --> 00:11:43.050
TO FACE EACH OTHER
IN A DUEL,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.285
WHERE'S YOUR FRIENDSHIP
THEN?

00:11:45.285 --> 00:11:46.787
HUH?
THAT'S WHY
THE ONLY PERSON

00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:49.289
A DUELIST CAN TRUST
IS HIMSELF.

00:11:49.289 --> 00:11:50.958
I HOPE THAT
YOUR DEFEAT TODAY

00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.793
TEACHES YOU
THAT LESSON, KID.

00:11:52.793 --> 00:11:54.461
GRR.

00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.629
HE'S LOSIN' IT!

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:57.931
HE NEEDS HELP.
YUGI, HELP HIM!

00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:03.070
Yugi: YU-GI-OHH!

00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:14.815
DON'T LISTEN TO HER, JOEY.

00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:16.049
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU

00:12:16.049 --> 00:12:18.752
JUST LIKE YOU'RE
ALWAYS THERE FOR US.

00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:20.320
HUH?
WHA--

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.588
TRUST ME ON THIS.

00:12:21.588 --> 00:12:23.690
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO DIVIDE AND CONQUER,

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.826
A STRATEGY THAT'S BEEN USED
FOR CENTURIES.

00:12:25.826 --> 00:12:27.427
BELIEVE ME. I KNOW.

00:12:27.427 --> 00:12:28.695
WHEN YOU GET THAT
LOOK IN YOUR EYE,

00:12:28.695 --> 00:12:30.998
I BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU SAY.

00:12:30.998 --> 00:12:32.766
HA HA HA HA.

00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:35.535
DO YOU REALLY THINK
YUGI WANTS <i>YOU</i> TO BE
THE GRAND PRIZE WINNER?

00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:36.904
HE'S A DUELIST, TOO,
YOU KNOW.

00:12:36.904 --> 00:12:39.039
TO WIN, YOU'LL EVENTUALLY
HAVE TO TAKE HIM ON.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:43.010
SHE'S RIGHT. WE WILL
HAVE TO DUEL, BUT--

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.312
YUGI, YOU'RE THE BEST
FRIEND I EVER HAD.

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:47.748
DON'T WORRY. WE'LL RESCUE
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:50.817
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.
WE'RE A TEAM.

00:12:50.817 --> 00:12:52.319
WE ARE A TEAM,

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:55.856
BUT I ALSO HAVE
TO WIN THE CONTEST
FOR SERENITY.

00:12:55.856 --> 00:12:57.224
I'M SENDING YOU THIS VIDEO

00:12:57.224 --> 00:13:00.160
JUST SO YOU DON'T FORGET
YOUR LITTLE SISTER'S FACE.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.396
IT SEEMS LIKE
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:04.031
TAKE CARE, JOEY.

00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:05.832
WHAT DO I DO?

00:13:05.832 --> 00:13:07.634
MAYBE YUGI'S RIGHT
ABOUT THIS THING.

00:13:07.634 --> 00:13:10.570
I HAVE TO STOP LISTENING
TO MAI'S NONSENSE

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.706
AND START USING MY HEAD.

00:13:12.706 --> 00:13:14.041
ARRGH!

00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.343
I JUST GOTTA CONCENTRATE
ON HOW TO WIN THE GAME.

00:13:21.581 --> 00:13:23.684
Joey: THERE'S GOTTA BE
A WAY TO BEAT MAI.

00:13:23.684 --> 00:13:25.052
IF I CAN JUST FIGURE OUT

00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:26.620
HOW SHE KNOWS
WHAT OUR CARDS ARE--

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.821
IF SHE'S NOT PSYCHIC,

00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:30.724
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHIN' ELSE SHE'S DOIN'.

00:13:30.724 --> 00:13:32.359
[SNIFFS]

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:35.996
WHAT'S THAT STRANGE SMELL?

00:13:35.996 --> 00:13:38.732
I NEVER NOTICED THAT SMELL
WHEN MY EYES WERE OPEN.

00:13:38.732 --> 00:13:40.600
I'M SMELLIN' A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT PERFUMES

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.502
COMIN' FROM...

00:13:42.502 --> 00:13:44.004

00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:45.105
HUH?!

00:13:45.105 --> 00:13:47.374
Mai: LET'S GO, KID.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:13:47.374 --> 00:13:48.375
THAT'S IT.

00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:50.577
I SEE THROUGH
YOUR CARD TRICK.

00:13:50.577 --> 00:13:53.280
HUH?!
YOU SPRAYED
ALL YOUR CARDS

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.483
WITH DIFFERENT PERFUMES,

00:13:56.483 --> 00:13:58.552
AND BY SMELLIN' EACH
DIFFERENT SCENT,

00:13:58.552 --> 00:13:59.920
YOU CAN TELL
WHICH CARD IS WHICH

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.788
EVEN WHEN
THEY'RE FACE DOWN.

00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:03.623
UH.
SO YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LOOK

00:14:03.623 --> 00:14:05.492
IN ORDER TO PLAY
YOUR CARDS.

00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:07.794
THAT WAY YOU CAN PSYCH
THE OTHER PLAYER OUT.

00:14:07.794 --> 00:14:10.163
NO WAY! HOW COULD
AN AMATEUR PUNK LIKE YOU

00:14:10.163 --> 00:14:12.099
SEE THROUGH
MY AROMA STRATEGY?

00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:13.400
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE!

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.002
I GOTTA ADMIT, MAI,

00:14:15.002 --> 00:14:18.138
YOU REALLY HAD ME
BUYIN' INTO THE WHOLE
PSYCHIC POWER SHTICK.

00:14:18.138 --> 00:14:19.673
I WAS TOO FREAKED OUT

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:21.475
TO THINK THINGS THROUGH
BECAUSE OF THAT,

00:14:21.475 --> 00:14:23.744
BUT YOU'RE NOT
A PSYCHIC AT ALL!

00:14:23.744 --> 00:14:25.412
YOU'RE JUST A BIG FAKE.

00:14:25.412 --> 00:14:26.646
ALL RIGHT, JOEY!

00:14:26.646 --> 00:14:28.648
GO GET HER, JOEY!
YOU THE MAN!

00:14:28.648 --> 00:14:30.484
YUGI, YOU WERE RIGHT!

00:14:30.484 --> 00:14:31.818
JUST BECAUSE
YOU SAW THROUGH

00:14:31.818 --> 00:14:33.053
MY LITTLE PSYCHIC ACT

00:14:33.053 --> 00:14:34.755
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE

00:14:34.755 --> 00:14:36.490
TO DEFEAT ME IN A DUEL.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.125
I THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:39.726
BEFORE YOU WERE WINNIN'
BY CONFUSING ME

00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:41.628
AND TRYIN' TO PIT ME
AGAINST MY FRIENDS,

00:14:41.628 --> 00:14:43.063
BUT NOW MY MIND IS CLEAR.

00:14:43.063 --> 00:14:44.264
I KNOW WHO I CAN TRUST.

00:14:44.264 --> 00:14:46.266
ALL YOU'VE GOT LEFT
IS YOUR CHEAP TRICKS,

00:14:46.266 --> 00:14:48.235
AND I WON'T FALL
FOR 'EM ANYMORE.

00:14:48.235 --> 00:14:51.004
UH.
I'M GONNA BLAST
YOUR HARPIES

00:14:51.004 --> 00:14:52.372
OUT OF THE SKY
WITH THIS.

00:14:52.372 --> 00:14:53.874
GOOD CARD, JOEY.

00:14:53.874 --> 00:14:55.442
Joey: BABY DRAGON.

00:14:57.778 --> 00:14:59.479
[HA-HA-HA-HA-HA]

00:14:59.479 --> 00:15:02.682
HA. THAT WIMPY CARD
IS YOUR GRAND PLAY?

00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:04.317
I ONLY WISH IT WAS
WORTH SOME MORE

00:15:04.317 --> 00:15:05.552
SO WHEN I DEVASTATE YOU,

00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:08.021
IT WOULD DO MORE DAMAGE
TO YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:11.358
MY CARD WILL BE
ELEGANT EGOTIST.

00:15:11.358 --> 00:15:15.062
ITS MAGIC
WILL MAKE DUPLICATES
OF MY HARPY'S LADY.

00:15:17.764 --> 00:15:18.999
OH, NO!

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:20.834
HARPY'S LADY 1...

00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:21.935
2...

00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:23.170
3.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.939
IT'S 3 TIMES
THE TROUBLE.

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:28.842
NOW WHAT? HE WAS
STRUGGLING WHEN
THERE WAS ONLY ONE.

00:15:28.842 --> 00:15:30.177
DON'T GIVE IN, JOEY!

00:15:30.177 --> 00:15:32.179
YOU'VE STILL GOT
ALL KINDS OF MOVES LEFT.

00:15:32.179 --> 00:15:33.947
REALLY? WHAT MOVES
WOULD THOSE BE?

00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:35.882
HOW WOULD I KNOW?
ASK AN EXPERT.

00:15:35.882 --> 00:15:37.050
ASK YUGI.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.419
IT'S JOEY'S DUEL.
HE HAS TO FIGURE IT OUT.

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:43.657
I DON'T HAVE ANY CARDS
STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAT
3 HARPY LADIES.

00:15:43.657 --> 00:15:47.527
HA! AND I'M GOING
TO KEEP USING THE MAGIC
OF ELEGANT EGOTIST

00:15:47.527 --> 00:15:50.897
TO DOUBLE MY HARPIES
AGAIN AND AGAIN EACH TURN.

00:15:50.897 --> 00:15:53.500
HA HA. BUT WHILE
MY HARPIES MULTIPLY

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.169
I CAN'T ATTACK YOU,
SO IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:15:56.169 --> 00:15:59.139
OF COURSE, YOU'LL SOON
BE UP AGAINST AN ARMY.

00:15:59.139 --> 00:16:00.307
AN ARMY OF HARPIES.

00:16:00.307 --> 00:16:02.843
HOW THE HECK
DO I FIGHT AN ARMY?

00:16:06.904 --> 00:16:08.606
SHE'S GOT A WHOLE ARMY.

00:16:08.606 --> 00:16:10.608
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO BEAT THAT?

00:16:10.608 --> 00:16:12.576
Yami Yugi:
DON'T GIVE UP, JOEY.

00:16:12.576 --> 00:16:13.844
HUH?

00:16:13.844 --> 00:16:15.446
THINK HARD
ABOUT HER STRATEGY.

00:16:15.446 --> 00:16:17.648
SHE'S BEEN USING
ONLY ONE MONSTER CARD

00:16:17.648 --> 00:16:19.283
AND STRENGTHENING
THAT ONE CARD

00:16:19.283 --> 00:16:20.851
WITH MANY MAGIC CARDS,

00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:22.453
BUT THERE'S A SERIOUS FLAW

00:16:22.453 --> 00:16:24.455
IN HER DUELING STRATEGY,
JOEY.

00:16:24.455 --> 00:16:27.124
USING MAGIC ON ONE CARD?
THAT'S TRUE.

00:16:27.124 --> 00:16:29.860
SHE'S JUST BEEN JUICING
UP THE HARPY LADIES
EVERY TURN,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.329
BUT IF SHE HAS
MOSTLY MAGIC CARDS,

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:33.698
MAYBE THE HARPY LADIES
ARE HER ONLY MONSTERS.

00:16:33.698 --> 00:16:35.533
I BET IF I CAN JUST
DEFEAT HER HARPIES,

00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:37.702
SHE WON'T HAVE ANY
MONSTERS LEFT TO PLAY.

00:16:37.702 --> 00:16:39.537
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY.
NOW THINK.

00:16:39.537 --> 00:16:42.707
WHAT CARD IN YOUR DECK
WILL HELP YOU WIN?

00:16:42.707 --> 00:16:45.109
WHICH OF MY CARDS?
YOU TELL ME.

00:16:45.109 --> 00:16:48.279
WAIT! I THINK
MAYBE YOU DID.

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:51.015
Yugi: SALAMANDRA AND
A KUNAI WITH CHAIN,

00:16:51.015 --> 00:16:53.451
BABY DRAGON AND
SHIELD AND SWORD.

00:16:53.451 --> 00:16:56.087
GREAT! WITH THESE
NEW MAGIC CARDS,

00:16:56.087 --> 00:16:57.688
COMBINED WITH
YOUR MONSTERS,

00:16:57.688 --> 00:16:59.123
YOU'LL HAVE
A REAL STRONG DECK.

00:16:59.123 --> 00:17:00.291
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:03.394
HERE, ADD THIS
TO YOUR DECK.

00:17:03.394 --> 00:17:06.263
IT CAN BE HELPFUL
IN A TIGHT SPOT.

00:17:06.263 --> 00:17:07.965
THE TIME WIZARD.

00:17:07.965 --> 00:17:09.467
THIS IS THE KIND OF
TIGHT SPOT

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:11.035
YUGI MUST'VE BEEN
TALKIN' ABOUT.

00:17:11.035 --> 00:17:12.703
NOW, IF I CAN
JUST REMEMBER

00:17:12.703 --> 00:17:13.771
WHAT GRAMPS TAUGHT ME

00:17:13.771 --> 00:17:15.606
ABOUT THE WAY TO USE
A MAGIC CARD.

00:17:15.606 --> 00:17:16.640
IT'S MY ONLY CHANCE.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.609
BUT DO I HAVE IT
IN MY HAND?

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:19.777
IF I HAD KNOWN HOW LONG

00:17:19.777 --> 00:17:21.345
IT WAS GOING TO TAKE YOU
TO MAKE A MOVE,

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:22.980
I WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT A MAGAZINE.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.417
UH-OH. THE TIME WIZARD'S
NOT IN MY HAND.

00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:27.985
I'LL HAVE
TO DRAW FOR IT.

00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:30.488
AHH, BUT WHAT IF
I DON'T GET IT?

00:17:30.488 --> 00:17:32.490
OHH, WHAT IF--

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.824

IS THAT THING?

DON'T YOU KNOW?

THE TIME WIZARD
CAN MAKE TIME
GO FASTER,

CAUSING
MY BABY DRAGON

TO GROW INTO

RIGHT, JOEY, AND THAT'S
NOT THE ONLY AFFECT

00:18:01.252 --> 00:18:03.054
