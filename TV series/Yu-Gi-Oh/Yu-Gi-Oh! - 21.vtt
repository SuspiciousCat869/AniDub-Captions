Announcer:
PREVIOUSLY ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:07.640
WHERE'S MOKUBA?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.910
IN PEGASUS' GRIP, JUST
LIKE YOU'LL SOON BE, KAIBA.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.711
IF YOU WANT
TO FIND YOUR BROTHER

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.347
BEFORE REINFORCEMENTS
ARRIVE, BETTER HURRY.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:17.950
MOKUBA!

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.218
I'VE GOTTA
GET HIM OUT OF HERE

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:20.686
AWAY FROM PEGASUS.

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:22.021
Para: YOU'RE TRAPPED!

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.689
Dox: AND THE DOORS
ARE ALL LOCKED.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:24.757
Both: HAH! WHOO! AH!

00:00:24.757 --> 00:00:26.158
YOU FACE THE BROTHERS...

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.127
PARADOX!
PARADOX!

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.396
ONE MERE DUELIST
WOULD BE CREAMED...

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.765
SO YOU MUST
DUEL AS A TEAM...

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.867
AND IF YOU
MANAGE TO WIN...

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.603
WHY, THEN, PUZZLING
NEW TESTS SHALL BEGIN.

00:00:37.603 --> 00:00:38.771
THE TEST, A CHOICE...

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.039
THAT YOU MUST MAKE!

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.475
Both: WHICH OF THESE DOORS
WILL YOU TAKE? HAH!

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.244
Joey: ME AND YUGI ARE
GONNA CLEAN YOUR CLOCKS.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.582
Para: MONSTER TAMER,
APPEAR NOW IN ATTACK MODE!

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.750
HYAH!

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.719
I PLAY MAGICAL HATS!

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.488
HATS, MATERIALIZE!

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.456
AS FOR OUR WARRIORS,

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.158
NOW YOU SEE THEM,

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:01.660
NOW YOU DON'T.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.363
YOUR LITTLE PLAN IS NOT
AS FOOLPROOF AS YOU THINK!

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.765
SANGA OF THUNDER
IS ONE OF 3 GODS

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:09.068
THAT CONTROL THUNDER,
WIND, AND WATER.

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:12.171
THE REMAINING 2 CARDS
ARE SUIJIN, GOD OF WATER,

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.406
AND KAZEJIN, GOD OF WIND.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:15.908
NO! THE TRINITY!

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.743
IT'S IN
THE CLASS OF EXODIA.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.712

KAZEJIN, BEGIN!

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.020
MELD YOUR POWERS
IN ETERNAL LIGHT.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.357
SHOW THESE FOOLS
YOUR UNSTOPPABLE MIGHT!

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:33.592
GATE GUARDIAN!

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:36.395
ALL YOUR MONSTERS ARE
TOO WEAK TO ATTACK OURS.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.831
GATE GUARDIAN,
USE YOUR IMMENSE POWER!

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.332
ATTACK FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.501
ELIMINATE HIM

HE COULD HAVE ESCAPED.

BUT, SIR, I'VE CHECKED
EVERY CORRIDOR.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.315
THEN STAND GUARD
BY HIS BROTHER'S CELL.

00:04:10.315 --> 00:04:12.051

IT WAS CREATED BY COMBINING
3 DIFFERENT MONSTERS, RIGHT?
SO?

TO DISMANTLING HIM.

YOU FOOL! ATTACK ONE SECTION
AND THE OTHERS WILL DEFEND IT.

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:03.902
YOU WASTED YOUR TURN.

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:06.405
NOW MY GUARDIAN
WILL LAY WASTE TO YOU!

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:08.107

OH, MY.
HUH?
HUH?

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:16.782
DOX IS USING
THE WATER ELEMENTAL SECTION
OF HIS GATE GUARDIAN

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:18.617
TO FLUSH OUT
THE ENTIRE MAZE.

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:20.986
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH
WILL BE ATTACKED.

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:22.955
THE MYSTIC PROPERTIES
OF THE MAGIC HATS

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.490
WILL PROTECT THE MAGICIAN,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.926
BUT I'M AFRAID
JOEY'S SWORDSMAN
WON'T BE AS LUCKY.

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.166
WE HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:35.167

DAMPENED THE FIELD,

OH, YOU
MUST BE JOKING!

00:06:00.348 --> 00:06:02.184
THAT SWORDSMAN
STARTED NOTHING

00:06:02.184 --> 00:06:03.985
BEFORE HE LEFT
CHOKING.

00:06:03.985 --> 00:06:05.153

00:06:05.153 --> 00:06:07.122
HMM. THAT'S
NOT QUITE TRUE.

IF IT
WEREN'T FOR HIM,

00:06:08.623 --> 00:06:09.958
THE STAGE
WOULDN'T BE SET

BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:15.584
YOU NOW FACE...

00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:17.719
THE SUPREME
BLACK SKULL DRAGON.

00:08:22.224 --> 00:08:25.227
YOUR GUY AIN'T
SO UNBEATABLE NOW, HUH?

00:08:25.227 --> 00:08:26.995
MMM. RIGHT.

00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:29.097
LET'S SEE
YOUR LABYRINTH STOP HIM.

00:08:29.097 --> 00:08:31.099
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:08:31.099 --> 00:08:33.101
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:34.603
HMM?
HMM?

00:08:34.603 --> 00:08:36.605
WHAT ARE
YOU TWO CLOWNS
LAUGHING ABOUT?

00:08:36.605 --> 00:08:39.074
YOU FOOLS! YOU THINK
YOUR NEW CREATURE

00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:40.709
WILL WIN
THE MATCH FOR YOU?

00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:41.910
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.446
THERE IS LITTLE
THAT YOUR CREATURE CAN DO,

00:08:44.446 --> 00:08:47.916
FOR THERE IS A MAZE RULE
THAT YOU MUST NOT HAVE KNOWN.

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:51.152
A RULE? OH, NO!

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:53.388
OH, YES,
AND THE RULE STATES

00:08:53.388 --> 00:08:55.991
THAT THE LABYRINTH
IS A NO-FLYING ZONE.

00:08:55.991 --> 00:08:57.659
AW, NUTS,

00:08:57.659 --> 00:09:00.262
AND MY RED EYES
BLACK DRAGON CAN
ONLY MOVE BY FLIGHT.

00:09:00.262 --> 00:09:01.463
THESE RULES STINK.

00:09:01.463 --> 00:09:03.965
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE AN ALTERNATE PLAN.

00:09:03.965 --> 00:09:06.334
AHH. I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

00:09:06.334 --> 00:09:09.104
YA HEAR THAT?
WE GOT A BACKUP PLAN.

00:09:09.104 --> 00:09:11.172
Para and Dox: HA HA HA HA!
Joey: UH, YUGI,

00:09:11.172 --> 00:09:12.741
WHY DON'T
THEY LOOK WORRIED?

00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:18.136
Joey: SO, UH,
WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:09:18.136 --> 00:09:20.104
THE BALD BROTHERS
ARE UP TO, YUGI?

00:09:20.104 --> 00:09:22.240
YOU MOCK US? HA.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.608
HA HA HA HA.

00:09:23.608 --> 00:09:26.177
BUT WITH THIS
NEXT CARD, I WILL
TRASH YOUR TEAM.

00:09:26.177 --> 00:09:27.645
HA HA HA HA.

00:09:33.017 --> 00:09:35.319
RIRYOKU!

00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:37.088
UGH. RIRYOKU?

00:09:37.088 --> 00:09:38.790
IT'S ALL GREEK
TO ME, PAL.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.925
RIRYOKU.

00:09:40.925 --> 00:09:43.828
IT'S A RARE
AND MIGHTY CARD, JOEY.

00:09:43.828 --> 00:09:46.964
TOO TRUE.
RIRYOKU'S LEGENDARY POWER

00:09:46.964 --> 00:09:49.801
ALLOWS ME TO TAKE HALF
OF MY OPPONENT'S LIFE POINTS

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:52.837
AND ADD THEM
TO ONE OF MY OWN
CREATURE'S ATTACK POINTS!

00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:54.005
NO FAIR!

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:55.439
YOU MIGHT AS
WELL BE STEALING!

00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:56.574
STAY STRONG!

00:09:56.574 --> 00:09:57.942
STAY STRONG?

00:09:57.942 --> 00:10:00.311
THE ONLY ONE ON THIS FIELD
WHO WILL BE STAYING STRONG

00:10:00.311 --> 00:10:01.546
IS OUR GATE GUARDIAN,

00:10:01.546 --> 00:10:03.614
FOR HE IS THE ONE
WE ARE POWERING UP

00:10:03.614 --> 00:10:04.982
WITH YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:10:04.982 --> 00:10:07.919
THAT'S LIKE CUTTING
THEIR CHANCES TO WIN
IN HALF.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.320
LUCKILY FOR YOU,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.955
USING
THE RIRYOKU CARD

00:10:10.955 --> 00:10:12.490
ENDS OUR TURN,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.692
BUT WHEN
OUR NEXT MOVE
IS AT HAND,

00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:17.595
WE WILL USE OUR
GATE GUARDIAN'S
NEWFOUND POWER

00:10:17.595 --> 00:10:20.598
TO WIN THIS DUEL
ONCE AND
FOR ALL. HA HA.

00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:22.733
HE WILL TURN YOUR MONSTERS
INTO SMEARS

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:24.435
ON THE LABYRINTH WALLS!

00:10:24.435 --> 00:10:26.437
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THEM, JOEY.

00:10:26.437 --> 00:10:28.072
I STILL HAVE A PLAN.

00:10:28.072 --> 00:10:29.774
FIRST, I DRAW.

00:10:31.542 --> 00:10:32.677
HMM.

00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:34.412
NEXT STEP,
MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:10:34.412 --> 00:10:36.380
WILL LEAVE THE SAFETY
OF THE MAGICAL HATS

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.982
AND RETURN TO THE MAZE.

00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:42.520
THEN HE'LL MOVE
6 SPACES FORWARD

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.022
AND OUT
OF YOUR LABYRINTH!

00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:46.424
YOU FOOL!

00:10:46.424 --> 00:10:48.793
WHY ARE YOU MOVING YOUR
DARK MAGICIAN OUT OF THE MAZE

00:10:48.793 --> 00:10:50.127
WHEN YOU KNOW
OUR GATE GUARDIAN

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:52.430
IS RIGHT THERE
JUST WAITING TO ATTACK?

00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:55.166
DOES IT MATTER?

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:56.901
YOU SEEM CERTAIN
HE'LL WIN

00:10:56.901 --> 00:10:59.003
REGARDLESS
OF WHAT I DO.

00:10:59.003 --> 00:11:00.471
Joey:
UH, YO, YUGE,

00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:03.007
NOT FOR NOTHIN',
BUT YOU WANT TO
FILL ME IN HERE?

00:11:03.007 --> 00:11:04.876
IT'S ALL RIGHT, JOEY.

00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:06.077
TRUST ME.

00:11:06.077 --> 00:11:07.078
Both: HA HA HA HA.

00:11:07.078 --> 00:11:09.914
FINALLY,
I PLAY THIS CARD.

00:11:09.914 --> 00:11:12.016
REBORN THE MONSTER!

00:11:12.016 --> 00:11:13.618
Para, thinking: NO MATTER
WHICH OF HIS MONSTERS

00:11:13.618 --> 00:11:15.019
HE REVIVES WITH THAT CARD,

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:16.854
IT WILL DO HIM NO GOOD.

00:11:16.854 --> 00:11:18.589
YOUR PLAN WILL FAIL!

00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:22.093
GATE GUARDIAN,
ATTACK THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:11:30.902 --> 00:11:32.870
Yugi: YOU ATTACKED
WITHOUT WAITING TO SEE

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.907
WHICH MONSTER I RESURRECTED
FROM THE GRAVEYARD PILE,

00:11:35.907 --> 00:11:37.408
SO YOU COULDN'T KNOW.

00:11:37.408 --> 00:11:39.677
YOU WASTED YOUR ATTACK.

00:11:39.677 --> 00:11:42.179
SUIJIN, TIDAL SHIELD!

00:11:44.015 --> 00:11:45.016
WHAT?
WHAT?

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:49.020
RECOGNIZE
THE MONSTER?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.489
YOU SHOULD, SEEING
AS HOW IT'S YOURS.

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.027
HE USED HIS REBORN
THE MONSTER CARD

00:11:56.027 --> 00:11:57.828
TO BRING BACK
OUR SUIJIN!

00:11:57.828 --> 00:12:00.031
ONLY NOW
HE'S NOT OURS.

00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:03.100
HE'S BEEN
BROUGHT BACK
ON THEIR SIDE.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.468
YEAH, YUGE!

00:12:04.468 --> 00:12:06.103
THAT'S
THE PLAY
OF THE GAME!

00:12:06.103 --> 00:12:09.407
OOH. THAT
WAS A CLOSE ONE.

00:12:09.407 --> 00:12:10.708
SURE WAS.

00:12:10.708 --> 00:12:13.711
HMM. NOW THE QUESTION IS
CAN THEY FOLLOW THROUGH?

00:12:13.711 --> 00:12:15.947
Para: YOU HAVE BEEN LUCKY,
YOU LITTLE LOUTS!

00:12:15.947 --> 00:12:19.083
BUT WE PROMISE YOUR LUCK'S
ABOUT TO RUN OUT.

00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:20.818
FINE,
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

00:12:20.818 --> 00:12:22.086
IT'S JOEY'S TURN.

00:12:22.086 --> 00:12:23.321
RIGHT.

00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.690
[THINKING]
OK. YUGI STARTED
OUR COMEBACK.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.091
NOW I GOTTA
KEEP IT GOING.

00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:30.227
[SIGHS, THINKING]
THAT WATER ELEMENTAL I REVIVED

00:12:30.227 --> 00:12:31.562
BOUGHT US SOME TIME,

00:12:31.562 --> 00:12:33.197
BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT OF IT.

00:12:33.197 --> 00:12:36.100
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO JOEY
TO KEEP US IN THIS DUEL.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.536
AND I KNOW
HE WON'T LET US DOWN.

00:12:42.406 --> 00:12:43.607
HMM.

00:12:43.607 --> 00:12:45.609
[THINKING]
COPYCAT?

00:12:45.609 --> 00:12:48.746
COPIES ONE CARD
YOUR OPPONENT'S
THROWN ON THE FIELD.

00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:49.947
HUH?

00:12:49.947 --> 00:12:51.716
OH.

00:12:51.716 --> 00:12:53.651
HUH? HEH HEH.

00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:55.786
AW, MAN, I JUST
GOT A KILLER IDEA.

00:12:57.822 --> 00:12:59.023
HERE IT GOES.

00:12:59.023 --> 00:13:02.960
I'LL USE COPYCAT AND
PLAY IT AS RIRYOKU!

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.962
AAH!
AAH!

00:13:04.962 --> 00:13:06.197
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:13:06.197 --> 00:13:08.466
SAY ADIOS
TO HALF OF YOUR
LIFE POINTS...

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:09.633
BUT DON'T WORRY.

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:11.435
THEY'RE GOING TO
A GOOD CAUSE--

00:13:11.435 --> 00:13:13.237
MY BLACK SKULL
DRAGON!

00:13:13.237 --> 00:13:16.273
GRR!

00:13:16.273 --> 00:13:17.608
GREAT MOVE, JOEY.

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:18.776
YEAH.

00:13:18.776 --> 00:13:20.611
WHY POWER UP YOUR DRAGON?

00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:22.880
HE IS STILL FORBIDDEN
TO FLY IN THE MAZE

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.648
AND THEREFORE CANNOT MOVE.

00:13:24.648 --> 00:13:26.984
IF YOU WERE SMART,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE USED IT

00:13:26.984 --> 00:13:28.719
ON THAT TREACHEROUS
WATER ELEMENTAL

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:30.488
BECAUSE IT'S HIM
I'M ATTACKING.

00:13:30.488 --> 00:13:32.289
THUNDERSTROKE, ATTACK!

00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:34.291
SUIJIN,
RAISE TIDAL SHIELD

00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:35.292
TO DEFEND!

00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:42.733
TO BE HONEST,
WE KNEW YOU WOULD DEFEND.

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:44.769
INDEED. NOW HIT HIM AGAIN!

00:13:49.106 --> 00:13:50.608
[SIGHS]

00:13:50.608 --> 00:13:52.376
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:13:52.376 --> 00:13:55.513
SUIJIN IS
ONLY ALLOWED TO USE
HIS TIDAL DEFENSE ABILITY

00:13:55.513 --> 00:13:56.981
ONCE PER TURN.

00:13:56.981 --> 00:14:00.818
SO THE PARADOX BROTHERS
SPLIT THEIR ATTACK
INTO 2 WAVES.

00:14:00.818 --> 00:14:03.754
YUGI, DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT ONE ELEMENTAL

00:14:03.754 --> 00:14:05.556
COULD STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST 2?

00:14:05.556 --> 00:14:08.259
THAT MISCALCULATION
WILL COST YOU THE DUEL.

00:14:08.259 --> 00:14:10.861
HA. I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:13.230
NOT ONLY DID I KNOW YOU
COULD DESTROY SUIJIN,

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.266
BUT I PLANNED
THAT YOU WOULD.

00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:16.367
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:17.968
ANYTHING TO DRAW
ATTENTION AWAY

00:14:17.968 --> 00:14:19.437
FROM
MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:14:19.437 --> 00:14:21.939
AFTER ALL,
IF I'M TO USE THIS
MONSTER REPLACE CARD

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:23.340
WITH OUR
BLACK SKULL DRAGON,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.176
I NEEDED SOMEONE
STRATEGICALLY PLACED

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:26.877
TO SWITCH PLACES
WITH.

00:14:26.877 --> 00:14:28.379
NO! HE CAN'T!

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:29.980
HE PLAYED US
FOR FOOLS,
BROTHER.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.148
KNOWING
THAT HIS DRAGON

00:14:31.148 --> 00:14:32.817
COULD NOT
MOVE WITHIN
OUR LABYRINTH,

00:14:32.817 --> 00:14:35.619
HE HAD HIS
DARK MAGICIAN
DO IT FOR HIM.

00:14:35.619 --> 00:14:37.121
AND NOW...

00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.023
MONSTER REPLACE!

00:14:39.023 --> 00:14:40.691
EXCHANGE
THE DARK MAGICIAN

00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:43.160
WITH THE BLACK SKULL
DRAGON!

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.162
AAH!
AAH!

00:14:45.162 --> 00:14:47.164
Yugi:
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
THE ONLY WAY

00:14:47.164 --> 00:14:49.967
TO BEAT
YOUR GATE GUARDIAN
WAS PIECE BY PIECE.

00:14:49.967 --> 00:14:52.236
BUT NOW WITH OUR
POWERED-UP DRAGON,

00:14:52.236 --> 00:14:56.407
WE CAN FINISH THIS
WITH ONE FINAL,
FEROCIOUS ASSAULT.

00:14:56.407 --> 00:14:57.908
BLACK SKULL DRAGON,

00:14:57.908 --> 00:15:00.478
MOLTEN FIREBALL
ATTACK!

00:15:09.453 --> 00:15:11.355
HA HA HA.
TAKE THAT.

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:12.957
THE DUEL GOES TO US.

00:15:12.957 --> 00:15:15.426
ALL RIGHT!
YEAH!
THEY WON!

00:15:15.426 --> 00:15:16.427
DOESN'T
THAT MEAN...

00:15:16.427 --> 00:15:17.962
OH, YEAH.
10 STARS!

00:15:17.962 --> 00:15:18.963
THEY DID IT?

00:15:18.963 --> 00:15:20.331
All: THEY DID IT!

00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.532
ALL FULL.

00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:24.068
AND ALL SET
TO DUEL PEGASUS.

00:15:24.068 --> 00:15:25.302
HA HA HA HA.

00:15:25.302 --> 00:15:26.337
NOT QUITE SET.

00:15:26.337 --> 00:15:28.072
Both: STILL ONE TEST YET.

00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:29.373
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

00:15:36.013 --> 00:15:36.981
[GRUNTS]

00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:38.949
HUH? WHAT WAS--

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:41.118
[GRUNTS]

00:15:48.659 --> 00:15:49.927
Kaiba: MOKUBA.
HUH?

00:15:49.927 --> 00:15:53.430
UH, SETO.
SETO, IT'S YOU.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.933
YEAH. IT'S ME.

00:15:55.933 --> 00:15:57.501
AH, SETO.

00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:00.938
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT YOU
WOULD COME AND RESCUE ME.

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:02.006
ALWAYS.

00:16:02.006 --> 00:16:03.474
LITTLE BROTHER.

00:16:03.474 --> 00:16:05.442
SO WHAT NOW?

00:16:05.442 --> 00:16:06.977
I BET YOU HAVE
SOME HIGH-TECH PLANS

00:16:06.977 --> 00:16:07.978
TO GET ME OUT OF--

00:16:07.978 --> 00:16:09.046
UHH, UNH.

00:16:09.046 --> 00:16:10.948
OH!
STAY STILL, KIDDO.

00:16:10.948 --> 00:16:13.617
OK. WHATEVER YOU SAY,
BIG BROTHER.

00:16:13.617 --> 00:16:16.020
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND
TO PICK THIS LOCK.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:18.289
Pegasus: WELL, WELL.
THE BROTHERS KAIBA,

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:20.257
REUNITED AT LAST.
HUH?

00:16:20.257 --> 00:16:23.260
BRAVO, KAIBA. BRAVO.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.763
I KNEW NOTHING WOULD
STOP YOU FROM GETTING HERE.

00:16:25.763 --> 00:16:27.565
PEGASUS.

00:16:31.794 --> 00:16:32.929
Joey: WHAT DO YA MEAN
THERE'S ANOTHER TEST?

00:16:32.929 --> 00:16:34.563
YUGI AND I JUST BEAT
YOU TWO IN A DUEL.

00:16:34.563 --> 00:16:35.998
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

00:16:35.998 --> 00:16:37.800
ENOUGH TO WIN
OUR STAR CHIPS,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.269
BUT NOT ENOUGH
TO ESCAPE THIS LABYRINTH.

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:42.705
YOU STILL MUST
CHOOSE A DOOR, REMEMBER?

00:16:42.705 --> 00:16:44.640
I REMEMBER.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.243
NOW, WHICH OF YOU BROTHERS
ARE GUARDING THE DOOR

00:16:47.243 --> 00:16:48.711
THAT LEADS OUT OF HERE?

00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:50.179
IF YOU CHERISH
YOUR LIVES,

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:52.114
YOU WILL CHOOSE MY WAY.

00:16:52.114 --> 00:16:54.884
SELECT MY SIDE
OR ELSE YOU'LL PAY.

00:16:56.118 --> 00:16:57.920
Téa: NOT
THIS GAME AGAIN.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.255
CAN'T YOU TWO
JUST ACT NORMAL

00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:01.123
AND GIVE US
A STRAIGHT
ANSWER FOR ONCE?

00:17:01.123 --> 00:17:03.426
Both: I AM GIVING YOU
A STRAIGHT ANSWER.

00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:05.995
THE ANSWER IS WE CAN'T
TRUST EITHER OF THESE TWO.

00:17:05.995 --> 00:17:08.431
OK, GUYS.
ANY BRIGHT IDEAS?

00:17:08.431 --> 00:17:10.433
Joey: UH, SURE.
DON'T I ALWAYS?

00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:11.434
All: MM-MMM.

00:17:11.434 --> 00:17:14.203
AW.
ZERO RESPECT.

00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:15.438
HMM.

00:17:15.438 --> 00:17:19.909
WE'LL DECIDE WITH THESE.

00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:21.177
Both: HA HA HA HA.

00:17:21.177 --> 00:17:22.912
OK. HEADS OR TAILS?

00:17:22.912 --> 00:17:24.613
NEITHER.
I MARKED EACH COIN

00:17:24.613 --> 00:17:26.349
TO REPRESENT
A DIFFERENT DOOR.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.851
THE COIN THAT I KEEP
CLENCHED IN MY FIST

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.853
WILL BE THE DOOR
THAT I HAVE CHOSEN.

00:17:30.853 --> 00:17:32.088
AH, KAIBA.

00:17:32.088 --> 00:17:33.856
I KNEW YOU'D
COME FOR MOKUBA
EVENTUALLY.

00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:35.124
OH, YOU DID?

00:17:35.124 --> 00:17:36.659
WELL, TELL ME
SOMETHING, PEGASUS.

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:38.160
DID YOU ALSO FORESEE

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.730
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO
TO YOU FOR HARMING
MY LITTLE BROTHER?

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.734
ACTUALLY, KAIBA,
I PREDICT YOU WON'T
LAY A FINGER ON ME.

00:17:44.734 --> 00:17:46.102
AND WHY IS THAT?

00:17:46.102 --> 00:17:47.737
HA HA HA HA HA.

00:17:47.737 --> 00:17:49.071
MMM.

00:17:50.106 --> 00:17:51.240
READY?

00:18:02.985 --> 00:18:05.554
THAT COIN IS MARKED
FOR DOX'S DOOR...

00:18:05.554 --> 00:18:07.156
BUT WAS
YOUR CHOICE GOOD

00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:08.591
OR WAS IT POOR?

00:18:08.591 --> 00:18:10.159
WHAT SAY YOU, DOX?

00:18:10.159 --> 00:18:11.594
SHALL WE TELL
WHICH WAS RIGHT?

00:18:11.594 --> 00:18:13.496
IN DUE TIME, PARA.

00:18:13.496 --> 00:18:15.064
I'M ENJOYING
THEIR PLIGHT.

00:18:15.064 --> 00:18:16.098
Joey: COME ON.
WAS IT PARA?

00:18:16.098 --> 00:18:17.166
Téa: OR WAS IT DOX?

00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:18.567
Tristan: YEAH, FESS UP!

00:18:22.605 --> 00:18:23.739
I SAY...

00:18:23.739 --> 00:18:24.840
YOU CHOOSE WRONG!

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.275
IT WAS MY DOORWAY...

00:18:26.275 --> 00:18:27.510
ALL ALONG!

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.145
Both: HA HA HA HA.

00:18:29.145 --> 00:18:31.280
Téa: SO DOX'S DOOR
WAS THE RIGHT ONE?

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.448
NOT QUITE.

00:18:32.448 --> 00:18:34.450
HUH? OH, YES, IT WAS.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.018
EXCEPT
IF WE HAD PICKED IT,

00:18:36.018 --> 00:18:38.621
PARA'S DOOR
WOULD BE THE RIGHT ONE.

00:18:38.621 --> 00:18:41.991
YOU CAN CHANGE WHICH DOOR
LEADS TO WHICH PATH,
CAN'T YOU,

00:18:41.991 --> 00:18:44.493
ENSURING
THAT WE CHOOSE WRONG.

00:18:44.493 --> 00:18:45.661
THAT'S
NO FAIR.

00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:47.363
YOU GUYS
CHEATED.

00:18:47.363 --> 00:18:49.765
TOO BAD. TOO LATE.
YOU CHOSE A WAY

00:18:49.765 --> 00:18:50.766
AND THAT MEANS...

00:18:50.766 --> 00:18:52.735
IN THIS MAZE
YOU WILL STAY.

00:18:52.735 --> 00:18:56.872
WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU NEVER SAW OUR CHOICE.

00:18:56.872 --> 00:18:59.208
Joey:
THE DOX COIN!

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:02.511
I FIGURED THE TWO OF YOU
WOULD PULL A STUNT
LIKE THIS,

00:19:02.511 --> 00:19:05.581
SO I PULLED A STUNT OF
MY OWN WITH THESE 2 COINS.

00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:08.717
INSTEAD OF MARKING THEM BOTH
WITH JUST ONE DOOR INSIGNIA,

00:19:08.717 --> 00:19:10.586
I MARKED
THE SECOND COIN WITH 2.

00:19:10.586 --> 00:19:12.922
ONE INSIGNIA ON EACH SIDE.

00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:15.357
THAT WAY, WE COULDN'T LOSE.

00:19:15.357 --> 00:19:17.460
HA! BEAT YA
AT YOUR OWN GAME.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.828
BOTH OF THEM.

00:19:18.828 --> 00:19:21.630
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,
WE HAVE A SCORE TO SETTLE

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.232
WITH YOUR BOSS.

00:19:23.232 --> 00:19:25.334
Joey: ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:19:25.334 --> 00:19:27.536
ON TO PEGASUS' CASTLE.

00:19:29.405 --> 00:19:31.841
Kaiba:
YOU CONNIVING SNAKE.

00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:33.509
I SHOULD TAKE YOU DOWN
RIGHT NOW

00:19:33.509 --> 00:19:35.411
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO MOKUBA.

00:19:35.411 --> 00:19:38.380
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS,
KAIBA BOY.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.317
IN MY DUNGEON,
IN MY CASTLE,
IN MY REALM,

00:19:41.317 --> 00:19:42.852
THE ONLY ONE
WHO MAKES THREATS...

00:19:42.852 --> 00:19:44.854
IS ME.

00:19:44.854 --> 00:19:46.856
[GRUNTS]

00:19:46.856 --> 00:19:49.325
Mokuba: AAH!

00:19:52.328 --> 00:19:53.329
MOKUBA?

00:19:55.865 --> 00:19:58.000
[SNICKERING]

00:20:00.102 --> 00:20:01.370
YOU MONSTER!

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.371
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:03.472
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO HIM?

00:20:03.472 --> 00:20:05.941
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
MAGIC TRICK.

00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:08.177
TELL ME,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:20:08.177 --> 00:20:10.179
I'VE ENSURED
YOUR COOPERATION,

00:20:10.179 --> 00:20:11.380
FOR, YOU SEE,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.315
MOKUBA'S SOUL
IS NOW IMPRISONED

00:20:13.315 --> 00:20:16.085
IN A PLACE
WHERE THE LOCKS
CAN'T BE PICKED.

00:20:16.085 --> 00:20:17.119
YOU'RE MAD!

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:18.420
AND THERE
HE WILL REMAIN,

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.421
KAIBA BOY,

00:20:19.421 --> 00:20:21.056
UNTIL YOU BEAT ME
IN A DUEL.

00:20:21.056 --> 00:20:23.025
DUEL?
WITH YOU? NOW?

00:20:23.025 --> 00:20:24.793
FINE.
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

00:20:24.793 --> 00:20:27.229
MM-MMM.
NOT JUST YET, KAIBA.

00:20:27.229 --> 00:20:29.765
YOU MUST FIRST
EARN THE PRIVILEGE
TO CHALLENGE ME,

00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:31.066
AND YOU CAN
ONLY DO THAT

00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:33.302
BY DEFEATING YUGI
IN A DUEL.

00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:36.138
AND IF YOU CAN'T
WIN AGAINST HIM,

00:20:36.138 --> 00:20:41.510
MOKUBA'S SOUL WILL
STAY MINE FOREVER.
HA HA HA HA HA.
