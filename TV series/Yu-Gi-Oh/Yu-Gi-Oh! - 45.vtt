00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.159
INCOMING!

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.627
[BUZZING]

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.229
STAND STRONG.

00:08:49.229 --> 00:08:51.097
GO, MIRROR FORCE!

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.471
Mai: THAT FIRE--

00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.975
IT'S DISTURBING THE COCOONS.
THEY'RE HATCHING!

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.812
AND THEY'RE FULL
OF MORE CREATURES!

00:09:05.812 --> 00:09:07.714
Joey: OH, MAN, NO WAY
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.482
TO TAKE DOWN
ALL OF THEM GREAT MOTHS.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:11.317
NO. IT CAN BE DONE,
JOEY.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:12.719
WITH THESE!

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:18.558
A KURIBOH?
ON A CATAPULT!

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.961
NOT JUST A KURIBOH--
BUT A TEAM OF THEM.

00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:23.897
GET READY
FOR SOME FIREWORKS!

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:25.565
GO, MULTIPLY!

00:09:32.539 --> 00:09:34.240
Joey: OH, YEAH.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.243
KURIBOHS SELF-DESTRUCT
ON CONTACT WITH ENEMY MONSTERS.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.313
THOSE MOTHS ARE DONE FOR.

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:42.048
YEAH!
YEAH!

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.653
Big One: IT'S TIME WE TERMINATE
THIS RESCUE MISSION

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:48.955
AND TAKE THIS GAME
TO ITS FINAL LEVEL.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:53.793
Joey: WOW. FROM CREEPY FOREST
TO CREEPY CAVERN.

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:56.429
AND STILL NO TRACE
OF KAIBA AND MOKUBA.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.665
WHOA, YOU GUYS
HEAR THAT?

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.400
THERE IT IS AGAIN!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.436
SOMETHING'S
DEFINITELY UP THERE.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.638
AAH!

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:11.010
A BLUE EYES!

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:15.915
Joey: KAIBA, MOKUBA,
YOU'RE OK!

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.250
WHAT A RELIEF!

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.651
WE'VE BEEN
ALL WORRIED.

00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:20.320
HMM.
JOEY, YOU LOOK LIKE

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.155
AN OVERGROWN MONKEY
IN THAT OUTFIT.

00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:24.157
OVERGROWN MONKEY?
THAT'S THE THANKS

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:26.392
I GET FOR COMING
TO RESCUE--HUH?

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.828
Big One, chuckling:
CONGRATULATIONS, GAMERS.

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:30.730
YOU'VE MADE IT
TO THE FINAL LEVEL.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.999
HMM. CORRECTION,
YOU SLIME BALL.

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.400
WE'VE BEATEN THE GAME.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.437
Big One: OH, IS THAT WHAT
YOU THINK, SETO KAIBA?

00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:39.439
THAT'S RIGHT.
I ESCAPED THE LAVA POOL.

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:41.574
THEREFORE THE MYTHIC
DRAGON WASN'T SUMMONED.

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.943
THAT MEANS
THIS GAME IS OVER.

00:10:43.943 --> 00:10:47.147
Big Three, chuckling:
IT WILL BE GAME OVER, ALL RIGHT.

00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:50.316
BUT FOR YOU, NOT US.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.317
NO WAY.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:52.886
HUH?
WHAT IS THIS?

00:10:52.886 --> 00:10:54.587
Kaiba: THEY'VE
REWRITTEN THE PROGRAM.

00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:57.490
THEY'RE SUMMONING
THE MYTHIC DRAGON THEMSELVES!

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:01.427
[ROARING]

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.829
Joey: OH, MAN.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.765
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
STAY CLOSE.

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:08.935
WE'LL WIN TOGETHER,
OR TOGETHER WE'LL FALL.

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.941
Joey: MAN, HAVE I HAD IT

00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:16.743
WITH THIS
VIRTUAL REALITY STUFF.

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:18.444
RESCUING KAIBA
WAS ONE THING,

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:20.880
BUT NOW WE GOTTA DEAL WITH
THIS MYTHIC DRAGON, TOO?

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.583
I'M REALLY STARTING
TO MISS MY BODY.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:24.951
SUCK IT UP!

00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.387
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
WE CAN GET OUT OF THIS GAME.

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:28.621
I AGREE.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.623
WE HAVE TO TAKE
THIS DRAGON DOWN.

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:32.392
All: LET'S GO.

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:33.860
Mai: ME FIRST.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.430
AND I CALL OUT
THE HARPIE LADY SISTERS!

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:41.568
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:44.204
Big One, chuckling:
JUST ANOTHER BIT

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.806
OF REPROGRAMMING
THAT WE DID.

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:49.542
Big Three: WE CALL IT
THE DRAGON'S SEAL,

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.578
AND IT MAKES THIS LAIR
A SACRED PLACE

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:54.614
WHERE ONLY DRAGON CLASS MONSTERS
ARE ALLOWED TO ATTACK.

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:57.584
EVERY OTHER MONSTER TYPE
IS USELESS.

00:11:57.584 --> 00:11:59.652
[LAUGHING]

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:04.390
YOU DARE CHALLENGE ME
TO A BATTLE OF DRAGONS?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.726
YOU FIVE SHOULD ALL KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.129
I CALL THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:12:10.129 --> 00:12:11.664
[ROAR]

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:13.666
ONLY DRAGONS, HUH?
FINE!

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.368
GO, RED EYES!

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.872
HARPIE'S PET DRAGON!

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:26.579
AND I SUMMON,
CURSE OF DRAGON!

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.214
Yami Yugi: YOUR MYTHIC DRAGON

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:31.551
WILL NOT STAND AGAINST
ALL WE HAVE SET AGAINST IT.

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:32.885
All: ATTACK!

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.126

NONE OF OUR ATTACKS
EVEN GOT THROUGH.

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.239
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:55.008
THOSE BLASTS MUST HAVE
CANCELED EACH OTHER OUT

00:12:55.008 --> 00:12:56.442
WHEN THEY ALL COLLIDED.

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:58.111
Big One: SO THEY DID.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:00.380
BUT ONE OF YOUR TEAM
HAS NO DRAGON

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.182
WITH WHICH
TO ATTACK OR DEFEND.

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.385
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MOKUBA?

00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:06.853

HIS RED EYES TAKE THE HIT,

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.399
BUT THAT MEANS--

00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:32.845
DON'T SAY THAT.

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.180
STAY WITH US,
PLEASE.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.348
YOU CAN'T GO.

00:13:35.348 --> 00:13:37.350
HEH HEH HEH.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.386
WE'VE LOST HIM.

00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:43.890
JOEY!
HE'S LEFT US.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.893
YOU CREEPS! WHAT KIND
OF SICK, TWISTED GAME

00:13:46.893 --> 00:13:48.394
HAVE YOU TURNED THIS
INTO?

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:50.630
GAME? HA HA HA HA.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.900
THIS CEASED TO BE
A GAME LONG AGO.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.435
WE NEED A NEW TACTIC.

00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:58.538
YES. WITH OUR DRAGONS
ALONE, WE WON'T WIN THIS.

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:00.373
BUT I THINK I KNOW
HOW WE CAN.

00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:01.674
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:04.043
AS STRONG AS THAT
MYTHIC DRAGON MIGHT BE,

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:06.179
THERE'S ONE CREATURE
THAT CAN BEAT IT.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.780
HUH?

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.384

I SUMMON YOU

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:14.287

HA HA HA HA.

00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:32.004
WEREN'T YOU LISTENING
TO WHAT WE JUST SAID?

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:35.541
YOUR BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER
IS NOT A DRAGON.

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.410
THEREFORE HE CAN'T ATTACK!

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.247
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
WE CAN STILL ATTACK HIM.

00:14:41.247 --> 00:14:42.548
NO, YOU CAN'T.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.417

THEN YOU'LL PAY THE PRICE.

00:14:50.423 --> 00:14:54.927
MAI! ALONE HER DRAGON
COULDN'T STAND AGAINST IT,

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.596
WHICH MEANS...

00:14:56.596 --> 00:14:57.997
NO!

00:14:57.997 --> 00:15:00.733

I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.668
TO SEE HOW THIS WHOLE
THING TURNS OUT.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.405

I TRIED MY BEST.

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:08.941

IT'S UP TO YOU.

NOW, KAIBA, THIS MAY BE
OUR ONE CHANCE.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.622
WE HAVE TO WORK AS A TEAM.

00:15:22.622 --> 00:15:25.491
NO WAY. YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.627
YOU JUST HAVE TO
TRUST ME, KAIBA!

00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:29.796
I DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING, YUGI.

00:15:29.796 --> 00:15:31.964
I CAN WIN THIS BATTLE
IN MY OWN WAY.

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.332

YOU'LL WIN NOTHING.

00:15:33.332 --> 00:15:35.368

ARE ALREADY GONE.

TO DEFEAT THIS BEAST.

WE CAN AVENGE OUR FRIENDS.
