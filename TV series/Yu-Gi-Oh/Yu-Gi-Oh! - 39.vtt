DUEL MONSTERS!

00:08:23.134 --> 00:08:24.869
AND WITH
THE MAGICIAN
OF BLACK CHAOS,

00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:27.271
I WILL AVENGE
MY FALLEN FRIEND.

00:08:32.243 --> 00:08:33.711
FACE IT, PEGASUS.

00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:34.979
YOU'RE THROUGH.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:37.248
NO CARD IN YOUR DECK
CAN SAVE YOU NOW!

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:39.850
YUGI'S LAST ACT
OF COURAGE
WILL FINISH YOU!

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.886
[THINKING]
AS POWERFUL AS
THAT CREATURE MAY BE,

00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:43.621
IT MATTERS NOT!

00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:46.157
FOR IN ONE TURN,
THAT BRAIN CONTROL
CARD WILL EXPIRE,

00:08:46.157 --> 00:08:49.660
AND I WILL REGAIN
COMMAND OVER RELINQUISHED.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:54.165
THE POWER TO ABSORB
AND ASSIMILATE MONSTERS
WILL BE MINE AGAIN!

00:08:54.165 --> 00:08:56.934
AND WITH IT,
I'LL STEAL THAT MAGICIAN
OF BLACK CHAOS

00:08:56.934 --> 00:08:59.303
AND HIS POWERS!
[LAUGHING]

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:02.473
INSTEAD OF BEING
THIS FOOL'S DELIVERANCE,
HE'LL BE HIS UNDOING!

00:09:02.473 --> 00:09:04.008
[LAUGHING]

00:09:04.008 --> 00:09:07.311
[ALOUD] YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT CHAOS MAGE!

00:09:07.311 --> 00:09:09.613
I THINK HE WILL
BRING ABOUT THE END
OF THIS MATCH.

00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:11.682
AND A LOT SOONER
THAN YOU MAY THINK!

00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:13.017
WE'LL SEE!

00:09:14.418 --> 00:09:16.353
WE WILL, INDEED!

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.592
[THINKING]
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:25.929
NOW, TO COMPLETE
MY STRATEGY,
I PLAY THIS.

00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:28.831
[GROWLS]

00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:31.467
AND ALSO ONE
MONSTER CARD
IN DEFENSIVE MODE.

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:35.338
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:41.544
[THINKING] HMM.
2 CARDS FACEDOWN. CLEVER BOY.

00:09:41.544 --> 00:09:44.247
HE KNOWS THAT WHEN
RELINQUISHED IS BACK
UNDER MY CONTROL,

00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:46.983
I'LL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIMILATE HIS MONSTERS!

00:09:46.983 --> 00:09:48.551
THOSE CARDS HE THREW
MUST BE PART

00:09:48.551 --> 00:09:50.987
OF A STRATEGY
TO TRY AND STOP ME.

00:09:50.987 --> 00:09:52.855
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:56.025
AND THE EFFECTS
OF YOUR TURN ARE OVER.

00:09:56.025 --> 00:09:59.662
NOW, YOUR BRAIN CONTROL SPELL
HAS EXPIRED, AND RELINQUISHED

00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:03.866
IS BACK WHERE HE BELONGS:
WITH HIS DADDY. [SNICKERS]

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.669
AND EVEN WITH YOUR 2 MYSTERY
CARDS OUT ON THE FIELD,

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:10.573
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT
HE'S JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS EVER.

00:10:10.573 --> 00:10:12.075
HUMPH.

00:10:12.075 --> 00:10:14.744
[THINKING] THAT IS, AFTER I
MAKE A SMALL ADDITION TO HIM

00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:19.816
AND CREATE THE MOST SINISTER
BEAST MY DECK CAN PRODUCE!
[LAUGHS]

00:10:19.816 --> 00:10:24.287
THEN I'LL CRUSH THIS FOOL
AND MAKE HIM REGRET
EVER TRIFLING WITH MY POWERS.

00:10:24.287 --> 00:10:27.690
IF YOU THINK
YOU HAVE RELINQUISHED
ALL FIGURED OUT...

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.593
THINK AGAIN.
BECAUSE I'M USING
MY POLYMERIZATION CARD

00:10:30.593 --> 00:10:32.562
TO FUSE HIM
WITH THOUSAND EYES IDOL!

00:10:32.562 --> 00:10:36.366
NOW PREPARE YOURSELF FOR
THE ULTIMATE MERGED MONSTER!

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:38.968
OH, YES!

00:10:38.968 --> 00:10:41.037
BEHOLD MY BEAUTY!

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:46.109
WITH THE THOUSAND EYES IDOL
AND RELINQUISHED FUSED TOGETHER,

00:10:46.109 --> 00:10:51.314
I'VE CREATED THE ONE, THE ONLY:
THE THOUSAND EYES RESTRICT!

00:10:52.982 --> 00:10:54.517
HE'S QUITE
A LOOKER, EH?

00:10:54.517 --> 00:10:55.652
HUH?

00:10:55.652 --> 00:10:58.221
IF YOU THINK HE'S
A REAL STUNNER NOW,

00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:03.926
WELL, JUST WAIT UNTIL ALL
1,000 OF HIS EYES OPEN UP!

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:05.928
THEN I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THAT HE'S MUCH MORE

00:11:05.928 --> 00:11:09.599
THAN JUST A PRETTY FACE!
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:12.669
Téa: KEEP IT UP,
GUYS. WE HAVE TO
STAY STRONG FOR YUGI!

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:15.171
Tristan: WE'RE NOT LETTING UP,
TéA, NOT UNTIL HE'S HOME SAFE.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.508
[THINKING]
COME ON, YUGE.

00:11:18.508 --> 00:11:22.312
I KNOW
YOU CAN DO THIS.
WE'RE WITH YOU, PAL.

00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:26.549
[THINKING] WE WON'T
GIVE UP ON YOU, YUGI.
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

00:11:26.549 --> 00:11:30.086
[THINKING] YUGI,
WE BELIEVE IN YOU,
LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE.

00:11:30.086 --> 00:11:32.755
WE BELIEVE IN YOU
WITH ALL OUR HEARTS.

00:11:36.059 --> 00:11:40.763
[PEGASUS CHUCKLES]
THE END IS TRULY IN SIGHT,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:44.500
GRR. NOT WITH
MY CHAOS MAGE
PROTECTING ME!

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.036
[CHUCKLES] OH, I THINK
YOU'LL FIND THAT ONCE

00:11:47.036 --> 00:11:49.405
ALL EYES ARE ON YOUR
MAGICIAN OF BLACK CHAOS,

00:11:49.405 --> 00:11:54.243
HE WON'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO PROTECT HIMSELF!
[LAUGHS]

00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:57.814
OH, TRUST ME. YOU'LL SEE
WHAT I MEAN VERY SHORTLY.

00:11:57.814 --> 00:11:59.482
[THINKING] HMM...

00:11:59.482 --> 00:12:03.686
SOON, EVERY EYEBALL
ON MY THOUSAND EYES RESTRICT
WILL OPEN UP,

00:12:03.686 --> 00:12:06.356
AND ALL THE MONSTERS
YUGI HAS ON THE FIELD

00:12:06.356 --> 00:12:09.892
WILL BE PARALYZED,
UNABLE TO ATTACK OR DEFEND.

00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:12.061
THEN NOTHING WILL STOP ME
FROM ASSIMILATING

00:12:12.061 --> 00:12:16.532
THAT CHAOS MAGE
AND WINNING THIS DUEL
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:12:17.934 --> 00:12:19.802
Yami Yugi:
I MAY NOT KNOW WHAT
PEGASUS IS PLANNING

00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:22.271
TO DO WITH THAT
MONSTROSITY OF HIS,

00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:26.142
BUT WHATEVER
IT MAY BE, I CAN'T
LET IT HAPPEN,

00:12:26.142 --> 00:12:28.911
NOT AFTER
THE TREMENDOUS ACT
OF BRAVERY YUGI MADE

00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:31.247
TO GIVE US
A FIGHTING CHANCE
AGAINST PEGASUS.

00:12:32.749 --> 00:12:35.585
[THINKING] WE BOTH
HAVE TO TRUST IN
THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:12:35.585 --> 00:12:41.624
[GROANING] THIS NEXT
CARD THAT I PULL
MIGHT BE MY LAST!

00:12:41.624 --> 00:12:44.427
PLEASE, MAKE IT ONE
THAT CAN DEFEAT PEGASUS!

00:12:48.097 --> 00:12:49.165
[GROANS]

00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:52.435
[THINKING] YUGI
RISKED EVERYTHING TO
GIVE ME THIS CHANCE.

00:12:52.435 --> 00:12:54.904
I CAN'T LET HIS
LAST HEROIC EFFORT
BE IN VAIN.

[CHUCKLES]

00:12:56.906 --> 00:12:58.608
PEGASUS, YOU CAN
DO YOUR WORST,

00:12:58.608 --> 00:13:00.042
BUT THIS DUEL
WILL BE WON

00:13:00.042 --> 00:13:02.745

PICKED IN HIS FINAL
ACT OF COURAGE.

00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:17.693
Yami: CHAOS MAGE!
PREPARE YOURSELF.
TRY TO HOLD HIM OFF.

00:13:17.693 --> 00:13:21.464
THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO
TO HOLD THIS ATTACK OFF.

00:13:21.464 --> 00:13:25.468
FOR, NOW I UNLEASH
THE THOUSAND EYES SPELL!

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:38.314
MY CHAOS MAGE!

00:13:38.314 --> 00:13:43.119
[CHUCKLES] IS TRAPPED
BY THE MYSTIC GAZE
OF MY ULTIMATE BEAST!

00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:44.754
AND DON'T THINK
YOU CAN RESCUE HIM.

00:13:44.754 --> 00:13:47.156
THERE'S NO ESCAPE
FROM THE MESMERIZING EYES

00:13:47.156 --> 00:13:49.225
WHOSE GAZE BLANKETS
YOUR FIELD.

EVEN THE MONSTERS
YOU'VE HIDDEN FROM ME
HAVE BECOME PARALYZED!

YOU HAVEN'T WON YET.

00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:58.301
DON'T BE A FOOL! IN JUST
A MATTER OF MOMENTS,

00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:01.003
MY THOUSAND EYES RESTRICT WILL
ASSIMILATE YOUR CHAOS MAGE,

00:14:01.003 --> 00:14:04.207
ABSORB HIS MAGICAL POWERS,
AND FINISH YOU OFF

00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:08.478
WITH ONE THUNDEROUS BLAST!
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT YOUR THOUSAND
EYES SPELL.

00:14:53.141 --> 00:14:55.210
IT DID AFFECT ALL
MY HIDDEN MONSTERS,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.079
SPECIFICALLY
MY KURIBOH.

00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.349
AND IT PARALYZED
HIM ALONG WITH
MY CHAOS MAGE!

NO, THIS CAN'T BE!

00:15:02.084 --> 00:15:06.255
YES. AND I ACTIVATED

IT'S TOO LATE
TO CALL BACK

THE ABSORPTION
FORCE SPELL THAT
YOU JUST CAST,

YOUR THOUSAND

HAS NO CHOICE

00:15:24.873 --> 00:15:28.543
BUT TO ASSIMILATE
THEM ALL.

OF THE WAY
THE KURIBOHS ATTACK,

00:15:48.897 --> 00:15:52.301
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO SEE JUST
AS MANY EXPLOSIONS!

I'VE LOST!

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:44.413
HMM. [SIGHS]

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:47.616
SPIRIT OF
THE PUZZLE,

00:17:47.616 --> 00:17:48.850
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.053
IT WAS YOUR COURAGE
AND THE LOVE

00:17:51.053 --> 00:17:53.555
YOUR FRIENDS HAD FOR YOU
THAT PREVAILED THIS DAY.

00:17:53.555 --> 00:17:55.490
AND YOUR
DETERMINATION.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.526
MM.

00:17:57.526 --> 00:17:59.694
WE ALL DID IT!
HUAH! TOGETHER!

00:17:59.694 --> 00:18:02.297
THAT'S RIGHT.
AS FRIENDS.

00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:04.666
AND IN THE END,
THAT'S WHAT
IT CAME DOWN TO.

00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.170
FRIENDS BEING THERE
FOR ONE ANOTHER.

00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:13.775
Joey: HEY!
IT'S CLEARING UP!

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:17.079
Tristan: YEAH.
AND I THINK I CAN
SEE SOMETHING!

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:18.046
Joey: ME, TOO!

00:18:18.046 --> 00:18:19.815
YA THINK IT'S...

00:18:19.815 --> 00:18:22.417
Tristan:
IT IS! IT'S HIM!

00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:26.922
All: YUGI!
[LAUGH]

00:18:26.922 --> 00:18:28.323
HMM?

00:18:28.323 --> 00:18:29.891
YOU GUYS! THANKS!

00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:32.661
AW, MAN, YUGE!
YOU DID IT!
YOU REALLY DID IT!

00:18:32.661 --> 00:18:36.164
YOU REALLY FINALLY
DID IT! UHH!

00:18:36.164 --> 00:18:38.400
WHAT JOEY IS TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT
IT'S REALLY GREAT

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.469
YOU AND YOUR
GRANDPA ARE GOING
TO BE REUNITED.

00:18:40.469 --> 00:18:42.571
YEAH, FOR SURE.
BUT ALSO, YUGE--

00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:45.207
ALSO, WE WANTED TO SAY
HOW IMPRESSED WE ARE

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.008
WITH YOU FOR BEING
SO BRAVE AND ALL.

00:18:47.008 --> 00:18:48.643
YEAH, IMPRESSED,
AND WE'RE--

00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:51.279
AND WE'RE PROUD
OF YOU, TOO.

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:54.182
AARGH! YOU GUYS
ARE STEALIN'

00:18:54.182 --> 00:18:56.384
EVERYTHING I WAS
GONNA SAY! AAH!

00:18:56.384 --> 00:18:58.887
SO THEN, TALK!
SHEESH!

00:18:58.887 --> 00:19:01.289
AH, FORGET IT.

00:19:01.289 --> 00:19:04.025
WHO CARES?
HE WON!

00:19:04.025 --> 00:19:05.861
YUGI WON!
HEY, HEY!

00:19:05.861 --> 00:19:08.463
Tristan: GO, YUGI!
All: YEAH!

00:19:08.463 --> 00:19:10.465
WE ALL WON.
THANKS, GUYS.

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:12.567
WAIT!
LET'S NOT FORGET.

00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:14.436
THIS ISN'T OVER
UNTIL PEGASUS

00:19:14.436 --> 00:19:17.339
RELEASES EVERYONE'S
SOULS JUST LIKE
HE PROMISED.

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:18.773
YEAH,
TéA'S RIGHT.

00:19:18.773 --> 00:19:20.775
SO THEN, LET'S GO
GRAB THE CREEP.

00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:22.777
HMM.

00:19:22.777 --> 00:19:23.778
HMM?

00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:25.780
[GASPS]

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.782
Yugi: HE'S GONE!

00:19:27.782 --> 00:19:29.918
WHY AM I NOT
SURPRISED
BY THIS?

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:33.054
SLIPPERY DOUBLE-CROSSIN' SNAKE!
LET'S GO FIND HIM!

00:19:33.054 --> 00:19:34.389
BUT WE CAN'T
JUST LEAVE

00:19:34.389 --> 00:19:36.691
MOKUBA AND BAKURA
HERE ALL ALONE.

00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:37.859
Bakura:
HEY! UP HERE!

00:19:37.859 --> 00:19:39.294
All: HUH?

00:19:39.294 --> 00:19:42.297
HELLO! HEY!

00:19:42.297 --> 00:19:43.398
Yugi: BAKURA!

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.800
HEY, THERE!
FEELIN' BACK TO NORMAL?

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.736
WHAT? BACK TO NORMAL?

00:19:47.736 --> 00:19:49.871
HAVE I NOT BEEN
NORMAL, TRISTAN?

00:19:49.871 --> 00:19:52.674
HE MUST NOT BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER ANYTHING.

00:19:52.674 --> 00:19:54.809
YEAH, THAT WEIRD RING
YOU WEAR AROUND YOUR NECK

00:19:54.809 --> 00:19:57.479
WAS MAKIN' YOU ACT
LIKE A REAL FREAK AGAIN!

00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:59.481
FREAK? OH, MY.

00:19:59.481 --> 00:20:01.650
HIS MILLENNIUM RING?

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.318
WHERE IS IT NOW?

00:20:03.318 --> 00:20:06.855
GONE. I CHUCKED THAT THING
AS FAR AWAY AS I COULD.

00:20:06.855 --> 00:20:08.323
Bakura: OH, WELL.
[ALL GASP]

00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:10.091
IF IT WAS MAKING ME
ACT WEIRD,

00:20:10.091 --> 00:20:11.960
THEN I GUESS IT WAS
FOR THE BEST.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.595
BUT IT APPEARS
I'M FINE NOW.

00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:14.996
All: HMM.

00:20:14.996 --> 00:20:18.433
WELL, IF YOU'RE OK,
COULD YOU WATCH
MOKUBA FOR US?

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:20.435
SURE. I SUPPOSE.

00:20:20.435 --> 00:20:24.005
GOOD. THEN LET'S
GO AND FIND THAT
CREEP PEGASUS.

00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:25.507
MM-HMM.

00:20:25.507 --> 00:20:27.242
AFTER ALL, HE
MADE A PROMISE

00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:31.012
TO FREE THOSE
SOULS, AND HE'S
GONNA KEEP IT!

00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:32.781
[THINKING] IF PEGASUS
RESTORES MOKUBA'S SOUL,

00:20:32.781 --> 00:20:35.350
HIS BODY WILL BE
USELESS TO ME.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.452
BUT IT MATTERS NOT,
BECAUSE NOW THAT PEGASUS

00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:39.454
IS WEAKENED BY HIS DUEL
WITH YUGI,

00:20:39.454 --> 00:20:42.424
HE'S GIVEN ME
THE OPPORTUNITY
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:20:42.424 --> 00:20:44.326
THE TIME HAS FINALLY COME

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:47.696
FOR ME TO ADD
PEGASUS' MILLENNIUM ITEM
TO MY COLLECTION.

00:20:47.696 --> 00:20:49.931
HEH HEH HEH.
