00:07:34.318 --> 00:07:36.087
HUH...UH?
TéA?

00:07:36.087 --> 00:07:38.756
TéA. I ASKED YOU
IF YOU REMEMBERED.

00:07:38.756 --> 00:07:40.625
YUGI,
I REMEMBER.

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.226
BUT WHAT WAS IT
THAT YOU DID

00:07:42.226 --> 00:07:43.761
TO THAT GUY
THAT DAY?

00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:46.497
I DON'T KNOW.
WHEN I CAME TO,

00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:48.232
THAT MUGGER WAS
ALREADY ON THE GROUND.

00:07:48.232 --> 00:07:50.234
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:07:50.234 --> 00:07:51.903
YOU'RE A MYSTERIOUS GUY,
YUGI.

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:54.438
DO YOU EVER FEEL THERE'S
SOMETHING WEIRD GOING ON?

00:07:54.438 --> 00:07:57.174
SOMETIMES YOU SEEM
LIKE YOU'RE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

00:07:57.174 --> 00:08:00.311
DOES WHAT I'M SAYING
MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU?

00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:03.180
[SIGHS] I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.450
SOMETIMES I FEEL
LIKE THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
INSIDE OF ME.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.219
I HOPE
I'M NOT LOSING IT.
HUH?

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:11.188
WELL, WHATEVER'S
GOING ON WITH YOU,

00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:13.224
BOTH OF YOU ARE
REALLY GOOD GUYS.

00:08:13.224 --> 00:08:14.525
TRUST ME.

00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:15.826
THANKS, TéA.

00:08:15.826 --> 00:08:18.362
Joey: HEY, DO WE NEED
TO CARRY YOU GUYS UP?

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:21.299
Tristan: YEAH,
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
COME ON!

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:23.301
COME ON. LET'S GO.

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:25.069
[CHUCKLES] YEAH.

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:28.839
Joey: YOU'D THINK
SOMEONE AS RICH AS PEGASUS
WOULD PUT IN AN ELEVATOR.

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:31.175
Tristan: HEY, GUYS, LOOK.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:33.444
WHO'S BLOCKIN' OUR WAY
INTO THE CASTLE.

00:08:33.444 --> 00:08:34.946
IT'S KAIBA!

00:08:34.946 --> 00:08:36.948
Joey: WHAT THE HECK'S
HE DOIN' HERE?

00:08:36.948 --> 00:08:39.050
I CAN'T LET YOU PASS, YUGI.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.886
I'VE WON 10 STAR CHIPS,
SO STAND ASIDE.

00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:43.387
YOU MAY HAVE WON
ENOUGH STAR CHIPS

00:08:43.387 --> 00:08:45.990
TO QUALIFY
FOR THE DUELIST KINGDOM
PLAYOFFS, YUGI,

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:49.460
BUT I CAN'T ALLOW YOU
TO FACE PEGASUS.
HE'S MINE.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.229
YOU AND I
ARE GOING TO HAVE
ONE FINAL DUEL.

00:08:52.229 --> 00:08:54.632
YOU WILL LOSE,
AND I WILL WIN.

00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:58.402
THE WINDS OF CHANGE
ARE BLOWING, YUGI MOTO.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.902
OHH! HE'S SO SMUG
UP THERE.

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:07.471
[THINKING] PEGASUS
MIGHT BE FORCING ME
TO FIGHT YUGI,

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:10.441
BUT IT'S A REMATCH
I'VE WANTED ALL ALONG.

00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:12.276
STEP ASIDE, KAIBA!

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:14.378
NOT UNTIL YOU AGREE
TO DUEL ME.

00:09:14.378 --> 00:09:17.214
I'M NOT DUELING YOU.
I DON'T HAVE TO.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:19.583
SO...NO LONGER
CONFIDENT

00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:22.486
YOUR SO-CALLED
"HEART OF THE CARDS"
CAN HELP YOU WIN?

00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:25.990
OR ARE YOU AFRAID
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME
WITHOUT EXODIA?

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.658
THAT'S IT,
ISN'T IT, YUGI?

00:09:27.658 --> 00:09:30.661
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID
YOU CAN'T BEAT ME
A SECOND TIME,

00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:32.463
YOU COWARD.

00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:35.099
YOU BACK OFF.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
PROVE ANYTHING.

00:09:35.099 --> 00:09:37.067
AWW, YOU WANT A DUEL,
SMART MOUTH?

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:39.103
I'LL TAKE YOU.
COME ON, LET'S DUEL.

00:09:39.103 --> 00:09:40.104
[CHUCKLES CRUELLY]

00:09:40.104 --> 00:09:41.238
DON'T LAUGH! AAHHH!

00:09:41.238 --> 00:09:42.473
JOEY! DOWN, BOY.

00:09:42.473 --> 00:09:44.475
DON'T FORGET
WHEN YOU BATTLED
HIM BEFORE,

00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:45.709
HE SLAUGHTERED
YOU.

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:46.710
[SIGHS]

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.546
LIKE YOU COULD
DO ANY BETTER?

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.713
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:49.713 --> 00:09:50.714
HUH?

00:09:53.184 --> 00:09:56.020
HAH! I CAN'T BELIEVE
THE LITTLE BARKING CHIHUAHUA

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.955
ALREADY HAS 10 STAR CHIPS.

00:09:57.955 --> 00:10:01.425
YOU EARN THEM YOURSELF,
OR DID YUGI THROW YOU
A FEW BONES?

00:10:01.425 --> 00:10:05.196
GRRR! DON'T CALL ME
A CHIHUAHUA! RRR!

00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:07.898
HA HA HA!
DON'T LET HIM
SNAP HIS CHAIN.

00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:10.835
THERE'S NO CHALLENGE
IN HUMILIATING YOU
AGAIN, JOEY.

00:10:10.835 --> 00:10:13.637
THERE'S ONLY ONE PLAYER
WHO'S EVER BEATEN ME
AT DUEL MONSTERS,

00:10:13.637 --> 00:10:15.206
AND THAT'S YUGI.

00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:19.076
BUT HOW HE DID IT
IS A MYSTERY THAT
STILL EATS AWAY AT ME.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:20.578
I WAS WINNING OUR BATTLE.

00:10:20.578 --> 00:10:24.915
MY BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON
WAS DEVASTATING HIS FORCES.

00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:27.785
HIS MONSTERS COULDN'T STAND UP
TO ITS WITHERING ATTACKS.

00:10:27.785 --> 00:10:29.954
AND THEN I DREW
MY SECOND BLUE EYES.

00:10:32.022 --> 00:10:34.425
I WAS INVINCIBLE!

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.794
YUGI THOUGHT
THE ATTACK STRENGTH
OF HIS DARK MAGICIAN

00:10:36.794 --> 00:10:38.095
COULD STOP ME...

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:45.569
BUT HE NEVER DREAMED
I'D DRAW MY <i>THIRD</i> BLUE EYES,

00:10:45.569 --> 00:10:47.638
WHICH BLEW HIS MAGICIAN
AWAY,

00:10:47.638 --> 00:10:50.074
OBLITERATING
HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:10:50.074 --> 00:10:51.075
BUT THEN...

00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:53.878
AND NOW I'LL PLAY

00:10:53.878 --> 00:10:56.313
THE UNSTOPPABLE EXODIA!

00:10:56.313 --> 00:10:58.182
JUST AS HE WAS ON
THE VERGE OF DEFEAT,

00:10:58.182 --> 00:11:01.218
YUGI SOMEHOW
ACHIEVED THE UNACHIEVABLE!

00:11:01.218 --> 00:11:04.688
HE ASSEMBLED ALL 5 PIECES
OF EXODIA!

00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:07.591
EXODIA!
AHH, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:09.894
NO ONE'S EVER
BEEN ABLE TO CALL HIM!

00:11:09.894 --> 00:11:12.463
BUT SOMEHOW, HE HAD.

00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:18.502
AAAAHHHH!

00:11:18.502 --> 00:11:22.406
YUGI, YOU SAID
YOU WON BY TAPPING INTO
THE HEART OF THE CARDS,

00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:24.575
AND FOR A LONG TIME
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT,

00:11:24.575 --> 00:11:26.710
BUT NOW I THINK I DO.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.580
AND IT TOOK PEGASUS
TO SHOW ME.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:34.118
HE GAVE ME A REASON TO PUT
MY HEART IN THE CARDS.

00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:35.786
Mokuba: HELP ME,
BIG BROTHER!

00:11:35.786 --> 00:11:37.521
[THINKING]
I <i>WILL</i> HELP YOU, MOKUBA.

00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:39.690
THERE'S NOT A POWER ON EARTH
THAT WILL STOP ME--

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.192
NOT PEGASUS, NOT YUGI.

00:11:42.192 --> 00:11:46.530
FOR THE FIRST TIME,
YUGI, I CAN DUEL WITH FIRE
AND PASSION IN MY HEART.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.965
I CAN FEEL IT.

00:11:47.965 --> 00:11:50.301
[THINKING]
KAIBA <i>HAS</i> CHANGED.
I CAN SENSE IT.

00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:52.603
HE'S FIGHTING
FOR MORE THAN JUST
HIMSELF THIS TIME.

00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:55.072
THERE'S A NEW BELIEF
IN THE HEART OF
THE CARDS.

00:11:55.072 --> 00:11:57.875
YUGI, YOU CAN'T ACCEPT
THIS DUEL.

00:11:57.875 --> 00:11:59.643
YOU'VE ALREADY
EARNED ENOUGH
STAR CHIPS

00:11:59.643 --> 00:12:01.145
TO GET
INTO THE CASTLE.

00:12:01.145 --> 00:12:03.847
I'VE CHANGED.
I DESERVE A REMATCH.

00:12:03.847 --> 00:12:06.383
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO PLAY YOU NOW, YUGI.

00:12:06.383 --> 00:12:08.986
LET ME PLAY YOU
FOR THE <i>RIGHT</i> REASONS.

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:10.454
[THINKING] AFTER ALL
GRANDPA'S TAUGHT ME,

00:12:10.454 --> 00:12:12.723
HOW CAN I DENY
THE HEART OF THE CARDS?

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:24.168
YU-GI-OH!

00:12:31.575 --> 00:12:32.710
HMM.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.478
[THINKING]
IT'S HAPPENED AGAIN.

00:12:34.478 --> 00:12:36.480

SEEMS DIFFERENT.

KAIBA,
I ACCEPT YOUR DUEL!

00:12:38.749 --> 00:12:40.651
WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU'VE
REALLY LEARNED.

00:12:40.651 --> 00:12:42.519
YOU JUST NAME THE PLACE.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:46.090
MMM. OUR DUELING FIELD
HAS BEEN PREPARED.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.324

00:12:54.965 --> 00:12:57.935
ALL RIGHT, KAIBA.
IT'S TIME TO DUEL.

Keith: I'M HERE FOR
THE DUELIST PLAYOFFS.

00:13:07.562 --> 00:13:09.564

00:13:09.564 --> 00:13:10.866
WELL, I GOT 'EM!

BUT THE REAL FUN'S
ON THE ANNEX ROOF.

YOU GOTTA CHECK IT OUT.

00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:17.706

MAYBE I WILL.

WONDER WHAT'S SHAKIN'.

00:13:28.383 --> 00:13:30.485

WE'LL EACH WAGER 5 STAR CHIPS
ON THIS DUEL,

WHO EARNS THE RIGHT
TO ENTER THE MAIN CASTLE.

00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:38.293
DONE. 5 CHIPS.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.832
WE'LL USE MY DUAL-DISK SYSTEM.

INSERT YOUR SHUFFLED DECK
INTO THE CARD-RECOGNITION SLOT.

Tristan:
YEAH!
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:03.118

IT'LL TAKE AWHILE

FOR THE OTHER FINALISTS
TO CATCH UP PLAYIN'
BY THE RULES,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.390

KILL SOME TIME

WELL DONE.
A FORMIDABLE CARD, YUGI,

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:17.459
AND A PLAY I WOULD EXPECT
FROM A DUELIST OF YOUR CALIBER.

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:18.960
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.597
YUGI, I KNOW FROM PLAYING YOU
YOU'RE A TALENTED DUELIST,

00:15:22.597 --> 00:15:24.966
BUT YOU'RE JUST
NOT AS GOOD AS I AM.

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:26.167
LISTEN UP.

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:28.370
ONLY ONE DUELIST
IS GONNA CHALLENGE PEGASUS

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.471
AND THAT'S ME!

00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.472
WRONG.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:32.140
THEN ATTACK AND FIND OUT.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.110
WHAT'S THE MATTER, YUGI?
NO FAITH IN YOUR MONSTER?

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.479
YOU'LL SEE.
HE'S MIGHTIER THAN YOURS.

00:15:37.479 --> 00:15:41.116
GO, CURSE OF DRAGON!
ATTACK RYU-KISHIN!

00:15:41.116 --> 00:15:43.118
[SHRIEKING]

00:15:43.118 --> 00:15:45.120
Yugi: DRAGON FLAME!

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.254
[ROARING]

00:15:46.254 --> 00:15:48.957
THERE.
RYU-KISHIN IS NO MORE.

00:15:52.027 --> 00:15:54.963
HMM. YOU'RE GOOD,
BUT OH, SO PREDICTABLE.

00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:57.232
DON'T YOU THINK
I EXPECTED THAT ATTACK?

00:15:57.232 --> 00:16:01.936
AND ONCE AGAIN YOU'VE PLAYED
RIGHT INTO MY HANDS, YUGI.

00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:05.040
HE'S BLUFFING.
YOU ALREADY GOT KAIBA
ON THE ROPES!

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.775
ALL RIGHT!
GO, YUGI!

00:16:08.343 --> 00:16:11.780
IT'S NOT A BLUFF,
AS YOU WILL ALL SOON SEE.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.515
HEH.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.285
I PLAY SWORDSTALKER!

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:23.758
THE SWORDSTALKER
GATHERS THE LIFE-FORCE
OF A FALLEN ALLY,

00:16:23.758 --> 00:16:28.296
RAISING HIS OWN ATTACK POWER
BY 20%. WATCH.

00:16:30.632 --> 00:16:34.803
[THINKING] SO <i>THAT'S</i> WHY
KAIBA ALLOWED HIS RYU-KISHIN
TO BE DEFEATED SO EASILY--

00:16:34.803 --> 00:16:39.207
SO HE COULD USE ITS ENERGY
TO CREATE AN EVEN STRONGER
MONSTER!

00:16:39.207 --> 00:16:40.642
AND NOW THAT HE'S DONE THAT,

00:16:40.642 --> 00:16:42.377
HIS SWORDSTALKER'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:45.513
IS EVEN GREATER THAN THAT
OF MY CURSE OF DRAGON!

00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:48.616
ATTACK NOW, SWORDSTALKER!

00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:49.951
[HOWLING]

00:16:49.951 --> 00:16:52.754
VENGEANCE STRIKE!

00:16:52.754 --> 00:16:55.523
WHAT?! THE CURSE OF DRAGON
DISAPPEARED!

00:16:55.523 --> 00:16:59.027
THAT'S BECAUSE
I LAID A MONSTER-REPLACE
MAGIC CARD ON THE FIELD.

00:16:59.027 --> 00:17:01.396
THIS CARD SWITCHES
THE MONSTER ON THE FIELD

00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:02.664
WITH THE MONSTER
IN MY HAND

00:17:02.664 --> 00:17:05.600
THAT HAS THE HIGHEST
ATTACK POWER,

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.602
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

00:17:07.602 --> 00:17:10.472
THE CREATURE
WITH THE GREATEST
ATTACK POWER IN MY HAND

00:17:10.472 --> 00:17:11.606
IS THE DARK
MAGICIAN.

00:17:11.606 --> 00:17:13.541
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:17:16.845 --> 00:17:20.248
THE DARK MAGICIAN
VANQUISHES
YOUR SWORDSTALKER.

00:17:22.217 --> 00:17:23.551
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:23.551 --> 00:17:26.654
HEY, KAIBA,
YUGI PUT THE MOVES
ON YOU AGAIN!

00:17:26.654 --> 00:17:28.790
HMM. CLUELESS.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.560
IF THOSE FOOLS ONLY KNEW
WHAT I HAVE IN STORE.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.631
NOW I CAN RE-PLAY
CURSE OF DRAGON
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:17:39.134 --> 00:17:40.268
YOUR MOVE, KAIBA.

00:17:43.838 --> 00:17:47.342
I'LL TAKE ON YOUR MAGIC
WITH A MAGICIAN OF MY OWN.

00:17:47.342 --> 00:17:51.479
I SUMMON LA JINN,
THE MYSTICAL GENIE!

00:17:51.479 --> 00:17:52.480
[EVIL LAUGH]

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.950
MY WISH IS
HIS COMMAND.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.953
DARK MAGICIAN,
ATTACK LA JINN!

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:00.722
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:18:00.722 --> 00:18:03.358
YOUR ATTACK
ACTIVATES MY TRAP--

00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:06.394
THE ANCIENT LAMP!

00:18:06.394 --> 00:18:10.865
FIRST IT PROTECTS MY GENIE
BY DRAWING HIM INTO THE LAMP.

00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:11.866
WHAT?!

00:18:13.902 --> 00:18:16.171
THEN THE LAMP
DEFLECTS YOUR ATTACK,

00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:18.573
TURNING IT BACK
ON YOUR MONSTER.

00:18:20.675 --> 00:18:22.911
WHICH LOWERS YOUR SCORE
TO EQUAL MINE.

00:18:22.911 --> 00:18:23.878
GRRR.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.350
REFLECT UPON THE INCREDIBLE
DEFENSIVE POWERS
OF MY ANCIENT LAMP!

00:18:32.754 --> 00:18:35.623
MY DEFLECTED ATTACK
MAY HAVE DESTROYED
CURSE OF DRAGON,

00:18:35.623 --> 00:18:38.593
BUT I STILL HAVE
THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:18:38.593 --> 00:18:41.729
KAIBA,
FOR ALL YOUR BRAGGING,
THE SCORE IS TIED.

00:18:41.729 --> 00:18:43.431
WE'RE EVENLY MATCHED.

00:18:43.431 --> 00:18:46.968
[THINKING] HAH.
YUGI DOESN'T SUSPECT
THAT SO FAR MY MANEUVERS--

00:18:46.968 --> 00:18:51.906
CLEVER AS THEY ARE--
ARE ALL JUST PLOYS TO DISTRACT
HIM FROM MY REAL PLAN,

00:18:51.906 --> 00:18:54.442
TO ASSEMBLE
ALL 3 BLUE EYES IN MY DECK

00:18:54.442 --> 00:18:58.279
TO CREATE A MONSTER
MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY
HE'S EVER SEEN.

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:01.950
FOR COMBINED, THEY CREATE
THE ULTIMATE CREATURE
OF DESTRUCTION...

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.486
THE BLUE-EYES ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:19:05.486 --> 00:19:06.554
HA HA HA!
