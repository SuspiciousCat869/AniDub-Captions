PLAY YOUR NEXT CARD.
WHATEVER IT IS, I'M READY.

00:14:50.134 --> 00:14:53.137
OHH...I HAVE TO PLAY
A ZOMBIE CARD.

00:14:53.137 --> 00:14:55.072
NO, NOT THAT ONE, BONZ.

00:14:55.072 --> 00:14:56.874
SECOND CARD TO THE LEFT.

00:14:56.874 --> 00:14:58.876
HUH?

00:14:58.876 --> 00:15:01.379
[THINKING]
THE CRAWLING DRAGON?

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:03.948
THIS ISN'T
A ZOMBIE CARD, EITHER.

00:15:03.948 --> 00:15:06.384
AS SOON AS I PLAY IT,
HE'LL OBLITERATE ME.

00:15:06.384 --> 00:15:08.586
JUST LIKE LAST TIME.

00:15:08.586 --> 00:15:10.121
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

00:15:10.121 --> 00:15:11.422
JUST BE PATIENT, BONZ.

00:15:11.422 --> 00:15:13.591
WE'RE WORKING
ON A STRATEGY HERE.

00:15:13.591 --> 00:15:15.359
REMEMBER,
NO DUELIST HAS EVER

00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:17.828
BEATEN BANDIT KEITH
WITHOUT CHEATIN'.

00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:19.830
YEAH, UNTIL NOW.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.999

00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:24.101
RUNNING FROM ME
ALREADY, SKULL FACE?

00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:26.137
YOU'RE NOT SO SCARY
AFTER ALL, HUH?

00:15:26.137 --> 00:15:28.039
GO, AXE RAIDER!

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.473
RRR....

00:15:29.473 --> 00:15:31.675

00:15:36.147 --> 00:15:37.381
OHH!

00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:38.716
I WIN!

00:15:38.716 --> 00:15:41.218
NOW PLAY THE CARD
THAT'S ON THE FAR RIGHT.

00:15:41.218 --> 00:15:42.820
RRR!

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.689
YOU HEARD ME.
AND DON'T USE
DEFENSE MODE THIS TIME.

00:15:45.689 --> 00:15:47.792
IF THE DWEEB
CAN'T SEE YOUR MONSTER,

00:15:47.792 --> 00:15:50.227
HE MIGHT JUST HESITATE
AND WAIT TO ATTACK.

00:15:50.227 --> 00:15:51.295
OHH...

00:15:51.295 --> 00:15:52.963
IF YOU DON'T
WANNA TRUST ME, BONES,

00:15:52.963 --> 00:15:55.366
I'LL KEEP MY ADVICE
TO MYSELF.

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:56.700
IT'S UP TO YOU.

00:15:58.803 --> 00:16:02.106
UM...CRASS CLOWN--
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:05.643
AH HA HA HA HA!

00:16:05.643 --> 00:16:08.145
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU'VE GOT?

00:16:08.145 --> 00:16:10.347
FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:16:10.347 --> 00:16:11.615
[GRUNTS]

00:16:11.615 --> 00:16:12.650
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:16:15.119 --> 00:16:16.620
AH HA HA HA HA HA!

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.122
GRR....

00:16:18.122 --> 00:16:20.291
FLAMING SWORD OF BATTLE!

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:28.332
TOO BAD.
ONE CRASS CLOWN
GOING DOWN.

00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:31.335
UHH, UHH...

[THINKING]
CREEPSHOW IS SCARED.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.338
I GOT HIM ON THE RUN,

00:16:34.338 --> 00:16:37.041
AND I PLAN
TO KEEP HIM THAT WAY.

00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:38.709
THERE'S WAY TOO MUCH
RIDING ON THIS DUEL

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:40.111
FOR ME TO BLOW IT.

00:16:40.111 --> 00:16:43.080
MY SISTER SERENITY'S
COUNTING ON ME.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.282
SO, WATCH OUT, SKULL FACE!

00:16:45.282 --> 00:16:48.052
YOU BETTER BE SCARED,
'CAUSE THIS LITTLE PUPPY DOG

00:16:48.052 --> 00:16:49.553
IS GONNA CHASE
YOUR BONY BUTT

00:16:49.553 --> 00:16:51.755
RIGHT OUT
OF YOUR OWN GRAVEYARD.

00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:55.526
NOW WHAT?

00:16:55.526 --> 00:16:57.261
JUST RELAX.

00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:59.630
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
THIS DUEL WON, BONZ.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.165
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
BONZ?

00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:03.334
CAN'T FIGHT
THIS DUEL ON YOUR OWN?

00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:05.302
MAYBE YOUR COACH
WANTS TO TAKE ME ON.

00:17:05.302 --> 00:17:06.937
I'LL CREAM HIM, TOO.

00:17:06.937 --> 00:17:08.873
OH, YEAH?
LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED

00:17:08.873 --> 00:17:11.175
A LESSON
IN STRATEGY, DWEEB.

00:17:11.175 --> 00:17:12.643
HUH?

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.149
OH! WOW.

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:21.519
I HAD TOTALLY FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THIS MAGIC CARD, BOSS.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:23.020
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.756
LAY IT DOWN, BONZ!
PLAY YOUR TRUMP CARD!

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:27.091
YOU'RE FINISHED!

00:17:27.091 --> 00:17:30.261
THIS MAGIC CARD
IS UNSTOPPABLE!

00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:32.763
THE CALL
OF THE HAUNTED!

00:17:32.763 --> 00:17:35.633
THE CALL
OF THE HAUNTED?

00:17:35.633 --> 00:17:37.801
IT BRINGS ALL
THE MONSTERS YOU DESTROY

00:17:37.801 --> 00:17:39.236
BACK FROM THE GRAVE.

00:17:39.236 --> 00:17:41.138
BUT THEY COME BACK
AS ZOMBIES,

00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:43.340
WITH THE POWER
OF IMMORTALITY!

00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:46.777

HEY, THAT'S
JOEY'S WALLET.

00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:06.262
WITH A PICTURE
OF HIS SISTER SERENITY.

00:18:06.262 --> 00:18:08.731
JOEY WOULD NEVER
BE CARELESS ENOUGH
TO LOSE THAT.

00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:11.267
HIS SISTER
MEANS MORE TO HIM
THAN ANYTHING.

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:14.570
THIS IS STARTING
TO SMELL LIKE FOUL PLAY.

Yugi: BE CAREFUL.

00:18:33.189 --> 00:18:35.124
IT COULD BE
SOME KIND OF TRAP.

00:18:35.124 --> 00:18:37.994
Téa: WHAT'S UP
WITH THOSE COFFINS?

00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:40.496
