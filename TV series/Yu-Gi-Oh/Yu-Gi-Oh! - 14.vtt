00:07:42.184 --> 00:07:45.951
THANKS TO THE FIELD
POWER BONUS I GET
FOR PLAYING IT AT NIGHT!

00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:48.351
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF THE DARK, PANIK.

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:51.384
YOU WOULD BE
IF YOU ONLY KNEW

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:54.217
THE FEARSOME NIGHTMARES
WITHIN ITS SHADE!

00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:55.784
THE BLANKET OF SHADOWS

00:07:55.784 --> 00:07:58.284
CAST OVER MY ENTIRE
SIDE OF THE FIELD

00:07:58.317 --> 00:08:01.424
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR YOU TO SEE
THE CREATURES I SUMMON

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:04.257
BUT LEAVES YOUR
ENTIRE SIDE EXPOSED

00:08:04.257 --> 00:08:06.057
AND VULNERABLE
TO MY ATTACKS.

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:08.557
UNNERVING, ISN'T IT, YUGI,

00:08:08.557 --> 00:08:11.257
HOW THE DARKNESS
PREYS ON YOUR FEARS,

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:12.724
ON YOUR MIND

00:08:12.757 --> 00:08:14.724
UNTIL YOU'RE
TOO SCARED TO THINK,

00:08:14.757 --> 00:08:16.924
TOO TERRIFIED TO FIGHT!

00:08:16.957 --> 00:08:19.791
[SINISTER LAUGHTER]

00:08:19.824 --> 00:08:21.224
DON'T LISTEN, YUGI!

00:08:21.257 --> 00:08:24.224
THIS IS EXACTLY
HOW HE THREW ME
OFF MY GAME!

00:08:24.257 --> 00:08:25.457
NOW YOU TELL US?

00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.824
AND IF YOU THINK
YOU CAN STORM MY CASTLE

00:08:29.857 --> 00:08:33.457
WITH THE HELP
OF A FIELD POWER BONUS
OF YOUR OWN, THINK AGAIN,

00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.591
BECAUSE JUST AS MY SHADOWS
BLOCK THE LIGHT FROM ABOVE,

00:08:36.624 --> 00:08:39.991
THEY'VE BLOCKED
THE FIELD POWER
FROM THE GROUND BELOW.

00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:42.991
ONLY THE NIGHT
GRANTS BONUSES HERE.

00:08:43.024 --> 00:08:44.391
[THINKING]
WITHOUT ANY IDEA

00:08:44.424 --> 00:08:45.557
WHAT'S
WAITING FOR ME
IN THOSE SHADOWS,

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.424
I CAN'T RISK
AN ATTACK.

00:08:47.457 --> 00:08:50.024
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
PLAY IT SAFE
FOR NOW.

00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:52.957
CELTIC GUARDIAN.
DEFENSE MODE!

00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:55.357
NOT A VERY BRIGHT IDEA.

00:08:57.057 --> 00:08:59.191
[THINKING] I CAN'T SEE
WHAT MONSTER HE PLAYED.

00:08:59.224 --> 00:09:01.631
HA HA HA HA! ATTACK!

00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:04.064
DARK GRASP OF FURY!

00:09:04.097 --> 00:09:06.231
[GROWLING]

00:09:15.864 --> 00:09:19.264
OUR FIRST VICTIM
OF THE NIGHT.

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:20.331
YUGI.

00:09:20.364 --> 00:09:21.631
THAT'S CHEAP.

00:09:21.664 --> 00:09:23.197
HOW DO YOU DEFEND
AGAINST WHAT
YOU CAN'T SEE?

00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:27.131
YEAH, OR DEFEAT
A MONSTER
YOU CAN'T FIND.

00:09:27.164 --> 00:09:29.064
Tristan: HMM. ANYBODY
GOT A FLASHLIGHT?

00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:30.331
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:32.731
EVEN YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE LOST HOPE FOR YOU.

00:09:32.764 --> 00:09:35.164
[THINKING] I NEED
TO GET HIS MONSTERS
OUT OF THOSE SHADOWS.

00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:37.164
BUT THE ONLY WAY
I CAN DO THAT

00:09:37.197 --> 00:09:40.097
IS BY DESTROYING
HIS CASTLE
OF DARK ILLUSIONS,

00:09:40.131 --> 00:09:42.097
AND WITH ITS DEFENSIVE
POINT SET AT 2500,

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:44.831
NO CARD IN MY DECK
HAS AN ATTACK POWER HIGH
ENOUGH TO SCRATCH IT,

00:09:44.864 --> 00:09:46.764
LET ALONE DESTROY IT.

00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:48.897
BOY, I'M BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND WHY
THEY CALL HIM PANIK!

00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:52.197
THE GAME JUST STARTED,
AND I'M ALREADY
FLUSTERED!

00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.631
PLAY ANY MONSTER CARD
YOU LIKE.

00:09:54.664 --> 00:09:56.831
THE CREATURES WITHIN
MY VEIL OF SHADOWS

00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:58.831
WILL CONSUME THEM ALL!

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.937
WINGED DRAGON
AND GUARDIAN
OF THE FORTRESS

00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:02.004
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:09.771
HA HA HA.
THIS DEFENSIVE MANEUVERING
MAY KEEP YOUR LIFE POINTS

00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:11.671
SAFE FROM ONE MONSTER,
YUGI...

00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:13.137
BUT NOT TWO!

00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.471
HA HA HA HA!
[GROWLING]

00:10:15.504 --> 00:10:17.437
[THINKING]
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,
BUT HE'S RIGHT.

00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:19.904
DEFENDING ALONE
WON'T WIN THIS DUEL
FOR ME.

00:10:19.937 --> 00:10:23.471
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE TERRIFIED,
AREN'T YOU, YUGI?

00:10:23.504 --> 00:10:26.371
ADMIT IT!
ALL YOUR COURAGE
HAS BEEN DEVOURED

00:10:26.404 --> 00:10:30.504
BY MY SHADOWY FOG!
HA HA HA HA!

00:10:30.537 --> 00:10:34.437
YES. ALL THAT'S LEFT
IS A TREMBLING
LITTLE DUELIST,

00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:36.537
POWERLESS
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.237
HOW'S YUGI SUPPOSED TO
TAKE THIS GUY OUT, MAI?

00:10:39.237 --> 00:10:40.871
IF I WAS ABLE
TO FIGURE THAT OUT,

00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:43.371
WE WOULDN'T BE IN
THIS SITUATION.

00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:46.171
[YUGI, THINKING]
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY

00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:48.271
TO NEUTRALIZE
PANIK'S
VEIL OF SHADOWS.

00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:50.704
BUT IT'S GENERATED
BY HIS CASTLE
OF DARK ILLUSIONS,

00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.937
AND THAT THING'S
VIRTUALLY
IMPREGNABLE!

00:10:52.937 --> 00:10:56.871
WAIT A MINUTE!
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
ATTACK PANIK'S CASTLE,

00:10:56.904 --> 00:11:00.444
BUT WHAT IF I ATTACK
THE DARKNESS ITSELF?

00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:03.044
GUARDIAN OF THE FORTRESS,
TAKE FLIGHT!

00:11:03.077 --> 00:11:04.844
[ROAR]

00:11:04.877 --> 00:11:06.511
FIREBALL ATTACK!

00:11:09.744 --> 00:11:11.144
HIS MONSTERS!

00:11:13.344 --> 00:11:16.244
HA HA HA HA!
SO YOU SAW MY CREATURES.

00:11:16.277 --> 00:11:18.711
BUT I DOUBT IT GIVES YOU
THE FORESIGHT

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.677
TO SEE WHAT'S COMING
NEXT.

00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:23.877
DARK GRASP OF FURY!

00:11:26.377 --> 00:11:29.011
[ROARING]

00:11:31.677 --> 00:11:34.411
LIGHTS OUT
FOR YOUR GUARDIAN
OF THE FORTRESS.

00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.677
MY CREATURES HUNGRILY EYE

00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:39.877
YOUR REMAINING LIFE POINTS,
YUGI.

00:11:39.877 --> 00:11:43.544
AND I'LL SEE TO IT
THAT THEY FEED AGAIN
QUITE SOON.

00:11:43.577 --> 00:11:45.244
HAS IT SUNK IT YET, WIMP?

00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:48.711
STANDING UP TO A BULLY
LEAVES YOU NOWHERE
TO GO BUT DOWN!

00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:49.911
[THINKING]
DOWN IS RIGHT.

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:51.644
MY LIFE POINTS
ARE WAY DOWN

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:53.577
WHILE PANIK'S
HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN TOUCHED.

00:11:53.577 --> 00:11:55.811
HIS SHADOWS HAVE DESTROYED
2 OF MY BEST MONSTERS

00:11:55.844 --> 00:11:58.244
WHILE I STILL CAN'T SEE
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

00:11:58.244 --> 00:12:00.317
HE'S GOT ME OUTMANEUVERED
AND OVERPOWERED,

00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:02.151
BUT I'M STILL
GONNA FIND A WAY

00:12:02.184 --> 00:12:03.896
TO PUT THAT BIG BULLY
IN HIS PLACE!

00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:09.915
Panik:
THE NIGHT HAS EYES, YUGI.

00:12:09.915 --> 00:12:12.815
HA HA HA HA HA!
AND ALL OF THEM
ARE ON YOU!

00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:15.682
[THINKING] AS LONG AS
PANIK'S CASTLE
OF DARK ILLUSIONS

00:12:15.715 --> 00:12:18.682
SHROUDS HIS SIDE
OF THE FIELD
WITH THAT SHADOW,

00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:21.549
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR ME TO SEE
ANY OF HIS MONSTERS.

00:12:21.582 --> 00:12:24.549
BUT PANICKING ABOUT IT
WILL ONLY MAKE THINGS
WORSE.

00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:28.449
SO I GOTTA
DO MY BEST NOT TO
LET HIM SEE ME SWEAT.

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:30.249
KEEP STRUGGLING, YUGI!

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.582
BULLYING'S
SO MUCH MORE FUN
WHEN YOU RESIST!

00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:37.315
TOUGH TALK, PANIK,
COMING FROM SOMEONE
WHO MAKES ALL THEIR ATTACKS

00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:39.282
WHILE HIDING
IN THE SAFETY OF SHADOWS!

00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:40.815
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:12:40.815 --> 00:12:42.149
Tea: YUGI, LOOK OUT!

00:12:44.182 --> 00:12:46.082
Joey: YOU OK, PAL?

00:12:46.115 --> 00:12:48.082
YOU UPPITY LITTLE CRETIN!

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:51.249
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
THINK TWICE BEFORE
YOU INSULT SOMEONE

00:12:51.282 --> 00:12:54.282
WHO CAN SCORCH YOU
WITH THE TOUCH
OF A BUTTON, HUH?!

00:12:54.315 --> 00:12:55.982
YOU'RE AFRAID, YUGI!

00:12:56.015 --> 00:12:57.949
YOU'RE LOST AND ALONE
IN THE DARK,

00:12:57.982 --> 00:13:00.155
AND I'M THE BIG,
BAD BOGEYMAN,

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:03.789
ABOUT TO LEAP OUT
AND GIVE YOU
THE SCARE OF YOUR LIFE!

00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:05.322
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:05.355 --> 00:13:07.855
IF YOU COULD SEE
WHAT I HAVE IN STORE FOR YOU,

00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:09.255
YOU WOULDN'T BE LAUGHING!

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.722
BUT THAT'S WHY
I'M LAUGHING...

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:14.689
BECAUSE I CAN SEE...
RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

00:13:14.689 --> 00:13:16.989
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:13:16.989 --> 00:13:18.222
YOU LITTLE RUNT!

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:20.055
YOU THE BOGEYMAN,
PANIK,

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:22.722
SCARING CHILDREN
INTO BEING AFRAID
OF THE DARK...

00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:26.622
UNTIL THEY REALIZE
THE DARK IS NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF...

00:13:26.655 --> 00:13:28.022
LIKE YOU.

00:13:28.055 --> 00:13:29.322
HUH?!

00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:31.355
ONCE A PERSON CONJURES UP
THE CONFIDENCE

00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:33.355
NOT TO BE FEARFUL
OF THE UNKNOWN,

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:35.289
THEY'VE DISARMED
THE ONLY WEAPON
THE DARK HAS.

00:13:35.322 --> 00:13:37.322
YOU WISH IT WAS
THAT SIMPLE, YOU‐‐

00:13:37.355 --> 00:13:40.022
BUT IT IS THAT SIMPLE!
I HAVE THE CARD
TO PROVE IT.

00:13:40.055 --> 00:13:41.155
WHAT CARD?

00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:43.255
A CARD
THAT'LL EXPOSE YOU

00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:46.589
AND LIFT UP
THAT VEIL OF SHADOWS
YOU COWER BEHIND.

00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:48.089
WHAT'S THAT?

00:13:48.089 --> 00:13:51.155
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING THAT'LL
TEACH YOU A TOUGH LESSON

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:52.689
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.

00:13:52.755 --> 00:13:55.789
HEY, MAI, WHY WOULD
YUGI TELL PANIK
HIS STRATEGY?

00:13:55.822 --> 00:13:57.155
IT'S PANIC.

00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:58.689
SAME THING
HAPPENED TO ME.

00:13:58.722 --> 00:14:01.095
YOU START MAKING
AMATEUR MISTAKES.

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:03.029
I DON'T KNOW, MAI.

00:14:03.062 --> 00:14:04.962
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE'S PANICKING.

00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:07.662
HA HA HA HA HA!
YOU ALMOST HAD ME THERE.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:11.129
BUT WE BOTH KNOW
THAT CARD'S NOTHING
BUT A BIG, FAT BLUFF!

00:14:11.162 --> 00:14:13.529
PROVE ME WRONG, YUGI.
GO AHEAD.

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:16.595
LET'S SEE YOU GIVE ME
MY TOUGH LESSON!
HA HA HA!

00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:18.962
HA HA. WHY SHOULD I
SHOW YOU MY CARD

00:14:18.995 --> 00:14:20.962
AFTER YOU'VE GONE
TO SUCH LENGTHS

00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:22.495
TO KEEP YOURS
IN THE DARK?

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.429
I THINK
YOU'RE STALLING.

00:14:24.462 --> 00:14:26.095
YOU DON'T TRUST ME,
PANIK?

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:29.362
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
NOT ALL DUELISTS ARE
LYING DOGS LIKE YOU.

00:14:29.395 --> 00:14:30.795
GRRR!

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:32.729
AND TO PROVE IT,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

00:14:32.762 --> 00:14:35.062
AFTER ALL,
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
THINKING

00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:36.729
I WAS
SOME KIND OF LIAR.

00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:38.162
SHOW ME!

00:14:38.195 --> 00:14:41.629
YOU DON'T NEED TO PROVE
ANYTHING TO THAT SLIME, YUGI!

00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:44.129
READY, PANIK?
HERE IT IS.

00:14:44.162 --> 00:14:45.995
THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:14:48.095 --> 00:14:50.729
HUH? REVEALING LIGHT?

00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:53.262
THE BLINDING MAGIC
OF THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT

00:14:53.295 --> 00:14:55.795
NOT ONLY STOPS
ALL ENEMY MONSTERS
FROM ATTACKING

00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:57.162
FOR 3 FULL TURNS,

00:14:57.195 --> 00:14:59.169
BUT IT BATHES
THE ENTIRE FIELD

00:14:59.202 --> 00:15:00.802
IN A LIGHT SO LUMINOUS

00:15:00.835 --> 00:15:04.235
THAT EVEN YOUR LURKING
SHADOW CREATURES
WILL BE EXPOSED!

00:15:06.835 --> 00:15:09.669
SOON, PANIK,
THE MONSTERS
IN YOUR DARK EMPIRE

00:15:09.702 --> 00:15:11.269
WILL HAVE NOWHERE
TO HIDE.

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:12.735
BUT RATHER THAN
PLAY IT NOW,

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:14.202
I'LL TAKE A PAGE
FROM YOUR BOOK

00:15:14.235 --> 00:15:17.435
AND LET YOU WORRY
ABOUT WHEN AND HOW
I'LL USE IT

00:15:17.469 --> 00:15:20.569
JUST LIKE YOU DO
WITH THE MONSTERS
YOU HIDE IN THE DARK.

00:15:20.602 --> 00:15:23.502
YOU'RE GOING DOWN
IN 5 TURNS.

00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:25.335
5 TURNS, PANIK!

00:15:25.369 --> 00:15:28.435
THEN MY MONSTERS
WILL FINISH YOU OFF!

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:31.369
CURSE OF DRAGON!
DEFENSIVE MODE!

00:15:31.402 --> 00:15:37.797
AND, OF COURSE,
THE CARD THAT WILL
MAKE YOU SEE THE LIGHT.

00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:40.697
YOUR 5 TURNS START NOW,
PANIK.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.630
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:15:42.663 --> 00:15:45.063
[THINKING]
GRRR! HE'S TAUNTING ME!

00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:48.497
THAT MUST BE THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:49.830
WHAT'S THE MATTER, PANIK?

00:15:49.863 --> 00:15:52.230
HAS BULLYING
LOST ITS THRILL?

00:15:52.263 --> 00:15:55.163
I'LL TEACH YOU
ABOUT LOSS‐‐JUST YOU WAIT!

00:15:55.197 --> 00:15:57.430
HEY, MAI, WHY IS YUGI
KEEPING THAT CARD OUT

00:15:57.463 --> 00:15:59.470
IF HE'S NOT GOING TO
PLAY IT YET?

00:16:00.803 --> 00:16:02.170
UH...

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.003
I HATE TO SAY IT, GUYS,
BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

00:16:05.003 --> 00:16:06.103
HUH?

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.537
I WAS ABLE
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER
FOR ABOUT THIS LONG, TOO,

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.037
BUT AFTER A WHILE,
PANIK HAS A WAY
OF GETTING TO YOU

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.437
AND MAKING YOU SLIP UP.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.537
NOT MY PAL.
HE KNOWS WHAT
HE'S DOING.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.370
Bakura:
I SURE HOPE SO.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.603
HE DOES.

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:21.403
Mai: LISTEN,
I KNOW YUGI'S GOOD,

00:16:21.403 --> 00:16:23.470
BUT FIGHTING PANIC
ISN'T ABOUT BEING GOOD.

00:16:23.503 --> 00:16:26.703
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING
A LEVEL HEAD WHILE
YOU'RE LOST IN THE DARK

00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:28.837
OR BEING ATTACKED
BY FIRE.

00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:32.603
YUGI'S GONNA NEED GUTS
TO WIN THIS DUEL,
NOT SKILL.

00:16:32.603 --> 00:16:35.070
GUTS, HUH?
WELL, HE'S GOT HEART.

00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:36.837
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:40.270
YES, BUT HE DID JUST
LEAVE HIS BEST CARD OUT,
FULLY VULNERABLE.

00:16:40.303 --> 00:16:43.703
YOU DON'T MAKE
THOSE KINDS OF MISTAKES
UNLESS YOU'RE NERVOUS.

00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:47.370
AND PANIK'S NOT ONE
TO LET A MISTAKE LIKE
THAT GO UNPUNISHED.

00:16:48.637 --> 00:16:50.670
MAKE YOUR MOVE,
PANIK.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.437
HA HA HA HA HA!
I MUST SAY...

00:16:54.437 --> 00:16:56.170
IT WAS QUITE
A DARING MOVE

00:16:56.170 --> 00:17:00.077
TO ILLUMINATE ME
WITH THE PRESENCE
OF THAT CARD, LITTLE YUGI.

00:17:00.377 --> 00:17:04.510
BUT IT WAS A CRITICAL MISTAKE
TO LEAVE IT ON THE FIELD
COMPLETELY EXPOSED!

00:17:05.777 --> 00:17:08.643
IF YOU THOUGHT IDLE CARDS
WERE SAFE FROM ATTACKS,

00:17:08.677 --> 00:17:10.610
YOU WERE DEAD WRONG!

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.210
REAPER OF THE CARDS!

00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:17.643
THE REAPER?

00:17:17.677 --> 00:17:19.310
WHEN THE REAPER IS SUMMONED,

00:17:19.343 --> 00:17:21.577
ALL MAGIC CARDS
HEAR THE GHOSTLY TOLL OF DOOM!

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:23.810
HE'LL BE SENDING
YOUR REVEALING LIGHT CARD

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.643
TO THE DISCARD GRAVEYARD,
LEAVING YOU DEFENSELESS!

00:17:27.643 --> 00:17:29.910
REAPER, ATTACK!

00:17:29.943 --> 00:17:31.077
YUGI!
YUGI!

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.010
BUT THAT CARD WAS
YUGI'S ONLY CHANCE!

00:17:33.043 --> 00:17:37.410
[MOANING]

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.210
OH!

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:44.777
YOUR FATE BELONGS TO ME NOW,
YUGI!

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.177
CALL OF THE GRAVEYARD!

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.210
HUH? [GASPS]

00:17:54.243 --> 00:17:56.377
HA HA HA HA HA...HUH?

00:17:56.943 --> 00:17:59.350
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:03.883
IT CAN'T FINISH
ITS ATTACK.

00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.183
MM...HUH?

00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:07.683
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:18:07.717 --> 00:18:09.550
IT SHOULD HAVE
DESTROYED YOUR CARD,

00:18:09.583 --> 00:18:11.750
THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:14.083
I SAID MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT

00:18:14.117 --> 00:18:16.583
IS THE CARD THAT
WOULD ILLUMINATE
YOUR MONSTERS.

00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:19.250
I NEVER SAID IT WAS
THE ONE I PLACED
ON THE FIELD.

00:18:19.283 --> 00:18:20.717
YOU JUST ASSUMED THAT.

00:18:20.717 --> 00:18:21.783
BUT IF THAT'S NOT‐‐

00:18:21.783 --> 00:18:25.583
THE CARD I PLACED
ON THE FIELD WAS
A DIFFERENT CARD.

00:18:25.617 --> 00:18:29.250
THE SPELL BINDING
CIRCLE‐‐A TRAP CARD.

00:18:29.283 --> 00:18:31.183
A TRAP...CARD!!

00:18:31.217 --> 00:18:33.750
YES, A TRAP CARD
THAT SNARES YOUR REAPER,

00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:36.083
STOPPING HIM DEAD
IN HIS TRACKS,

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.650
ENCIRCLING HIM
IN A MAGICAL PRISON.

00:18:41.017 --> 00:18:44.383
IN DUEL MONSTERS,
ONE MUST BE WARY OF
THE REAPER OF THE CARDS

00:18:44.383 --> 00:18:47.850
AND ITS ABILITY
TO SEND MAGIC CARDS
TO THE DISCARD PILE.

00:18:47.883 --> 00:18:49.850
I FIGURED THAT YOU
PROBABLY HAD ONE

00:18:49.883 --> 00:18:52.017
STALKING AROUND
IN YOUR DECK SOMEWHERE.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.950
BUT NOW THAT
HE'S FROZEN, UNABLE
TO DAMAGE MY DECK,

00:18:54.983 --> 00:18:56.517
I'M FREE TO LAY

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.550
WHATEVER MAGIC CARDS
I WANT ON THE FIELD.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.557
GREAT THINKING!

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.457
WAY TO PUT ONE
OVER ON HIM, YUGE!

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.257
WHAT IS IT WITH THIS KID?

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:06.090
I CAN'T EVEN
KEEP UP WITH HIM
HERE ON THE SIDELINES.

00:19:06.123 --> 00:19:08.523
Bakura: HE'S DOING GOOD,
BUT IT'S NOT OVER YET.

00:19:11.257 --> 00:19:13.657
HOW DARE YOU!!

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.423
YOU FOOLED ME!

00:19:15.457 --> 00:19:17.590
[CHUCKLES] YOU FOOLED
YOURSELF, PANIK,

00:19:17.623 --> 00:19:20.423
AND WASTED QUITE
A POWERFUL CARD, TOO.

00:19:20.457 --> 00:19:22.757
BUT NOW THAT
THE COAST IS CLEAR...

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.690
I'LL REALLY LAY
MY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:19:28.023 --> 00:19:29.423
AAAHHH!

00:19:29.457 --> 00:19:31.590
AND THE SECOND
MAGIC CARD...

00:19:31.623 --> 00:19:34.023
BOTH FACEDOWN.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.490
FACEDOWN? WHY?

00:19:38.523 --> 00:19:40.257
NOW WHAT'S UP?

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.923
I DON'T KNOW,

00:19:41.957 --> 00:19:44.857
BUT I BET WE'RE GOING
TO FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.223
SO WHAT. YOU CAPTURED
MY REAPER.

00:19:47.223 --> 00:19:50.057
BUT HE'S ONLY ONE
OF MY POWERFUL MONSTERS.

00:19:50.057 --> 00:19:53.123
THE ONES THAT REMAIN
WILL DESTROY YOU!

00:19:53.157 --> 00:19:55.423
[GROWLING]
