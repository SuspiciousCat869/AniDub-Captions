WHAT KIND OF TRICKS
HE'LL PULL.

WHATEVER TRICKS HE TRIES,

00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:54.361

BUT WAIT FOR THE DUEL
TO PLAY OUT.

ALL THE CARDS RIGHT NOW.

THE OUTCOME
OF THE GAME.

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.266
I'M GONNA SEE
IF I CAN FIND KAIBA
OR MOKUBA ANYWHERE,

00:06:33.266 --> 00:06:34.401
BECAUSE IF I CAN
GET 'EM BACK,

00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:36.002
EVEN WITHOUT THEIR SOULS,

00:06:36.002 --> 00:06:38.805
THEN PEGASUS WON'T HOLD
ALL THE CARDS.

EMPTY VESSELS--

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:16.076
YOU CAN ASK
FOR THIS ENTIRE ISLAND

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:19.713
OR DEMAND MR. PEGASUS'S
MILLENNIUM EYE AS YOUR PRIZE.

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:21.348
THIS IS CRAZY!

00:07:23.183 --> 00:07:25.352
OH. WELL,
WHERE'S TRISTAN?

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:28.288
OH. TRISTAN WANDERED OFF
SOMEWHERE BY HIMSELF.

00:07:28.288 --> 00:07:29.389
I'M NOT SURE WHERE.

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.224
PROBABLY JUST
WENT TO THE JOHN.

00:07:31.224 --> 00:07:33.793
FORGET HIM. THIS IS
JUST GETTIN' INTERESTIN'.

00:07:33.793 --> 00:07:36.229
HMM? "ANY REQUEST
WILL BE HONORED"?

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.032
WOW. THAT'S WHAT
I CALL A PRIZE.

00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:40.700
DO I KNOW HOW
TO THROW A TOURNAMENT...

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.435
OR DO I KNOW
HOW TO THROW

OF MY GRANDFATHER
AND ALL THE OTHERS.

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:50.510
YES...

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.213
BUT IF I AM THE ONE
THAT DEFEATS YOU INSTEAD,

00:07:53.213 --> 00:07:56.149
YOU HAVE TO FULFILL
YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN
AS WELL.
