00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.403
YOU'RE AT THE MERCY
OF MY MILLENNIUM EYE.

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.839
UGH!

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.340
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.243
I ALREADY KNOW
EVERY CARD YOU
KEEP IN YOUR DECK

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.411
AND HAVE IN MY
POSSESSION

00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:33.480
EVERY CARD NEEDED
TO STOP THEM.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.850
I CAN SEE EVERY STRATEGY
YOUR FEEBLE MIND
HAS CONCOCTED

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.619
AND HAVE ALREADY
DESIGNED MY OWN
COUNTER TACTICS

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:41.287
TO RENDER THEM
COMPLETELY USELESS!

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:43.289
BUT EVEN WITHOUT
MY MILLENNIUM MAGIC,

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.924
YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR ME.

00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:48.028
AFTER ALL, WHO NEEDS
MAGIC WITH THIS CARD?

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:51.498
PERHAPS YOU'LL
REMEMBER IT.

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:52.999
GRR.

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:55.335
THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI.
IT'S...

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.103
THE MAGICAL TOON WORLD!

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:10.550
I THOUGHT AS MUCH.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.684
OH!

00:09:11.684 --> 00:09:13.987
AW, MAN.
THIS AIN'T GOOD.

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:22.028
AS YOU RECALL, TOON WORLD
PROTECTS MY MONSTERS

00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:24.864
BENEATH ITS IMPENETRABLE
HARDBACK BINDINGS,

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.200
BINDINGS THAT THEY'LL
ONLY VACATE

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.668
WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT
TO ATTACK YOU!

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:30.703
HA HA HA!

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:33.039
OH, AND SEEING HOW
ALL MY MONSTERS

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.642
HAVE BEEN TRANSFORMED
TO THEIR SUPER-POWERED
TOON FORM,

00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:38.678
IT WILL BE AN ATTACK
THAT'S CERTAIN TO LEAVE
YOU IN STITCHES.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:39.846
HA HA HA HA!

00:09:39.846 --> 00:09:40.980
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.683
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.285
WHAT'S THE MATTER, YUGI-BOY?

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.153
DON'T YOU HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR?

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.222
HA HA HA HA!

00:09:49.222 --> 00:09:50.723
MANGA RYA-RAN!

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.193
ATTACK THE MONSTER
YUGI HAS IN DEFENSIVE MODE.

00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:56.162
NASTY NOSTRIL FLAME ATTACK!

00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.769
UNGH!

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:04.671
Pegasus: LOOKS LIKE YOUR
GIANT SOLDIER OF STONE

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:05.872
COULDN'T STAND THE HEAT.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:07.340
HA HA HA.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.608
ANH!

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.113
AREN'T MY TOONS
SIMPLY MARVELOUS?

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:16.015
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
THE SAME PROUD SATISFACTION

00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:17.550
THAT A PARENT WOULD.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.887
I GUESS THAT'S MY REWARD
FOR HAVING CREATED THE CARD.

00:10:20.887 --> 00:10:22.455
HA HA HA.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.690
[THINKING]
THAT CHEAT!

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.025
THE TOON WORLD CARD
IS ONE OF A KIND.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:28.194
IT WAS THOUGHT
TOO POWERFUL
FOR DISTRIBUTION.

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:30.430
THAT'S HOW HE WAS
ABLE TO BEAT KAIBA
WITH IT.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.099
AND NEXT I THINK I'LL
SWITCH THE TOON MERMAID

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:34.367
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.337
YOU KNOW?
TO LET HER OUT OF HER SHELL.

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:38.838
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:41.841
[THINKING]
HMM. IF I KEEP
THROWING MY MONSTERS

00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:46.779
IN DEFENSIVE MODE,
PEGASUS' TOONS WILL JUST
KEEP PICKING THEM OFF.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.849
MY ONLY CHANCE IS
TO TAKE THE OFFENSIVE.

00:10:49.849 --> 00:10:52.519
MAYBE BY ATTACKING,
I CAN UNCOVER SOME KIND
OF WEAKNESS

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.187
IN THESE TOON MONSTERS.

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:56.156
CELTIC GUARDIAN!

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:59.159
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:01.694
[THINKING]
MY GUARDIAN MAY NOT
PACK ENOUGH PUNCH

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.029
TO BEAT THAT MERMAID,

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:05.064
BUT WITH BOTH
THEIR ATTACKS AT 1,400,

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.167
SHE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO BEAT HIM EITHER.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.201
GO!

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:11.571
CELTIC GUARDIAN!
SILVERBLADE SLASH!

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.344
NO WAY!

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:21.247
THE CLAM CAUGHT
MY ATTACK!

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.129
HEE HEE HEE.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:28.888
Tea: THAT TOON CAUGHT
YUGI'S ATTACK?

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:30.423
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:11:30.423 --> 00:11:31.424
I DON'T KNOW, TEA.

00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.092
THAT MATCH-UP
SHOULDA BEEN A DRAW.

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:35.728
Pegasus: HA HA!
SHOULDA, WOULDA, COULDA.

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.198
I'M AFRAID THAT YOU'RE ALL
JUST GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:40.433
THE REALITY
OF THE SITUATION.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:43.503
YUGI'S GUARDIAN IS
THE CATCH OF THE DAY.
HA HA HA.

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:45.972
AND IF THERE'S ONE
THING I LOVE,

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:47.574
BESIDES WINNING, THAT IS,

00:11:47.574 --> 00:11:49.609
IT'S A FISH FRY!

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.380
UGH!

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:55.748
THAT WAS NO DRAW.

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.551
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SOMETHING'S OFF
WITH THOSE TOONS.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:03.056
[THINKING] OK, WELL,
MAYBE IF I PLAY
A STRONGER CARD.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.524
AFRAID NOT.

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:06.960
NO CARD IN YOUR DECK
IS STRONG ENOUGH.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.496
MY TOON MONSTERS
CAN'T BE BEATEN
BY SHEER BRUTE FORCE.

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.031
HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.804
[THINKING]
THEN WHAT CAN I DO?

00:12:17.804 --> 00:12:19.339
ATTACK IS USELESS.

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:21.808
THAT MILLENNIUM EYE
GIVES PEGASUS ACCESS
TO MY EVERY CARD,

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:23.810
THOUGHT,
AND STRATEGY.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.247
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY
WIN THIS DUEL?

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:32.552
IT'S MY TURN, YUGI-BOY.

00:12:32.552 --> 00:12:35.488
AND I THINK I'LL JUST
LAY THESE 2 CARDS

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.724
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:44.897
[THINKING]
GREAT. MORE TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:12:44.897 --> 00:12:46.666
IT'S MY MOVE NOW.

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:49.335
[THINKING] HMM.
WITH THOSE 2 CARDS OUT,

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.703
I GUESS I SHOULD DEFEND.

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.505
IT MAY COST ME
A MONSTER,

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:54.941
BUT IT'S BETTER
THAN LOSING LIFE POINTS.

00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:57.443
Yugi: I'M THROWING
A MONSTER IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.213
HA HA HA.

00:13:00.213 --> 00:13:02.548
I KNEW YOU WOULD,
YUGI-BOY.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:06.886
AFTER ALL, THAT'S THE REASON
WHY I PLAYED THIS CARD
FACE DOWN.

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:08.054
AND THEN...

00:13:08.054 --> 00:13:12.692
BEHOLD THE TRAP
KNOWN AS GORGON'S EYE!

00:13:12.692 --> 00:13:16.562
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
HIS GLANCE MOST ARRESTING.

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:22.535
MY IMP!

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.237
HE'S BEEN
TURNED TO STONE!

00:13:24.237 --> 00:13:25.371
Pegasus: AS WILL
EVERY OTHER MONSTER

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.240
YOU THROW IN DEFENSIVE MODE.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.910
FOR THE GORGON'S EYE
IS A PERMANENT TRAP.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.845
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
EVERY TIME I DESTROY

00:13:32.845 --> 00:13:34.547
ONE OF HIS CONCRETE
VICTIMS,

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.216
HALF OF THEIR DEFENSIVE
POWER WILL BE DEDUCTED

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.485
FROM YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.488
SORRY, BUT THERE IS
A BRIGHT SIDE TO HAVING

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:45.024
A SET OF FOSSILIZED
MONSTERS, YUGI-BOY.

00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:46.492
THEY MAKE FINE
PAPER WEIGHTS.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:49.429
HA HA HA!

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:51.597
UGH.

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:53.433
HMM. TOUGH CROWD.

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.135
WELL, HERE, MAYBE YOU CAN
LEARN TO LIGHTEN UP

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:58.571
FROM MY SECOND
FACEDOWN CARD.

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:02.175
DOPPLEGANGER, THE COPY CARD!

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:03.743
KNOW WHY HE'S
GRINNING, YUGI?

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:06.245
BECAUSE THIS LITTLE FELLA
LOVES WHAT HE DOES

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:08.881
AND DOES WHAT HE LOVES.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:10.550
[THINKING]
HE USED THIS ON KAIBA!

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.151
CORRECT, YUGI-BOY.

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.387
THIS LITTLE RASCAL
CAN TRANSFORM HIMSELF

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:17.557
INTO ANY CARD
ON THE FIELD THAT I WANT.

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:27.633
OH, BEG YOUR PARDON.
ANY CARD THAT <i>HE</i> WANTS.

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:30.169
SO WHICH ONE WILL IT
BE THIS TIME,
DOPPLEGANGER?

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.170
HUH?

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.638
[WHISPERING]

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:36.943
PERFECT. YOU ALWAYS
HAVE THE BEST IDEAS.

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.578
WELL, YUGI-BOY,

00:14:38.578 --> 00:14:42.448
IT SEEMS THAT HE WOULD
LIKE TO TRANSFORM INTO
THAT SUMMONED SKULL

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.851
THAT I DEFEATED A FEW
TURNS AGO.

00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.520
MY SKULL? HE'S
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.657
YES, BUT YOUR GRAVEYARD PILE
IS ON THE FIELD.

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:54.727
SO IT'S FAIR GAME
FOR MY DOPPLEGANGER.

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.728
OHH!

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.530
GO, MY FURRY FRIEND.

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:06.372
IT'S REALLY SOMETHING,
ISN'T IT, YUGI-BOY?

00:15:06.372 --> 00:15:08.708
I CAN COPY ONE
OF YOUR MONSTERS,

00:15:08.708 --> 00:15:10.376
RECRUIT HIM TO MY TEAM,

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:13.379
AND TURN HIM INTO A TOON
ALL IN ONE MOVE.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:28.428
AND WITH THAT, A DARK,
NEW CHAPTER OF TOON WORLD
HAS BEEN WRITTEN.

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.630
THE CHAPTER OF FIENDS!

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.999
AND HERE'S OUR STORY'S
PROTAGONIST.

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:36.035
OR ANTAGONIST,
DEPENDING UPON YOUR
POINT OF VIEW.

00:15:36.035 --> 00:15:37.870
THE TOON SKULL!

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.540
WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO HIM?

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.477
Pegasus: NOTHING COMPARED TO
WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO TO YOU!

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.220
YOU'RE TWISTED, PEGASUS.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.221
YOU TAKE SUCH DELIGHT

00:15:55.221 --> 00:15:57.890
IN CREATING SUCH
A MONSTROSITY.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.058
DON'T SAY THAT.

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.827
YOU'LL HURT ITS FEELINGS.

00:16:00.827 --> 00:16:02.195
YOU MAY NOT KNOW IT,

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:06.332
BUT BENEATH THAT
GRUFF EXTERIOR LIES
A VERY SENSITIVE TOON.

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:07.366
HA HA HA.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.837
PEGASUS, JUST MOVE!

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.839
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
YUGI-BOY.

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:14.540
HA HA HA.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:18.044
TOON SKULL,
LIGHTNING STRIKE ATTACK!

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:26.486
YOUR HORN IMP IS DEMOLISHED.

00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:28.154
AND SINCE HE WAS FIRST
TURNED TO STONE

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:30.156
BY MY MYSTIC
GORGON'S EYE TRAP,

00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:33.359
HALF HIS DEFENSE POWER IS
REMOVED FROM YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:16:45.171 --> 00:16:47.106
WHAT SPLENDID SHOWMANSHIP.

00:16:47.106 --> 00:16:49.675
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE,
YUGI-BOY?

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.945
PERHAPS I'LL COERCE HIM
TO DO AN ENCORE
A LITTLE BIT LATER.

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:55.481
THAT CREEP SURE LOVES
TO HEAR HIMSELF TALK.

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.350
UNGH! COME ON, YUGE,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.852
POP THAT MUSCLE-HEADED TOON
LIKE A BALLOON.

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:01.320
[THINKING]
BUT HOW?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.090
THE MAGIC OF TOON WORLD
MAKES IT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE.

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.926
Pegasus: IT'S YOUR TURN!

00:17:06.926 --> 00:17:08.427

HMM.

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:22.775
HA HA HA HA.

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:25.678
I SEE YOU'VE DRAWN
THE FABLED DARK MAGICIAN.

00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:27.079
ANH!

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:32.618
Pegasus: YOUR FAVORITE CARD,
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:36.122
HIS TROUNCING SHOULD BE
ESPECIALLY PAINFUL FOR YOU.

00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:37.757
HA HA HA.

00:17:37.757 --> 00:17:42.061
I SO LOOK FORWARD
TO WHEN YOU PUT HIM
INTO PLAY, YUGI-BOY.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:44.297
[THINKING]
AND I CAN CRUSH HIM.

00:17:44.297 --> 00:17:46.232
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:54.540
Tristan: HEY, BAKURA,
WHAT WAS IT YOU DID
BACK THERE?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.743
USING THAT MAGIC CARD,
BUT FOR REAL!

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:00.346
NOT NOW. THOSE GUARDS
ARE STILL BEHIND US.

00:18:00.346 --> 00:18:02.415
FINE, BUT SOMETHING'S
UP WITH YOU,

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:04.150
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TO TELL ME WHAT.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.118
[GROANING]

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.787
IT'S A NO GO.
THIS DOOR'S LOCKED.

00:18:07.787 --> 00:18:08.921
COME ON!

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:12.224
[FOOTSTEPS RUNNING]

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:17.430
LOOK! A WAY OUT!

00:18:19.732 --> 00:18:21.968
AAH! OHH!

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:23.736
OHH! OOH!

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.539
OHH! OHH! OHH!

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:28.608
WHOA, MAMA, PLEASE!

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.943
[GROANING]

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.445
UGH!
UGH!

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:36.816
I OWE YOU ONE, BAKURA.

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.553
[THINKING] Yugi:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:42.254
I CAN'T EVEN TRY
ATTACKING THOSE TOONS

00:18:42.254 --> 00:18:44.357
WHILE THEY'RE INSIDE
THAT MAGIC BOOK.

00:18:44.357 --> 00:18:48.160
AND THE GORGON'S EYE
TURNS ANY DEFENSE MONSTER
I THROW TO STONE.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.228
[SIGHS]

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:51.464
IT ALL JUST SEEMS
SO HOPELESS.

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.099
Pegasus: IT CERTAINLY DOES.

00:18:53.099 --> 00:18:54.600
OH, SORRY.
WERE YOU HAVING

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.169
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION
WITH YOURSELF?

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:58.204
I'M SO GAUCHE.

00:18:58.204 --> 00:19:00.039
I REALLY MUST LEARN
TO NOT KEEP BUTTING

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:02.408
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:06.245
AFTER ALL, ACCEPTING DEFEAT
IS SUCH A PERSONAL MATTER.

00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.513
AGH.

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.015
DON'T YOU LISTEN
TO HIM, YUGE.

00:19:09.015 --> 00:19:10.983
REMEMBER EVERYTHING
AT STAKE HERE.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.853
YOUR GRANDPA,
MOKUBA, KAIBA.

00:19:13.853 --> 00:19:16.255
THEY'RE ALL
COUNTING ON YOU,
YUGI.

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:17.923
AND WE KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO
COME THROUGH

FOR ALL OF THEM!

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.360
YOU CAN DO IT!
WE BELIEVE IN YOU!

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.695
YEAH!

[THINKING]
JOEY AND TEA ARE RIGHT.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.334
I JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER
WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR HERE:

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:31.303
TO SAVE THE SOUL
OF MY GRANDFATHER

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:35.241
AND THE SOULS OF BOTH
THE KAIBA BROTHERS, TOO.

HMM.

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:38.511
I CAN'T LET THEM DOWN.

00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:43.182
WELL, SEEIN' AS HOW
JUMPIN'S OUT OF
THE QUESTION,

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.718
I'D SAY WE'RE
AS GOOD AS CAUGHT.

00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:47.586
THERE THEY ARE!
COME ON!

00:19:47.586 --> 00:19:49.889
GET 'EM!

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:51.724
WELL, WE TRIED.

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:53.559
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WE TRIED"?

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.461
WE ARE NOT CAPTURED
JUST YET.

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:58.597
WE'RE TOTALLY OUT-MANNED.

00:19:58.597 --> 00:20:00.299
WE WON'T BE AFTER
I ENLIST SOME HELP

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.801
FROM
THE SHADOW REALM.

00:20:01.801 --> 00:20:02.768
HUH?

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:03.803
THE SHADOW REALM?

00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:05.137
THIS CAN'T BE GOOD.

YUGI!

00:20:12.745 --> 00:20:13.746
HANG TOUGH!

00:20:15.681 --> 00:20:17.049
[THINKING]
IF I GIVE UP HOPE NOW,

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.218
I'LL LOSE THOSE 3
FOREVER.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.087
THEIR SOULS WILL
REMAIN IMPRISONED

00:20:21.087 --> 00:20:22.488
IN THE SHADOW REALM,

00:20:22.488 --> 00:20:25.291
AND PEGASUS WILL BE FREE
TO CONTINUE HIS EVIL WAYS

00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:27.526
WITH NO ONE TO STOP HIM.

I CAN'T GIVE UP!

00:20:32.498 --> 00:20:35.367
AS HOPELESS AS IT SEEMS,
I HAVE TO KEEP
BATTLING.

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:38.037
I HAVE TO SAVE
MY FRIENDS.
