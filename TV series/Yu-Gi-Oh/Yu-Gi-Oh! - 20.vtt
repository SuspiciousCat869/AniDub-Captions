00:15:01.473 --> 00:15:03.441
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU OUGHTA BE SCARED.

00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:05.277
IT JUICES UP
ANY FIRE-BASED BLADE

00:15:05.277 --> 00:15:07.445
AND RAISES
ITS ATTACK POINTS 700.

00:15:07.445 --> 00:15:10.582
SWORDSMAN,
SALAMANDRA FLAMESTRIKE!

00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:15.387
WHERE IS IT GOING?!

00:15:15.387 --> 00:15:17.856
GOOD SHOW. NOT ONLY
DOES SALAMANDRA

00:15:17.856 --> 00:15:19.858
INCREASE
THE SWORDSMAN'S
ATTACK STRENGTH,

00:15:19.858 --> 00:15:22.327
BUT BECAUSE
OF THE WORM'S
WEAKNESS TO FIRE,

00:15:22.327 --> 00:15:23.795
IT NEGATES
THE BONUS POINTS

00:15:23.795 --> 00:15:25.697
THE WORM GOT FROM
THE MONSTER TAMER,

00:15:25.697 --> 00:15:27.999
RETURNING
ITS ATTACK POWER
TO 2,200.

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:30.368
Joey: LESS THAN MY
SUPERCHARGED SWORDSMAN.

00:15:30.368 --> 00:15:31.436
THE WORM TURNS.

00:15:31.436 --> 00:15:33.605
OR SHOULD I SAY BURNS?

00:15:33.605 --> 00:15:34.639
TOP THAT!

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.541
JOEY, GREAT MOVE.
GOOD GOING.

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:38.176
YOU DID IT.
YOU DID IT.

00:15:38.176 --> 00:15:40.345
YOU MUST DRAW
THE CARD WE NEED.

00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:41.346
INDEED.

00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:44.783
HMM. HA!
THE THIRD PIECE!

00:15:44.783 --> 00:15:46.384
THIS WILL
SEAL THEIR FATE.

00:15:46.384 --> 00:15:48.153
HMM. THE THIRD PIECE,
HA.

00:15:48.153 --> 00:15:49.454
WITH WHICH
WE'LL NOW CREATE...

00:15:49.454 --> 00:15:50.789
A MONSTER
WHO WILL...

00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:52.090
Both: ANNIHILATE!

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.658
AAH!
AAH!

00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:54.659
HA!
HA!

00:15:54.659 --> 00:15:56.161
AGAINST THE...
TRINITY.

00:15:56.161 --> 00:15:57.362
Para: THEY CAN'T DEFEND...

00:15:57.362 --> 00:15:59.698
Dox: ALL THEIR LIFE POINTS
WE WILL REND.

00:15:59.698 --> 00:16:03.034
Both: SUMMON
KAZEJIN, GOD OF WIND.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.739
UH, YUGI, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:16:07.739 --> 00:16:10.275
OH, NO.
THE TRINITY!

00:16:10.275 --> 00:16:12.711
IT'S IN
THE CLASS OF EXODIA.

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.179
Joey: WHOA.

00:16:16.014 --> 00:16:18.583
Para, Dox:
ELEMENTS OF THUNDER,
WATER, AND WIND,

00:16:18.583 --> 00:16:21.019
SUIJIN, SANGA,
KAZEJIN, BEGIN.

00:16:21.019 --> 00:16:23.054
MELD YOUR POWERS
IN ETERNAL LIGHT.

00:16:23.054 --> 00:16:26.157
SHOW THESE FOOLS
YOUR UNSTOPPABLE MIGHT.

00:16:26.157 --> 00:16:27.459
HERE IT COMES.

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:28.893
WHAT IS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.

00:16:28.893 --> 00:16:31.162
Para: HE IS PAIN
BEYOND DESCRIPTION.

00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:34.065
Dox: HE'LL MARK THE GRAVES
WITH YOUR INSCRIPTION.

00:16:34.065 --> 00:16:36.501
Both: GATE GUARDIAN!

00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:38.937
[GROWLS]

00:16:43.193 --> 00:16:44.294
Para, Dox:
AGAINST OUR GATE GUARDIAN,

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:46.530
YOU CANNOT POSSIBLY WIN.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.866
OH, IT HAS THE STRENGTH
OF 3 MONSTERS.

00:16:48.866 --> 00:16:51.201
YEAH.
HE'S 3 GUYS IN ONE.

00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:53.437
WE'RE NEVER GETTIN'
OUT OF THIS MAZE.

00:16:53.437 --> 00:16:54.838
Téa: NOW WHAT DO THEY DO?

00:16:54.838 --> 00:16:56.640
Bakura:
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS LOOKS BAD.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.042
DON'T BE
SO DOWNBEAT,
BAKURA.

00:16:59.042 --> 00:17:00.210
IF THEY
DON'T BEAT 'EM,

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.778
WE'LL NEVER
GET OUT OF
THE LABYRINTH.

00:17:01.778 --> 00:17:04.648
TRISTAN, THANKS
FOR CHEERING ME UP, MATE.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:05.949
SO, THINK
YOU CAN BEAT US

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:07.284
WITH YOUR
BIG MULTIPLE GUY?

00:17:07.284 --> 00:17:08.619
WELL, WE'RE
NOT GIVIN' UP.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.587
LET'S GO. BRING IT ON!

00:17:10.587 --> 00:17:13.290
HA HA HA HA HA.
YOU MUST BE MAD.

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.659
NO ONE'S
EVER GOTTEN PAST
THE GATE GUARDIAN.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.461
HE IS COMPOSED
OF 3 PARTS,

00:17:17.461 --> 00:17:19.496
EACH CONTROLLING
AN ELEMENTAL FORCE.

00:17:19.496 --> 00:17:21.765
YOU'LL
NEVER GET PAST
HIS COMBINED POWER.

00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:23.133
YOU WILL WANDER
THE LABYRINTH...

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:25.369
Both: LOST FOR ALL ETERNITY.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.038
ME AND YUGI'LL TAKE ON
ANYTHING THAT YOU GOT!

00:17:28.038 --> 00:17:30.040
JOEY'S RIGHT. WE'RE A TEAM.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.209
YOU'LL NEVER BEAT
OUR COMBINED POWER.

00:17:32.209 --> 00:17:33.410
TAKE YOUR TURN.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.478
HA.
HA.

00:17:34.478 --> 00:17:36.613
I TOLD YOU
TO TAKE ME
TO MOKUBA,

00:17:36.613 --> 00:17:37.614
NOT ON A TOUR.

00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:38.982
IT'S ENDLESS.

00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:40.651
THESE TUNNELS
ARE HONEYCOMBED

00:17:40.651 --> 00:17:42.452
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE ISLAND.

00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:43.787
WITHOUT ME TO GUIDE YOU,

00:17:43.787 --> 00:17:46.056
YOU COULD GET LOST
DOWN HERE FOR YEARS.

00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:48.058
DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:50.060
LISTEN, SLIM,
I'M MUCH BIGGER

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.195
AND MUCH STRONGER
THAN YOU ARE.

00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:54.331
YOU ONLY
GOT THE JUMP ON ME

00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:57.034
'CAUSE YOU SNUCK UP
AND TOOK ME BY SURPRISE.

00:17:57.034 --> 00:17:59.836
WHAT'S TO STOP ME
FROM SPINNIN' AROUND
RIGHT NOW

00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:01.004
AND KNOCKIN' YOUR--UHH.

00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:03.106
TRY IT,
AND I'LL DROP YOU

00:18:03.106 --> 00:18:04.374
WHERE YOU STAND.

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:06.109
WELL, WHEN
YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

00:18:06.109 --> 00:18:07.911
NOTHING
WOULD PLEASE ME MORE

00:18:07.911 --> 00:18:10.781
THAN TO REUNITE YOU
WITH YOUR BROTHER MOKUBA.

00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:14.284
[THINKING]
YOU PROMISED, SETO.

00:18:14.284 --> 00:18:16.853
YOU PROMISED YOU'D NEVER
LET ANYONE SEPARATE US.

00:18:16.853 --> 00:18:19.056
EVEN AT THE ORPHANAGE,

00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.225
WHEN ALL THE OTHER BOYS
WERE BEING ADOPTED
ONE BY ONE,

00:18:22.225 --> 00:18:25.362
SOME PARENTS WANTED YOU--
SAID YOU WERE A GENIUS--

00:18:25.362 --> 00:18:29.666
BUT YOU REFUSED
TO GO WITHOUT ME.

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:31.935
Young Mokuba: THANK YOU.
THAT COULD'VE BEEN YOU.

00:18:31.935 --> 00:18:34.938
[THINKING]
BUT YOU SAID WE WEREN'T
LEAVING THE ORPHANAGE

00:18:34.938 --> 00:18:37.541
UNTIL WE COULD BOTH
LEAVE TOGETHER.

00:18:37.541 --> 00:18:39.276
Young Mokuba:
YOU WON'T LET THEM
SEPARATE US?

00:18:39.276 --> 00:18:41.011
Young Seto: NEVER.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:42.813
NO ONE WILL
EVER KEEP US APART.

00:18:44.047 --> 00:18:46.316
[THINKING]
BUT WHAT ABOUT PEGASUS?

00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:48.619
YOU COULDN'T STOP HIM
FROM CAPTURING ME.

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:51.722
IS HE TOO MUCH
FOR YOU TO HANDLE?

00:18:51.722 --> 00:18:54.057
WHAT IF
HE'S GOT YOU, TOO?

00:18:54.057 --> 00:18:57.494
Kemo: OK, THIS
IS AS FAR AS WE GO.

00:18:57.494 --> 00:18:59.129
WHERE'S MOKUBA?

00:18:59.129 --> 00:19:02.265
IN PEGASUS' GRIP,
JUST LIKE YOU'LL
SOON BE, KAIBA.

00:19:02.265 --> 00:19:03.500
STOP PLAYING GAMES.

00:19:05.335 --> 00:19:08.005
[BUZZER SOUNDING]
AH! THE ALARM.

00:19:08.005 --> 00:19:09.773
IF YOU WANT
TO FIND YOUR BROTHER

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:12.442
BEFORE REINFORCEMENTS
ARRIVE, BETTER HURRY.

00:19:12.442 --> 00:19:15.078
SECURITY WILL BE HERE
ANY MOMENT.

00:19:15.078 --> 00:19:17.881
MOKUBA! UNH.

00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:18.982
I'VE GOTTA GET HIM
OUT OF HERE,

00:19:18.982 --> 00:19:21.284
AWAY FROM PEGASUS.

00:19:23.887 --> 00:19:25.722
SIR, KEMO
HAS REPORTED IN.

00:19:25.722 --> 00:19:26.790
IT SEEMS
SETO KAIBA

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.492
HAS BEEN SPOTTED
IN THE TUNNELS.

00:19:28.492 --> 00:19:30.794
HMM,
ONCE AGAIN, CROQUET,

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:33.163
YOU REPORT
WHAT I ALREADY KNOW.

00:19:33.163 --> 00:19:35.032
I BEG YOUR
PARDON, MASTER.

00:19:35.032 --> 00:19:36.633
YOU CAN BEG LATER
WHEN YOU ARE PUNISHED.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:37.734
HUH?

00:19:37.734 --> 00:19:39.803
SETO KAIBA'S PRESENCE
ON THE ISLAND

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.772
WAS NOT PART
OF MY ORIGINAL PLAN,

00:19:41.772 --> 00:19:44.207
BUT PERHAPS
I CAN TURN THIS

00:19:44.207 --> 00:19:46.576
TO MY ADVANTAGE
AND MY AMUSEMENT.

00:19:46.576 --> 00:19:50.313
Seto:
MOKUBA? MOKUBA?

00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:51.381
SETO!

00:19:51.381 --> 00:19:52.949
MY BROTHER'S HERE!

00:19:52.949 --> 00:19:54.885
IT'S YOUR TURN,
YUGI.

00:19:54.885 --> 00:19:56.620
ATTACK THAT
BIG, UGLY LUG!

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.889
NOTHING IN MY DECK
IS POWERFUL ENOUGH

00:19:58.889 --> 00:20:00.557
TO ATTACK THE GATE GUARDIAN.

00:20:00.557 --> 00:20:03.593
I CAN ONLY PLAY THESE.

00:20:03.593 --> 00:20:05.462
Para: WHAT A WASTE
OF A TURN.

00:20:05.462 --> 00:20:07.597
YOU'RE FRIGHTENED,
FOR ALL YOUR MONSTERS

00:20:07.597 --> 00:20:09.866
ARE TOO WEAK
TO ATTACK OURS.

00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:12.569
GATE GUARDIAN,
USE YOUR IMMENSE POWER.

00:20:12.569 --> 00:20:13.904
ATTACK FLAME SWORDSMAN.

00:20:13.904 --> 00:20:16.173
ELIMINATE HIM
FROM THE FIELD.

00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:18.842
THIS IS IT, BUD.

00:20:18.842 --> 00:20:20.410
WE'RE GOIN' DOWN
IN A BIG WAY.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:21.511
UNH.

00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:23.847
Para: THUNDERSTROKE ATTACK!

00:20:24.981 --> 00:20:27.226
Joey: FLAME SWORDSMAN
IS ABOUT TO FLAME OUT.
