JUST STOMPED WEEVIL.

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:10.262
YUGI, THESE GUYS
ANY GOOD?

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:12.731
OH, YEAH. THEY'RE BOTH
PRETTY TOUGH CUSTOMERS.

00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:14.566
WEEVIL SPECIALIZES
IN INSECT CARDS,

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:16.468
AND HE'S A GREAT
STRATEGIST.

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:17.836
THEN YOU'VE GOT
REX RAPTOR

00:07:17.836 --> 00:07:20.706
AND HIS DINOSAUR CARDS.
HE USES THEIR POWER

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:22.808
TO OVERWHELM
HIS OPPONENTS.

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:25.844
ITSY-BITSY BUGS
AGAINST DUELIN'
DINOSAURS?

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:28.313
RAPTOR HAS GOT
THIS ONE IN THE BAG.

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:31.316
Yugi: I WOULDN'T
BE SO SURE.

00:07:31.316 --> 00:07:33.785
ALL RIGHT, WEEVIL.

00:07:33.785 --> 00:07:37.623
CONSIDER YOURSELF
DINOSAUR CHOW!

PLAYS THE STRONGEST CARD
IN HIS DECK--

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:43.395
THE TERRIBLE 2-HEADED
KING REX!

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:46.598
LOOKS LIKE THIS MATCH
COULD BE OVER RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW!

MONSTER FANS,

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.798
AND WITH THE 2-HEADED
KING REX IN PLAY,

00:07:54.798 --> 00:07:57.468
IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS DUEL IS ALL DONE.

00:07:57.468 --> 00:07:58.502
YOUR MOVE.

00:07:58.502 --> 00:07:59.703
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:02.039
AND ALL I HAVE IS
THIS WEAK LITTLE BUG.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.809
Announcer:
WEEVIL UNDERWOOD COUNTERS

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:08.379
WITH A BASIC INSECT CARD.

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:09.513
HE PLAYS A WIMPY BUG

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:11.281
AGAINST A GIANT
DINOSAUR?

00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:13.350
THE PLACE WILL BE
COVERED IN BUG GUTS.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.353
MAYBE, BUT I WOULDN'T
UNDERESTIMATE WEEVIL.

00:08:16.353 --> 00:08:18.856
KING REX, LET'S TAKE
THIS CHAMPIONSHIP.

HEE HEE HEE.

00:08:22.459 --> 00:08:24.695
YOU ATTACKED YOUR WAY
INTO MY TRAP,

00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:27.831
BUT THEN,
HOW COULD YOUR TINY
DINOSAUR BRAIN KNOW

00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.834
WHEN AN ENEMY ATTACKS,
MY VORTEX ACTIVATES.
[COMPUTER BEEPS]

00:08:30.834 --> 00:08:32.836
OH, NO!
IT'S A TRAP CARD!

00:08:32.836 --> 00:08:34.138
WHICH TOTALLY TRAPS

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:36.607

INESCAPABLE EMBRACE.

NO, MY KING REX!

00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:43.347
AND WHILE
HE'S TRAPPED THERE,

00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:45.649
I'LL UPGRADE
MY BASIC INSECT

00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:47.818
BY GIVING HIM ARMOR
WITH FIRE POWER.

00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:55.793
NOT SUCH A WEAK
LITTLE BUG AFTER ALL, HMM?

WOW! BEATEN BY A BUG.

WE'LL HAVE THOUSANDS
OF DUELISTS FLOCKING

00:10:15.239 --> 00:10:16.940
YES. AN EVENT
SUCH AS THIS

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.009
WILL HOPEFULLY ATTRACT
THOSE WHO POSSESS

00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:21.245
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS
I SEEK.

00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:22.513

00:11:03.353 --> 00:11:07.357
I HAVE HEARD SOME TERRIBLY
INTERESTING THINGS
ABOUT YOU, YUGI.

00:11:07.357 --> 00:11:08.458
HUH?

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:10.194
YOUR IMPRESSIVE DEFEAT
OF SETO KAIBA

00:11:10.194 --> 00:11:11.461
INTRIGUED ME SO MUCH,

00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:12.963
I'VE DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE

00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:15.833
YOUR AMAZING DUELING SKILLS
PERSONALLY.

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:16.900
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW,

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.635
WE SHALL HOLD
A SPECIAL DUEL.

00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:21.605
WE'LL PLAY WITH A STRICT
TIME LIMIT OF 15 MINUTES,

00:11:21.605 --> 00:11:22.773
AND WHEN TIME'S UP,

00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:24.842
THE PLAYER WITH
THE HIGHEST LIFE POINTS

00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:26.076
WILL BE THE WINNER.

00:11:26.076 --> 00:11:27.678
ARE YOU READY?

EXPECT YOU TO FIGHT A DUEL

AGAINST A VIDEOTAPE?

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:32.282
THAT'S CRAZY.

AND THE OTHERS
AREN'T MOVING.

WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TO THEM?!

00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:43.994
WHERE HAVE YOU
TAKEN US?

[LAUGHS]

00:11:45.128 --> 00:11:47.164
WE ARE NO LONGER
IN THE WORLD YOU KNOW,

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:49.600
BUT I WILL RETURN YOU
AFTER OUR GAME.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.635

START THE CLOCK
AND MAKE YOUR MOVE,

00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:14.157
CERTAINLY, LET'S BEGIN.

00:12:14.157 --> 00:12:17.461
NERVOUS, YUGI-BOY?
YOU SHOULD BE.

00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:21.131
YOU HAVE NEVER FACED
A DUELIST LIKE ME BEFORE.

00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:22.466
YOU MAY BE GOOD.

00:12:22.466 --> 00:12:24.134
I ASSURE YOU I AM.

00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:26.770
BUT I WILL BEAT YOU
TO SAVE MY FRIENDS.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.239
YOU WON'T SAVE ANYONE
WITH THAT DRAGON CARD.

00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:30.240
HOW--

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.775
I TOLD YOU
YOU'VE NEVER FACED

00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:33.510
ANYONE LIKE ME BEFORE.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.046
I KNOW EVERY MOVE
YOU'LL MAKE

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:38.849
BEFORE YOU CAN
EVEN MAKE IT.

00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:44.210
Pegasus: KNOWING
EVERY MOVE YOU'LL MAKE

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.278
GIVES ME
A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE,

00:12:45.278 --> 00:12:46.779
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?
Yugi: WHAT?!

00:12:46.779 --> 00:12:49.415
FOR EXAMPLE, I CAN
ANTICIPATE YOUR NEXT PLAY

00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:52.285
AND COUNTER IT WITH
THIS DRAGON CAPTURE JAR.

00:12:53.486 --> 00:12:54.854
Yugi: AAH!

00:12:54.854 --> 00:12:57.223
IT WILL DRAW
THE KOUMORI DRAGON
FROM YOUR CARD

00:12:57.223 --> 00:12:59.058
AND IMPRISON THE BEAST.

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.897

PLAYED AGAINST ME.

00:13:04.897 --> 00:13:06.299

THIS IS CRAZY.

FIRST HE READS MY MIND,

00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:09.902
THEN HE BRINGS
THE MONSTER
ON MY CARD TO LIFE.

00:13:09.902 --> 00:13:12.939
THIS DARK DIMENSION
WE'RE IN IS KNOWN
AS THE "SHADOW REALM,"

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:15.308
A MYSTICAL PLACE
WHERE INCREDIBLE MONSTERS

00:13:15.308 --> 00:13:17.310
CAN BE SUMMONED
AND THE IMPOSSIBLE

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.911
IS QUITE POSSIBLE.

00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:21.147
BUT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME
CAN'T BE TRUE.

00:13:21.147 --> 00:13:22.548
TELL ME, YUGI,
DO YOU BELIEVE

00:13:22.548 --> 00:13:24.717
THERE IS MAGIC
IN THESE CARDS?

00:13:24.717 --> 00:13:26.652
DON'T YOU KNOW?
YOU INVENTED THIS GAME.

00:13:26.652 --> 00:13:28.454
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T.

00:13:28.454 --> 00:13:29.722
HUH?!

00:13:29.722 --> 00:13:31.224
IN ANCIENT TIMES,
THE EGYPTIANS

00:13:31.224 --> 00:13:33.392
CALLED THIS
THE SHADOW GAME.

00:13:33.392 --> 00:13:36.095
POWERFUL PHARAOHS
WOULD HOLD MYSTICAL DUELS

00:13:36.095 --> 00:13:38.731
IN OTHER DIMENSIONS
JUST AS WE'RE DOING NOW,

00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:40.666
BUT NOT WITH CARDS.

00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:42.668
THEY BATTLED
WITH REAL MONSTERS

00:13:42.668 --> 00:13:44.170
AND REAL MAGIC--

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.105
MAGICAL FORCES
SO POWERFUL

00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:48.608
THE EGYPTIANS
LOST CONTROL OF THEM

00:13:48.608 --> 00:13:51.644
AND NEARLY DESTROYED
THE ENTIRE WORLD.

00:13:51.644 --> 00:13:53.112
IT'S A GOOD STORY,
PEGASUS,

00:13:53.112 --> 00:13:55.047
BUT THESE MONSTERS
CAN'T BE REAL.

00:13:55.047 --> 00:13:57.450
TELL THAT TO
MY DRAGON-CHARMER.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.087
AS HIS FLUTE OF RESURRECTION
FREES YOUR KOUMORI DRAGON,

00:14:01.087 --> 00:14:03.222
BUT PUTS HIM
UNDER MY CONTROL.

00:14:03.222 --> 00:14:04.590
[ROARS]

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.459

HA! AS YOU SEE, YUGI,

00:14:17.804 --> 00:14:20.206

ARE VERY REAL,

HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH,

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.476
AND ALSO QUITE DANGEROUS.

00:14:23.476 --> 00:14:25.912
HEH HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:14:25.912 --> 00:14:27.213
AHH, YUGI-BOY.

00:14:27.213 --> 00:14:28.648
YOU REALLY ARE
QUITE ENTERTAINING--

00:14:28.648 --> 00:14:30.950
THE WAY YOU
SCOWL AND SNEER,

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.852
SO DEFIANT AND YET HELPLESS

00:14:32.852 --> 00:14:34.687
AND SO COMPLETELY
IGNORANT

00:14:34.687 --> 00:14:37.390
OF THE POWER OF
YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.126
WHAT?!
5,000 YEARS AGO,

00:14:40.126 --> 00:14:41.527
A POWERFUL PHARAOH

00:14:41.527 --> 00:14:44.297
LOCKED THE MAGIC
OF THE SHADOW GAMES AWAY.

00:14:44.297 --> 00:14:46.165
WHAT'S THIS HAVE
TO DO WITH ME?

00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:48.968
THE PHARAOH CAPTURED
THESE VAST MAGICAL ENERGIES

00:14:48.968 --> 00:14:51.671
IN 7 MYSTICAL
MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

00:14:51.671 --> 00:14:53.272
7 ITEMS?

00:14:53.272 --> 00:14:56.776
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
MY PUZZLE'S ONE OF THEM?

00:14:56.776 --> 00:14:59.779
YES, AND THERE ARE MYSTICAL
ENERGIES LOCKED WITHIN IT--

00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:02.048
MAGIC THAT COULD CHANGE
YOUR LIFE FOREVER

00:15:02.048 --> 00:15:04.851
IF YOU ONLY KNEW
HOW TO UNLEASH IT.

00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:06.819
BUT WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

00:15:06.819 --> 00:15:10.056
WHY? SIMPLY BECAUSE
I NEED YOU TO KNOW.

00:15:10.056 --> 00:15:11.457
BUT PERHAPS I HAVE
SAID TOO MUCH,

00:15:11.457 --> 00:15:13.793
AND SINCE THE CLICK
IS STILL TICKING,

00:15:13.793 --> 00:15:16.796
I PROPOSE WE RESUME
PLAYING OUR LITTLE DUEL.

00:15:16.796 --> 00:15:18.698
[THINKING] HE'S RIGHT.
TIME'S RUNNING OUT,

00:15:18.698 --> 00:15:19.765
AND I STILL
HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:21.367
WHETHER HE CAN
REALLY READ MY MIND

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:22.802
OR IF IT'S
SOME KIND OF TRICK.

00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:31.344
[SIGHS] I'VE GOT TO
TRY SOMETHING.

00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:33.045
MAYBE MY ZOMBIE WARRIOR.

00:15:33.045 --> 00:15:34.480
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.681
WAIT A MINUTE!

00:15:35.681 --> 00:15:37.550
HE DEFINITELY KNOWS
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.584
BUT HOW?

00:15:38.584 --> 00:15:40.219
IT'S GOT TO HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO

00:15:40.219 --> 00:15:41.954
WITH THAT
WEIRD EYE OF HIS.

00:15:46.192 --> 00:15:47.460
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.528
THAT WEIRD EYE MUST
SOMEHOW LET HIM SEE

00:15:49.528 --> 00:15:50.930
THE CARDS IN MY HAND.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.198
SO, NO MATTER
WHICH CARD I PICK,

00:15:52.198 --> 00:15:54.166
HE'S ALREADY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF ME,

00:15:54.166 --> 00:15:57.436
BUT THAT
GIVES ME AN IDEA.

00:15:57.436 --> 00:16:00.673
HURRY UP, NOW, YUGI-BOY.
TIME IS RUNNING OUT

00:16:00.673 --> 00:16:02.942
FOR YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

00:16:02.942 --> 00:16:04.377
PEGASUS IS
EXPECTING ME TO PLAY

00:16:04.377 --> 00:16:06.345
ONE OF THE CARDS
IN MY HAND,

00:16:06.345 --> 00:16:10.449
BUT WHAT IF I PLAY
A CARD EVEN I HAVEN'T
SEEN YET?

00:16:10.449 --> 00:16:12.318
WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DRAW A NEW CARD

00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:13.653
STRAIGHT FROM THE DECK

00:16:13.653 --> 00:16:15.388
WITHOUT EVEN
LOOKING AT IT.

00:16:15.388 --> 00:16:19.458
I ALREADY KNOW YOU PLAN
TO PLAY THE ZOMBIE WARRIOR,

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:21.694
AND I'M ALREADY
PREPARED TO COUNTER IT

00:16:21.694 --> 00:16:22.995
WITH A TRAP CARD

00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:26.065
THAT MAKES EVEN ZOMBIES
LIE DOWN AND PLAY DEAD.

00:16:26.065 --> 00:16:27.700
NOT THIS TIME.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.535
I FIGURED OUT YOUR
LITTLE GAME, PEGASUS.

00:16:29.535 --> 00:16:31.737
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE
THE CARDS IN MY HAND,

00:16:31.737 --> 00:16:34.807
BUT YOU CAN'T SEE
THE CARDS I PULL
FROM THE DECK.

00:16:34.807 --> 00:16:35.808
HMM?

00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:37.810
MY NEXT CARD IS...

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.779
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:16:41.013 --> 00:16:44.283
OOH, A BIG, SCARY
DARK MAGICIAN.

00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:46.352
MOCK ME ALL YOU LIKE,
PEGASUS,

00:16:46.352 --> 00:16:48.788
BUT MY MAGICIAN WILL
DESTROY THAT DRAGON!

00:16:48.788 --> 00:16:52.024
GO RIGHT AHEAD
IF YOU THINK IT'LL HELP.

00:16:52.024 --> 00:16:54.260
IT'LL DO MORE
THAN HELP, PEGASUS.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.028
IT'LL BRING YOU
CLOSER TO DEFEAT

00:16:56.028 --> 00:16:58.531
AND BRING ME CLOSER
TO SAVING MY FRIENDS.

00:16:58.531 --> 00:17:02.335
IF IT CAN DO ALL THAT,
BY ALL MEANS, PLAY IT.

00:17:02.335 --> 00:17:03.703
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:17:06.806 --> 00:17:08.874
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:17:10.242 --> 00:17:12.244
AAH!

00:17:12.244 --> 00:17:13.245
[SHATTERS]

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:17.717
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:17.717 --> 00:17:18.751
NICELY PLAYED,

00:17:18.751 --> 00:17:20.920
BUT BY USING
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.455
YOU'VE LET ME MANIPULATE
YOU ONCE AGAIN.

00:17:22.455 --> 00:17:23.856
AHH.

00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:27.293
BY PLAYING THAT ONE CARD,
YOU HAVE INSURED MY VICTORY.

00:17:27.293 --> 00:17:28.561
NO.

00:17:28.561 --> 00:17:31.664
WE SHALL SEE, YUGI.

00:17:31.664 --> 00:17:34.166
OH, A VERY RARE CARD.

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:37.670
THIS IS THE FEARSOME
FACELESS MAGE.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.905
I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT CARD BEFORE,

00:17:39.905 --> 00:17:41.207
BUT MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:17:41.207 --> 00:17:43.909
IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST
MAGIC CARDS IN THE GAME.

00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:45.311
BUT HOW WILL HE FARE

00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:47.747
ONCE I COMBINE
MY FACELESS MAGE

00:17:47.747 --> 00:17:49.982
WITH THE EQUALLY RARE
EYE OF ILLUSION?

00:17:49.982 --> 00:17:51.017
[LAUGHS]

00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:53.352
DARK MAGICIAN,
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:17:55.788 --> 00:17:57.890
[LAUGHS]

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:02.128
[GROANS]

00:18:02.128 --> 00:18:03.229
DARK MAGICIAN!

00:18:04.563 --> 00:18:06.999
[THINKING] MY ATTACK
HAD NO AFFECT AT ALL.

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:09.468
HIS FACELESS MAGE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED,

00:18:09.468 --> 00:18:10.569
BUT IT'S STILL STANDING

00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:12.972
AND I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:18.377
Yugi, thinking: I'M UP
BY 300 LIFE POINTS,

00:18:18.377 --> 00:18:20.613
BUT ONLY BECAUSE PEGASUS
IS TOYING WITH ME.

00:18:20.613 --> 00:18:22.548
I'VE GOT TO FIND
A WAY TO BEAT HIM

00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:24.917
AT HIS OWN SHADOW GAME.

00:18:30.547 --> 00:18:31.915
[THINKING] PEGASUS KNOWS
ALL KINDS OF TRICKS,

00:18:31.915 --> 00:18:34.284
BUT I GOT TO FIND
A WAY TO DEFEAT HIM.

00:18:34.284 --> 00:18:37.421
I JUST HAVE TO TRUST
IN MY GRANDPA'S CARDS.

00:18:39.256 --> 00:18:42.326
I ATTACK YOUR COMBO
WITH THE ELF SWORDSMAN.

00:18:42.326 --> 00:18:43.327
THIS MIGHTY WARRIOR

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:45.395
WILL CUT
YOUR FACELESS MAGE

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.097
DOWN TO SIZE.

00:18:47.097 --> 00:18:49.132
TRUE, YOUR ELF IS MIGHTY,

00:18:49.132 --> 00:18:51.168
BUT YOU HAVE ONCE AGAIN
UNDERESTIMATED

00:18:51.168 --> 00:18:53.737
THE INCREDIBLE POWER
OF MY EYE OF ILLUSION.

00:18:53.737 --> 00:18:55.339
HA HA!
NO!

00:18:55.339 --> 00:18:56.573

AAH!

00:19:01.311 --> 00:19:03.380
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.848
THE FACELESS MAGE
DOESN'T HAVE

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:06.383
A DARK MAGIC ATTACK.

00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:07.885
OH, NO!

00:19:07.885 --> 00:19:09.987
[THINKING] IT WAS
MY OWN DARK MAGICIAN

00:19:09.987 --> 00:19:11.455
THAT ATTACKED ME.

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:13.357
PEGASUS IS
CONTROLLING HIM

00:19:13.357 --> 00:19:16.293
WITH THE EYE OF ILLUSION.

00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:19.096
BUT IF HE'S USING
ITS MAGIC TO CONTROL
MY MAGICIAN,

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:20.797
WHAT'S PROTECTING
HIS MAGE?

00:19:20.797 --> 00:19:23.467
WELL, YUGI, OUR TIME
TOGETHER IS NEARLY UP,

00:19:23.467 --> 00:19:25.302
AND AS I'VE MORE
LIFE POINTS THAN YOU,

00:19:25.302 --> 00:19:29.339
IT APPEARS I AM THE VICTOR.

00:19:29.339 --> 00:19:31.441
TIME'S NOT UP
JUST YET, PEGASUS,

00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:32.976
AND YOU'VE LEFT
YOUR FACELESS MAGE

VULNERABLE TO
A PHYSICAL ASSAULT.

00:19:35.312 --> 00:19:38.148

BUT HOW CLOSE WAS THAT?

00:19:48.325 --> 00:19:50.327
IF YOU HAD BEEN ABLE
TO COMPLETE THAT ATTACK,

00:19:50.327 --> 00:19:51.995
I WOULD HAVE LOST.

00:19:51.995 --> 00:19:53.997
BUT I DIDN'T, DID I?

00:19:53.997 --> 00:19:57.534

OF YOUR TALENTS THIS DAY,
