HOW IT WORKS.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.777

KIND OF LIKE YOUR DUELLING DECK,

00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:31.578

YOU SHUFFLE YOUR DECK,

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:40.954

WILL RANDOMIZE YOUR 15 DICE

YOU ROLL ALL 3
AT THE SAME TIME,

00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:49.263

TO MAKE YOUR MOVE,

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:51.098
DEPENDING ON WHAT
YOU ROLLED.

00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:53.734

MORE ABOUT THAT A BIT LATER.

OUT OF THE AUTO HATCH.

THE WAY TO DESTROY
YOUR OPPONENT'S
HEART POINTS

HEH, YEAH, 'CAUSE
THE LEVEL OF DICE YOU THREW

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:47.407
WERE WAY TOO HIGH.

SORRY. DIDN'T I MENTION
THAT DIFFERENT DICE
HAD DIFFERENT LEVELS?

00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:53.247
RRR.
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS:

00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:56.750
THERE ARE 6 TYPES OF CRESTS
ON THE SURFACES OF THESE DICE.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.919
SUMMON, MOVEMENT,

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.988
MAGIC, ATTACK,

00:06:00.988 --> 00:06:03.457
DEFENSE, AND TRAP CRESTS.

00:06:03.457 --> 00:06:05.592
HOW OFTEN
EACH OF THESE CRESTS
APPEARS ON A DICE

00:06:05.592 --> 00:06:07.561
DEPENDS
ON THAT DICE'S LEVEL.

00:06:07.561 --> 00:06:09.530
THE LEVEL 2 DICE
THAT I JUST USED

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.532
HAVE 3 SUMMON CRESTS
ON EACH,

00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:13.901
SO IT WAS EASY FOR ME
TO ROLL 2 OF 'EM.

00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:16.470
BUT THE EASIER A MONSTER
IS TO SUMMON,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.138
THE WEAKER HE IS.

00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:21.441
OK, NOW LOOK CAREFULLY
AT YOUR DICE, YUGI.

00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:26.547
THEY EACH HAVE
ONLY ONE SUMMON CREST.

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:29.182
RIGHT, AND THAT MAKES IT
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:30.918
FOR YOU TO ROLL
A PAIR OF THEM.

00:06:30.918 --> 00:06:34.588
OF COURSE, HAD YOU,
IT'D HAVE BEEN
A VERY STRONG MONSTER.

STILL, I'M OF THE OPINION

00:06:36.223 --> 00:06:37.958
THAT IN THE EARLY STAGES
OF THE GAME,

00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:40.360
IT'S BETTER TO GO
FOR A LOW-LEVEL SURE THING.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.530
AFTER ALL, THE ODDS
OF SUMMONING A MONSTER
WITH HIGH-LEVEL DICE

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.198
ARE SLIM-TO-NONE.

2 MONSTERS ON THE FIELD!

00:07:38.244 --> 00:07:43.082
DIMENSION THE DICE
AND UNLOCK YARANZO!

00:07:47.353 --> 00:07:48.821
[THINKING]
HIS DUNGEON PATH

00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:50.155
IS GETTING
CLOSER AND CLOSER

00:07:50.155 --> 00:07:51.657
TO MY HEART POINTS,

00:07:51.657 --> 00:07:53.359
AND I'M NOT EVEN
ON THE BOARD YET!

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:55.194
I'M COMING
FOR YOU, YUGI,

00:07:55.194 --> 00:07:58.097
AND SINCE I JUST ROLLED
A MOVEMENT CREST, TOO,

00:07:58.097 --> 00:07:59.698
I CAN USE IT
TO ADVANCE MY MONSTER

00:07:59.698 --> 00:08:03.235
EVEN FURTHER ALONG
THE DUNGEON PATHWAY.

00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:06.438
OH, F.Y.I,
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE
A CREST YOU ROLLED,

00:08:06.438 --> 00:08:09.208
YOU CAN SAVE THEM FOR LATER
IN YOUR CREST POOL.

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:12.011
NOW GO AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:13.379
HMM. GO, DICE ROLL!

00:08:15.514 --> 00:08:17.716
[THINKING]
STILL NO MATCHING
CRESTS!

00:08:17.716 --> 00:08:20.152
HA HA!
NOTHING AGAIN, HUH?

00:08:20.152 --> 00:08:23.222
MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TRY
BLOWING ON THEM FOR GOOD LUCK.

00:08:23.222 --> 00:08:25.024
MY TURN NOW.

00:08:25.024 --> 00:08:27.092
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:31.897
HMM. WELL, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT?

00:08:31.897 --> 00:08:33.332
IT'S ANOTHER SUMMONING!

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.469
AND LOOK
AT THE SURPRISE INSIDE:

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:39.405
GATOR DRAGON!

00:08:39.405 --> 00:08:43.409
AND I'LL USE THE MOVEMENT CREST
I ROLLED TO ADVANCE HIM!

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.877
MY ROLL NOW.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:49.081
[THINKING]
AT LAST!
2 SUMMONING CRESTS!

00:08:49.081 --> 00:08:50.749
I CAN PLAY
A MONSTER.

00:08:50.749 --> 00:08:52.351
[LAUGHING]
NO, YOU CAN'T.

00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:54.186
YOU ROLLED
2 SUMMONING CRESTS,

00:08:54.186 --> 00:08:55.587
BUT THEIR LEVELS
AREN'T THE SAME.

00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:57.222
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:59.391
I THOUGHT--
IT'S MY TURN
AGAIN.

00:08:59.391 --> 00:09:02.027
OOH! LEVEL 4 DICE!

00:09:02.027 --> 00:09:04.129
THEY WERE TOO HOT
FOR YOU TO HANDLE,

00:09:04.129 --> 00:09:05.964
BUT LET'S SEE
HOW I CAN DO.

00:09:05.964 --> 00:09:07.399
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:09:09.535 --> 00:09:11.036
AH HO HO HO HO!

00:09:11.036 --> 00:09:12.538
OH, WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:15.507
I GUESS LADY LUCK
HAS GOT THE HOTS
FOR OLD DUKE DEVLIN,

00:09:15.507 --> 00:09:16.942
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

00:09:16.942 --> 00:09:20.479
I MEAN, WHAT IS THAT,
4 SUMMONINGS IN A ROW?

00:09:24.416 --> 00:09:26.151
[THINKING]
HUH? A CHEST?

00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:28.420
THIS IS AN ITEM SUMMONING,
YUGI,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.456
BUT MORE ON THAT
A BIT LATER.

00:09:30.456 --> 00:09:31.824
NOW ROLL!

00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:36.528
[THINKING]
OHH! NO. ANOTHER MISS!

00:09:36.528 --> 00:09:38.530
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD
CHANGE YOUR TITLE

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.899
FROM THE KING OF GAMES
TO THE KING OF LAME.

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:43.135
I MEAN, AT THIS RATE,
I'LL HAVE YOU BEAT

00:09:43.135 --> 00:09:45.137
EVEN BEFORE BEFORE
YOU'RE ON THE BOARD.

00:09:45.137 --> 00:09:47.840
I KNEW THAT YOU WEREN'T
THE REAL DEAL, YUGI.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.208
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:09:51.577 --> 00:09:52.945
YES! ANOTHER SUMMONING.

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:55.681
NOW I'LL HAVE A MONSTER
RIGHT BY YOUR HEART POINTS.

00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:57.516
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:09:59.885 --> 00:10:02.621
CHECK IT OUT.
THE THIRTEENTH GRAVE!

00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:05.190
AH HA HA
HA HA HA!

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.127
[THINKING]
THAT THIRTEENTH GRAVE
IS JUST 3 SQUARES AWAY

00:10:08.127 --> 00:10:10.162
FROM BEING ABLE
TO ATTACK ME!

00:10:10.162 --> 00:10:12.531
I HAVE
TO SUMMON A MONSTER
AND TAKE HIM OUT!

00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.467
OTHERWISE, I'LL LOSE
A HEART POINT FOR SURE.

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:18.704
COME ON! LET'S GO!
OUR AUDIENCE IS WAITING.

00:10:18.704 --> 00:10:20.406
[THINKING]
AND SOON,
THEY'RE GONNA SEE YOU

00:10:20.406 --> 00:10:21.907
FOR WHAT YOU REALLY ARE:

00:10:21.907 --> 00:10:25.944
A LOSER, WHO COULD HAVE
NEVER TRULY BEATEN PEGASUS.

00:10:25.944 --> 00:10:27.980
[THINKING]
THIS IS IT.
NO MATTER HOW HIGH

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.715
THE ODDS ARE STACKED
AGAINST ME,

00:10:29.715 --> 00:10:32.985
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
IT'S POSSIBLE TO ROLL
2 SUMMON CRESTS HERE--

00:10:32.985 --> 00:10:35.788
THE SAME WAY I BELIEVED
IN THE HEART OF THE CARDS!

00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:37.656
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:10:43.495 --> 00:10:45.264
[THINKING]
HA! NOT A SUMMON CREST.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.435
[THINKING]
I GOT ONE!
NOW IF ONLY...

00:10:53.605 --> 00:10:56.942
THERE! I ROLLED
2 LEVEL 4 SUMMON CRESTS.

00:10:56.942 --> 00:10:58.010
RRR!

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.778
NOW I CAN FINALLY
SUMMON A MONSTER

00:10:59.778 --> 00:11:01.914
AND DEFEND
MY HEART POINTS!

00:11:01.914 --> 00:11:03.849
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:11.957
THE MIGHTY MAGE.

00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:14.893
AND NEXT, I'LL ACCESS
MY CREST POOL DICE!

00:11:14.893 --> 00:11:18.964
AND USE A MOVEMENT CREST
TO MOVE MY MAGE
ONE SPACE FORWARD,

00:11:18.964 --> 00:11:21.600
SO HE CAN LAUNCH
AN ATTACK AGAINST
THE THIRTEENTH GRAVE!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.635
LIGHTNING STAFF!

00:11:23.635 --> 00:11:25.838
YA HA HA HA HA!

00:11:25.838 --> 00:11:26.872
ALL RIGHT!

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:27.973
IN YOUR FACE!

00:11:27.973 --> 00:11:30.042
YES!
Girls: BOO!

00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:32.144
Yugi: KNOWING THIS GAME
AND ALL OF ITS RULES

00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:33.745
MAY HAVE GIVEN YOU
THE ADVANTAGE

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:36.048
IN ASSEMBLING YOUR
CREATURES AGAINST ME,

00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:38.617
BUT NOW I HAVE
A MONSTER OF MY OWN.

00:11:42.415 --> 00:11:44.384
DID YOU SEE
YUGI'S LAST MOVE?

00:11:44.384 --> 00:11:46.819
[ALL GASP]
INCREDIBLE!

00:11:46.819 --> 00:11:48.655
HE BUSTED OUT
THAT LEVEL 4 MONSTER

00:11:48.655 --> 00:11:50.790
LIKE HE'S PLAYED
DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS
FOR YEARS.

00:11:53.092 --> 00:11:55.028
YUG! KEEP IT UP,
BUDDY.

00:11:55.028 --> 00:11:56.462
YOU'RE REALLY
DOIN' GREAT.

00:11:56.462 --> 00:11:57.730
WHAT DO YOU THINK, TEA,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.198
IS YUGI IN THE CLEAR NOW?

00:11:59.198 --> 00:12:01.134
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

00:12:01.134 --> 00:12:04.504
DUKE'S DUNGEON PATH
IS WAY MORE WIDESPREAD
THAN YUGI'S,

00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:07.206
AND HE'S STILL
GOT MORE MONSTERS
OUT ON THE BOARD, TOO.

00:12:07.206 --> 00:12:11.077
YUGI HAS
A LONG WAY TO GO
TO WIN THIS GAME.

00:12:11.077 --> 00:12:13.746
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR
FIRST MONSTER, YUGI.

00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:16.482
JUST 4 MORE NOW,
AND YOU'LL HAVE
AS MANY AS I DO.

00:12:16.482 --> 00:12:17.717
MY TURN NOW.

00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:19.319
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:25.591
WHOOPS, SPOKE TOO SOON.
MAKE THAT 5 MORE.

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:26.993
HMM.
[LAUGHS]

00:12:26.993 --> 00:12:28.161
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:34.233
I'VE UNLOCKED
THE BLAST LIZARD!

00:12:35.935 --> 00:12:38.705
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED
BY HIS LOW-LEVEL STATUS, YUGI.

00:12:38.705 --> 00:12:40.773
WHEN PLAYED IN JUST
THE RIGHT WAY,

00:12:40.773 --> 00:12:42.575
BLAST LIZARD
HAS A SPECIAL ATTACK

00:12:42.575 --> 00:12:45.244
THAT PACKS
A SURPRISING PUNCH.

00:12:45.244 --> 00:12:46.245
[THINKING]
SPECIAL ATTACK?

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:47.880
SOUNDS LIKE
ANOTHER RULE

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.749
THAT DUKE
CONVENIENTLY
FORGOT TO MENTION.

00:12:49.749 --> 00:12:51.551
I'LL HAVE
TO BE ON MY GUARD.

00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:53.319
MY ROLL NOW.

00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:56.155
[THINKING]
OH, COOL! SOME
LOW-LEVEL DICE.

00:12:56.155 --> 00:12:58.091
I KNEW
I HAD AT LEAST
A FEW OF THESE.

00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:00.226
IT SHOULD BE EASIER
TO SUMMON NOW.

00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:02.862
GO DICE ROLL!

00:13:02.862 --> 00:13:04.697
[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT!
2 CRESTS!

00:13:04.697 --> 00:13:06.299
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:13:11.938 --> 00:13:14.240
THE WINGED DRAGON,
GUARDIAN
OF THE FORTRESS!

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.542
NOW YOU HAVE
2 MONSTERS OF MINE

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:17.710
TO CONTEND WITH,
DEVLIN!

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.014
HMM. NOT FOR LONG, YUGI.
IT'S MY TURN.

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:23.182
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:13:25.918 --> 00:13:27.553
YOU FAILED
TO SUMMON ANYTHING.

00:13:27.553 --> 00:13:31.924
HMM. WHOEVER SAID
I WAS TRYING TO SUMMON
A MONSTER ON THIS ROLL?

00:13:31.924 --> 00:13:33.559
[GASPS]
WHAT?

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:34.794
BOY, ARE YOU DENSE.

00:13:34.794 --> 00:13:37.196
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID
ABOUT PLAYING MY BLAST LIZARD

00:13:37.196 --> 00:13:38.898
IN JUST THE RIGHT WAY?

00:13:38.898 --> 00:13:41.834
SO THEN, YOU WERE ROLLING
FOR HIS SPECIAL ATTACK?

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:43.469
THAT'S KINDA RIGHT, YUGI.

00:13:43.469 --> 00:13:45.071
THE BLAST LIZARD'S
SPECIAL ATTACK

00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:47.173
REQUIRES 4 MAGIC CRESTS.

00:13:47.173 --> 00:13:48.975
I ALREADY HAD
2 IN MY CREST POOL,

00:13:48.975 --> 00:13:51.878
SO I NEEDED TO ROLL
2 MORE, WHICH I DID.

00:13:51.878 --> 00:13:54.080
SO NOW I'LL USE
A MOVEMENT CREST

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.848
TO POSITION
MY BLAST LIZARD,

00:13:55.848 --> 00:13:58.184
AND NEXT,
USE MY 4 MAGIC CRESTS

00:13:58.184 --> 00:13:59.652
TO HAVE HIM ATTACK YOU.

00:14:03.589 --> 00:14:05.558
[ROARS]

00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:08.461
AAH! UNH.

00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:10.930
THAT'S TOO BAD.
YOU WORKED SO HARD

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.932
TO SUMMON THAT
WINGED DRAGON, TOO.

00:14:12.932 --> 00:14:14.033
Girls: YAY!

00:14:14.033 --> 00:14:15.968
WE LOVE YOU,
DUKEY-POO!

00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:18.037
DON'T GIVE UP.

00:14:18.037 --> 00:14:19.839
YOU CAN BEAT HIM,
YUGI.

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.974
IT'S MY TURN.
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:25.945
NOT ONE SUMMONING
CREST DIE.

00:14:25.945 --> 00:14:28.047
IT'S MY TURN.
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:31.884
LOOK, ANOTHER SUMMONING,

00:14:31.884 --> 00:14:33.619
AND WITH LEVEL 3 DICE
AS WELL.

00:14:33.619 --> 00:14:35.855
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:14:38.758 --> 00:14:40.560
DARK ASSAILANT!

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.961
[GROWLS]

00:14:41.961 --> 00:14:44.263
AND NOW, I'LL DIP INTO
MY CREST POOL AGAIN

00:14:44.263 --> 00:14:46.732
AND CLOSE IN ON
YOUR HEART POINTS.

00:14:46.732 --> 00:14:49.202
BY USING 2 MOVEMENT CRESTS,

00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:51.270
I PUT BLAST LIZARD
AND GATOR DRAGON

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.606
WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE
OF YOUR HEARTS.

00:14:53.606 --> 00:14:54.607
[GASPS]

00:14:54.607 --> 00:14:56.342
GO AHEAD, TAKE YOUR TURN.

00:14:56.342 --> 00:14:58.778
NOTHING YOU ROLL
IS GOING TO HELP YOU
GET OUT OF THIS MESS.

00:14:58.778 --> 00:15:00.179
[LAUGHS]

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:01.614
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN THINK

00:15:01.614 --> 00:15:03.883
THAT I'D BE ABLE TO FIND
A WAY TO PULL IT OFF,

00:15:03.883 --> 00:15:06.252
AND I'M THE ONE
WHO INVENTED THE GAME.

00:15:06.252 --> 00:15:07.753
YOU'RE ITS INVENTOR?

00:15:07.753 --> 00:15:09.922
I KNEW YOU WERE
ITS CHAMPION, BUT--

00:15:09.922 --> 00:15:13.559
I'M BOTH, AND EVERYONE
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
SHOULD KNOW IT!

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.194
WHAT?

00:15:15.194 --> 00:15:17.964
I SHOULD BE KNOWN
AS THE SECOND GREATEST
GAME CREATOR

00:15:17.964 --> 00:15:19.765
IN ALL OF THE WORLD
BY NOW, YUGI!

00:15:19.765 --> 00:15:23.336
BUT I'M NOT, AND IT'S ALL
BECAUSE OF YOUR CHEATING WAYS!

00:15:23.336 --> 00:15:25.605
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD HAVE BEATEN

00:15:25.605 --> 00:15:27.440
A GREAT MAN
LIKE PEGASUS!

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.375
HE HAS TWICE THE SKILLS
YOU HAVE!

00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:31.911
YOU RUINED MY LIFE
ON THAT DAY, YUGI.

00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:33.846
THE DEFEAT THAT
YOU HANDED PEGASUS

00:15:33.846 --> 00:15:35.815
CHANGED EVERYTHING FOR ME.

00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:36.883
BUT HOW?

00:15:36.883 --> 00:15:39.385
Devlin: I DEDICATED MY LIFE

00:15:39.385 --> 00:15:41.621
TO CREATING
DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS.

00:15:41.621 --> 00:15:43.089
I SPENT
ALL OF MY FREE TIME

00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:47.026
PERFECTING ITS GAME PLAY
AND FINE TUNING ITS RULES,

00:15:47.026 --> 00:15:48.828
AND WHEN I WAS FINISHED,
IT WAS CLEAR

00:15:48.828 --> 00:15:51.831
THAT I HAD CREATED SOMETHING
TRULY REMARKABLE.

00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.834
I DECIDED I HAD TO SEND IT
TO THE ONLY MAN

00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:58.104
WHO COULD POSSIBLY
APPRECIATE IT--PEGASUS.

00:15:58.104 --> 00:16:02.208
A COUPLE OF DAYS PASSED.
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING
FROM THAT GREAT GAME MASTER

00:16:02.208 --> 00:16:04.176
UNTIL I GOT
THIS CRAZY E-MAIL.

00:16:04.176 --> 00:16:08.180
HE SAID
HE'D READ MY PROPOSAL.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.816
I COULDN'T
BELIEVE MY EYES.

00:16:10.816 --> 00:16:13.920
E-MAIL FOR DEVLIN BOY.
E-MAIL FOR DEVLIN BOY.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.755
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO FLY ME OUT

00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:17.423
ON HIS PERSONAL
HELICOPTER

00:16:17.423 --> 00:16:19.191
SO THAT WE COULD
DISCUSS THE GAME IN PERSON.

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:20.393
YEAH!

00:16:22.061 --> 00:16:23.996
THE VERY NEXT DAY,

00:16:23.996 --> 00:16:27.600
I WAS BROUGHT
TO PEGASUS' ISLAND:
DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.168
I COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE IT!

00:16:29.168 --> 00:16:31.737
ALL MY HARD WORK
WAS PAYING OFF!

00:16:33.205 --> 00:16:38.377
I WAS GONNA MEET MY IDOL:
MAXIMILLION PEGASUS!

00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:40.880
WHEN WE MET, PEGASUS
IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED ME

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.482
TO A GAME OF
DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS.

00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:45.351
I EXPECTED HIM
TO BE GOOD,

00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:46.986
BUT HE WAS
PHENOMENAL.

00:16:46.986 --> 00:16:48.487
IT WAS HIS FIRST TIME
PLAYING THE GAME,

00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:50.990
AND HE COMPLETELY
OVERPOWERED ME...

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.125
ME, THE GUY
WHO CREATED IT.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.961
I WAS AMAZED
WITH HIS SKILLS.

00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.629
OH.

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:58.864
LOOKS LIKE I WIN.

00:16:58.864 --> 00:17:00.600
WHOA, YOU'RE GOOD.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.468
WELL, DEVLIN BOY,

00:17:02.468 --> 00:17:05.004
I MUST SAY THIS
DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS GAME

00:17:05.004 --> 00:17:06.372
IS REALLY SOMETHING.

00:17:06.372 --> 00:17:08.841
I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT.

00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.876
AND TOGETHER,
WE'LL SEE TO IT

00:17:10.876 --> 00:17:14.213
THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
DOES AS WELL. PARTNERS?

00:17:14.213 --> 00:17:16.015
OH, I'D BE HONORED,
MR. PEGASUS.

00:17:17.416 --> 00:17:21.187
Devlin: AND WITH THAT,
THE DEAL WAS SEALED.

00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:24.523
HE TOLD ME WE'D DRAW UP
THE OFFICIAL CONTRACT

00:17:24.523 --> 00:17:27.159
AFTER HE'D FINISHED
HOSTING A DUELING TOURNAMENT

00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:29.495
THAT WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE
ON HIS ISLAND--

00:17:29.495 --> 00:17:31.964
THE TOURNAMENT THAT YOU
WERE HEADED TO, YUGI--

00:17:31.964 --> 00:17:34.867
AND EVER SINCE
YOU BEAT HIM THERE,

00:17:34.867 --> 00:17:37.269
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO CONTACT HIM AT ALL.

00:17:39.505 --> 00:17:42.742
EVERYTHING THAT I WORKED FOR
WAS SHATTERED THAT DAY,

00:17:42.742 --> 00:17:44.877
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

00:17:44.877 --> 00:17:47.813
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MAN
PEGASUS WAS AT ALL!

00:17:47.813 --> 00:17:51.150
HE WAS A GREAT MAN
UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.420
AND BROKE HIS SPIRIT
WITH YOUR DIRTY CHEATING WAYS!

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.189
AND NOW I'LL GET MY REVENGE
BY BREAKING YOU!

00:17:57.189 --> 00:17:58.591
[GASPS]

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:04.719
NOW, YUGI, I'LL EXPOSE YOU
FOR WHAT YOU REALLY ARE--

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:06.888
A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING CHEATER!

00:18:06.888 --> 00:18:09.824
I'VE NEVER CHEATED
AT ANYTHING
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!

00:18:09.824 --> 00:18:12.193
PLEASE. YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE

00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:13.428
THAT SOMEONE LIKE YOU
COULD DEFEAT

00:18:13.428 --> 00:18:16.297
A GREAT GAME MASTER
LIKE MAXIMILLION PEGASUS?

00:18:16.297 --> 00:18:19.233
YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD YOUR OWN
IN DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS!

00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:20.968
JUST LISTEN TO ME, DEVLIN!

00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:22.170
NEVER!

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.005
YOUR HERO WORSHIP
OF PEGASUS

00:18:24.005 --> 00:18:26.040
HAS COMPLETELY
BLINDED YOU
TO THE TRUTH!

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.343
NO, I CAN SEE PERFECTLY,
AND I SEE A CHEATER

00:18:29.343 --> 00:18:32.280
WHO'S ABOUT TO BE RETIRED
FROM DUEL MONSTERS FOREVER!

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.182
NOW ROLL, YOU FRAUD!

00:18:34.182 --> 00:18:37.051
I WILL ROLL,
AND I WILL DEFEAT YOU!

00:18:39.287 --> 00:18:42.356
THERE! I ROLLED
2 LEVEL 3 SUMMON CRESTS!

00:18:42.356 --> 00:18:44.325
THAT'S ANOTHER MONSTER
FOR ME.

00:18:44.325 --> 00:18:46.327
DIMENSION THE DICE...

00:18:46.327 --> 00:18:49.864
AND UNLOCK THUNDER BALL!

00:18:52.166 --> 00:18:54.635
Devlin: HA! THUNDER BALL.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:57.772
THUNDER BALL MAY BE
A THIRD-LEVEL MONSTER,

00:18:57.772 --> 00:18:59.674
BUT HIS STATS
REALLY AREN'T THAT STRONG.

00:18:59.674 --> 00:19:01.576
I'M AFRAID
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE

00:19:01.576 --> 00:19:02.577
A LOT OF HELP
TO YOU.

00:19:02.577 --> 00:19:04.178
[THINKING]
UNLESS, THAT IS,

00:19:04.178 --> 00:19:06.581
YUGI USES THUNDER BALL'S
SPECIAL ATTACK.

00:19:06.581 --> 00:19:08.816
TOO BAD
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

00:19:08.816 --> 00:19:12.019
MY TURN NOW.
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:19:14.088 --> 00:19:17.225
YES! ONE ATTACK
AND 2 MOVEMENT CRESTS!

00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:20.361
I'LL ADVANCE
MY BLAST LIZARD
AND GATOR DRAGON

00:19:20.361 --> 00:19:22.563
INTO ATTACK POSITION.

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:23.765
LOOK OUT, YUG!

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:26.434
THAT GATOR DRAGON'S
FINALLY REACHED YUGI!

00:19:26.434 --> 00:19:29.170
YUG'S HEART POINTS,
THEY'RE IN RANGE!

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:30.538
[ROARS]

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:31.639
Devlin:
THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI.

00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:35.076
MY GATOR DRAGON IS POISED
TO TAKE YOUR HEART.

00:19:35.076 --> 00:19:36.778
OH. AH.

00:19:36.778 --> 00:19:39.947
AND NOW, GATOR DRAGON,
ATTACK HIM...

00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:43.117
WITH SWAMP FIRE BLAST!

00:19:43.117 --> 00:19:45.419
UNH!

00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:48.923
Téa: OH, NO.

00:19:48.923 --> 00:19:51.793
HE WIPED OUT
YUGI'S HEART POINT
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:19:51.793 --> 00:19:54.562
Girls: WE LOVE DUKE!
HE'S SO CUTE!

00:19:54.562 --> 00:19:56.297
WHEN HE SMILES, HE--

00:19:56.297 --> 00:19:57.465
STOP!

00:19:57.465 --> 00:19:58.533
WOULD YOU ALL SHUT UP?

00:19:58.533 --> 00:20:00.568
MY FRIEND'S
IN REAL TROUBLE HERE!

00:20:00.568 --> 00:20:02.236
HMM?
Girls:
I'LL SHOW YOU TROUBLE!

00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:03.271
SOMEONE HELP ME!

00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:05.706
HA HA HA HA!
NOW YOU ONLY HAVE

00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:07.208
2 HEART POINTS, YUGI!

00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:10.611
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
'CAUSE MY MONSTERS
ARE ALREADY LINED UP

00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:12.914
AND READY
TO TAKE THEM OUT
IN THE NEXT ROUND.

00:20:12.914 --> 00:20:14.215
THIS IS BAD.

00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:17.718
Devlin: THE WHOLE WORLD'S
ABOUT TO SEE YOU LOSE, YUGI.

00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:21.422
THEN YOU'LL BE FORCED
TO RETIRE FROM DUEL MONSTERS
IN SHAME.

00:20:21.422 --> 00:20:24.559
PEGASUS WILL BE AVENGED,
AND YOU'LL BE EXPOSED

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:27.395
AS THIS SHAM THAT YOU ARE.
[LAUGHING]

00:20:27.395 --> 00:20:29.797
[THINKING]
COME ON, YUGI.

00:20:29.797 --> 00:20:31.165
[THINKING]
WHAT CAN I DO?

00:20:31.165 --> 00:20:32.700
DUKE'S GOT MORE MONSTERS,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.269
MORE DUNGEON PATH,
AND MORE HEART POINTS THAN ME.

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:37.205
AND HE'S IN A POSITION
TO ATTACK AGAIN.

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:38.472
[LAUGHING]

00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:40.107
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY WIN?

00:20:40.107 --> 00:20:44.178
HOW CAN I BEAT DUKE
AT HIS OWN GAME?
