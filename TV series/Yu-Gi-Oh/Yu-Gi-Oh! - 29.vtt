00:15:45.503 --> 00:15:47.305
[ROARS]

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.275
WHAT IS THAT?

00:15:51.275 --> 00:15:54.679
HARPY'S OH-SO-CUDDLY
PET DRAGON.

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:56.347
SWEET AS A KITTEN, ISN'T HE?

00:15:56.347 --> 00:15:58.749
WELL, SWEET AS
A FIRE-BREATHING
KITTY CAN BE.

00:15:58.749 --> 00:16:00.584
AND HE GETS
300 MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:02.420
JUST BY SITTING
NEAR HIS MASTER!

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.122
NOW, BLAST
THAT SKULL TO ASHES!

00:16:05.122 --> 00:16:06.624
FEARSOME FIRE BLAST!

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.128
Yugi: NO!

00:16:15.497 --> 00:16:16.665
HARPY'S PET DRAGON, ATTACK!

00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:22.170
MY SUMMONED SKULL!

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.573
HA! I TOLD YOU,
YOU'VE GOTTA CONCENTRATE

00:16:24.573 --> 00:16:27.976
IF YOU'RE GONNA
STAND A CHANCE AGAINST ME!

00:16:27.976 --> 00:16:30.245
WHY ARE YOU PLAYING
SO POORLY, YUGI?

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:33.181
I'VE GOT YOU ON THE ROPES,
AND YOU'RE BARELY
PUTTING UP A FIGHT!

00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:35.116
I WANT TO DUEL YOU
AT YOUR BEST,

00:16:35.116 --> 00:16:37.719
BUT THERE'S ONLY
SO FAR I'M WILLING TO GO.

00:16:37.719 --> 00:16:41.022
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
JOEY ONCE ASKED ME

00:16:41.022 --> 00:16:42.924
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION
ABOUT WHY I DUEL.

00:16:42.924 --> 00:16:46.461
THE ANSWER I GAVE HIM
WAS FRIVOLOUS, BUT HONEST.

00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:49.598
CAN YOU ANSWER
THE QUESTION, YUGI?

00:16:49.598 --> 00:16:51.967
I'M DUELING FOR
MY GRANDFATHER, MAI.

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:54.269
HEY, HE'S GOT
A HECK OF A LOT
BETTER ANSWER

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:56.938
THAN YOU DID, MAI!
LISTEN, ME AND YUGI

00:16:56.938 --> 00:16:59.040
AREN'T JUST DUELING
FOR OURSELVES,
YOU KNOW!

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.942
WELL, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY.

00:17:00.942 --> 00:17:04.546
BUT TELL ME, COULD IT BE
YOUR MOTIVES AREN'T
ENTIRELY UNSELFISH?

00:17:04.546 --> 00:17:06.481
HUH? WHAT ARE
YOU SAYIN', MAI?

00:17:06.481 --> 00:17:08.283
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD
BE MORE LIKE YOU?

00:17:08.283 --> 00:17:09.985
WELL, I GUESS
WE COULD DO THAT!

00:17:09.985 --> 00:17:12.354
I'M GORGEOUS!
I'M SUCH
A GREAT DUELIST!

00:17:12.354 --> 00:17:14.522
I LOVE ME!
HOW'S THAT?

00:17:14.522 --> 00:17:16.791
YOU ARE SUCH A TWIT!

00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:19.294
JOEY, CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS?

00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:20.595
I CAN SEE
YOU'RE TRYING

00:17:20.595 --> 00:17:23.098
TO SERIOUSLY MESS
WITH YUGI'S HEAD!

00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:24.733
AND YOU'RE MAKING
HIM AND ME

00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:27.836
AND EVERYBODY CRAZY
AND DIZZY AND--AAH!

00:17:31.406 --> 00:17:33.475
WILL YOU
CONTROL YOURSELF?

00:17:33.475 --> 00:17:35.877
[THINKING] HMM.
YOU'RE WRONG, JOEY.

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:37.879
I'M NOT TRYING
TO CONFUSE YUGI,

00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:41.483
AND YOU'RE OFF-KILTER ENOUGH
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME.

00:17:41.483 --> 00:17:43.451
SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO YUGI,

00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:45.053
AND HE'LL NEED MORE
THAN HIS FRIENDSHIP

00:17:45.053 --> 00:17:47.722
WITH ALL OF YOU
TO SNAP HIM OUT OF IT.

00:17:47.722 --> 00:17:50.125
THERE'S ONLY
SO MUCH I CAN DO.

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:54.095
I MAY ADMIRE YUGI,
BUT I'M STILL DETERMINED
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:17:56.264 --> 00:17:58.300
[THINKING] MAI'S RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING--

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.402
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO BE DISTRACTED NOW.

00:18:00.402 --> 00:18:02.904
WINNING THIS DUEL
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:07.509
YES! THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:18:07.509 --> 00:18:09.477
THIS CARD
WOULD DEFINITELY
BE POWERFUL ENOUGH

00:18:09.477 --> 00:18:12.881
TO DEFEAT
HARPY'S PET DRAGON,
IF I COULD ATTACK.

00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:16.051
BUT I CAN'T,
NOT WHILE MAI'S
MIRROR WALL TRAP CARD

00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:18.987
IS STILL IN PLAY.
I NEED ANOTHER TACTIC.

00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:23.058
WAIT, I KNOW!
I'LL MATCH HER
TRAP FOR TRAP!

00:18:23.058 --> 00:18:26.161
[OUT LOUD] I'LL LAY
ONE CARD FACE DOWN,

00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:28.964
AND THEN THROW
DARK MAGICIAN
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:30.865 --> 00:18:32.968
THAT ENDS MY TURN.

00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:34.970
[THINKING]
COME ON, MAI. ATTACK.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.371
I'VE MATCHED
YOUR MIRROR WALL

00:18:36.371 --> 00:18:38.406
WITH A CARD
CALLED MIRROR FORCE!

00:18:38.406 --> 00:18:40.575
ALL YOUR MONSTERS
WILL BE DESTROYED!

00:18:40.575 --> 00:18:42.010
NOW IT'S MY TURN!

00:18:44.446 --> 00:18:49.184
[THINKING] HMM. THIS CARD
WILL NEARLY COMPLETE
MY HARPY COMBO.

00:18:49.184 --> 00:18:53.188
WHATEVER TRAP
YOU SET FOR ME, YUGI,
JUST BECAME USELESS.

00:18:53.188 --> 00:18:57.559
[OUT LOUD] I PLAY
THIS ACCESSORY CARD:
SHADOW OF EYES!

00:18:57.559 --> 00:18:59.394
HUH? THE SHADOW OF EYES?

00:18:59.394 --> 00:19:02.998
WATCH THE ARENA.
I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS AT ALL.

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:07.135
WHAT IS THIS?
MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:19:07.135 --> 00:19:08.770
IS SWITCHING
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.341
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S THE MAGIC
OF SHADOW OF EYES.

00:19:13.341 --> 00:19:15.543
IT EXUDES
AN IRRESISTIBLE FORCE

00:19:15.543 --> 00:19:18.313
THAT CAN LURE
EVEN THE MIGHTIEST
MONSTERS INTO BATTLE.

00:19:21.316 --> 00:19:23.685
MAI'S TRYING TO FORCE
YUGI INTO ATTACKING!

00:19:23.685 --> 00:19:25.420
THAT MEANS
THAT THROWING MONSTERS

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.188
IN DEFENSE MODE
IS USELESS, TOO.

00:19:27.188 --> 00:19:29.858
SO WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, DARK MAGICIAN?

00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:32.127
ATTACK HARPY LADY!

00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:44.305
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU PLAYED A TRAP CARD,

00:19:44.305 --> 00:19:48.276
SO HARPY'S FEATHER DUSTER,
GIVE HIM A DUSTING OFF!

00:19:48.276 --> 00:19:49.978
[SCREECHES]

00:19:52.514 --> 00:19:54.849
NO! SHE'S ELIMINATED
MY MIRROR FORCE CARD!

00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:57.452
NOW, TO BLOW SOME
EXTRA SMOKE YOUR WAY,

00:19:57.452 --> 00:20:00.221
DRAGON, FEARSOME FIRE BLAST!

00:20:00.221 --> 00:20:02.724
[ROARS]

00:20:08.129 --> 00:20:11.633
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE YOUR FAVORITE CARD
THE DARK MAGICIAN LEFT.

00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:12.834
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

00:20:12.834 --> 00:20:15.070
YEAH, WHAT IS
YUGI GONNA DO NOW?

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.305
YUGI, YOU CAN
STILL TURN
THIS AROUND.

00:20:17.305 --> 00:20:18.840
I KNOW YOU CAN!

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.042
Joey: UH, YEAH.
IT ONLY LOOKS HOPELESS.

00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:25.246
I CAN'T LOSE THIS MATCH!

00:20:25.246 --> 00:20:27.215
[THINKING] YUGI,
LET ME HELP YOU!

00:20:27.215 --> 00:20:30.318
IF YOU CONTINUE
TO HOLD ME BACK,
EVERYBODY LOSES!
