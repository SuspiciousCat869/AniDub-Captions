00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:28.502
A BLACK DIE?!

00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:29.970
YAY!
YEAH!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.937
ALL RIGHT!

00:14:30.937 --> 00:14:33.306
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:14:34.941 --> 00:14:36.510
EXCELLENT!

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.178
A PAIR
OF SUMMONING CRESTS.

00:14:38.178 --> 00:14:39.179
UNH!

00:14:39.179 --> 00:14:41.581
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:45.519
NOW I PLACE
A SECOND WARP VORTEX...

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:49.956
SO THAT <i>I</i> HAVE
EASY ACCESS TO <i>YOUR</i>
HEART POINTS!

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:53.126
STRIKE NINJA...JUMP
INTO THE WARP VORTEX!

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:55.028
HOOH! HAHH!
HOOH!

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:56.396
Joey: LOOK AT HIM GO!

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.832
THAT STRIKE NINJA
REALLY <i>IS</i> FAST! WOW!

00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:00.734
HYAAAHHH...UHH!

00:15:00.734 --> 00:15:02.636
HWAAHHHH!

00:15:02.636 --> 00:15:05.405
Duke: NO! HE'S GONE
INTO THE WARP HOLE!

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.540
BUT THAT MEANS--

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.441
Yugi: THAT'S RIGHT,
DEVLIN.
UHH!

00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:11.278
HE'LL COME OUT
ON <i>YOUR</i> SIDE
OF THE FIELD.

00:15:11.278 --> 00:15:12.512
HUNHH!

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:14.347
HUHH! HOOH!
HUNH! HUHH! HUHH!

00:15:14.347 --> 00:15:15.749
NOW!

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.919
STRIKE NINJA,
ATTACK AND DESTROY
HIS RYU-KISHIN!

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:22.055
STEALTH SLASH ATTACK!
AAAAHHHH...

00:15:22.055 --> 00:15:23.456
HHARRHHH!

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:25.258
HURRRHHHH!

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:26.626
Joey: WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:15:26.626 --> 00:15:27.961
NOTHIN' HAPPENED!

00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:29.262
ARRRRHHH!

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.565
ALL RIGHT!

00:15:31.565 --> 00:15:32.766
YEAH!
YEAH!

00:15:32.766 --> 00:15:35.001
YU-GI! YU-GI!
OUR LITTLE
DUKEY SCHNOOK!

00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:37.470
UHHH! HMM!

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.573
[THINKING] DUKE
MAY HAVE BLOCKED ME
FROM BEING ABLE

00:15:39.573 --> 00:15:41.775
TO EXTEND MY DUNGEON PATH
TO HIS HEART POINTS,

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.810
BUT THANKS
TO THE WARP VORTEX
HE PLACED,

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.445
I NOW HAVE
AN EVEN BETTER WAY

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.547
OF GETTING MY MONSTERS
OVER TO THEM.

00:15:47.547 --> 00:15:49.583
<i>HIS</i> PORTAL BECAME
<i>MY</i> WAY IN.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:52.752
[THINKING] I CAN'T BELIEVE
YUGI GOT A RARE BLACK DIE.

00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:55.956
NOW HE'S USING
THE WARP VORTEX
<i>I</i> SUMMONED AGAINST <i>ME!</i>

00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:58.091
AND WITH THAT
HIGH-SPEED STRIKE NINJA

00:15:58.091 --> 00:16:02.696
ALREADY DEEP IN MY TERRITORY,
ALL YUGI HAS TO DO IS ROLL
ONE MOVEMENT CREST,

00:16:02.696 --> 00:16:05.799
AND HE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE
WITHIN STRIKING RANGE
OF MY HEART POINTS.

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:07.534
I HAVE TO STOP HIM!

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:09.469
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:16:09.469 --> 00:16:11.671
I NEED 2 SUMMON CRESTS!

00:16:13.039 --> 00:16:14.207
UHHH!

00:16:14.207 --> 00:16:15.542
MY ROLL FAILED ME!

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:17.410
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:16:19.112 --> 00:16:21.781
PERFECT! A SET
OF MOVEMENT CRESTS.

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:22.849
UHHH!

00:16:22.849 --> 00:16:25.051
STRIKE NINJA,
ADVANCE!

00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.252
HOOHH!

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:28.521
Joey: OH, YEAH! I LOVE
WATCHIN' THIS DUDE RUN.

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:33.026
NOW, STRIKE NINJA,
ATTACK HIS HEART POINT!

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:35.362

OHHH! UHHH!

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:47.540
OHHH...
OHHH...

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.608
[SOBBING]

00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:50.443
OH, MAN!
HA HA HA!

00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:51.745
THAT'S ONE DOWN!

00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:53.313
YEP, AND
2 TO GO!

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:56.016
YES! DID YOU SEE THAT?!

00:16:56.016 --> 00:16:58.151
THAT'S MY GRANDSON!

00:16:58.151 --> 00:17:00.720
[CHUCKLING MALEVOLENTLY]

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.921

HA HA HA HA HA!

00:17:03.757 --> 00:17:04.924
I'M SORRY, YUGI.

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:06.192
IT'S JUST BEEN SO LONG

00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:09.129
SINCE ANYONE'S DESTROYED
ONE OF MY HEART POINTS.

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:11.998
YOU SHOULD REALLY
GIVE YOURSELF
A PAT ON THE BACK...

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.733
'CAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU,

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:16.469
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
HAPPENING AGAIN!

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:18.338
HYAHHHHH!

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:20.340
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:17:22.942 --> 00:17:23.977
PERFECT!

00:17:23.977 --> 00:17:25.979
A LEVEL-3 SUMMONING.

00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:28.882
DIMENSION THE DICE!

00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:32.352
AND UNLOCK
MY UNDEFEATABLE MONSTER!

00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:37.891
I SUMMON
ORGOTH THE RELENTLESS!

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.559
RAAAHHHRRRR!

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.996
AND NEXT I'LL USE
2 MAGIC CRESTS...

00:17:42.996 --> 00:17:46.433
AND ACTIVATE
ORGOTH THE RELENTLESS'
SPECIAL ATTACK

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:50.470
TO RAISE HIS POWER
FROM 20 TO 30.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.140
AND NOW I'LL USE
2 OF MY STORED
MOVEMENT CREST DICE

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.010
AND POSITION ORGOTH
FOR ATTACK!

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.145
HA HA HA
HA HA HA!

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:01.948
ORGOTH THE RELENTLESS,

00:18:01.948 --> 00:18:03.883
DIAMOND BLADE STRIKE!

00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:06.753
RAAAHHRRR!

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:11.124
[THINKING] OHHH...
I'D BETTER THINK FAST
IF I WANT TO SAVE MY NINJA!

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:12.158
THERE!

00:18:12.158 --> 00:18:14.027
THAT'S IT!

00:18:14.027 --> 00:18:16.529
YOUR NINJA
HAS BEEN DESTROYED.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:19.132
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE
IF I WERE YOU.

00:18:19.132 --> 00:18:20.266
WHAT?!

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.469
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK, DEVLIN?

00:18:22.469 --> 00:18:25.939
WHAT? I DON'T
SEE ANY--HUH?

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:27.941
NO! IT CAN'T BE!

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.809
THERE...I-IN THE SMOKE...

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.478
THE STRIKE NINJA!

00:18:33.446 --> 00:18:36.816
SORRY, DUKE,
BUT JUST BEFORE ORGOTH
THE RELENTLESS ATTACKED,

00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:38.952
I ACTIVATED
MY NINJA'S
SPECIAL ABILITY

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.653
WITH A STORED
TRAP CREST.

00:18:40.653 --> 00:18:44.090
IT ALLOWS HIM TO QUICKLY
DODGE ANY ATTACK THAT'S
WAGED AGAINST HIM

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.692
AND ESCAPE HARM.

00:18:45.692 --> 00:18:48.094
[THINKING] I CAN'T BELIEVE
YUGI HAS TAUGHT HIMSELF

00:18:48.094 --> 00:18:50.230
SUCH AN ADVANCED
DEFENSE MANEUVER!

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.134
HE'S MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE A NOVICE
AT MY OWN GAME!

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:56.669
OHH...I CAN'T
LET HIM RATTLE ME.

00:18:56.669 --> 00:19:00.106
I HAVE TO REMEMBER
THAT THIS KID IS
JUST A LOUSY CHEAT.

00:19:00.106 --> 00:19:02.442
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILLS
TO WIN THIS MATCH.

00:19:03.777 --> 00:19:06.179
IT'S MY ROLL NOW, DUKE.

00:19:06.179 --> 00:19:08.448
AND NOW I CAN
ATTACK AGAIN.

00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:09.816

YEAH, YUGE!

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.858
I BELIEVE
I'VE TAKEN THE LEAD

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:19.959
NOW, DEVLIN.

00:19:19.959 --> 00:19:21.828
[THINKING]
YOU LITTLE WANNABE!

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.097
I SWORE I'D HAVE
MY REVENGE ON YOU

00:19:24.097 --> 00:19:28.501
FOR CHEATING PEGASUS
AND SABOTAGING MY GAME,
AND I WILL!

[OUT LOUD]
GO, DICE ROLL!

00:19:33.006 --> 00:19:35.542
NOW, ORGOTH,
SHOW THAT NINJA

00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:37.310
WHY YOU'RE CALLED
RELENTLESS!

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.513
[THINKING] OH, NO!
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE TRAPS

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.081
IN MY CREST POOL!

00:19:42.081 --> 00:19:45.518
THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME
TO HELP MY NINJA ESCAPE
THIS TIME.

DIAMOND BLADE STRIKE!

00:19:47.754 --> 00:19:50.723
AAAAAHHHHH!

Téa: OH, NO!
HIS NINJA'S
BEEN WIPED OUT!

00:19:52.492 --> 00:19:54.494
HMM.

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:55.695
YOU WERE CLOSE, YUGI...

00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.897
CLOSER THAN ANYONE
I'VE EVER FACED.

00:19:57.897 --> 00:19:59.766
BUT I'M AFRAID
THAT CLOSE DOESN'T CUT IT

00:19:59.766 --> 00:20:01.568
IN DUNGEON DICE MONSTERS.

00:20:01.568 --> 00:20:04.237
SURE, YOU MAY HAVE
ONE HEART POINT MORE THAN ME,

00:20:04.237 --> 00:20:06.506
BUT I HAVE
ORGOTH THE RELENTLESS,

00:20:06.506 --> 00:20:10.777
AND NONE OF YOUR MONSTERS
WILL STOP HIM FROM GETTING
TO YOUR HEART POINTS!

ON THE VICTORY TRAIL,
YUGI,

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:15.281

AT A DEAD END!
