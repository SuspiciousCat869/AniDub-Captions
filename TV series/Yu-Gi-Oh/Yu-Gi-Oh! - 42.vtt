BUT IN HIS
FIELD OF ARCHAEOLOGY,

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:46.426

IT WAS A MYSTERY.

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.963

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.432
A NEW INTERPRETATION
OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY,

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:28.201

AN ASTONISHING CONCLUSION.

THE IMAGES ARE
NEARLY THE SAME!

WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE
THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:13.346
MUST'VE PLAYED
A SIMILAR GAME TO OUR OWN.

I COULD.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.611

A LINK BETWEEN THE GAME
AND THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

THAT BE?

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.462

A SMALL AMOUNT
OF WATER LEFT.

THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR 2 PEOPLE,

SO IF WE TRY
TO SHARE IT

00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:52.439

THAT NEITHER OF US

00:07:54.207 --> 00:07:55.809
I PROPOSE
THAT THE LAST
OF THE WATER

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:58.278
SHOULD GO TO THE
WINNER OF THIS DUEL.
DO YOU AGREE?

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.413
SADLY, I DO.

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.283
AND SO,
OUR GRIM DUEL BEGAN.

00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:06.353
IN HIS FIRST TURN,
THE CARD THAT ARTHUR PLAYED

00:08:06.353 --> 00:08:07.754
WAS THE WITCH
OF THE BLACK FOREST.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:10.190
SOUND FAMILIAR, REBECCA?

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:13.960
IT'S THE SAME
CARD SHE PLAYED.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:15.428
THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:16.629
IT WAS YOUR GRANDFATHER

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:19.232
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO DUEL,
WASN'T IT?

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.502
Téa: NEVER MIND HER!
GO ON WITH
THE STORY!

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.169
WELL, YOU SEE--

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.204
NO MORE LIES!

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:26.106
WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?!

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:28.441
YOU COULD BE MAKING
THIS WHOLE STUPID STORY UP!

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.143
MR. MOTO
DOESN'T LIE.

00:08:32.312 --> 00:08:34.114
YEAH, WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD FINISH THIS DUEL!

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:35.882
OH, YEAH?
WELL, SOME OF US

00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:38.051
WOULD RATHER HEAR THE
REST OF THE STORY FIRST.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.285
NO, LET THE DUEL CONTINUE.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:41.755
HUH?

00:08:43.423 --> 00:08:44.624
HMM. I THINK
IT'S YUGI'S TURN.

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.761
WE KNOW THAT!
WHY DON'T YOU
BUTT OUT, OLD MAN,

00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:49.262
SO WE CAN SETTLE
THIS THING?

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:50.363
AS YOU WISH.

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.233
GOOD. I'LL GET BACK
TO KICKIN' YUGI'S BUTT!

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.201
WELL, ONE THING'S
FOR CERTAIN.
WHAT?

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.704
REBECCA MAY HAVE LEARNED
DUELING FROM ARTHUR,

00:08:58.638 --> 00:09:00.540
BUT SHE NEVER LEARNED
MANNERS FROM HIM.

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:03.743
MAYBE THIS WILL
TEACH HER SOME.

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:05.311
I PLAY CATAPULT TURTLE

00:09:06.446 --> 00:09:07.113
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:08.948
CATAPULT TURTLE
LETS ME SACRIFICE

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:11.384
ANY MONSTER
ON MY FIELD!

00:09:12.052 --> 00:09:13.853
WHEN I DO, I AM THEN
ABLE TO DEDUCT

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:15.755
HALF OF MY SACRIFICED
MONSTER'S ATTACK POWER

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.191
DIRECTLY FROM MY OPPONENT'S
LIFE POINTS!

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:20.527
WHAT A JOKE.
THAT WON'T HELP.

00:09:21.828 --> 00:09:23.830
IT WILL WHEN I COMBINE IT
WITH MY BRAIN CONTROL!

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:26.666
HUH? OH, NO,
OH, NO, OH, NO!

00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:28.935
WITH BRAIN CONTROL,
I CAN SEIZE ANY MONSTER

00:09:29.803 --> 00:09:31.004
AND CONTROL IT
FOR ONE TURN!

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:33.139
MILLENNIUM SHIELD
COME TO ME!

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:36.910
AAH!

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.612
AND NOW I USE
CATAPULT TURTLE

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.982
TO SACRIFICE YOUR
MILLENNIUM SHIELD!

00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:47.053
AAH! OH, NO!

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.722
AND MY TURN ISN'T
OVER YET, REBECCA.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:09:51.324
NOW...

00:09:52.392 --> 00:09:54.427
SUMMON SKULL ATTACK!

00:09:57.564 --> 00:09:58.565
YOUR CANNON SOLDIER
IS TOAST!

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:00.166
[SOBBING]

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:01.901
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:04.104
I'M STILL GONNA
BEAT YOU, YUGI!

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.173
I'M GONNA GET YOU
AND YOUR THIEVING
GRANDFATHER!

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.012
Rebecca: [THINKING]
HA! GUESS YUGI'S

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.081
A LITTLE BETTER DUELIST
THAN I THOUGHT.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.817
GUESS I CAN SEE
HOW HE WON THE DUELIST
KINGDOM TOURNAMENT.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.587
BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN UP
AGAINST A GENIUS BEFORE,

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:22.922
AND EVERYTHING IS GOING
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

00:10:24.357 --> 00:10:26.759
LET'S SEE. RIGHT NOW
I HAVE 6 CRUMMY MONSTERS
IN MY GRAVEYARD.

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.331
NOT QUITE ENOUGH!

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:34.634
[SNICKERS]

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:36.636
HA HA! GREAT! FANTASTIC!

00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:39.372
LOOK WHAT CARD
WE DREW, TEDDY!

00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:40.940
BRAVO!
BRAVO, REBECCA!

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:42.842
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:43.877
[CACKLING]

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:45.111
"V" FOR VICTORY!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.281
I PLAY THIS MAGIC CARD--
JUDGMENT BLASTER!

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:50.416
WHAT'S THAT?

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.618
WITH JUDGMENT BLASTER,

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:54.787
I CAN DISCARD 5 CARDS
FROM MY HAND

00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:57.524
AND IN EXCHANGE...

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.698
I GET TO OBLITERATE
EVERY MONSTER YOU'VE GOT
ON THE FIELD!

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:07.200
WHA--

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:08.601
AND ONE MORE THING.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.704
NOW I SUMMON
MY FAVORITE MONSTER...

00:11:15.074 --> 00:11:17.277
UP FROM THE DEPTHS
COMES THE CREEPY
AND, OH, SO LOVABLE

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:19.312
SHADOW GHOUL
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.081
AND FOR EACH OF
THE LAME-O MONSTERS
IN MY GRAVEYARD,

00:11:22.649 --> 00:11:24.450
THIS ADORABLE FELLA
GAINS AN EXTRA
100 ATTACK POINTS!

00:11:26.119 --> 00:11:26.786
OH!
AH!

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:28.021
FOR EACH MONSTER?

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:29.322
I LOST COUNT, MAN.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:31.691
HOW MANY MONSTERS
HAS SHE SENT
TO THE GRAVEYARD?

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:32.759
I THINK...IT'S 11.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:34.127
100, 200,

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.129
3--
1100.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.132
UH-HUH. SHADOW GHOUL
NOW HAS AN ATTACK POWER
OF 2700!

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.403
WHAT? YOU MEAN YOU
SACRIFICED 11 MONSTERS
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.208
JUST SO YOU COULD USE
THEIR ENERGY TO POWER UP
YOUR SHADOW GHOUL?

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.677
YOU'RE JUST NOW
CATCHING ON TO MY
STRATEGY, YUGI?

00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:52.712
YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK
FASTER THAN THAT.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:54.214
REBECCA...

00:11:54.614 --> 00:11:55.281
NOW WHAT?

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.050
DUEL MONSTERS
ISN'T ABOUT
TOSSING ASIDE

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.618
ALL YOUR BEST
CREATURES.

00:11:59.786 --> 00:12:01.054
EACH MONSTER
HAS ITS OWN ABILITIES

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:03.289
AND DEMANDS ITS OWN
KIND OF RESPECT.

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:05.458
IF YOU JUST THROW THEM
AWAY--

00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:07.060
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!

00:12:07.427 --> 00:12:09.229
DUELING HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH RESPECTING
YOUR MONSTERS.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.732
EVERYONE KNOWS THE ONLY THING
THAT <i>REALLY</i> MATTERS
IS WINNING!

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:15.735
BESIDES, WHAT WOULD
A FAMILY OF THIEVES

00:12:16.669 --> 00:12:17.870
KNOW ABOUT
A DUELIST'S
REAL POWER?

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:20.273
I LEARNED
MY DUELING STRATEGY
FROM A MASTER--

00:12:21.341 --> 00:12:22.008
MY GRANDFATHER!

00:12:22.842 --> 00:12:23.843
ANYWAY, DUEL MONSTERS
AREN'T REAL.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.511
THEY'RE JUST INK ON CARDS.

00:12:26.179 --> 00:12:26.846
WHAT'S TO RESPECT?

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:28.848
THAT'S NOT WHAT
ARTHUR THOUGHT.

00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:30.450
[THINKING] REBECCA
UNDERSTANDS THE STRATEGY

00:12:31.517 --> 00:12:32.518
AND TACTICS
OF DUEL MONSTERS,

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.455
BUT SHE'S NEVER
FOUND THE HEART
OF THE CARDS.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.491
[THINKING]
IF ANYONE CAN TEACH
REBECCA THE LESSONS

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:40.960
SHE NEEDS TO LEARN,
IT'S MY GRANDSON.

00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:42.128
HMM.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:44.597
YOU'RE KEEPING ME
WAITING, YUGI.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.866
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TAKE A NAP.

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:47.867
I CAME TO DUEL!

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:49.369
ALL RIGHT THEN.

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.005
I SUMMON A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:58.811
WELL, WELL.

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.048
WHAT YOU THINK
I LACK IN RESPECT,
I MAKE UP IN TALENT.

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.317
I DREW A MAGIC CARD:
STOP DEFENSE.

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:06.185
HUH?

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.521
SHE'S FORCED
THE DARK MAGICIAN
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:10.923
[EVERYONE GASPS]

00:13:11.324 --> 00:13:12.325
AND NOW, SHADOW GHOUL ATTACK!

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:14.027
GREEN VAPOR SHROUDS!

00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:17.263
[ROAR]

00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:23.970
BYE-BYE, DARK MAGICIAN.

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.240
Tristan:
MR. MOTO, YUGI'S
GETTING CREAMED!

00:13:28.107 --> 00:13:30.109
THIS COULDN'T BE
HOW YOUR DUEL WITH
PROFESSOR HAWKINS WENT.

00:13:31.444 --> 00:13:32.645
ACTUALLY, IT WENT
EXACTLY LIKE THIS.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.982
BUT THE OUTCOME
OF THIS DUEL MAY YET
SURPRISE YOU.

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.685
I PLAY SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT!

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:41.954
THAT WILL KEEP YOU
FROM ATTACKING
FOR 3 TURNS,

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:43.589
REBECCA.

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:44.957
WELL, THAT'S REALLY
IRRITATING.

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:48.127
OK, THEN,
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I PASS THIS TURN.

00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:50.663
YEESH. IT DIDN'T
EVEN FAZE HER.

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:52.732
I CAN USE THIS CARD--

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:54.901
MONSTER REBORN--

00:13:56.436 --> 00:13:57.437
TO RESURRECT
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:00.973
HMM. HE'S TRYING
TO REASSEMBLE
HIS FORCES, TEDDY,

00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:04.077
WHILE I'M PREVENTED
FROM ATTACKING HIM.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:05.878
BUT THAT WON'T SAVE HIM.

00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:08.147
I'LL PLAY MY NEXT CARD
DEFENSE MODE,

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:10.183
AND I'LL TELL HIM
WHAT IT IS,

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:13.119
'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
HE CAN BEAT
MY GENIUS BRAIN.

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.755
WHEE! ANOTHER CANNON
SOLDIER!

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:18.424
SMART MOVE.
SHE WANTS ME TO ATTACK.

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:21.594
BUT I CAN'T LET
THAT CANNON SOLDIER
GET OFF A SHOT.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:23.663
YOU WANT AN ATTACK,
REBECCA?
WELL, HERE IT COMES!

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:28.334
DARK MAGICIAN,
ATTACK CANNON SOLDIER!

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:33.139
HMM. THANK YOU.
YOU'VE JUST RAISED
SHADOW GHOUL'S ATTACK POWER

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:35.942
BY ANOTHER 100 POINTS!

00:14:37.744 --> 00:14:39.345

CARD YUGI DRAWS NEXT,

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:41.381
THAT GHOUL'S MORE
POWERFUL THAN EVER.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:43.316
REBECCA'S STRATEGY
SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:45.084
MAYBE SHE IS
A GENIUS.

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.887
Joey: DON'T
COUNT YUGI OUT YET.
HE LEARNED FROM THE MASTER.

00:14:48.788 --> 00:14:49.589
OH, I UNDERSTAND NOW.

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:52.558
YOU'RE USING THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT
TO STALL FOR TIME,

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.161
HOPING FOR SOME SPECIAL
CARD TO COME UP.

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:58.498
BUT THAT ISN'T GOING TO
HELP HIM AT ALL,
IS IT, TEDDY?

00:14:58.765 --> 00:15:00.233
NOT WHEN SHADOW GHOUL
CAN ATTACK AGAIN.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:02.668
I'LL PASS THIS TURN, TOO.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:05.371
BUT NEXT TIME,
WHEN MY GHOUL'S FREE
TO ATTACK,

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:07.407
I'LL WIPE YOU OUT!

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.342
[ROAR]

00:15:10.543 --> 00:15:11.944
Arthur: SO, SOLOMON,
ON MY NEXT TURN,

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:13.946
I'LL BE FREE TO ATTACK.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.982
BUT I'M GOING TO PASS
THIS TURN.

00:15:16.816 --> 00:15:18.418
IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:20.820
WHAT CARD ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, SOLOMON?

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.023
THAT'S MY SECRET.

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:29.762
WHAT'S THE MATTER, YUGI?

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.731
DIDN'T YOU GET
THE CARD YOU NEED?

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:32.899
HMM...

00:15:34.467 --> 00:15:35.101
SO, SOLOMON,

00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:39.172
DID YOU GET
THE CARD YOU NEED?

00:15:40.873 --> 00:15:42.475
HMM...

00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:46.612
COME NOW.
DON'T KEEP ME
IN SUSPENSE.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:49.449
I SURRENDER, ARTHUR.

00:15:50.216 --> 00:15:50.883
YOU WIN.

00:15:52.218 --> 00:15:53.986
AH...

00:15:58.658 --> 00:15:59.325
I SURRENDER,
REBECCA.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:01.961
OH!
AH!

00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:05.731
Joey: I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT!
YUGI'S GIVEN UP!

00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:10.670
THE GAME'S OVER,
REBECCA.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:13.311
Tristan: UNBELIEVABLE...

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.202
[GIGGLES]

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:16.810
YUGI, WHY?

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.712
YOU CAN'T JUST
GIVE UP, YUGE!

00:16:19.512 --> 00:16:20.513
HMM...

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:23.550
YOU MEAN I WIN?

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:25.018
YES. YOU WIN,
REBECCA.

00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:26.887
BRAVO! YAY, ME!

00:16:28.221 --> 00:16:29.022
WE BEAT HIM, TEDDY.

00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:30.523
REBECCA THE GENIUS WINS!

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:33.093
WHEE!

00:16:33.593 --> 00:16:35.195
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY DID YOU
SURRENDER?

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.529
YEAH, WHAT'S UP WITH
THAT, YUGE?

00:16:37.397 --> 00:16:39.499
I WON! NOW GIVE ME
THE BLUE EYES.

00:16:42.469 --> 00:16:43.470
AAH!

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:46.306
YOU TORE IT!
OH, NO!

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:48.174
YOU DESTROYED
MY GRANDFATHER'S
FAVORITE CARD!

00:16:48.975 --> 00:16:49.976
IT WASN'T ME,
REBECCA. I--

00:16:50.443 --> 00:16:52.646
FIRST YOU STEAL IT,
THEN YOU LIE,
THEN YOU RUIN IT!

00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:53.546
YOU DESPICABLE,
MEAN MAN!

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:56.016
I TREASURED THAT CARD,
REBECCA.

00:16:56.816 --> 00:16:58.018
I WOULD NEVER HAVE
DESTROYED IT!

00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.287
I'VE HEARD JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH OF YOUR LIES!

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:02.822
Arthur: REBECCA,
BEHAVE YOURSELF.

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:05.625
GRANDPA?

00:17:05.992 --> 00:17:07.193
ARTHUR? ARTHUR
IS IT REALLY YOU?

00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:09.763
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
SOLOMON.

00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:12.632
FAR TOO LONG,
MY DEAR OLD FRIEND.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.101
I DO HOPE
MY PRECOCIOUS GRANDDAUGHTER

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.070
HASN'T CAUSED YOU
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:18.638
CAN YOU FORGIVE HER?

00:17:19.673 --> 00:17:20.340
FOR WHAT?

00:17:20.807 --> 00:17:21.608
REBECCA, DID YOU KNOW

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.810
YUGI WAS ACTUALLY
THE WINNER OF YOUR DUEL?

00:17:24.945 --> 00:17:25.745
NO, GRANDPA, I WON!

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.248
YUGI, YOU'RE
JUST LIKE YOUR
GRANDFATHER.

00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:32.919
YOU'RE A GENEROUS
YOUNG MAN AND A VERY
FINE DUELIST.

00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:35.889
I KNEW IT.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.091
REBECCA, HAVE A LOOK
AT THIS CARD.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:39.793
HUH?

00:17:40.226 --> 00:17:41.428
IT'S A CARD CALLED
SOUL RELEASE.

00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.664
IF YUGI
HAD PLAYED THIS CARD
IN THE FINAL TURN,

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:46.633
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
DEFEATED FOR CERTAIN.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:47.834
WITH SOUL RELEASE,

00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:50.837
YUGI COULD HAVE FREED
UP TO 5 CARDS
FROM HIS GRAVEYARD,

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:52.305
OR YOURS.

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:54.341
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT THAT MEANS?

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:55.775
YOUR SHADOW GHOUL'S
ATTACK POWER

00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:58.044
WOULD HAVE INSTANTLY
DROPPED FROM 2800
TO 2300.

00:18:00.213 --> 00:18:02.082
YUGI'S DARK MAGICIAN
HAD AN ATTACK POWER
OF 2500,

00:18:04.217 --> 00:18:05.418
AND THEREFORE...

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:08.355
YOU MEAN YUGI REALLY
NEVER HAD TO SURRENDER?

00:18:09.723 --> 00:18:10.390
THEN WHY?

00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:11.691
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:15.395
YUGI WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THAT THERE'S MUCH MORE
TO DUELING

00:18:16.196 --> 00:18:17.197
THAN JUST WINNING
AND LOSING.

00:18:17.797 --> 00:18:20.600
HE WANTED YOU TO SEE
THAT THE WAY TO THE HEART
OF THE CARDS

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:21.968
IS THROUGH YOUR OWN HEART.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.373
AFTER THAT TOMB COLLAPSED
AND WE'D BET OUR LAST DROP
OF WATER ON THE DUEL,

00:18:27.474 --> 00:18:28.475
SOLOMON ALSO SACRIFICED
A VICTORY

00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:30.176
TO SAVE MY LIFE.

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:32.379
OH!

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:34.714
I FELT WEAK,
OVERCOME BY THE HEAT.

00:18:36.916 --> 00:18:39.853
HOLD ON, MY FRIEND.

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:42.088
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
SURRENDER.

00:18:43.156 --> 00:18:44.758
I COULDN'T LET YOU
LOSE THIS DUEL,
ARTHUR.

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:45.959
YOU NEED THE WATER.

00:18:46.526 --> 00:18:48.828
SOLOMON...THANK YOU.

00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:57.470
Rescue man: WE DID IT!
WE'VE BROKEN THROUGH!

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:59.105
ARE YOU DOWN THERE?

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:02.375
Second man:
DID YOU SURVIVE?

00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:04.544
HE SAVED MY LIFE,
REBECCA.

00:19:06.212 --> 00:19:07.814
BUT THERE'S MORE.
IN MY DUEL WITH SOLOMON,

00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.618
IT'S TRUE THAT I SENT
ANY NUMBER OF MONSTERS
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:19:13.219 --> 00:19:15.021
TO BRING THE SHADOW GHOUL
TO ITS ULTIMATE POWER,

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.824
BUT I NEVER FAILED
TO HONOR THOSE MONSTERS

00:19:18.892 --> 00:19:19.559
FOR THEIR SACRIFICE.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.063
IN THEIR OWN WAY,
THEY WERE EVERY BIT
AS IMPORTANT TO ME

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:25.832
AS THE SHADOW GHOUL
CARD ITSELF.

00:19:26.299 --> 00:19:26.966
OH...

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.768
EVEN MORE THAN
THE MONSTERS, THOUGH,

00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:31.237
A DUELIST MUST ALWAYS
RESPECT HIS OPPONENT.

00:19:32.338 --> 00:19:34.140
IN SOLOMON'S CASE,
I FELT SUCH RESPECT
AND GRATITUDE

00:19:35.942 --> 00:19:37.744
THAT I GAVE HIM
MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:41.181
YEAH, AND HE SHOWED
HIS RESPECT AND THANKS
BY RIPPING IT UP!

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:43.650
IT WAS DAMAGED,
ARTHUR.
FORGIVE ME.

00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.186
THAT DOESN'T MATTER,
SOLOMON.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.823
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
YOU KEPT IT AS A TOKEN
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:19:50.323 --> 00:19:51.925
YOU VALUED THE CARD
NOT FOR ITS RARITY

00:19:53.293 --> 00:19:55.095
BUT FOR WHAT
IT REPRESENTS--
THE BOND BETWEEN US.

00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:57.997
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
REBECCA?

00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:01.101
GREAT DUELS CAN FORM
THE BASIS OF GREAT
AND LASTING FRIENDSHIPS

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:03.736
BECAUSE THE CARDS
ARE ABOUT HEART.

00:20:04.637 --> 00:20:05.305
MY HEART?

00:20:06.072 --> 00:20:07.073
THE HEART
OF EVERY DUELIST.

00:20:07.907 --> 00:20:09.109
AND THE HEART
OF THE CARDS.

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:11.511
THAT'S WHAT YUGI
WAS TRYING
TO SHOW YOU.

00:20:12.345 --> 00:20:13.146
OH, YUGI, I'M SORRY.

00:20:14.681 --> 00:20:15.348
IT'S OK, REBECCA.

00:20:16.349 --> 00:20:17.350
YOU MEAN
YOU FORGIVE ME?

00:20:18.952 --> 00:20:19.953
SURE. HERE,
TAKE THIS CARD.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:21.688
THE TIES OF FRIENDSHIP?

00:20:23.223 --> 00:20:24.624
YEAH. I'D LIKE YOU
TO HAVE IT.

00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:25.859
THANK YOU, YUGI.

00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:27.494
SAY, SOLOMON,

00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:30.163
IT'S BEEN AGES
SINCE YOU AND I HAVE
DUELED.

00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:32.932
IS THAT A CHALLENGE
I HEAR, ARTHUR?

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.701
OH, WOW!
THIS I
GOTTA SEE!

00:20:35.535 --> 00:20:36.202
DUELIN'
GRANDPAS!

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:37.237
MR. MOTO,
REMEMBER,

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.072
YOU JUST
GOT OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL.

00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:41.141
YES, BUT I COULD OUTDUEL
ANY OF YOU YOUNG TURKS

00:20:42.308 --> 00:20:43.910
EVEN IF I WAS STILL
IN A COMA.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.411
[ALL LAUGH]
