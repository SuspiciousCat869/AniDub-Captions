00:07:16.192 --> 00:07:19.529
MAKO TSUNAMI,
I ACCEPT YOUR CHALLENGE.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.533
Mako: BEHOLD, YUGI MUTO.

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.439
WE SHALL BATTLE
BESIDE THE MAJESTIC SEA.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:31.274
OH.
AH.
HMM.

00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:41.384
THE PLAYING FIELD
IS EQUALLY SPLIT
INTO 2 HALVES.

00:07:41.384 --> 00:07:44.520
ONE HALF IS LAND.
THE OTHER IS SEA.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.656
AND THE STAKES, MAKO?

00:07:46.656 --> 00:07:49.425
I WAGER 2 STAR CHIPS
ON THIS MATCH.

00:07:49.425 --> 00:07:51.127
2 STARS.

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:55.264
[THINKING] FINALLY,
AN ADVERSARY OF REAL MERIT.

00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:57.100
HOW I HAVE WAITED
FOR THIS DAY.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.335
[ALOUD] NOW,
LET THE BATTLE BEGIN!

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:00.603
Both: DUEL!

00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:04.173
THIS SHOULD BE
SOME MATCH.

00:08:04.173 --> 00:08:06.576
SINK THAT SOGGY
SUCKER, YUGI!

00:08:06.576 --> 00:08:08.644
I'M CURIOUS TO SEE

00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:12.348
HOW YOU WILL COMBAT
MY MIGHTY DENIZENS
OF THE DEEP.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.218
WHAT'S THIS?

00:08:15.218 --> 00:08:17.587
HIS CREATURE
IS UNDERWATER.

00:08:17.587 --> 00:08:19.622
HOW DO I CHOOSE
WHICH CARD TO PLAY

00:08:19.622 --> 00:08:21.858
WHEN I CAN'T EVEN SEE
WHAT I'M FIGHTING?

00:08:21.858 --> 00:08:23.860
THIS I DON'T LIKE.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.496
THE OCEAN CONCEALS
MANY THINGS

00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:27.997
BENEATH ITS SHIFTING SURFACE.

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:33.536
[SNARLS]
AS LONG AS THAT THING
STAYS SUBMERGED,

00:08:33.536 --> 00:08:34.837
I CAN'T ATTACK.

00:08:34.837 --> 00:08:38.207
I PROMISE HE WON'T
STAY SUBMERGED FOR VERY LONG.

00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:39.642
[THINKING]
I HAVE NO IDEA

00:08:39.642 --> 00:08:41.244
WHAT THAT THING IS
DOWN THERE,

00:08:41.244 --> 00:08:43.246
SO I'D BETTER PREPARE
FOR THE WORST

00:08:43.246 --> 00:08:45.648
WITH AS STRONG A DEFENSE
AS POSSIBLE.

00:08:45.648 --> 00:08:48.518
[THINKING] HMM...
CLEARLY THIS IS YUGI'S
FIRST ENCOUNTER

00:08:48.518 --> 00:08:50.253
WITH SEA-BASED
DUEL MONSTERS.

00:08:50.253 --> 00:08:54.023
HE WILL LEARN FIRSTHAND
WHAT A POWERFUL ALLY
THE SEA CAN BE.

00:08:54.023 --> 00:08:56.459
IT GIVES MY CREATURES
A FIELD POWER BONUS,

00:08:56.459 --> 00:08:57.794
AND IT CONCEALS THEM,

00:08:57.794 --> 00:09:00.663
MAKING THEIR STEALTHY ATTACKS
EVEN MORE LETHAL.

00:09:00.663 --> 00:09:01.964
SOMETHING'S FISHY.

00:09:01.964 --> 00:09:03.833
HOW COULD HE FIGHT
WHAT HE CAN'T SEE?

00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:04.834
BEATS ME.

00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:06.402
THIS IS
TOTALLY BOGUS!

00:09:06.402 --> 00:09:07.904
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:09:07.904 --> 00:09:10.106
IT SEEMS THAT
MY OCEAN-BASED STRATEGY

00:09:10.106 --> 00:09:12.341
HAS TAKEN YOU
BY SURPRISE, YUGI.

00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:15.344
[THINKING] MAYBE SO...
BUT I CAN STILL RAISE
A STRONG DEFENSE.

00:09:15.344 --> 00:09:18.414
I CALL UPON
THE HORN IMP!

00:09:21.217 --> 00:09:23.219
[ROARS]

00:09:23.219 --> 00:09:25.788
NOW, FIEND KRACKEN...
ENSNARE HIM!

00:09:26.989 --> 00:09:28.591
MY IMP!

00:09:31.093 --> 00:09:32.261
[ROARS]

00:09:34.063 --> 00:09:35.064
ATTACK!

00:09:35.064 --> 00:09:36.999
[ALL GASP]
WHAT IS THAT?

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:38.334
Joey: WHATEVER IT IS,

00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:40.036
IT'S BAD NEWS FOR YUGI.

00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:47.605
Joey: OH, MAN.
YUGI'S IMP IS DONE FOR.

00:09:47.605 --> 00:09:49.808
FIEND KRACKEN,
END THIS NOW!

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:51.910
AAH!

00:09:53.578 --> 00:09:55.447
Mako: WELL DONE,
KRACKEN.

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:57.449
[SNARLS]

00:09:57.449 --> 00:09:59.918
WOW. AND THAT
WAS JUST HIS
OPENING MOVE.

00:10:02.654 --> 00:10:04.189
[SIGHS]
YOU'RE GOOD, MAKO.

00:10:04.189 --> 00:10:05.557
A BRILLIANT
OPENING PLAY.

00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.792
Mako: I AM PLEASED
YOU APPRECIATE IT,

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:09.994
THOUGH I VERY MUCH DOUBT
YOUR IMP DID.

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:13.264
WELL, NOW I KNOW
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

00:10:13.264 --> 00:10:16.101
YES, THE MIGHTY OCEAN
COMMANDS RESPECT,

00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:18.303
AS DO THE CREATURES
THAT INHABIT IT.

00:10:18.303 --> 00:10:20.672
[THINKING]
MAYBE I CAN PREPARE
AN ATTACK

00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:22.607
THAT WILL DESTROY
HIS CREATURES,

00:10:22.607 --> 00:10:25.243
EVEN THOUGH
I CAN'T SEE THEM.

00:10:25.243 --> 00:10:26.511
FERAL IMP!

00:10:28.546 --> 00:10:29.547
[SNARLS]

00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:30.749
[THINKING]
MY FERAL IMP

00:10:30.749 --> 00:10:33.184
SHOULD DISPENSE WITH
MAKO'S MONSTERS,

00:10:33.184 --> 00:10:36.187
NO MATTER HOW DEEP
THEY'RE HIDDEN
IN THE SEA.

00:10:36.187 --> 00:10:39.190
I AM FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR FERAL MONSTER

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.625
AND ITS ELECTRICAL ATTACK,

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:43.628
SO FOR MY NEXT CARD,
I PLAY...

00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:46.531
MY GIANT JELLYFISH.

00:10:47.832 --> 00:10:49.534
HA HA HA HA.
BEHOLD!

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:52.504
[UNDERWATER SHRIEK]

00:10:52.504 --> 00:10:54.439
UHH...I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:56.241
AH HA HA HA HA!

00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:58.543
THAT IS THE BATTLE CRY
OF MY CREATURE.

00:10:58.543 --> 00:11:00.245
IT'LL BE CRYING,
ALL RIGHT...

00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:01.780
ONCE I COMBINE
MY FERAL IMP

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.149
WITH THE MAGICAL HORN
OF THE UNICORN!

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:08.319
[SNARLS]

00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:14.526
ALL RIGHT.

00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:15.627
WHAT?

00:11:15.627 --> 00:11:17.595
YUGI CAN'T SEE
MAKO'S MONSTERS,

00:11:17.595 --> 00:11:19.330
BUT HE KNOWS
THEY'RE ALL UNDERWATER,

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.032
AND WATER
CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY.

00:11:21.032 --> 00:11:23.168
OH! SO THEY'RE
VULNERABLE

00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:24.969
TO THE FERAL IMP'S
ELECTRICAL ATTACK.

00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:27.605
WHOA!
THAT IS SO SMART!

00:11:29.007 --> 00:11:30.942
MAGIC LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:32.944
[ROARS]

00:11:35.647 --> 00:11:37.715
IT'S A FISH FRY!

00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:39.284
[ROARS]

00:11:41.686 --> 00:11:43.688
Yugi: BUT WAIT!
WHAT IS THIS?

00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:46.691
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.
MAKO STILL HAS ALL
HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:47.926
AH HA HA HA.

00:11:47.926 --> 00:11:50.695
YOUR STRATEGY HAS FAILED,
YUGI. HA HA HA HA!

00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:51.930
HOW?!

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.399
AS A SEA DUELIST,
I AM WELL AWARE

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.034
THAT WATER CONDUCTS
ELECTRICITY,

00:11:56.034 --> 00:11:58.837
SO I PLAYED
MY GIANT JELLYFISH.

00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:00.271
IT HAS THE MAGICAL ABILITY

00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:02.407
TO ABSORB ALL
ELECTRICAL ATTACKS,

00:12:02.407 --> 00:12:04.776
PROTECTING ALL
OF MY OCEAN CREATURES.

00:12:04.776 --> 00:12:05.977
[SNARLS]

00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:07.278
[JELLYFISH SCREECHES]

00:12:07.278 --> 00:12:09.848
AND NOW IT'S TIME
FOR MY COUNTERATTACK.

00:12:09.848 --> 00:12:12.450
FIEND KRACKEN,
CRUSH HIS FERAL IMP!

00:12:18.957 --> 00:12:20.425
CRUSH HIM NOW!

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.494
[SNARLS]

00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:24.696
HA HA HA!

00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:26.664
DID YOU ENJOY
MY KRACKEN'S EMBRACE?

00:12:26.664 --> 00:12:28.066
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:29.534
[THINKING]
I'VE NEVER DUELED

00:12:29.534 --> 00:12:31.569
AGAINST CREATURES
LIKE THESE BEFORE.

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:34.372
IT FEELS
AS IF I'M BATTLING
MAKO'S SEA MONSTERS

00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:37.375
AND THE AWESOME POWER
OF THE OCEAN ITSELF.

00:12:38.543 --> 00:12:40.612
Mako: DO ANY OF YOUR CARDS
HAVE THE POWER

00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:42.680
TO STAND AGAINST
MY OCEAN PETS?

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.148
I HAVE THE POWER OF...

00:12:44.148 --> 00:12:45.316
SILVER FANG...

00:12:45.316 --> 00:12:46.451
AND I COMBINE HIM

00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.519
WITH THE MAGIC
OF THE FULL MOON

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:49.554
TO DOUBLE
HIS FEROCITY.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.258
[HOWLS]

00:12:53.258 --> 00:12:56.227
AH HA HA HA.
FEROCIOUS INDEED,

00:12:56.227 --> 00:12:58.630
BUT THE MOON
ALSO CONTROLS THE TIDES,

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.697
CAUSING THEM TO RISE...

00:13:01.199 --> 00:13:03.735
ALLOWING ME TO UNLEASH
MY NEXT CREATURE.

00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:06.437
ARISE, MIGHTY KAIRYUSHIN!

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:10.141
[GRUNTS] WHAT'S THIS?

00:13:12.777 --> 00:13:13.811
[ROARS]

00:13:14.846 --> 00:13:17.382
WHOA, THAT IS
ONE BIG FISH!

00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:20.118
Mako: BEHOLD,
THE COLOSSAL KAIRYUSHIN!

00:13:20.118 --> 00:13:21.653
A CREATURE SO ENORMOUS,

00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:23.855
THAT WHEN HE RISES UP
FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS,

00:13:23.855 --> 00:13:25.857
HE CREATES
HIS OWN TIDAL WAVE!

00:13:25.857 --> 00:13:27.592
WHAT A BEAST!

00:13:27.592 --> 00:13:29.661
YOUR WOLF IS BRAVE, YUGI,

00:13:29.661 --> 00:13:32.797
BUT HE WILL NOT STAND
BEFORE MY KAIRYUSHIN'S
TIDAL ATTACK.

00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:35.133
[ROARS]
[HOWLS]

00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:37.468
Yugi: NO! SILVER FANG!

00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:40.905
GONE...

00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:43.241
BUT MY KAIRYUSHIN'S
TIDAL ATTACK DID MORE

00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:45.143
THAN SIMPLY WASH
YOUR WOLF CUB AWAY.

00:13:45.143 --> 00:13:46.344
WHAT?

00:13:46.344 --> 00:13:48.880
IT CONSIDERABLY ALTERED
OUR PLAYING FIELD.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.081
HUH! MY LAND!

00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:52.951
KAIRYUSHIN'S ATTACK
HAS NEARLY WASHED AWAY

00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:55.853
MY ENTIRE LAND-BASED
PLAYING FIELD!

00:13:55.853 --> 00:13:57.121
AH HA HA HA!

00:13:57.121 --> 00:13:59.524
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
YOURSELF LUCKY, YUGI.

00:13:59.524 --> 00:14:02.026
IN MY PREVIOUS DUELS,
WHEN KAIRYUSHIN ATTACKS,

00:14:02.026 --> 00:14:04.629
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS LEFT
STANDING IN ITS WAKE.

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:07.231
I THINK IT WAS QUITE
CONSIDERATE OF MY PET

00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:11.903
TO LEAVE YOU
A LITTLE PATCH OF DIRT
TO STAND ON, DON'T YOU?

00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:13.171
OR DOES IT
MAKE YOU UNEASY

00:14:13.171 --> 00:14:15.840
TO BE SURROUNDED
ON ALL SIDES BY THE SEA?

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.110
ALL MEN GIVE PAUSE
BEFORE THE SAVAGE POWER

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.545
OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN...

00:14:20.545 --> 00:14:22.647
EVEN THE GREATEST
OF FISHERMEN.

00:14:22.647 --> 00:14:24.315
YOU MEAN YOUR FATHER.

00:14:24.315 --> 00:14:27.018
MY FATHER WAS
A GREAT FISHERMAN.

00:14:27.018 --> 00:14:28.786
HE TAUGHT ME MY LOVE
OF THE SEA...

00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:32.056
BUT ONE DAY,
THE SEA...TOOK HIM.

00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:36.060
I LOVED GOING OUT
ON THE BOAT WITH MY FATHER,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.497
JUST THE TWO OF US
AND THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL OCEAN,

00:14:39.497 --> 00:14:42.166
NEVER SUSPECTING THAT THE SEA
WOULD TURN ON US.

00:14:42.166 --> 00:14:44.535
LOOK, MAKO.
THERE'S A STORM
BLOWING IN.

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:45.536
A BIG ONE?

00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:46.704
MAYBE.

00:14:46.704 --> 00:14:47.739
I'VE LEARNED
TO NEVER TAKE
CHANCES

00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:49.007
WITH THE SEA.
OH.

00:14:50.008 --> 00:14:51.175
AND FATHER WAS RIGHT.

00:14:51.175 --> 00:14:52.944
SUDDENLY, THE CALM,
FRIENDLY SEA

00:14:52.944 --> 00:14:54.846
TURNED INTO
A RAGING MAELSTROM.

00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:57.081
IT PITCHED OUR BOAT
AS IF IT WERE A TOY.

00:14:57.081 --> 00:14:58.750
AH, FATHER!
I CAN'T HOLD ON!

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.151
IT'S OK, MAKO.

00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:02.987
THERE.
I'VE TIED YOU DOWN.

00:15:02.987 --> 00:15:04.789
YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE, SON.
I PROMISE.

00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:05.790
DAD, LOOK OUT!

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.725
Both: AAAAH!

00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:13.297
WHEN THE STORM
FINALLY DIED OUT,

00:15:13.297 --> 00:15:16.634
OUR LITTLE BOAT
HAD WASHED ASHORE.

00:15:16.634 --> 00:15:17.769
OUR LITTLE BOAT
MY FATHER WAS RIGHT.

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:19.670
<i>I</i> HAD BEEN PERFECTLY SAFE.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.540
BUT BECAUSE HE HAD STOPPED
TO TIE ME DOWN,

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.143
HE HAD NO TIME TO SECURE
HIMSELF TO THE MAST!

00:15:26.377 --> 00:15:28.179
I THOUGHT I HAD
LOST HIM FOREVER,

00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:30.681
BUT THEN I NOTICED
THAT OUR LIFEBOAT WAS MISSING.

00:15:30.681 --> 00:15:33.084
I KNOW MY FATHER IS ALIVE...

00:15:33.084 --> 00:15:35.586
SO I WILL WIN THIS CONTEST,
BUY A SHIP,

00:15:35.586 --> 00:15:38.589
AND SEARCH THE 7 SEAS
UNTIL I FIND HIM!

00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.658
THAT IS WHY
I DUEL, YUGI.

00:15:40.658 --> 00:15:41.959
THAT IS WHY
I MUST WIN

00:15:41.959 --> 00:15:43.895
AND YOU MUST LOSE.

00:15:43.895 --> 00:15:45.763
I UNDERSTAND, MAKO,
BELIEVE ME.

00:15:45.763 --> 00:15:48.266
BUT I STILL CAN'T
LET YOU WIN.

FOR HIS DAD

00:15:51.803 --> 00:15:53.671
LIKE YUGI DUELS
FOR HIS GRANDPA.

00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:55.239

LEFT TO ME

I'VE REALLY
GOTTA MAKE THIS
NEXT PLAY COUNT.

00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:02.814
I NEED SOMETHING
THAT WILL HELP ME
TURN THE TIDE...

00:16:02.814 --> 00:16:04.682

DOWN TO AN ISLAND,
MAKO,

00:16:13.524 --> 00:16:16.394
BUT MY STONE SOLDIER
STILL GETS A FIELD
POWER BONUS.

00:16:18.663 --> 00:16:22.200
YOUR MASSIVE MONSTER
CAN BARELY FIT
ON THAT LITTLE ROCK,

LET ALONE DO BATTLE
WITH MY UNDERSEA ATTACK FORCE.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.007

ON ALL SIDES BY THE OCEAN,

00:16:31.876 --> 00:16:33.845

[SHARK SCREECHES]

00:16:37.682 --> 00:16:39.117
THIS SAVAGE SHARK

00:16:39.117 --> 00:16:40.785
WILL LEAD MY OTHER
SEA CREATURES

00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:43.087
IN AN ALL-OUT

ABOUT TO BECOME

00:16:55.592 --> 00:16:56.927
THIS IS IT, YUGI.

00:16:56.927 --> 00:17:00.096
IT'S OVER,
BUT YOU PLAYED HONORABLY.

00:17:00.096 --> 00:17:03.633
YOU HAVE BEEN
A FAIR AND NOBLE
OPPONENT, TOO, MAKO,

00:17:03.633 --> 00:17:05.101
BUT I ALSO DUEL

00:17:05.101 --> 00:17:06.870
WITH THE FATE
OF A LOVED ONE
AT STAKE...

00:17:08.338 --> 00:17:10.273
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE.

00:17:10.273 --> 00:17:12.175
I SWITCH
MY STONE SOLDIER

00:17:12.175 --> 00:17:13.777
TO ATTACK MODE!

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:17.147

00:17:17.147 --> 00:17:18.548
BUT WHY?

00:17:18.548 --> 00:17:20.650
HE CANNOT ATTACK
MY SEA MONSTERS

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.252
WHILE THEY ARE UNDERWATER.

00:17:22.252 --> 00:17:25.088
BUT HIS TARGET ISN'T
YOUR SEA MONSTERS.

00:17:25.088 --> 00:17:28.792
I'M HAVING HIM
ATTACK A CARD I PUT
ON THE FIELD MYSELF.

00:17:32.829 --> 00:17:34.331

NOW, STONE SOLDIER!

00:17:36.099 --> 00:17:38.268
DESTROY THE MOON!

00:17:43.874 --> 00:17:45.242
AAH!

IT'S GOING OUT!

00:17:54.117 --> 00:17:56.119
BUT HOW?

00:17:56.119 --> 00:17:58.688
AS YOU YOURSELF
SAID BEFORE, MAKO,

00:17:58.688 --> 00:18:01.558
IT IS THE MOON
THAT CONTROLS
THE OCEAN'S TIDES...

00:18:01.558 --> 00:18:03.693
ITS EBB AND ITS FLOW.

00:18:03.693 --> 00:18:05.795
SO I ORDERED

AND NOW I'LL DELIVER
THE FINAL BLOW.

I COMBINE MY
