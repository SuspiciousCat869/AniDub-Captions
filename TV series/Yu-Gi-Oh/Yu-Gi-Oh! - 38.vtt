00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.956
[THINKING]
YUGI, IF THIS IS
TOO MUCH FOR YOU,

00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:46.125
YOU SHOULD LET ME
TAKE OVER.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.761
[THINKING]
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:51.731
I JUST WANT TO TRY
TO LAST OUT THE TURN.

00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:54.801
[THINKING]
HE'S TOO YOUNG AND UNSKILLED
TO COPE WITH THE STRESS,

00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.836
AND COMMUNICATING
WITH THAT OTHER SPIRIT

00:07:56.836 --> 00:07:59.172
SPLITS HIS CONCENTRATION
EVEN MORE.

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:03.109
HIS MENTAL
AND MAGICAL ENERGIES
WILL SOON BE EXHAUSTED.

00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:06.813
UNH!

00:08:06.813 --> 00:08:08.347
YOU FELT IT,
TOO, HUH?

00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:10.883
YEAH, A SHARP JOLT,
RIGHT IN MY HEART,

00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:12.251
ALONG WITH
THE STRANGEST FEELING

00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.187
THAT SOMETHING BAD
HAS HAPPENED TO YUGI.

00:08:14.187 --> 00:08:15.721
TELL ME
ABOUT IT, TéA.

00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:18.758
I THINK THAT
OUR LITTLE BUDDY'S
IN BIG TROUBLE.

00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:20.726
I KNOW.

00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:21.661
HUH?
HUH?

00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:23.095
YOU FELT IT, TOO?

00:08:23.095 --> 00:08:25.298
YEAH, MAYBE
IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE
ALL BECOME SO TIGHT,

00:08:25.298 --> 00:08:26.666
BUT IT'S LIKE
WE'VE DEVELOPED

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.601
SOME KIND
OF WEIRD LINK
WITH HIM.

00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:30.236
FOR SURE.

00:08:30.236 --> 00:08:33.239
YEAH, BUT IF WE'RE
FEELING WHAT HE'S FEELING,

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:35.241
IT MUST BE
REALLY BAD IN THERE.

00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:38.177
Joey: IF ONLY
THERE WAS SOME WAY
WE COULD HELP HIM.

00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:40.479
YOU'RE LOOKING
A LITTLE PALE, YUGI.

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:43.349
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE UP
YOUR MIND-SHUFFLE STRATEGY.

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:44.917
TAKE A BREATHER.

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:47.653
I CAN SEND YOU
BACK TO YOUR WORLD

00:08:47.653 --> 00:08:50.556
ANYTIME YOU'RE
READY TO SURRENDER.

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:53.793
[THINKING] YUGI,
FOR ONCE, PEGASUS
IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:08:53.793 --> 00:08:55.294
YOUR MIND
JUST CAN'T HANDLE

00:08:55.294 --> 00:08:57.763
THE STRESS OF MAINTAINING
OUR MONSTERS.

00:08:57.763 --> 00:09:00.466
[THINKING] OK.
TAKE OVER--FOR NOW.

00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:03.736
I'LL USE MY TURN TO ATTACK
WITH CURSE OF DRAGON!

00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:06.205
[SCREECHING]

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:11.644
[THINKING]
AN IMPULSIVE ATTACK,
PRECIPITATED, NO DOUBT,

00:09:11.644 --> 00:09:13.946
BY HIS CONCERN
FOR LITTLE YUGI.

00:09:13.946 --> 00:09:17.416
BUT IN HIS RUSH,
HE'S MADE A FATAL MISTAKE.

00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:20.953
YOUR ATTACK ACTIVATES
DARK EYES ILLUSIONIST'S

00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:22.688
SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:09:24.657 --> 00:09:26.559
MESMERIZING MAGIC!

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.328
HE STOPPED HIM.

00:09:29.328 --> 00:09:30.463
TO MAKE UP FOR DARK EYES'

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:32.932
NONEXISTENT ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS,

00:09:32.932 --> 00:09:35.768
I ENDOWED HIM
WITH A SPECIAL ABILITY.

00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:39.538
DARK EYES ILLUSIONIST
CAN USE THE POWER
OF ITS MESMERIC EYE

00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:42.775
TO PARALYZE
ATTACKING MONSTERS
IN THEIR TRACKS.

00:09:42.775 --> 00:09:45.011
WITH SUCH A SUPERB MONSTER
AT MY DISPOSAL,

00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:47.246
WHAT COULD MY NEXT
BRILLIANT MOVE BE?

00:09:47.246 --> 00:09:48.447
JUST PLAY IT.

00:09:48.447 --> 00:09:49.916
AS YOU WISH.

00:09:49.916 --> 00:09:51.117
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I'M GOING TO USE

00:09:51.117 --> 00:09:53.152
THE BLACK
ILLUSION RITUAL CARD

00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:55.655
TO SACRIFICE
MY INCREDIBLE DARK EYES.

00:09:55.655 --> 00:09:57.390
"HAS HE GONE INSANE,"
YOU MIGHT ASK,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.658
"SACRIFICING A CREATURE

00:09:58.658 --> 00:10:01.260
THAT CAN PARALYZE
ANY MONSTER I PLAY?"

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.796
NO. I'M MERELY
USING THIS CEREMONY

00:10:03.796 --> 00:10:05.765
TO CREATE
AN EVEN BETTER MONSTER.

00:10:05.765 --> 00:10:08.734
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:12.672
I HEREBY SACRIFICE
DARK EYES ILLUSIONIST

00:10:12.672 --> 00:10:14.874
TO SUMMON ANOTHER
SPELLCASTER MONSTER.

00:10:14.874 --> 00:10:16.809
YES, THERE'S MORE.

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:20.546
THE INCREDIBLE,
EXTRAORDINARY,

00:10:20.546 --> 00:10:23.516
UNFORGETTABLE CREATURE
KNOWN ONLY AS...

RELINQUISHED!

00:10:26.052 --> 00:10:27.687
QUITE A LOOKER, HUH?

00:10:29.755 --> 00:10:31.791
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER
CAN THIS BE?

00:10:31.791 --> 00:10:33.125
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

00:10:33.125 --> 00:10:37.496
I'LL SHOW YOU
BY ACTIVATING
ITS SPECIAL POWER.

00:10:37.496 --> 00:10:41.767
IT'S EVEN MORE IRRESISTIBLE
THAN MY PREVIOUS CREATURE.

00:10:41.767 --> 00:10:44.036
[SCREECHING]

00:10:47.573 --> 00:10:50.242
OH, NO!
MY CURSE OF DRAGON!

00:10:52.812 --> 00:10:55.181
GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN.

00:10:55.181 --> 00:10:57.850
UHH! DARK MAGICIAN,
GO NOW!

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.685
ATTACK RELINQUISHED!

00:10:59.685 --> 00:11:02.054
DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:11:02.054 --> 00:11:03.889
RELINQUISHED,
ACTIVATE YOUR DEFENSE SHIELD.

00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.059
[SCREECHES]

00:11:07.059 --> 00:11:09.662
NO! IT'S USING
MY CAPTURED
CURSE OF DRAGON

00:11:09.662 --> 00:11:11.530
AS A SHIELD
AGAINST THE ATTACK!

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.167
THE DARK MAGICIAN'S ATTACK
ELIMINATES CURSE OF DRAGON

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.535
FROM THE GAME!

00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:18.637
BUT, SINCE
HE WAS YOUR CREATURE,

00:11:18.637 --> 00:11:20.573
YOU LOSE THE LIFE POINTS.

00:11:20.573 --> 00:11:22.875
BY ABSORBING
ITS OPPONENT'S MONSTERS,

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:24.577
RELINQUISHED CAN USE THEM

00:11:24.577 --> 00:11:26.579
AND THEIR ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:29.048
TO PROTECT AGAINST
ANY ATTACKING MONSTER.

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:30.983
RELINQUISHED
REMAINS UNHARMED,

00:11:30.983 --> 00:11:33.252
WHILE THE OPPONENT
SUFFERS THE DAMAGE.

00:11:33.252 --> 00:11:36.155
YOUR OWN ATTACK
REDUCED YOUR LIFE POINTS!

00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:38.557
AS LONG AS I HAVE
RELINQUISHED IN PLAY,

00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:40.593
YOU'RE
YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY!

00:11:47.397 --> 00:11:50.099
OOH, HOW FRUSTRATING
IT MUST BE TO BE YOU,

00:11:50.099 --> 00:11:53.002
TO KNOW YOU HAVE
ALL THESE GREAT
MONSTERS IN YOUR DECK

00:11:53.002 --> 00:11:56.205
AND, IF YOU DARE PLAY
ANY OF THEM, THEY WILL BE
USED AGAINST YOU.

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:59.409
THIS GAME'S NOT OVER
YET, PEGASUS.

00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:01.144
NO, BUT IT
MIGHT AS WELL BE.

00:12:01.144 --> 00:12:04.580
MY MONSTER'S UNSTOPPABLE.
WATCH!

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.318
I ACTIVATE RELINQUISHED'S
HYPNOTIC ATTRACTION.

00:12:13.356 --> 00:12:16.326
TRY AS HE MIGHT TO RESIST,
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN

00:12:16.326 --> 00:12:17.760
WILL FIND MY SPELLCASTER

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.463
AS IRRESISTIBLE
AS YOUR DRAGON DID.

00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:22.632
LIKE YOUR DRAGON,
HE'LL SOON BE MINE.

00:12:30.073 --> 00:12:31.541
NO! MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:12:35.044 --> 00:12:36.979
IT CAPTURED HIM, TOO!

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:41.317
OHH! AND NOW

00:12:41.317 --> 00:12:43.186
IT'S TURNED HIM INTO
ANOTHER DEFENSE SHIELD!

00:12:43.186 --> 00:12:45.888
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI.

00:12:45.888 --> 00:12:47.623
YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO CATCH ON,

00:12:47.623 --> 00:12:50.526
AND THIS TIME,
I'VE GOT ONE OF YOUR MOST
POWERFUL MONSTERS

00:12:50.526 --> 00:12:52.061
TO USE AGAINST YOU.

00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:54.263
NOT TO MENTION
YOUR PERSONAL FAVORITE.

00:12:54.263 --> 00:12:57.533
BUT, IN AN ATTACK,
HE'LL TAKE YOUR LIFE POINTS
ALL THE SAME.

00:12:57.533 --> 00:12:59.635
GUESS YOU'RE
NOT HIS FAVORITE,

00:12:59.635 --> 00:13:01.070
NOT ANYMORE.

[THINKING]
HOW CAN I POSSIBLY WIN?

00:13:02.538 --> 00:13:04.974
ANY MONSTER I USE
WILL BE TURNED AGAINST ME,

00:13:04.974 --> 00:13:07.043
AND EVEN IF I COME UP
WITH ANOTHER STRATEGY,

00:13:07.043 --> 00:13:08.978
PEGASUS WILL
KNOW IT INSTANTLY.

00:13:08.978 --> 00:13:10.179
[THINKING]
WE CAN'T GIVE UP!

00:13:10.179 --> 00:13:11.781
WE HAVE TO
MIND-SHUFFLE AGAIN

00:13:11.781 --> 00:13:14.016
LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO PLAY A CARD
AND RETREAT

00:13:14.016 --> 00:13:15.852
BEFORE PEGASUS
CAN READ MY MIND.

00:13:15.852 --> 00:13:18.488
IT WORKED BEFORE.
IT'LL WORK AGAIN!

[THINKING] ARE YOU
SURE YOU'RE UP TO THIS?

00:13:20.289 --> 00:13:22.992
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG YOU CAN LAST
IN THE SHADOW REALM.

00:13:22.992 --> 00:13:24.927
I DON'T HAVE
TO LAST LONG,

00:13:24.927 --> 00:13:27.430
JUST LONG ENOUGH
TO PULL ONE LAST CARD.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.165
BUT IF YOU
REACH THE LIMITS
OF YOUR ENDURANCE,

00:13:29.165 --> 00:13:30.666
YOUR SOUL
WILL BE SHREDDED,

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:33.403

IN THE SHADOW REALM
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:35.371
WHATEVER THE RISK,
I HAVE TO TAKE IT,

00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:37.340
FOR GRANDPA'S SAKE.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.942

IN THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

TO PLAY FAST.

IT'S LITTLE YUGI.
HE'S BACK.

00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:54.123
SOME PEOPLE
NEVER LEARN.

00:13:56.826 --> 00:13:59.662
[THINKING]
I'VE GOT TO HAVE FAITH
IN THE HEART OF THE CARDS...

00:13:59.662 --> 00:14:02.398
BECAUSE THE NEXT
CARD I PULL...

00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:03.800
MIGHT BE MY LAST.

00:14:05.268 --> 00:14:07.770
PLEASE, MAKE IT ONE
THAT CAN DEFEAT PEGASUS.

00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:10.072

TO THE SPIRIT

00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:17.013
OF THE MILLENNIUM
PUZZLE NOW.

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:20.216

ONE CARD FACEDOWN.

FOR MY LAST MOVE,

00:14:23.419 --> 00:14:26.289
I THROW FERAL IMP
IN DEFENSE MODE!

AT LEAST NOW

00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:32.295
THERE'S ONE CARD
THAT PEGASUS
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT.

00:14:32.295 --> 00:14:34.797
NOW MAYBE
WE STAND A CHANCE.

TO READ HIS MIND,

00:14:37.099 --> 00:14:38.734
THEY'LL JUST
SWITCH AGAIN.

00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:40.670
SO INSTEAD,
I'LL OVERTAX IT,

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.238

BUT WHAT?

00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:27.917
OR WORSE.

00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:29.619
[THUNDER]

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.093
Yami Yugi:
YUGI! YUGI!

00:15:37.093 --> 00:15:38.761
I CAN'T
SENSE HIS SPIRIT.

00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:41.964
I CAN NO LONGER
FEEL THE PRESENCE
OF HIS YOUNG MIND.

00:15:41.964 --> 00:15:45.501
NO. HE--
HE CAN'T BE GONE!

00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:48.170
FORGET HIM.
THE BOY WAS TOO WEAK.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.406
IT TAKES A PERSON
OF TRUE FORTITUDE

00:15:50.406 --> 00:15:53.409
TO COPE WITH
THE HARSH UNREALITIES
OF THE SHADOW REALM.

00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:57.346
FACE IT.
YUGI IS GONE, AND IT'S
JUST YOU AND ME NOW.

00:16:00.016 --> 00:16:02.051
THIS IS TOO FREAKY.

00:16:02.051 --> 00:16:04.120
SUDDENLY, I'M NOT
FEELING YUGI AT ALL.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.154
IT'S LIKE
HE'S VANISHED

00:16:05.154 --> 00:16:06.556
OFF THE FACE
OF THE PLANET.

00:16:06.556 --> 00:16:08.824
I KNOW.
WHAT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO HIM?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.392
I'M TELLING YA,
I'M GETTING CREEPED OUT.

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:17.793
ONE MINUTE,
I WAS FEELING YUGI

00:16:17.793 --> 00:16:19.295
LIKE HE WAS RIGHT HERE
BESIDE ME,

00:16:19.295 --> 00:16:20.863
AND THEN THE NEXT...

00:16:20.863 --> 00:16:23.832
HE WAS GONE.
I FELT IT, TOO.

00:16:23.832 --> 00:16:26.602
[THINKING] ME, TOO.
WE'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM.

00:16:26.602 --> 00:16:28.337
HE NEEDS OUR HELP. YUGI!

00:16:28.337 --> 00:16:29.939
HUH? TéA, NO!

00:16:29.939 --> 00:16:32.107
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:16:32.107 --> 00:16:33.642
UH, I'M NOT SURE.

00:16:34.944 --> 00:16:36.378
HMM.

00:16:36.378 --> 00:16:37.913
OH! OH!

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:39.615
SO, WHAT'LL WE DO NOW?

00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:42.051
STAND BACK.
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME WAY IN.

00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.320
OHH!
AAH!

00:16:46.355 --> 00:16:48.757
HUH? HUH? HUH?

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:51.093
TRISTAN, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.728
Téa: YELL IF YOU
CAN HEAR US!

00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:55.231
SOMEHOW I JUST
PASSED THROUGH IT!

00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:56.498
UHH!

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:57.499
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:16:57.499 --> 00:16:58.767
NO GOOD,
HUH?

00:16:58.767 --> 00:17:01.237
WHATEVER THIS DOME
BUBBLE THINGY IS,

00:17:01.237 --> 00:17:03.505
IT'S CLEAR
PEGASUS DESIGNED IT

00:17:03.505 --> 00:17:05.941
TO KEEP YUGI IN
AND US OUTSIDE.

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:09.011
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
OUR BEST FRIEND'S
IN THE WORST JAM EVER

00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:11.914
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO TO HELP HIM.

00:17:11.914 --> 00:17:12.915
UNH!

00:17:12.915 --> 00:17:15.150
[THINKING]
OH, JOEY'S RIGHT.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.353
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN GET THROUGH
TO HELP YUGI,

00:17:17.353 --> 00:17:20.789
AND NOW IT FEELS
LIKE IT'S TOO LATE.

00:17:27.997 --> 00:17:30.466
YOU USED YOUR
UNDERHANDED TACTICS

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:31.734
TO OVERWHELM
YUGI'S MIND!

00:17:31.734 --> 00:17:33.802
YOU WILL PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:35.170
HEH HEH HEH.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.506
SO, I TAKE IT,
FROM THIS EMOTIONAL OUTBURST,

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:38.774
THAT YOU'RE HAVING
A DIFFICULT TIME

00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:40.809
ACKNOWLEDGING THE FACT
THAT YOU FAILED

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.578
IN YOUR
SELF-APPOINTED DUTY

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:45.347
TO PROTECT YOUR LITTLE
DUELING PROTEGE.

00:17:45.347 --> 00:17:47.583
WHOEVER YOU ARE,
PERHAPS YUGI WOULD HAVE
BEEN BETTER OFF

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:50.619
WITHOUT
YOUR INTERFERENCE, HMM?

00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:52.054
BE SILENT!

00:17:52.054 --> 00:17:54.523
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE,

00:17:54.523 --> 00:17:56.725
I WILL
SHOW YOU NO MERCY.

00:17:56.725 --> 00:17:59.395
THEN LET THE GAME
CONTINUE.

00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:00.763
IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:18:00.763 --> 00:18:02.931
YOU NO LONGER
HAVE YUGI TO HELP YOU.

00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:05.901
ONCE MORE, YOUR MIND
IS AN OPEN BOOK TO ME.

00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:08.437
THE CARD YOU DREW
IS WINGED DRAGON

00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:11.440
AND GUARDIAN OF THE FORTRESS,
A WEAK MONSTER.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.642
[THINKING]
WITHOUT YUGI,
HE CAN'T STOP ME

00:18:13.642 --> 00:18:15.644
FROM READING HIS MIND
ANY LONGER.

00:18:15.644 --> 00:18:18.614
[THINKING]
PEGASUS READ MY MIND,
SO NOW HE KNOWS

00:18:18.614 --> 00:18:20.849
ALL THE CARDS
IN MY HAND.

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:21.884
THE ONLY CARD
HE DOESN'T KNOW

00:18:21.884 --> 00:18:23.986
IS THE ONE YUGI
LEFT ON THE FIELD.

00:18:23.986 --> 00:18:25.921
I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING
IF THAT'S A CARD

00:18:25.921 --> 00:18:28.791
THAT COULD TIP
THE DUEL IN MY FAVOR.

00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:32.461
I PLAY WINGED DRAGON
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:34.096
[ROARS]

00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:38.934
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:18:38.934 --> 00:18:40.703
DESTROYING
YOUR DEFENSE MONSTER

00:18:40.703 --> 00:18:42.438
WON'T AFFECT
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:18:42.438 --> 00:18:44.540
BUT I'LL DO IT
JUST FOR FUN.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.176
RELINQUISHED, DESTROY
THE WINGED DRAGON.

00:18:47.176 --> 00:18:48.477
[ROARS]

00:18:48.477 --> 00:18:51.680
AH, THAT WAS FUN.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.483
NOW THE CARD
OF YOUR FINAL DEFEAT.

00:18:54.483 --> 00:18:56.418
YOUR TIME'S RUN OUT.

00:19:03.192 --> 00:19:04.593
JIGEN BAKUDAN!

00:19:04.593 --> 00:19:06.662
THE INFAMOUS
TIME BOMB!

00:19:06.662 --> 00:19:11.200
YES. JIGEN BAKUDAN IS
A SELF-DESTRUCTING MONSTER

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.701
THAT'S IMMUNE TO ATTACKS.

00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:14.737
IN JUST 2 TURNS,
IT WILL EXPLODE

00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:17.439
AND DESTROY
MY BELOVED RELINQUISHED.

00:19:17.439 --> 00:19:20.409
YOU'RE USING BAKUDAN
TO DESTROY YOUR OWN MONSTER?

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.778
YES.
BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:25.614
IT'LL ALSO DESTROY
THE ONES RELINQUISHED
HAS ABSORBED.

00:19:25.614 --> 00:19:27.082
NAMELY, YOURS.

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:31.019
AND RELINQUISHED?
HIS ATTACK POWER IS ZERO.

00:19:31.019 --> 00:19:34.723
MEANING YOUR
LIFE POINTS WON'T BE
AFFECTED AT ALL. RIGHT?

00:19:34.723 --> 00:19:36.258
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:36.258 --> 00:19:38.093
WHILE MY SCORE
IS UNAFFECTED,

00:19:38.093 --> 00:19:41.697
THE EXPLOSION WILL WIPE OUT
THE DARK MAGICIAN,

00:19:41.697 --> 00:19:43.031
AND HIS ATTACK POINTS
WILL BE DEDUCTED

00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:45.401
DIRECTLY FROM
YOUR LIFE POINTS,

00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:46.802
ENDING THE GAME.

00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:48.771
[THINKING]
AND THAT'LL DESTROY
ANY HOPE I HAVE

00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:52.341
OF RESCUING
YUGI'S GRANDFATHER,
KAIBA, AND MOKUBA!

00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:55.377
FACE IT, THE CLOCK
IS TICKING DOWN
ON YOUR DEMISE,

00:19:55.377 --> 00:19:57.813
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT.

00:19:57.813 --> 00:20:01.517
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST OCCASION
I HAD SO MUCH FUN.

00:20:01.517 --> 00:20:05.220
REMEMBER,
ONLY 2 TURNS LEFT
TILL KABOOM!

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.189
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
A SINGLE CARD
IN YOUR HAND

00:20:07.189 --> 00:20:08.490
THAT CAN HELP YOU.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.658
TRUST ME, I KNOW.

00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:11.894
[GIGGLES]

00:20:11.894 --> 00:20:14.863
[THINKING]
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

00:20:14.863 --> 00:20:16.732
EVEN IF I DRAW
A NEW CARD,

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:20.335
PEGASUS' MILLENNIUM EYE
WILL LET HIM READ MY MIND

00:20:20.335 --> 00:20:22.805
AND SEE EXACTLY
WHAT CARD I'VE DRAWN!

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:26.208
THAT'S RIGHT.
AS LONG AS I CAN
READ YOUR MIND,

00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:28.777
YOU CAN DO NOTHING
AGAINST ME.

00:20:28.777 --> 00:20:32.714
YOU'VE LOST.
THE GAME IS OVER.

00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:34.016
[THINKING] HE'S RIGHT.

00:20:34.016 --> 00:20:36.318
AS MUCH AS I HATE
TO ADMIT IT,
I'VE FAILED.

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:39.421
I'VE FAILED YUGI,
AND I'VE FAILED
ALL OF HIS FRIENDS.

00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:41.723
NOTHING I DRAW
CAN HELP ME NOW.

00:20:41.723 --> 00:20:43.659
YUGI'S SACRIFICE
WAS IN VAIN.

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.795
HIS GRANDPA
AND THE KAIBA BROTHERS
ARE DOOMED!
