00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.735
ANYONE CAN SCORE
AN EARLY LEAD IN A DUEL,

00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:51.371
BUT ONLY A FEW CAN PLAY WELL
FOR THE ENTIRE MATCH.

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:53.006
ONLY THE BEST.

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:55.141
EXACTLY RIGHT, TéA.

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.509
YOU SEE, TRISTAN,

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:58.812
EVEN THOUGH
YUGI'S BEHIND
IN LIFE POINTS NOW,

00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:01.014
HE'S PROVEN HIMSELF
ABLE TO STAY FOCUSED

00:08:01.014 --> 00:08:03.083
AND MAKE
THE BIG PLAYS
WHEN THEY COUNT.

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:05.318
NOT THAT JOEY
HASN'T SHOWN
THE SAME PROMISE,

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.387
IT'S JUST THAT
YUGI'S HAD
MORE EXPERIENCE.

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:09.789
AND THAT MAY BE
WHAT GIVES HIM
THE EDGE HERE.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.325
[THINKING]
JOEY LEFT HIS KNIGHT
ON THE FIELD

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.960
COMPLETELY UNPROTECTED.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.096
JUST ONE OF THOSE
AMATEUR MISTAKES

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:17.097
COULD COST HIM
THE MATCH

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.565
IF HE WERE
DUELING PEGASUS.

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.400
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.035
[SPEAKING]
TIME OUT, JOEY!

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:23.403
TIME OUT?

00:08:23.403 --> 00:08:25.171
EVER SINCE WE ARRIVED
ON THIS ISLAND,

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.073
I'VE DONE MY VERY BEST
TO TEACH YOU

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:28.608
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:32.579
NOW YOU MUST PUT EVERYTHING
YOU'VE LEARNED INTO PLAY.

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:33.947
THINK STRATEGICALLY,

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:36.316
YOU CANNOT AFFORD
ANY MISTAKES.

00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.318
MISTAKES?
I DON'T GET IT.

00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:39.386
WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN',
YUGE,

00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:40.887
THAT I DID SOMETHING
WRONG ALREADY?

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.456
IT'S ONLY BEEN
ONE TURN SO FAR.

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.591
WHAT I'M SAYING, JOEY,

00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.559
IS THAT IN A DUEL
OF THIS MAGNITUDE,

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:49.062
EVERY SINGLE MOVE
YOU MAKE IS CRUCIAL.

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:50.730
ONE FALSE CARD,
AND IT CAN COST YOU

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.366
EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED
SO HARD FOR.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:55.168
I GOT IT.
EVERY MOVE I MAKE HERE

00:08:55.168 --> 00:08:57.037
HAS GOTTA BE
RIGHT ON THE DOT.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:58.705
THAT'S RIGHT,
BECAUSE HERE NO ONE

00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.440
LETS A MISTAKE
GO UNPUNISHED.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.142
NOT PEGASUS,
AND NOT ME.

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:03.977
OK! TIME IN!

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:06.046
NOW GIMME
YOUR BEST SHOT, PAL!

00:09:06.046 --> 00:09:07.614
I INTEND TO.

00:09:07.614 --> 00:09:10.150
GO, GAIA,
THE FIERCE KNIGHT!

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.420
[WHINNIES]

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.454
ATTACK!

00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:17.624
[HORSE WHINNIES]

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.162
[HOWLING]

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:25.732
GILTIA THE KNIGHT
IS NO MORE!

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.668
YOU SURE TOOK IT
TO ME THERE, YUGE.
GOOD MOVE.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.671
NOW LET'S SEE
WHAT OL' JOEY
CAN COME UP WITH!

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:34.541
THERE.
ARMORED LIZARD.

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:36.443
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:38.044
[GROWLS]

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.581
[THINKING] I KNOW JOEY HAS
A BETTER MONSTER THAN THAT.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:44.884
HMM, I WONDER WHAT
HE'S PLANNING HERE?

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:48.388
Tristan: WHAT'S HE PLAYING
THAT THROWAWAY MONSTER FOR?

00:09:48.388 --> 00:09:50.490
WHO KNOWS?
PERHAPS JOEY HASN'T LEARNED

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:51.491
AS MUCH AS WE THOUGHT.

00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:52.492
OH!

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:54.694
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:57.697
[THINKING]
I SEE, JOEY.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:00.700
COME ON, YUGE.
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.168
AND I'LL PLAY THIS:

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.571
THE SUMMONED SKULL
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:05.839
THAT'S IT.

00:10:05.839 --> 00:10:09.242
[ROARS]

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:11.945
LIGHTNING STRIKE!

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.079
ATTACK!

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:20.286
ARMORED LIZARD
IS VANQUISHED.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.654
HMM.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:22.889
LOOK AT JOEY.

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:25.892
HE ALMOST LOOKS GLAD
HIS CREATURE WAS STRUCK.

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:28.895
MAN, THAT'S SAD.
HE'S IN DENIAL ALREADY.

00:10:28.895 --> 00:10:30.864
NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:33.967
I THINK THAT JOEY PLAYED
THAT MEDIOCRE MONSTER OF HIS

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.070
SO YUGI WOULD BE LULLED
INTO A FALSE SENSE OF
SECURITY AND ATTACK IT.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.272
AFTER ALL,
JOEY KNOWS FULL WELL

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:41.574
THAT YUGI HAS MONSTERS
IN HIS DECK THAT COULD

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.276
EASILY BEAT
HIS ARMORED LIZARD.

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:46.546
NO. I THINK THAT JOEY
WAS JUST TRYING TO DRAW
YUGI'S MONSTER OUT.

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:49.349
SORRY, BUD,

00:10:49.349 --> 00:10:52.385
BUT I WAS HOPIN' YOU WERE
GONNA THROW DOWN THAT
SUMMONED SKULL CARD.

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:55.054
I NEEDED HIM OUT
FOR MY STRATEGY TO WORK--

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:58.791
A STRATEGY THAT HAS ZERO
MISTAKES, I MIGHT ADD.

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:01.928
BUT HERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

00:11:01.928 --> 00:11:03.530
YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF!

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.766
GET READY, BUD,
'CAUSE NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON!

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:07.734
GRR...

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.615
Téa: JOEY SURE
SEEMS CONFIDENT

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.852
THAT WHATEVER HE HAS
PLANNED WILL TAKE DOWN
YUGI'S SUMMONED SKULL.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:27.220
OK, YUGE.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:32.392
I'LL PLAY THIS FIRST
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:36.129
THE FLAME SWORDSMAN?
WHY PLAY HIM?
HEH HEH!

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:38.131
THE SWORDSMAN
WON'T STAND A CHANCE.

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.833
THE SUMMONED SKULL'S
ATTACK POWER IS
TOO HIGH.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.102
NOT ONCE JOEY PLAYS THAT.
HUH?

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:45.405
I HATE DOIN' THIS
TO YOU,

00:11:45.405 --> 00:11:49.042
BUT I'M PLAYING
THE MAGICAL SHIELD
AND SWORD CARD.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:50.109
OH, NO!

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:53.313
NOW YOU'RE IN FOR IT, YUGI BOY.

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:56.216
THE MAGIC OF THE SHIELD
AND SWORD CARD

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.219
FLIPS EACH MONSTER'S
ATTACK POINTS WITH
THEIR DEFENSE POINTS.

00:11:59.219 --> 00:12:00.787
I GET IT NOW.

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:03.256
JOEY'S SWORDSMAN'LL
HAVE MORE ATTACK POINTS

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:04.257
THAN YUGI'S
SUMMONED SKULL.

00:12:04.257 --> 00:12:06.226
CLEVER MOVE.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.996
SO, HOW'S THAT FOR
PUTTIN' EVERY SLICK MOVE

00:12:09.996 --> 00:12:11.731
THAT I'VE LEARNED
HERE INTO PLAY, YUGE?

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.868
BET YOU WISH YOU DIDN'T
SHOW ME THE ROPES QUITE
SO WELL NOW, HUH, BUD?

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:17.003
ATTACK!

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:19.405
FLAMING SWORD OF BATTLE!

00:12:26.546 --> 00:12:29.315
SUMMONED SKULL'S BEEN
REDUCED TO ASH.

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:30.550
WELL PLAYED, JOEY.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.051
YOU NOT ONLY REDUCED
MY LIFE POINTS,

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.621
BUT YOU TOOK OUT ONE
OF MY BEST MONSTERS,
TOO.

00:12:34.621 --> 00:12:36.723
THANKS, PAL,
BUT THAT'S NOTHING

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:38.157
COMPARED TO SOME OF
THE OTHER MOVES

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:40.393
I GOT READY TO BUST OUT
IN THIS DUEL.

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:41.427
HEH HEH HEH!

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.396
AND I LOOK FORWARD
TO THEM, JOEY,

00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:44.931
BUT REMEMBER...

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:48.501
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH POWERFUL MOVES
READY TO PLAY.

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:50.603
WELL, THEN,
BRING 'EM ON, PAL.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.705
THIS DUEL IS REALLY
HEATING UP.

00:12:52.705 --> 00:12:55.708
YES. AND WITH
THE LEVEL OF SKILL
THAT THOSE TWO POSSESS,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.176
I HAVE A STRONG FEELING

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.046
THAT THINGS ARE ONLY GOING
TO GET HOTTER DOWN THERE.

00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:02.415
UHH! OH, GREAT.

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:05.585
[CHUCKLES, THINKING]
HOW SPLENDID!

00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:09.656
THE PASSION, THE DRAMA,
THE FEROCITY!

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:12.392
FRIENDS MAKE SUCH
WONDERFUL ADVERSARIES.

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:15.128
SO, LET'S SEE
ONE OF THEM MOVES, YUGE.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:18.865
VERY WELL, JOEY.
SUMMONED SKULL WILL
NOW BE AVENGED.

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:21.701
OH, YEAH? WELL, YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO GET THROUGH

00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.836
MY FLAME SWORDSMAN FIRST.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.838
PRECISELY.

00:13:25.838 --> 00:13:28.508
CURSE OF DRAGON.
ATTACK MODE!

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.578
[ROARING]

00:13:35.448 --> 00:13:36.816
[GROANS]

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:39.652
AND NEXT I'LL USE THIS
POLYMERIZATION CARD

00:13:39.652 --> 00:13:42.789
TO FUSE MY DRAGON WITH
GAIA THE FIERCE KNIGHT!

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:44.590
WHAT?!
BEHOLD...

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.326
GAIA THE DRAGON
CHAMPION!

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.127
[CRIES]
[ROARS]

00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:56.469

00:13:56.469 --> 00:13:59.706
NOW, MY DRAGON
CHAMPION, ATTACK!

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:02.642
[CRIES]

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:05.511
[GROWLS]

00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:08.648
YOUR SWORDSMAN'S
BEEN TROUNCED.

00:14:08.648 --> 00:14:10.149
[GROANS]

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.484
OH, MY.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:13.019
SEE? THIS IS
WHAT I MEANT.

00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:14.921
HUH?
NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS,

00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:16.723
YUGI KEEPS
A LASER-LIKE FOCUS

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:18.691
AND MAKES THE
BIG PLAYS WHEN
THEY REALLY COUNT.

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.095
AND NOW I GUESS
WE'LL SEE IF JOEY
CAN DO THE SAME.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.930
HOW CAN JOEY MAKE A BIG PLAY

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.199
WITH THAT
DRAGON CHAMPION OUT THERE?

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:27.867
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT'S OUT.

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:31.137
YOU SEE, JUST AS
YUGI WAS ABLE TO
KEEP HIS COOL

00:14:31.137 --> 00:14:33.272
WHILE FACING
THAT FLAME SWORDSMAN,

00:14:33.272 --> 00:14:35.641
NOW JOEY NEEDS TO
MAINTAIN HIS FOCUS

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:38.144
EVEN WHILE
HE'S BEING ATTACKED
BY HIS BEST FRIEND.

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:40.313
HE'S BEING FORCED
TO THINK ON HIS FEET.

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:43.316
YOU KNOW, IT'S AS IF
YUGI AND JOEY

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:46.152
ARE PUSHING EACH OTHER
TO DUEL THEIR VERY BEST.

00:14:46.152 --> 00:14:47.787
Bakura:
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:14:47.787 --> 00:14:50.256
THEY'RE PUSHING
EACH OTHER AS HARD
AS THEY CAN NOW

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:53.226
SO NO MATTER WHICH ONE
OF THEM WINS THIS DUEL,

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.628
HE'LL BE AT HIS BEST
WHEN HE FACES PEGASUS.

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:56.896
OH.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.500
[THINKING, CHUCKLES]
IT SEEMS I'M THE ONLY ONE

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.902
WHO APPRECIATES WATCHING
2 FRIENDS PUSH EACH OTHER

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.704
TO THE BRINK
OF THEIR ABILITIES.

00:15:04.704 --> 00:15:08.274
I GUESS IT'S SOMETHING
OF AN ACQUIRED TASTE.

00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:11.844
SO EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
BEING FORCED TO FIGHT
AGAINST EACH OTHER,

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.881
THEY'VE ACTUALLY
FOUND A WAY TO HELP
EACH OTHER.

00:15:14.881 --> 00:15:16.249
IT'S AMAZING.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.451
WHOA.

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:22.054
[THINKING] OK.

[THINKING]
ALL RIGHT. I GOT
THE GRAVEROBBER, TOO!

00:15:33.232 --> 00:15:34.801
I THINK
I COULD USE THESE TWO

00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:37.870
IN A WAY THAT'D BE
ABLE TO TAKE OUT
YUGI'S DRAGON CHAMPION,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.139
MAYBE EVEN CLINCH
THE MATCH! HA HA!

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:43.576
ALL RIGHT, YUGI.
READY OR NOT, HERE I COME.

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:50.283
[THINKING] I THINK
THIS COMBO OF MINE
MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.651
HEH.

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:52.718
[THINKING] HMM?

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:54.887
WHAT COULD JOEY
BE SMILING ABOUT?

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:58.825
GAIA THE DRAGON
CHAMPION IS ONE OF
MY TOUGHEST MONSTERS.

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:02.595
YUGI, YOUR DRAGON
CHAMP'S DONE FOR.

WATCH THIS!

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:05.665
HE'S DONE FOR?

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:06.966
JOEY MUST HAVE
SOMETHING BIG PLANNED.

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.501
HUH?
HUH?

00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:11.771

TO STEAL A MONSTER
FROM YOUR GRAVEYARD.

00:16:25.685 --> 00:16:27.920

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.522
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT, YUGI.

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:32.358
NOW HE'S MINE.

00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:34.093

BINGO! I MAY HAVE NEVER
PLAYED IT BEFORE,

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.453
BUT I'VE SEEN YOU USE IT
PLENTY OF TIMES.

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:01.454
