WELL, YUGI,

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.013
BETWEEN YOUR GRANDPA
AND MY SISTER,

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:02.581
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
ROOM FOR MISTAKES.

00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:03.649
RIGHT!

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.552
Téa: THE FIREWORKS!
IT'S STARTING!

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:10.856
LET'S DO IT!

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.795
Joey: SO WHAT'S
YOUR PLAN, YUGI?

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:19.098
WELL, I MIGHT AS WELL
STICK WITH WEEVIL.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.467
AFTER ALL, WE DO HAVE
A SCORE TO SETTLE.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.935
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SAY THAT.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:23.936
ISN'T THAT HIM?

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:24.970
[GASPS]

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.038
Yugi: WEEVIL.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.241
WEEVIL, I CHALLENGE
YOU TO A DUEL!

00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:30.910
Weevil: HA HA HA!
Tristan:
HEY, WAIT--

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.011
I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT!

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.612
WEEVIL'S
RUNNING AWAY!

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:34.914
HEY, WAIT UP!

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:38.284
Weevil: HA HA HA!

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:43.022
Tristan: UGH! WHERE
ARE ALL THESE MOTHS
COMING FROM?

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.657
Téa: ECCH!
THEY'RE DISGUSTING!

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.959
HE'S FAST
FOR A SMALL GUY.

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.862
MAYBE YOU'RE JUST
SLOW FOR A BIG GUY.

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.063
WE'RE NEVER
GONNA CATCH HIM.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.598
AS LONG AS THE
WHOLE ISLAND'S INBOUNDS,

00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.699
HE'LL KEEP
RUNNING ALL DAY!

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.601
Yugi, thinking:
WHAT'S WEEVIL UP TO?

00:08:55.601 --> 00:08:56.936
HE'S WANTED
TO DUEL WITH ME

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.537
EVER SINCE WE MET
ON THE BOAT.

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:01.307
SO WHAT'S HE
RUNNING FOR?

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.042
WAIT A MINUTE!

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.643
WHAT DID HE SAY
ON THE BOAT?

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:06.378
EVERYONE
WILL SOON LEARN

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:07.813
THAT THERE ARE NEW
RULES ON THE ISLAND

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:10.015
THAT REQUIRE
MORE STRATEGY.

00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:11.750
Yugi, thinking: IT MUST
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.952
WITH THE NEW RULES,

00:09:12.952 --> 00:09:16.488
SO I BETTER FIGURE
OUT WHAT...AND FAST!

00:09:18.757 --> 00:09:19.725
Joey: THERE HE IS!

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:20.726
"WELCOME,"

00:09:20.726 --> 00:09:22.795
SAID THE SPIDER
TO THE FLY.

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.763
YOU FLEW RIGHT
INTO MY TRAP...

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:26.665
Weevil: AGAIN!

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:27.766
IT'S TIME YOU ANSWER

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:29.134
FOR WHAT YOU DID
ON THE BOAT, WEEVIL.

00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:34.206
Yugi: YU-GI-OH!

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:48.387
HEH. ALL RIGHT,
WEEVIL.

00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:49.388
TIME TO FIND OUT

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:50.389
IF YOU'RE
AS GOOD AT DUELING

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:51.490
AS YOU ARE
AT RUNNING AWAY.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.225
WAS I SIMPLY RUNNING AWAY

00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:55.461
OR CLEVERLY WEAVING YOU
INTO MY WEB?

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.129
IT'S TIME TO DUEL!

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.630
HEH HEH HEH.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.133
AS YOU WISH!

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.134
[GROUND RUMBLING]

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:03.302
IT'S AN
EARTHQUAKE!

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:05.304
HEH HEH HEH.

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:07.239
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

00:10:10.082 --> 00:10:11.083
[GROUND RUMBLING]

00:10:13.085 --> 00:10:15.053
HEH HEH HEH.

00:10:16.588 --> 00:10:19.558
Tristan: WHOA! THE ENTIRE
GROUND IS TRANSFORMING!

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:29.268
Téa: IT'S GIGANTIC!

00:10:32.771 --> 00:10:35.808
Joey: MAN, THESE AREN'T
GOING TO BE LIKE
THE DUELS BACK HOME.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.813
YOU'VE JUST STEPPED
INTO A HORNET'S NEST,

00:10:40.813 --> 00:10:42.581
AND THERE'S NO WAY OUT!

00:10:42.581 --> 00:10:44.082
WHAT IS THAT?

00:10:44.082 --> 00:10:47.085
THESE GIANT ARENAS
MUST BE SET UP ALL
OVER THE ISLAND.

00:10:47.085 --> 00:10:49.655
I'LL JUST MEET YOU
ON THE FIELD.

00:10:50.756 --> 00:10:51.890
Joey:
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.259
WEEVIL'S
A LITTLE TOO COCKY.

00:10:55.761 --> 00:10:58.964
Weevil: I NOTICED
THAT YOU HAVE JUST
ONE STAR CHIP, YUGI.

00:10:58.964 --> 00:11:00.866
I GUESS THAT MEANS
I'LL HAVE THE PLEASURE

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:02.768
OF ELIMINATING YOU
FROM THE TOURNAMENT!

00:11:02.768 --> 00:11:04.002
ONCE YOU'RE GONE,

00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:06.004
EVERYONE ELSE'S CHIPS
WILL BE EASY PICKINGS.

00:11:06.004 --> 00:11:08.507
NOT IF I TAKE
YOUR 2 FIRST.

00:11:08.507 --> 00:11:09.608
WHAT?

00:11:09.608 --> 00:11:11.210
THIS WILL BE AN ALL
OR NOTHING MATCH

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.511
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:15.681
HA! WHY SHOULD I RISK
BOTH MY STAR CHIPS

00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:17.449
WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE?

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:19.918
BECAUSE I HAVE SOMETHING
ELSE I THINK YOU WANT--

00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:22.120
MY WHOLE
DUEL MONSTER'S DECK!

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.656
SO, YOU'D RISK
YOUR GRANDPA'S DECK?

00:11:24.656 --> 00:11:25.724
FINE WITH ME.

00:11:25.724 --> 00:11:27.159
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:29.194
WINNING ALL YOUR CARDS
WILL BE AN EASY WAY

00:11:29.194 --> 00:11:31.096
TO EXTERMINATE YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:32.331
EXTERMINATE?

00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:34.333
SWAT THAT
LITTLE TWERP
LIKE A MOSQUITO!

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:37.569
WHOA, SOUNDS LIKE
A DUEL IS ABOUT
TO START OVER THERE.

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:39.504
Duelist:
THAT'S WEEVIL UNDERWOOD,

00:11:39.504 --> 00:11:41.740
BUT WHO'S THE OTHER GUY?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.408
THAT GUY IS YUGI MUTO.

00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:45.143
HE BEAT KAIBA,

00:11:45.143 --> 00:11:48.313
AND I HAPPEN TO BE
HIS BEST FRIEND,
JOEY WHEELER.

00:11:48.313 --> 00:11:49.314
AND THESE TWO?

00:11:49.314 --> 00:11:50.315
THESE TWO ARE TRESPASSERS.

00:11:50.315 --> 00:11:51.316
AAH!
AAH!

00:11:51.316 --> 00:11:52.618
I THOUGHT
I WOULDN'T BE SEEING

00:11:52.618 --> 00:11:54.653
A WEEVIL/YUGI MATCH-UP
TILL THE FINALS.

00:11:54.653 --> 00:11:56.388
WEEVIL'S
THE REGIONAL CHAMP.

00:11:56.388 --> 00:11:58.357
NO NEW KID'S GOT
A CHANCE AGAINST HIM.

00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:00.859
Weevil: WELL, YUGI,
MY ADORING PUBLIC
IS WAITING,

00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.361
SO WE SHOULD BEGIN.

00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:03.896
Weevil and Yugi: DUEL!

00:12:06.932 --> 00:12:09.434
LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE
MY KILLER NEEDLE.

00:12:17.242 --> 00:12:19.811
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET
THROUGH MY MAMMOTH
GRAVEYARD FIRST.

00:12:22.681 --> 00:12:25.851
THIS MASSIVE
MONSTER WILL MATCH
YOUR ANNOYING INSECT

00:12:25.851 --> 00:12:27.586
POINT FOR POINT.

00:12:27.586 --> 00:12:28.587
ATTACK!

00:12:29.922 --> 00:12:33.158
KILLER NEEDLE, LET'S SHOW
THE MAMMOTH YOUR STINGER.

00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:34.159
ATTACK!

00:12:37.729 --> 00:12:38.830
Yugi: NO!

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.799
Weevil: HA!
GONE AFTER ONE STING?

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:42.334
HE MUST BE ALLERGIC.

00:12:42.334 --> 00:12:43.435
Yugi, thinking:
I DON'T GET IT.

00:12:43.435 --> 00:12:45.671
BOTH CREATURES WERE
EVENLY MATCHED.

00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:46.972
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A STALEMATE.

00:12:46.972 --> 00:12:49.007
HAVE YOU BEGUN
TO FIGURE OUT YET

00:12:49.007 --> 00:12:52.010
WHY I LED YOU ALL THE WAY
TO THIS FOREST AREA?

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.179
IF YOU JUST LOOK AROUND,

00:12:54.179 --> 00:12:55.981
THEN YOU WILL SEE
THAT THIS AREA

00:12:55.981 --> 00:12:59.551
IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF OUR
SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT--

00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:02.154
ONE PART WASTELAND
AND ONE PART FOREST--

00:13:02.154 --> 00:13:04.756
AND WHO THRIVES
IN THE FOREST?

00:13:04.756 --> 00:13:08.994
BUGS. THE STRONGEST,
MOST POWERFUL INSECTS
RULE THE FOREST!

00:13:08.994 --> 00:13:11.630
SO AS LONG AS I PLAY MY
BUGS IN THE FOREST AREA,

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.132
I GET
A FIELD POWER BONUS.

00:13:14.132 --> 00:13:16.134
I GUESS YOU JUST
WEREN'T LISTENING

00:13:16.134 --> 00:13:18.003
WHEN PEGASUS SAID
THAT THIS TOURNAMENT

00:13:18.003 --> 00:13:20.706
WOULD HAVE EXCITING
NEW SURPRISES
IN STORE FOR US.

00:13:20.706 --> 00:13:22.708
MAYBE IF YOU WERE
SMART ENOUGH

00:13:22.708 --> 00:13:24.443
TO STEAL
THE TOURNAMENT'S
SECRET NEW RULES

00:13:24.443 --> 00:13:25.544
LIKE I DID,

00:13:25.544 --> 00:13:27.045
YOU'D BE GETTING
A FIELD POWER BONUS

00:13:27.045 --> 00:13:29.381
INSTEAD OF ME!
HA HA HA HA!

00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:30.482
HE CHEATED!

00:13:30.482 --> 00:13:31.750
HE LED US HERE
'CAUSE HE KNEW

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.318
HE'D HAVE
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

00:13:33.318 --> 00:13:35.487
GO AHEAD!
CALL ME A CHEATER!

00:13:35.487 --> 00:13:38.557
YOU'RE ALL JUST ANGRY
THAT YOU DIDN'T SWIPE
THE RULES YOURSELVES.

00:13:38.557 --> 00:13:39.992
AND BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T,

00:13:39.992 --> 00:13:42.194
LITTLE YUGI IS
ABOUT TO GET STUNG.

00:13:42.194 --> 00:13:43.228
Yugi: HA HA HA!

00:13:43.228 --> 00:13:45.030
WHAT? HOW CAN
YOU BE LAUGHING?

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.533
BECAUSE. TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR FEROCIOUS
KILLER NEEDLE NOW.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:50.168
W-W-WHAT?

00:13:51.536 --> 00:13:53.572
OH, NO! MY MONSTER!

00:13:53.572 --> 00:13:56.008
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY MONSTER?!

00:13:57.142 --> 00:13:58.710
Weevil, thinking:
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.178
MY CREATURE WAS
SUPERCHARGED

00:14:00.178 --> 00:14:02.581
WITH THE
FIELD POWER BONUS,

00:14:02.581 --> 00:14:06.618
BUT ACCORDING TO THIS,
YUGI'S CREATURE SOMEHOW
BECAME JUST AS POWERFUL.

00:14:06.618 --> 00:14:09.221
LOOKS LIKE MY MAMMOTH
GOT A FIELD POWER BONUS

00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:10.422
FROM THE WASTELAND AREA

00:14:10.422 --> 00:14:12.591
JUST LIKE YOUR BUGS
DO FROM THE FOREST!

00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:16.595
GRR! THE FIELD-POINT
ADVANTAGE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MINE ALONE!

00:14:16.595 --> 00:14:19.264
I KEPT WONDERING ABOUT
SOMETHING ON THE BOAT
RIDE HERE, WEEVIL.

00:14:19.264 --> 00:14:22.601
WHY WERE WE TRAVELING
TO SOME REMOTE ISLAND
JUST TO DUEL?

00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:25.137
BUT AS SOON AS I SAW
THIS HOLOGRAPHIC
DISPLAY GRID,

00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:26.438
IT ALL CAME TOGETHER.

00:14:26.438 --> 00:14:28.640
EVERY MONSTER HAS
A TYPE OF FIELD

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.808
THAT IT DOES BEST ON,

00:14:29.808 --> 00:14:31.810
KIND OF LIKE
A HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE,

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.012
AND WHAT MAKES
THIS ISLAND SO SPECIAL

00:14:34.012 --> 00:14:35.113
IS THAT IT CONTAINS

00:14:35.113 --> 00:14:38.383
EVERY TYPE
OF FIELD IMAGINABLE!

00:14:38.383 --> 00:14:41.620
SO WHEN YOU DELIBERATELY
LED US TO THIS SPOT,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.821
YOU WERE CLEARLY HOPING

00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:44.923
TO GET SOME KIND
OF FIELD ADVANTAGE.

00:14:44.923 --> 00:14:48.160
GRR! HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.430
YOU'RE AWFULLY CLEVER
TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER
LIKE THAT, YUGI,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.032
BUT FIGURING OUT ONE RULE
WON'T BE ENOUGH.

00:14:54.032 --> 00:14:56.401
THERE ARE SURPRISES
HIDDEN UNDER EVERY ROCK,

00:14:56.401 --> 00:14:58.670
AND I KNOW THEM ALL.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.272
YOU CAN BEAT HIM, YUGI!

00:15:00.272 --> 00:15:02.407
DON'T LET THAT
FLEA SCARE YA!
HE'S BLUFFIN'.

00:15:02.407 --> 00:15:05.911
REALLY? THEN LET'S
JUST SEE HOW YOU
HANDLE THIS BLUFF.

00:15:09.748 --> 00:15:11.650
MY HERCULES BEETLE
WILL FIND A WAY

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.685
TO CRAWL UNDER YOUR SKIN!

00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:17.155
Yugi, thinking: AHH,
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW ABOUT
THE FIELD POWER BONUS,

00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:20.158
IT'S TOO LATE
TO REBUILD MY DECK NOW.

00:15:20.158 --> 00:15:23.161
I GUESS A COMBO ATTACK
WOULD BE MY BEST BET.

00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:26.098
Yugi: I PLAY FERAL IMP!

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:31.636
AND NOW I'LL ADD
THIS HORN OF THE UNICORN

00:15:31.636 --> 00:15:34.206
SO ITS MAGIC WILL RAISE
MY ATTACK POINTS!

00:15:37.642 --> 00:15:38.844
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:15:38.844 --> 00:15:41.179
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
A LOT BETTER THAN THAT!

00:15:41.179 --> 00:15:44.416
HERCULES BEETLE, ATTACK!

00:15:46.651 --> 00:15:48.854
Yugi: FERAL IMP,
MAGIC LIGHTNING, ATTACK!

00:15:53.492 --> 00:15:55.827
YUGI'S ATTACK DIDN'T
EVEN FAZE THAT THING.

00:15:55.827 --> 00:15:56.995
SOMETHING'S SCREWY!

00:15:56.995 --> 00:15:58.730
MY IMP'S MAGIC
LIGHTNING ATTACK

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.332
SHOULD HAVE DESTROYED
YOUR BEETLE.

00:16:00.332 --> 00:16:02.033
IS THIS ANOTHER
TRICK, WEEVIL?

00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:05.103
NO, YUGI.
I JUST THOUGHT YOU KNEW

00:16:05.103 --> 00:16:07.606
THAT ALL MONSTERS
WITH A FIELD POWER BONUS

00:16:07.606 --> 00:16:11.042
WERE ALSO RESISTANT
TO ANY TYPE OF MAGIC ATTACK,

00:16:11.042 --> 00:16:14.813
AND SINCE MY HERCULES
BEETLE EASILY DEFLECTED
YOUR LIGHTNING BOLTS,

00:16:14.813 --> 00:16:16.548
HE HAS MORE THAN
ENOUGH POWER LEFT

00:16:16.548 --> 00:16:18.416
TO DESTROY
YOUR PUNY FERAL IMP

00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:20.852
AND CONTINUE TO EAT AWAY
AT YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:16:23.188 --> 00:16:26.458
EVEN THAT 4-EYED TICK'S
WEAKEST BUGS ARE GONNA
BE TOUGH TO BEAT

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:28.660
SO LONG AS HE'S GOT
THAT FIELD POWER BONUS.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.563
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
EXACTLY LIKE IT CAN
JUST BE TURNED OFF.

00:16:31.563 --> 00:16:33.565
THAT WEEVIL'S
A NO GOOD CHEAT!

00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:36.568
Weevil: IT'S YOUR TURN.
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

00:16:36.568 --> 00:16:39.004
Yugi, thinking:
MAYBE I SHOULD USE MY
NEXT MONSTER TO DEFEND.

00:16:39.004 --> 00:16:40.572
BY PUTTING MY CARD
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:16:40.572 --> 00:16:42.174
MY MONSTER
WILL TAKE A HIT,

00:16:42.174 --> 00:16:44.142
BUT MY LIFE POINTS
WILL BE SPARED.

00:16:44.142 --> 00:16:46.311
SO, WE'RE
DEFENDING NOW, ARE WE?

00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:47.979
VERY CLEVER!

00:16:47.979 --> 00:16:50.549
SINCE I CAN'T SEE
YOUR MONSTER'S
DEFENSE POINTS,

00:16:50.549 --> 00:16:52.350
I CAN'T BE SURE
I CAN BEAT IT.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.219
BUT EVEN YOUR
STRONGEST MONSTER

00:16:54.219 --> 00:16:56.321
CAN'T STAND AGAINST
MY BASIC INSECT.

00:16:59.324 --> 00:17:01.826
NOT ONLY DOES HE GET
A FIELD POWER BONUS,

00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:02.827
BUT I'M
UPGRADING HIM

00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:05.830
WITH A LEVEL 3
LASER CANNON

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.099
AND A LEVEL 2
POWER BOOST!

00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:12.370
Yugi, thinking: NO! HIS
INSECT'S SO POWERFUL NOW,

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.072
MY DEFENSE WON'T
STAND A CHANCE,

00:17:14.072 --> 00:17:16.841
AND AFTER IT FALLS,
MY LIFE POINTS ARE NEXT!

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:23.659
Weevil: NOW, YUGI, FOR ALL
THE INNOCENT LITTLE BUGS

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:26.662
YOU'VE SQUASHED, STOMPED,
CRUSHED, OR FUMIGATED,

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:27.663
IT'S...

00:17:27.663 --> 00:17:29.065
PAYBACK TIME!

00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:32.168
UNGH!

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:38.040
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.508
YOU'LL HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT

00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:43.179
IF YOU HOPE
TO SURVIVE MY BUG'S
LASER-POWERED ARSENAL.

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:44.547
THEN I'LL PLAY
THIS CARD.

00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:51.187
Weevil, thinking:
HMM, ANOTHER DEFENSE
CARD, NO DOUBT,

00:17:51.187 --> 00:17:53.823
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT DEFENDING IS
ALL HE CAN DO!

00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:55.057
HEH HEH HEH.

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:57.326
I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU
ON THE DEFENSIVE.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.695
ATTACK NOW
WITH ANY MONSTER,

00:17:59.695 --> 00:18:02.498
AND YOU WILL INSTANTLY
ACTIVATE THIS TRAP CARD.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.200
THAT WEEVIL'S
GOT YUGI CORNERED!

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.102
YEAH, HE CAN'T EVEN
COUNTERATTACK!

00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:08.804
Weevil: AS LONG AS MY
TRAP CARD REMAINS IN PLAY,

00:18:08.804 --> 00:18:11.107
YOU'RE POWERLESS TO MAKE
A MOVE AGAINST ME!

00:18:11.107 --> 00:18:13.075
SO, DOES MY TIGHTENING WEB

00:18:13.075 --> 00:18:15.111
MAKE YOU SQUIRM?

00:18:15.111 --> 00:18:16.779
Yugi, thinking:
HE'S SO BUSY BRAGGING,

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:18.848
HE'S NOT PAYING ANY
ATTENTION TO MY MOVES.

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.350
MAYBE I CAN SET
A LITTLE TRAP OF MY OWN.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.886
FACE IT, YUGI!
I'VE GOT YOU PINNED DOWN,

00:18:23.886 --> 00:18:26.122
AND WHILE YOU'RE TOTALLY
UNABLE TO ATTACK ME,

00:18:26.122 --> 00:18:28.290
I CAN ATTACK YOU
ANYTIME I WANT!

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.425
EACH TURN YOU COWER,

00:18:29.425 --> 00:18:31.494
I CREATE A NEW MONSTER.

00:18:35.464 --> 00:18:36.832
Weevil:
KEEP DRAWING, YUGI.

00:18:36.832 --> 00:18:39.168
MY ARMY OF INSECTS JUST
KEEPS GETTING BIGGER!

00:18:39.168 --> 00:18:40.970
I'M GOING TO WIPE OUT
ALL YOUR MONSTERS

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.571
IN ONE BUG BLITZKRIEG!

00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:44.140
Yugi, thinking:
THAT'S RIGHT, WEEVIL.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.908
PUT ALL YOUR MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD.

00:18:45.908 --> 00:18:49.411
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M COUNTING ON.

00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:50.713
JUST LOOK
AT OUR YUGI.

00:18:50.713 --> 00:18:52.214
HE'S SO CONFIDENT
UP THERE.

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:53.349
I KNOW!

00:18:53.349 --> 00:18:54.383
WHEN HE'S DUELIN',
IT'S LIKE HE BECOMES

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:55.584
A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT GUY.

00:18:55.584 --> 00:18:56.819
HEE HEE HEE!

00:18:56.819 --> 00:18:58.154
WELL, WHAT DO YA KNOW?

00:18:58.154 --> 00:19:00.456
I'M DOWN TO MY
LAST MONSTROUS INSECT,

00:19:00.456 --> 00:19:02.057
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS, YUGI?

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:03.759
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE EXTERMINATED!

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:05.995
WE'LL SEE WHAT MY CARDS
HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT!

00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:08.731
Yugi, thinking:
YES, THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.099
THIS IS PERFECT!

00:19:10.099 --> 00:19:13.169
THERE'S NO WAY WEEVIL
CAN RESIST HIM
AS A TARGET.

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:14.236
ALL RIGHT, WEEVIL!

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:16.238
I DEFEND WITH
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:19:16.238 --> 00:19:19.241
EXCELLENT!
I'LL DESTROY YOUR VERY
FAVORITE CARD FIRST!

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:22.244
NOW, MY PET, POWER UP
YOUR LASER CANNON!

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:23.445
HEE HEE HEE!

00:19:25.948 --> 00:19:27.650
ATTACK!

00:19:28.651 --> 00:19:29.952
[LAUGHING]

00:19:29.952 --> 00:19:31.687
WH-WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:34.857
WEEVIL, YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN
SET A TRAP CARD.

00:19:34.857 --> 00:19:35.858
WHAT?!

00:19:35.858 --> 00:19:37.760
YOU WERE SO BUSY
GRANDSTANDING,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.563
YOU PAID NO ATTENTION
TO THE CARDS I PUT
INTO PLAY.

00:19:40.563 --> 00:19:42.631
BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE
ALL MONSTER C-C-CARDS?

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:45.968
NOT ALL. WHILE YOU
LOADED THE FIELD WITH
YOUR BUG MONSTERS,

00:19:45.968 --> 00:19:48.304
I PREPARED
A SPECIAL SURPRISE,

00:19:48.304 --> 00:19:50.472
THE POWER OF MY MIRROR
FORCE TRAP CARD!

00:19:50.472 --> 00:19:52.041
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:53.709
TOO LATE, WEEVIL.

00:19:53.709 --> 00:19:56.445
YOU ALREADY ORDERED
YOUR ATTACK ON
MY DARK MAGICIAN,

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:59.515
AND MIRROR FORCE
WILL DEFLECT IT
RIGHT BACK AT YOU!

00:20:01.684 --> 00:20:04.486
MY LIFE POINTS
ARE DEVASTATED!

00:20:04.486 --> 00:20:05.955
YES!

00:20:05.955 --> 00:20:07.990
YEAH, YUGI!
HEY!
WAY TO GO!

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.327
Weevil, thinking:
HE OBLITERATED MY ARMY
OF BEAUTIFUL BUGS.

00:20:11.327 --> 00:20:12.995
HOW DARE HE!

00:20:12.995 --> 00:20:15.064
YOU'RE A LIAR
AND A CHEAT, WEEVIL,

00:20:15.064 --> 00:20:16.732
BUT IT WAS
YOUR OVERCONFIDENCE

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.634
THAT ALLOWED ME TO GET
THE BEST OF YOU.

00:20:18.634 --> 00:20:20.102
YOUR INSECTS
ARE DECIMATED.

00:20:20.102 --> 00:20:21.837
YOUR LIFE POINTS
ARE LOW,

00:20:21.837 --> 00:20:23.973
AND AS YOU YOURSELF
SAID BEFORE,

00:20:23.973 --> 00:20:27.209
YOU HAVE USED UP
ALL YOUR MONSTERS.

00:20:27.209 --> 00:20:28.344
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:30.946
ACTUALLY, I LIED
ABOUT THAT, TOO!

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:32.147
HUH?!

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:34.416
I STILL HAVE MY MOST
FORMIDABLE CREATURE

00:20:34.416 --> 00:20:35.784
WAITING IN THE WINGS,

00:20:35.784 --> 00:20:38.887
AND THIS
UNCONQUERABLE INSECT
WILL SWAT YOU DOWN

00:20:38.887 --> 00:20:40.055
ONCE AND FOR ALL!

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.125
GRR!
