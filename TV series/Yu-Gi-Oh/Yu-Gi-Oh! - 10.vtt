Yami Yugi: PREVIOUSLY
ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.910
Pegasus: KAIBA HAS ABANDONED
HIS CORPORATE STATION,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.015
AND NOW YOU FIVE
WISH TO SEIZE CONTROL
OF KAIBACORP.

00:00:09.015 --> 00:00:10.518
FOR OUR PLAN
TO SUCCEED,

00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:12.721
KAIBA MUST BE TAKEN
OUT OF THE PICTURE...

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.956
PERMANENTLY.

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:15.859
AGREED. THE ELDER KAIBA
SHALL MEET

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.295
WITH "AN ACCIDENT."

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:19.299
MR. PEGASUS
WOULD LIKE

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:21.702
TO HAVE A FEW WORDS
WITH YOU.

00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:23.740
YOU'LL NEVER
TAKE ME ALIVE!

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:27.312
GET HIM!

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:30.684
NOBODY COULD SURVIVE
A FALL LIKE THAT.

00:00:30.684 --> 00:00:32.153
IT'S TIME
TO DUEL!

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:34.424
THERE IS YOUR OPPONENT.
OHH!

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:38.063
HEH HEH!
YUGI, YOU DON'T HAVE
A GHOST OF A CHANCE

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:41.302
BEATING KAIBA,
BECAUSE THIS TIME
HE IS A GHOST.

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:44.340
IT CAN'T BE!
THAT GUY'S
NOTHING BUT A FAKE,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.109
A TRICK BY PEGASUS.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.881
UNH. UHH.

00:01:01.134 --> 00:01:02.303
WE'RE GOING TO HACK

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:05.642
RIGHT INTO PEGASUS'
COMPUTER MAINFRAME.

00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:07.345
Computer: WE'VE
EASILY BROKEN THROUGH

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:10.083
THE DUELIST KINGDOM
COMPUTER SYSTEM.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.754
YUGI'S INSIDE.
GET READY TO GO IN.

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:17.495
[THINKING]
THIS NEXT CARD'S A BLAST
FROM THE PAST, YUGI.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.000
ONLY ONE DECK
HAS GOT THAT CARD.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.570
LOOKS LIKE
THE ADVANTAGE IS MINE.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.907
Yugi: DARK MAGICIAN,
GO TO DEFENSIVE MODE.

00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:28.179
SMART PLAYING, YUGI.

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.817
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WASN'T SMART ENOUGH.

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:32.453
YOU PLAYED
RIGHT INTO MY HAND.

00:01:32.453 --> 00:01:35.392
DEFENSE PARALYSIS!
A TRAP!

00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:37.996
[THINKING] WHILE THAT
DEFENSE PARALYSIS CARD'S
ON THE FIELD,

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:40.233
MY MONSTERS
CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES.

MAGICAL HATS,
CONCEAL
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.046
YOUR MOVE, BUT YOU
BETTER THINK TWICE
BEFORE YOU CHOOSE.

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:51.451
IT'S A SHAME THIS DUEL'S
GOING TO END SO SOON.

NO! THAT HAT WAS EMPTY!

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.281
ALL RIGHT!
THIS COULD WORK.

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.850
IT'S GOTTA WORK.

YUGI'LL BEAT

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.855
YOUR GUESS
WAS WRONG.

00:03:13.855 --> 00:03:15.991
GUESS WRONG AGAIN,
AND IT WILL COST YOU.

00:03:17.727 --> 00:03:19.230
HUH?

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.202
THERE ARE STILL
3 MAGICAL HATS
LEFT ON THE FIELD,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.305
AND ONE OF THEM
HOLDS
A SPECIAL SURPRISE

JUST FOR YOU.

00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.445
IF YOU DESTROY
THE HAT THAT HIDES
MY DARK MAGICIAN,

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:30.048
YOU'LL WIN
THIS DUEL.

00:03:30.048 --> 00:03:31.217

BUT I'M BETTING
YOU'LL PICK THE HAT

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:35.991
THAT CONCEALS
THE TRAP CARD

00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:37.460
I JUST PUT
INTO PLAY.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.796
A TRAP CARD?

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:41.300
NOW WHICH HAT
WILL IT BE?

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.537
YOU'RE TAKING
A BIG GAMBLE,
YUGI.

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:45.506
IF HE GUESSES RIGHT,
IT'S OVER.

00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:57.895
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON,
ATTACK THE MIDDLE HAT!

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:03.803
HEH! WELL,
NOW YOU'VE DONE IT,

00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:06.675
ACTIVATED MY TRAP

GRR!

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.725
A BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON
IS NORMALLY UNSTOPPABLE,

00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:18.695
BUT ONCE DRAINED
OF ITS ENERGY

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:20.732
BY THE SPELLBINDING
CIRCLE,

00:04:20.732 --> 00:04:23.704
IT'S NO MATCH
FOR THE FULL POWER
OF MY DARK MAGICIAN!

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:40.230
AND THAT PUTS AN END

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.001

WHITE DRAGON.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.004
GRR!

00:04:44.004 --> 00:04:45.907

WHOA! ANOTHER ONE?!

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.968
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:05.573
AND THAT PUTS AN END
TO YOUR DARK MAGICIAN.

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.378
THERE ARE ONLY 3 BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON CARDS

00:05:08.378 --> 00:05:10.849
IN THE WORLD, AND
THEY'RE ALL IN MY DECK.

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.686
YOUR GRANDPA HAD THE FOURTH,
BUT I RIPPED IT UP.

00:05:13.686 --> 00:05:15.890
BUT HOW COULD I
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.193
IF I'M NOT REALLY
SETO KAIBA?

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.398
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU BEAT

00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:23.736
ALL 3 OF MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGONS WITH EXODIA.

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:26.708
BUT NOW WITHOUT
THAT MONSTER IN YOUR DECK,

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:29.613
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY
YOU CAN WIN.

00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:31.716
YOUR MOVE.
OHH.

00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:34.020
EVERYONE HEARD
ABOUT YOUR DUEL
WITH SETO.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.190
THAT'S HOW THIS LOSER
KNOWS ABOUT IT.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.262
THAT'S NOT MY BROTHER,
YUGI. I'M SURE.

00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:47.075
Computer: I AM NOW
REROUTING THE DATA

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:50.614
FROM FIELD 146
AT THE DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:05:50.614 --> 00:05:52.484
AFTER THAT,
WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:54.554
IF YUGI MUTO
IS DUELING THERE.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.692
I'M SURE HE IS. NOW
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:00.030
HERE IT COMES.
WE'RE IN.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.634
NOW DOWNLOADING
DUEL DATA.

00:06:02.634 --> 00:06:05.305
YOU WERE RIGHT.
YUGI MUTO IS IN THIS DUEL.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.342
CAN YOU SHOW IT TO ME
ON SCREEN?

00:06:07.342 --> 00:06:10.647
MY PLEASURE. I THINK
THE PART YOU'LL FIND
MOST INTERESTING

00:06:10.647 --> 00:06:12.817
IS THE NAME
OF YUGI'S OPPONENT.

00:06:12.817 --> 00:06:15.555
WHAT?! IS THIS
YOUR IDEA OF A JOKE?

00:06:15.555 --> 00:06:17.325
I NEVER JOKE.

00:06:17.325 --> 00:06:20.163
SENSORS INDICATE THAT
THE OPPONENT OPPOSITE YUGI

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:22.501
IS REGISTERED
AS SETO KAIBA

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:24.837
AND HE'S
USING YOUR DECK.

00:06:24.837 --> 00:06:27.375
PEGASUS MUST'VE
TAKEN MY DECK.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:29.713
THE DUELISTS ARE TIED,
AND THE IMPOSTER

00:06:29.713 --> 00:06:32.650
HAS HIS SECOND BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON ON THE FIELD.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.521
YUGI DEFEATED
THE FIRST ONE

00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.590
USING A COMBINATION
OF THE DARK MAGICIAN

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.593
AND MAGICAL HATS.

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:40.864
HE CURRENTLY
HAS 500 POINTS LEFT

00:06:40.864 --> 00:06:42.567
AND NO CARDS IN PLAY.

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:44.303
IT'S HIS MOVE.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:47.308
BUT WITHOUT EXODIA,
YUGI CAN'T WIN.

00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:49.646
HE HAS
NO OTHER CARDS
LEFT IN HIS DECK

00:06:49.646 --> 00:06:52.049
THAT CAN BEAT
THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON,

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:54.320
LET ALONE 2 OF THEM.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.323
WELL, THEN
I HOPE YOU HAVE A PLAN.

00:06:56.323 --> 00:06:58.259
YES, BUT WE'VE
GOT TO WORK FAST.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:06:59.795
YUGI'LL LOSE
ON THE NEXT ATTACK

00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:01.398
FROM THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON

00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:03.669
UNLESS WE DECREASE
ITS POWER FROM HERE.

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:04.804
CAN WE DO THAT?

00:07:04.804 --> 00:07:06.674
OH, YEAH.
UPLOAD A VIRUS

00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:08.543
INTO THAT MONSTER'S
HOLO COMPUTER.

00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:11.648
THAT DRAGON IS
ABOUT TO GET SICK,
REAL SICK.

00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:14.019
STANDING BY, BUT
SHOULDN'T WE FIRST WAIT

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:16.122
TO SEE
YUGI'S NEXT MOVE?

00:07:16.122 --> 00:07:17.658
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO RISK YUGI

00:07:17.658 --> 00:07:19.929
LOSING THE DUEL.
UPLOAD!

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:22.800
VIRAL INJECTION
UNDERWAY.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.804
[ROARS]

00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:28.476
[THINKING] I DON'T
HAVE ANY MONSTERS
THAT CAN WITHSTAND

00:07:28.476 --> 00:07:30.212
HIS BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:07:30.212 --> 00:07:32.383
UGH.
THIS COULD BE IT.

00:07:32.383 --> 00:07:34.686
THIS DUEL IS OVER, YUGI.

00:07:34.686 --> 00:07:37.224
I'M SURE WE'LL BE
HEARING THE FAT LADY SING

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:38.793
RIGHT AFTER YOUR TURN.

00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:41.231
I STILL HAVE
DEFENSE PARALYSIS ACTIVE,

00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:42.700
SO WHATEVER
MONSTER YOU PICK

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.803
WON'T BE ABLE
TO DEFEND ITSELF.

00:07:44.803 --> 00:07:47.775
I CHOOSE THE FERAL IMP
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:56.456
Kaiba: I WISH YUGI
WAITED A FEW MORE SECONDS
BEFORE MOVING.

00:07:56.456 --> 00:07:58.626
ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:01.331
TO GET THAT COMPUTER VIRUS
UPLOADED FASTER?

00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:03.100
Computer: WE'RE
ALREADY HALFWAY THERE.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.836
THIS IS AS FAST
AS IT GOES.

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:07.241
VIRAL IMPLANT
NOW AT 60%,

00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:09.044
BUT IT DOESN'T
SEEM TO BE WORKING.

00:08:09.044 --> 00:08:11.314
THE BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON
IS STILL SHOWING

00:08:11.314 --> 00:08:12.849
NO SIGNS OF WEAKNESS.

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:14.185
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

00:08:14.185 --> 00:08:18.092
HEH HEH HEH!
THIS IS ALMOST TOO EASY.

00:08:18.092 --> 00:08:19.161
YUGI!

00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:22.466
HANG ON! YUGI
CAN STILL WIN THIS.

00:08:22.466 --> 00:08:24.736
GRR! DON'T FORGET--
HE BEAT KAIBA LAST TIME.

00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:25.938

WHITE DRAGON. ATTACK!

00:08:34.486 --> 00:08:37.491
Ghost Kaiba:
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:38.893
ATTACK!

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.564
Computer: THE VIRUS
IS TAKING EFFECT.

00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:43.333
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON'S
ATTACK POWER

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.571
IS BEGINNING TO DROP.

00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:48.609
BUT IT'S
STILL TOO STRONG.
IT HAS TO GET WEAKER

00:08:48.609 --> 00:08:50.879
OR IT'LL
STILL BEAT YUGI.

00:08:53.217 --> 00:08:54.786
WHY, I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:56.555
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:08:56.555 --> 00:08:59.060
MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.866
[DRAGON BELLOWING]

00:09:02.866 --> 00:09:05.370
All: OHH!

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.373
THIS IS KEMO
TO PEGASUS.

00:09:07.373 --> 00:09:08.742
I HOPE YOU'RE
WATCHING, SIR,

00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:10.880
BECAUSE WE GOT
A REAL PROBLEM
OUT HERE.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.749
HOW DID YUGI
DO THAT?

00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:15.219
IT WASN'T YUGI.
IT WAS SETO KAIBA.

00:09:15.219 --> 00:09:16.388
HOW?

00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:18.224
IT SEEMS
THAT THE REAL KAIBA

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.128
IS STILL
VERY MUCH ALIVE.

00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:22.832
Computer: THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON'S ATTACK POWER

00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:24.368
IS DROPPING RAPIDLY.

00:09:24.368 --> 00:09:25.703
THE VIRUS IMPLANT

00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:28.809
IS SUCCESSFULLY DISABLING
THE MONSTER COMPLETELY.

00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:30.746
ALL RIGHT.
NOW LET'S GET TO WORK

00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:32.348
ON DRAGON NUMBER 3.

00:09:32.348 --> 00:09:34.618
STANDING BY.

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:35.887
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:38.024
WE'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT
BY A REMOTE TERMINAL.

00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:39.928
LOOKS LIKE
<i>WE'VE</i> BEEN HACKED!

00:09:39.928 --> 00:09:41.130
ARGH!

00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:43.967
HEY, KAIBA!
HEY, KAIBA!

00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:46.104
HEY, KAIBA!
HEY, KAIBA!

00:09:46.104 --> 00:09:49.109
HEY, KAIBA!
HEY, KAIBA! HEYYYY...

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:52.381
UGH! IT'S PEGASUS!

00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.853
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

00:09:57.924 --> 00:09:59.393
MMM.

00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:02.197
MOVE IN ON MY MARK.

00:10:02.197 --> 00:10:05.302
LET'S GO!
COVER ME!

00:10:05.302 --> 00:10:08.809
Computer: ATTACK POWER
IS HOLDING NOW AT 2000.

00:10:08.809 --> 00:10:10.445
BUT THIS
SHOULD'VE WORKED.

00:10:10.445 --> 00:10:14.184
THE BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON
IS LAUNCHING ITS ATTACK.

00:10:14.184 --> 00:10:15.920
NO!

00:10:17.523 --> 00:10:19.393
NOW, BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON,

00:10:19.393 --> 00:10:21.062
TIME TO OBLITERATE THEM!

00:10:21.062 --> 00:10:23.700
All: OHH!

00:10:25.837 --> 00:10:28.608
UNH! YUGI!

00:10:28.608 --> 00:10:30.278
KAIBA?

00:10:39.393 --> 00:10:42.197
[ROARS]

00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:43.967
UNH!

00:10:43.967 --> 00:10:45.703
YUGI!

00:10:45.703 --> 00:10:46.705
KAIBA!

00:10:50.144 --> 00:10:51.780
[ROARS]

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.616
IT STOPPED!

00:10:53.616 --> 00:10:55.687
AH! THE DRAGON!

00:10:55.687 --> 00:10:59.292
[ROARS]

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:05.402
THIS CAN'T BE!

00:11:05.402 --> 00:11:07.305
OHH.
IT'S GONE.

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:09.276
IT'S A TRICK.

00:11:09.276 --> 00:11:12.013
Computer: THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON IS DESTROYED,

00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:14.818
BUT THE VIRUS
WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE.

00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:18.558
THEN HOW? DID YUGI MUTO
SOMEHOW DO THIS?

00:11:18.558 --> 00:11:21.261
HOW COULD HE?
IT IS YOUR DECK.

00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:24.935
IT'S THE HEART OF THE CARDS.
YUGI WAS RIGHT.

00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:25.936
HUH?

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.415
WHY? WHY ME?!

00:11:33.415 --> 00:11:36.520
WHY? BECAUSE
KAIBA'S STILL ALIVE.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.589
HE STOPPED YOU!

00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:41.162
SILENCE! I AM KAIBA!

00:11:41.162 --> 00:11:43.966
ENOUGH!
YOUR CHARADE IS OVER!

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:46.037
MY BROTHER IS ALIVE!

00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:47.239
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:49.208
Mokuba:
IT'S LIKE YUGI SAID.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.211
LAST TIME YUGI
DUELED MY BROTHER,

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.382
HE SHOWED SETO
THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:11:53.382 --> 00:11:55.552
THIS FAKER
MAY HAVE TAKEN HIS DECK,

00:11:55.552 --> 00:11:58.157
BUT THE REAL SETO KAIBA
IS ALIVE AND WELL.

00:11:58.157 --> 00:12:00.727
AHH.
OHH.

00:12:00.727 --> 00:12:02.229
Yami Yugi: IMPOSTER!

00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:05.134
THE REAL SETO KAIBA
DESTROYED THAT MONSTER!

00:12:05.134 --> 00:12:08.674
I KNOW, BECAUSE I SENSED
HIM CALLING OUT TO ME
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

00:12:08.674 --> 00:12:10.911
NOW, ENOUGH OF YOUR LIES!

00:12:10.911 --> 00:12:12.613
WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT KAIBA.

00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:15.185
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SHOW US
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:19.525
I TOLD YOU, I AM KAIBA.
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:12:19.525 --> 00:12:23.531
OR AT LEAST I'M PART OF HIM--
THE DARKEST PART.

00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:27.271
AH HA HA HA HA HA! AHH.

00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:28.607
HUH!

00:12:28.607 --> 00:12:31.846
AH HEE HEE HA HA HA HA!

00:12:31.846 --> 00:12:34.383
I CAN SEE YOU DON'T
RECOGNIZE ME, YUGI.

00:12:34.383 --> 00:12:37.956
I WASN'T LYING WHEN I
TOLD YOU I WAS SETO KAIBA--

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:41.194
THE EVIL PART OF HIM THAT
YOU SENT TO THE SHADOW REALM

00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:42.497
AFTER OUR LAST DUEL!

00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:45.468
NOW I'M BACK, THANKS
TO PEGASUS! HA HA HA HA HA!

00:12:45.468 --> 00:12:48.306
YOU'RE NOT A PART
OF MY BROTHER ANYMORE!

00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:50.510
OOH, IT'S HIDEOUS.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.146
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT THIS DUEL

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.615
JUST MIGHT
TURN UGLY,

00:12:53.615 --> 00:12:55.518
BUT I
NEVER THOUGHT
<i>THAT</i> UGLY.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.022
HYAH!

00:13:02.396 --> 00:13:03.732
SIR, HE GOT AWAY.

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:06.737
SEARCH THE GROUNDS.
EVERYWHERE.

00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:10.543
HMM. IT APPEARS
THAT YOUNG YUGI'S NEMESIS,

00:13:10.543 --> 00:13:13.581
THE REAL SETO KAIBA,
HAS COME TO HIS RESCUE.

00:13:13.581 --> 00:13:15.785
I MUST ADMIT
THAT THIS LITTLE DEVELOPMENT

00:13:15.785 --> 00:13:19.057
IS ONE TWIST THAT
EVEN I DID NOT FORESEE.

00:13:19.057 --> 00:13:20.560
I HAVE
SOME BAD NEWS, SIR.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.997
THE REAL KAIBA HAS
ELUDED US ONCE AGAIN.

00:13:22.997 --> 00:13:26.203
YOU WERE RIGHT.
HE WAS USING A TERMINAL
IN THE KAIBA MANSION

00:13:26.203 --> 00:13:28.973
TO ACCESS THE INDUSTRIAL
ILLUSIONS MAINFRAME.

00:13:28.973 --> 00:13:32.246
IF I THOUGHT
HE WAS ALIVE, I WOULD
HAVE BEEFED UP SECURITY.

00:13:32.246 --> 00:13:36.620
THAT'S 2 ESCAPES, CROQUET.
MUST I LOCK YOU AWAY AGAIN?

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.624
GET ME KEMO ON THE RADIO.

00:13:39.624 --> 00:13:42.362
HEY, UGLY,
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D START WORRYING

00:13:42.362 --> 00:13:44.466
ABOUT WHAT
MY BIG BROTHER'S
GONNA DO TO YOU

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:46.202
WHEN HE FINALLY
CATCHES UP TO YOU.

00:13:46.202 --> 00:13:49.641
PEGASUS TO KEMO.
SETO KAIBA HAS GOTTEN AWAY.

00:13:49.641 --> 00:13:52.079
DON'T LOSE THE LITTLE ONE,
NO MATTER WHAT!

00:13:52.079 --> 00:13:53.280
UNDERSTOOD.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.651
I GUESS I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO CALL YOU.

00:13:55.651 --> 00:13:57.287
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MONSTER,

00:13:57.287 --> 00:14:00.459
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO INSULT THE CARDS.

00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:02.295
HMM.
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:14:02.295 --> 00:14:03.864
YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE
DECK TO GO THROUGH

00:14:03.864 --> 00:14:06.602
AND ONLY ONE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON LEFT.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.078
GRAPPLER, IN DEFENSE MODE!
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:14:14.215 --> 00:14:18.188
[ROARS]

00:14:18.188 --> 00:14:20.325
[THINKING] HE'S
JUST BIDING HIS TIME

00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:22.796
UNTIL HE DRAWS
HIS LAST BLUE EYES.

00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:24.465
IT'S MY TURN.

00:14:24.465 --> 00:14:26.001
[THINKING] I'D PLAY
THIS CARD IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:14:26.001 --> 00:14:28.739
BUT HE'S STILL GOT
HIS DEFENSE PARALYSIS
CARD IN PLAY,

00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:31.611
SO I CAN ONLY ATTACK,
AND WITH NO DEFENSE,

00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:34.683
IF HE DRAWS THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON, I'M FINISHED.

00:14:34.683 --> 00:14:37.053
I'LL SET ONE CARD
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD

00:14:37.053 --> 00:14:39.557
AND DRAW THE CELTIC
GUARDIAN AS WELL,

00:14:39.557 --> 00:14:40.993
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:48.706 --> 00:14:50.842
[ROARS]

00:14:50.842 --> 00:14:52.913
YOUR GRAPPLER SPLIT!

00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:56.752
AH, PARTING
IS SUCH SWEET SORROW.

00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:59.623
NEXT STOP IS MYSTIC HORSEMAN
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:14:59.623 --> 00:15:03.464
AND I'LL LAY ONE OF MY CARDS
FACE DOWN, JUST LIKE YOU.

00:15:04.698 --> 00:15:07.470
[THINKING] FACE DOWN?
IS IT A MAGIC CARD,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.172
OR IS HE
SETTING A TRAP?

00:15:10.708 --> 00:15:12.679
AGAIN, I'LL LAY
A CARD FACE DOWN,

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:15.751
AND I'LL USE
THE MYSTICAL ELF
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:17.653
PLUS, THIS BOOK
OF SECRET ARTS

00:15:17.653 --> 00:15:22.495
WILL RAISE ITS ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POWER
BY 300 POINTS!

00:15:25.266 --> 00:15:27.771
[CHANTING]

00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:29.340
MY TURN IS OVER.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.048
PATIENCE, YUGI, FOR
IT WILL SOON BE <i>ALL</i> OVER.

00:15:34.048 --> 00:15:38.522
[THINKING]
YUGI HAS 2 CARDS FACE DOWN
AND 3 MONSTERS.

00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:41.927
HE MUST BE
TRYING TO STRENGTHEN
THE MYSTICAL ELF SOMEHOW

00:15:41.927 --> 00:15:44.532
TO WITHSTAND
MY MYSTIC HORSEMAN'S ATTACK.

00:15:44.532 --> 00:15:46.868
BUT IF I DRAW
THE FINAL BLUE EYES

00:15:46.868 --> 00:15:49.640
AND DESTROY
ANY ONE OF HIS MONSTERS,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.545
THAT WILL TAKE HIS LIFE POINTS
DOWN TO ZERO, ANYWAY.

00:15:52.545 --> 00:15:54.381
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:56.985
I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE,
BUT I'M LIKIN' THE LOOK

00:15:56.985 --> 00:15:59.924
ON THAT GUY'S FACE
EVEN LESS THAN I DID BEFORE.

00:15:59.924 --> 00:16:02.327
WIPE THAT SMILE
OFF HIS FACE, YUGI!

00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:04.565
LOSER! MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:16:04.565 --> 00:16:08.304
HA HA HA HA HA HA!
AS YOU WISH.

00:16:08.304 --> 00:16:10.775
NOW, PREPARE...

00:16:10.775 --> 00:16:11.810
GRR!

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.447
FOR THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:16:19.256 --> 00:16:20.792
[ROARS]

00:16:20.792 --> 00:16:22.060
YUGI!

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.562
DON'T WORRY, YUGI.

00:16:23.562 --> 00:16:26.234
MY BROTHER WILL HELP OUT,
JUST LIKE LAST TIME.

00:16:26.234 --> 00:16:29.472
DREAM ON. YOUR LUCK'S
ABOUT TO RUN OUT.

00:16:29.472 --> 00:16:31.977
JUST SEE FOR YOURSELF.

00:16:31.977 --> 00:16:35.382
UNLIKE THE LAST
BLUE EYES, THIS ONE'S
AT FULL POWER,

00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:37.085
AND YOUR BROTHER'S
IN NO POSITION

00:16:37.085 --> 00:16:38.989
TO DO A THING ABOUT IT.

00:16:38.989 --> 00:16:41.125
'CAUSE WE FOUND WHERE
HIS HIDING PLACE IS,

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:42.561
AND NOW HE'S ON THE RUN.

00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:44.697
SO THAT MEANS
KAIBA IS ALIVE?

00:16:44.697 --> 00:16:47.769
Kemo: DIMWIT.
IT MEANS DON'T EXPECT
ANOTHER MIRACLE,

00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:49.706
CAUSE THIS DUEL'S
ABOUT TO END.

00:16:49.706 --> 00:16:51.609
HA HA HA HA HA!

00:16:51.609 --> 00:16:52.945
OH, NO!

00:16:56.551 --> 00:16:58.020
[ROARS]

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.292
HA HA HA HA!
SUCH A GOOD DRAGON!

00:17:01.292 --> 00:17:03.296
WOULDN'T YOU SAY, YUGI?

00:17:03.296 --> 00:17:08.837
THIS DUEL'S
ABOUT TO END NOW! GO!
WHITE LIGHTNING ATTACK!

00:17:10.607 --> 00:17:12.811
THIS DUEL'S NOT OVER YET.

00:17:12.811 --> 00:17:15.014
ACTIVATE MIRROR FORCE NOW!

00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:21.058
WAH! HE'S TURNED OVER
A TRAP CARD!

00:17:21.058 --> 00:17:24.698
THE MIRROR FORCE
REFLECTS YOUR ATTACK
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:29.205
PRETTY GOOD TRICK,

00:17:29.205 --> 00:17:30.975
BUT I'M READY
WITH ONE OF MY OWN.

00:17:30.975 --> 00:17:32.711
I'LL USE NEGATE ATTACK.

00:17:35.249 --> 00:17:37.585
[THINKING] OH! HE HAD
A MAGIC CARD WAITING,

00:17:37.585 --> 00:17:38.921
JUST IN CASE.

00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:42.326
NEGATE ATTACK NEUTRALIZES
ANY ATTACK THROWN AT ME,

00:17:42.326 --> 00:17:44.497
EVEN IF
IT'S ONE OF MY OWN.

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:45.933
YUGI!

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:47.669
[THINKING]
IT'S ALL OVER.

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:51.208
HA HA HA HA!
IT'S TIME
TO FINISH THIS DUEL

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.512
WITH REBORN,
THE MONSTER!

00:17:53.512 --> 00:17:56.751
OH, NO! THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO REVIVE ANY MONSTER

00:17:56.751 --> 00:17:59.321
LOST IN THIS DUEL
FROM EITHER DECK!

00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:01.125
I'M GLAD
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:03.128
NOW GUESS
WHICH CARD I WANT?

00:18:03.128 --> 00:18:07.902
BE REBORN,
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:14.379
[ROARS]

00:18:14.379 --> 00:18:15.748
AHH HA!

00:18:15.748 --> 00:18:19.789
OHH, FAT LOT OF GOOD
THAT MOVE'S GONNA DO YOU, YUGI!

00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:22.760
BOTH OF THESE MONSTERS
ARE EVENLY MATCHED.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.630
THEIR POWERS
ARE NOT THE SAME.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.865
UHH!

00:18:25.865 --> 00:18:28.370
YOU FORGOT
ABOUT MY MYSTICAL ELF.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.675
SHE'S BEEN CHANTING
A SPELL SINCE I PUT HER
ON THE FIELD.

00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:36.550
IT ALLOWS THE
MYSTICAL ELF TO TRANSFER
HER OWN ATTACK POWER

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.088
TO ANY OTHER MONSTER
I CHOOSE.

00:18:39.088 --> 00:18:40.523
WHAT? THIS CAN'T BE.

00:18:40.523 --> 00:18:43.762
THIS MOVE WAS INSPIRED
BY SETO KAIBA HIMSELF.

00:18:43.762 --> 00:18:46.366
HE SHOWED ME
THAT YOU CAN ALTER
THE ATTACK POWER

00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:48.035
OF A BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON,

00:18:48.035 --> 00:18:50.606
BUT I'M RAISING
THE POWER OF MINE

00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:54.078
INSTEAD OF LOWERING IT
LIKE KAIBA DID TO YOURS!

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:57.518
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!
OH, NO! NO!

00:18:57.518 --> 00:19:00.623
CONSIDER THIS A MESSAGE
FROM THE REAL SETO KAIBA:

00:19:00.623 --> 00:19:02.092
YOU LOSE!

00:19:02.092 --> 00:19:03.294
OHH!

00:19:03.294 --> 00:19:06.265
NOW, BLUE EYES,
OBLITERATE!

00:19:13.544 --> 00:19:15.147
[ROARS]

00:19:17.184 --> 00:19:19.187
[ALL SCREAM]

00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:21.223
AAH!

00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:25.364
PEGASUS MAY HAVE HELPED YOU
ESCAPE THE SHADOW REALM
ONCE BEFORE,

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:27.267
BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:28.736
NEVER AGAIN!

00:19:28.736 --> 00:19:31.808
AAH!

00:19:31.808 --> 00:19:35.848
PEGASUS, I SENSE
THAT YOU'RE WATCHING.

00:19:35.848 --> 00:19:37.517
CONSIDER THIS A WARNING.

00:19:37.517 --> 00:19:40.022
NOTHING YOU SEND
AGAINST ME WILL STOP ME.

00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:43.928
AND WHEN WE FINALLY DUEL,
BELIEVE ME,
VICTORY WILL BE MINE.

00:19:43.928 --> 00:19:46.165
I'LL WIN BACK
MY GRANDFATHER'S SOUL,

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:48.535
AND YOU WILL PAY FOR
ALL THE PEOPLE YOU'VE HURT

00:19:48.535 --> 00:19:51.173
IN THE NAME
OF YOUR SICK LITTLE GAME.

00:19:51.173 --> 00:19:53.544
I'M COMING
FOR YOU, PEGASUS!

00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:57.717
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:19:57.717 --> 00:20:00.155
YUGI, YOU DEVELOPED
YOUR SHADOW POWERS

00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:02.993
QUITE A BIT
IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.

00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:06.098
BUT WHEN WE FINALLY
DUEL, BELIEVE ME,

00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:08.870
YOUR MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
WILL BE MINE.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.439
HA HA HA HA!

00:20:20.956 --> 00:20:22.526
KAIBA.

00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:24.529
THAT GHOST IS TOAST,
HUH, YUGI?

00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:27.877
I KNEW THAT
THE REAL KAIBA WAS
ALIVE THE WHOLE TIME.

00:20:27.877 --> 00:20:28.878
HUH?

00:20:28.878 --> 00:20:29.912
MMM?
MMM?

00:20:29.912 --> 00:20:30.980
WHAT IS IT?

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.815
THAT CREEP TOOK MOKUBA!

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:34.049
WHA--
HUH?

00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:35.751
HUH? MOKUBA!

00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:36.952
Téa: I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

00:20:36.952 --> 00:20:40.122
Yami Yugi: MOKUBA!
HE'S GONE. TAKEN AGAIN.

00:20:40.122 --> 00:20:41.624
Joey: OH, NO!

00:20:41.624 --> 00:20:42.625
Tristan: HEY, MOKUBA!

00:20:42.625 --> 00:20:43.893
Tea: MOKUBA!
