00:07:52.962 --> 00:07:54.364
DO YOU THINK IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO

00:07:54.364 --> 00:07:56.132
WITH HIS
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE?

00:07:57.667 --> 00:08:03.540
YU-GI-OH!

00:08:13.817 --> 00:08:16.486
NOW, HOW MANY STAR CHIPS
WILL YOU WAGER?

00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:18.188
TO WIPE YOU OUT? 5!

00:08:18.188 --> 00:08:19.322
THEN 5 IT IS,

00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:20.990
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I THINK I KNOW WHY

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.325
YOU ARE DOING THIS.

00:08:22.325 --> 00:08:24.260
I DON'T CARE
WHAT <i>YOU</i> THINK, YUGI,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.162
'CAUSE <i>I</i> THINK
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.865
Tea: WHAT DOES YUGI SEE
THAT WE DON'T?

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:31.434
IT'S LIKE HE'S LOOKING
INTO THE OTHER PLAYER'S SOUL.

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:33.303
HEY, SOUL, SCHMOUL.

00:08:33.303 --> 00:08:36.206
I CAN SEE FROM HERE THAT
THAT KID'S GONNA GET
HIS BUTT KICKED.

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:38.107
MAYBE...BUT YUGI
SHOULD HURRY

00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:39.709
IF HE PLANS
TO GET THOSE
STAR CHIPS

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:41.144
BACK TO THE BOAT
IN TIME.

00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:43.580
DON'T WORRY, TRISTAN.
HE'LL WIN THE CHIPS,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.082
AND WE'LL BE BACK AT THE DOCK
WITH TIME TO SPARE.

00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:47.550
Yugi and Mokuba: DUEL!

00:08:48.885 --> 00:08:50.019
THIS IS IT, YUGI.

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:51.387
NOW YOU'RE GONNA PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID

00:08:51.387 --> 00:08:52.755
TO MY BIG BROTHER.

00:08:54.157 --> 00:08:55.859
Mokuba: SETO,
YOU'VE GOTTA LEAVE NOW

00:08:55.859 --> 00:08:59.062
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THE BOAT
FOR THE BIG TOURNAMENT
AT DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:08:59.062 --> 00:09:00.930
SETO, OPEN THE DOOR!

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.398
HUH? SETO?

00:09:02.398 --> 00:09:04.300
I'M NOT GOING,
MOKUBA.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.269
NOT GOING? WHY NOT?

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:08.538
THERE'S NO POINT.

00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:11.040
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NO POINT"?

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.243
KID, I AM
IN NO CONDITION
TO DUEL ANYONE.

00:09:13.243 --> 00:09:14.677
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:16.746
YOU ALWAYS SAY,
"CARDS ARE POWER,"

00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:18.681
AND YOU'VE GOT
ALL THE STRONGEST CARDS.

00:09:18.681 --> 00:09:20.583
SINCE I LOST MY DUEL
WITH YUGI,

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:22.819
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT I THINK ANYMORE.

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:24.254
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.

00:09:24.254 --> 00:09:26.823
IT FEELS AS IF I LOST
A PIECE OF MYSELF
THAT DAY.

00:09:26.823 --> 00:09:28.258
BUT, SETO...

00:09:28.258 --> 00:09:30.159
YOU'RE THE BEST.
YOU'RE THE CHAMP.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:33.830
NOT SINCE THE DAY
I WAS DEFEATED
BY YUGI.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.864
HUH?

00:09:34.864 --> 00:09:35.899
HERE, MOKUBA.

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:37.200
I'M GOING AWAY
FOR A WHILE.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.068
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I'LL BE GONE.

00:09:39.068 --> 00:09:40.069
KEEP THIS...

00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:41.204
IT WAS ALWAYS
YOUR FAVORITE.

00:09:41.204 --> 00:09:42.772
WHY? WHY ARE YOU LEAVING?

00:09:42.772 --> 00:09:45.708
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM ANYMORE.

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:47.076
TAKE CARE, KID.

00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:48.578
SETO, DON'T GO!

00:09:48.578 --> 00:09:49.612
UHH.

00:09:49.612 --> 00:09:52.081
YOU BROKE UP
MY FAMILY, YUGI,

00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:54.784
AND NOW,
I'M GONNA BREAK <i>YOU</i> UP.

00:09:54.784 --> 00:09:57.654
MY FIRST CARD
IS THE MAN-EATING PLANT!

00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:00.957
[ROARS]

00:10:03.092 --> 00:10:04.260
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.062
I'LL COUNTER
YOUR ATTACK

00:10:06.062 --> 00:10:07.330
WITH THE WINGED
DRAGON,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.431
GUARDIAN
OF THE FORTRESS!

00:10:09.666 --> 00:10:11.134
[ROARS]

00:10:14.237 --> 00:10:16.706
Mokuba: HA!
BAD CHOICE, YUGI.

00:10:16.706 --> 00:10:21.244
MY MAN-EATING PLANT
WILL EAT YOUR DRAGON ALIVE.

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:29.745
Mokuba: SO NOW,
YOU'RE FINALLY GONNA PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID, YUGI,

00:10:29.745 --> 00:10:32.781
AND YOUR STUPID DRAGON'S
GONNA BE PLANT FOOD.

00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:35.017
MAN-EATING PLANT...
ATTACK!

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:36.619
FIREBALL ATTACK!

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.962
HUH? MY MONSTER LOST?

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:48.330
YOU CAN'T WIN A DUEL

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.100
WITH CARDS THAT DON'T
RIGHTFULLY BELONG
TO YOU.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.269
HOW COULD YOUR HEART
EVER LIVE IN CARDS

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:54.637
THAT BELONG
TO SOMEONE ELSE?

00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:56.171
BE QUIET.
I DON'T BELIEVE

00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:59.074
IN THAT "HEART OF THE CARDS"
STUFF YOU KEEP PREACHIN' ABOUT.

00:10:59.074 --> 00:11:01.176
CARDS HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH HEART.

00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:03.045
IT'S ALL ABOUT POWER.

00:11:03.045 --> 00:11:04.613
YES, I CAN SEE IT NOW.

00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:06.849
I SENSED A CONNECTION
TO KAIBA.

00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:07.950
YOU'RE HIS BROTHER!

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:08.951
YOU'RE MOKUBA!

00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:10.853
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:11.987
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:11:11.987 --> 00:11:13.088
LOOK!

00:11:13.088 --> 00:11:14.523
IT <i>IS</i> KAIBA'S
LITTLE BROTHER!

00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:16.725
THAT'S RIGHT.
SETO KAIBA IS MY BROTHER,

00:11:16.725 --> 00:11:19.428
AND HE'S THE BEST DUELIST
THAT THERE EVER WAS.

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.830
BUT NOW, THANKS TO YUGI,
HE'S GONE,

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.466
AND PEGASUS IS TRYING
TO TAKE OVER KAIBACORP.

00:11:24.466 --> 00:11:26.402
PEGASUS WANTS
KAIBACORP?

00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:27.603
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:29.938
TO MY BIG BROTHER
WHEN YOU DUELED, YUGI,

00:11:29.938 --> 00:11:31.607
BUT EVER SINCE THAT DEFEAT,

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:33.842
HE HASN'T BEEN THE SAME.

00:11:33.842 --> 00:11:35.778
HE RAN AWAY 'CAUSE OF YOU,

00:11:35.778 --> 00:11:38.280
AND WITH HIM GONE,
PEGASUS MOVED RIGHT IN.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.251
SOME KAIBACORP EXECUTIVES
INVITED HIM TO SOME KIND
OF SECRET BOARD MEETING.

00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:43.786
NOW, GENTLEMEN,

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.821
LET'S SEE IF I UNDERSTAND
YOUR PROPOSITION.

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:48.657
SETO KAIBA HAS ABANDONED
HIS CORPORATE STATION,

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:51.727
AND NOW YOU FIVE
WISH TO SEIZE CONTROL
OF KAIBACORP.

00:11:51.727 --> 00:11:53.696
YOU THEN WANT TO MERGE
WITH MY COMPANY,

00:11:53.696 --> 00:11:56.765
AND YOU'D LIKE ME TO HANDLE
ANY MESSY DETAILS, YES?

00:11:56.765 --> 00:11:58.567
PRECISELY, MR. PEGASUS.

00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:00.169
WITH OUR MONEY
AND YOUR LEADERSHIP,

00:12:00.169 --> 00:12:02.771
WE WILL EASILY TAKE CONTROL
OF KAIBACORP.

00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:04.206
DO TELL.

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:05.607
FOR OUR PLAN TO SUCCEED,

00:12:05.607 --> 00:12:07.910
KAIBA MUST BE TAKEN OUT
OF THE PICTURE...

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.144
PERMANENTLY.

00:12:09.144 --> 00:12:10.913
HOWEVER,
THERE IS ONE CATCH.

00:12:10.913 --> 00:12:12.548
AS PER THE CORPORATE BYLAWS,

00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:15.584
ONLY A KAIBA FAMILY MEMBER
CAN LEGALLY CONTROL KAIBACORP.

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:16.552
HMM.

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:17.986
TO THAT END, PEGASUS,

00:12:17.986 --> 00:12:20.723
WE RECOMMEND KIDNAPPING
KAIBA'S BROTHER MOKUBA.

00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:22.491
IN NAME, HE WILL
CONTROL KAIBACORP,

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:23.992
BUT WE WILL CONTROL HIM.

00:12:23.992 --> 00:12:25.561
DO THESE THINGS FOR US

00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:29.164
AND WE WILL LAY ALL
OF KAIBACORP'S TECHNOLOGY
AT YOUR FEET.

00:12:29.164 --> 00:12:32.434
AGREED. THE ELDER KAIBA
SHALL MEET WITH AN ACCIDENT,

00:12:32.434 --> 00:12:34.503
AND THE YOUNGER KAIBA
WILL BE CAPTURED.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.439
EXCELLENT. BUT WE HAVE
ONE FINAL CONDITION.

00:12:37.439 --> 00:12:38.741
THE BRAT
WHO BEAT KAIBA

00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:41.043
HAS TARNISHED
KAIBACORP'S
GOOD NAME,

00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:43.645
AND WE MUST INSIST
THAT YOU RESTORE IT.

00:12:43.645 --> 00:12:45.414
WELL, HOW FORTUITOUS.

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:48.317
PLANS FOR ME TO DUEL YUGI
ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY.

00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:51.887
NOW, TO SHOW
THAT I TRULY <i>AM</i>
THE MAN FOR THIS JOB--

00:12:51.887 --> 00:12:54.123
KEMO, BRING ME
YOUNG KAIBA, WOULD YOU?

00:12:54.123 --> 00:12:55.491
Mokuba: NOOOO!

00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:56.759
AAH! UNH!

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:58.394
LET ME GO, YOU CREEPS.

00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:00.896
I HEARD EVERYTHING, AND WHEN
I TELL MY BIG BROTHER,
YOU'RE GONNA--

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:02.164
YOU SEE, GENTLEMEN?

00:13:02.164 --> 00:13:03.599
THIS IS HOW EFFICIENTLY

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:06.135
YOU CAN EXPECT ME
TO HANDLE OUR BUSINESS.

00:13:06.135 --> 00:13:08.837
YOUNG KAIBA IS CAPTURED,
YUGI WILL BE DEFEATED,

00:13:08.837 --> 00:13:11.540
AND SETO KAIBA
WILL BOTHER US NO MORE.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.542
HA HA HA HA HA HA!

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:14.676
UHH!

00:13:14.676 --> 00:13:15.911
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!

00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:17.513
SETO DESERTED ME
'CAUSE OF YOU.

00:13:17.513 --> 00:13:19.214
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:21.583
MOKUBA, YOUR BROTHER,
HASN'T DESERTED YOU.

00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:23.419
HE'S SEARCHING
FOR HIMSELF.

00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:24.653
LIAR!

00:13:24.653 --> 00:13:26.488
TELL IT TO MY MONSTER!

00:13:28.357 --> 00:13:29.992
GO, CROCODILUS!

00:13:40.702 --> 00:13:42.871
BATTLING ME WON'T BRING
YOUR BROTHER BACK,

00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:45.474
AND WE WANT
TO STOP PEGASUS
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

00:13:45.474 --> 00:13:47.409
HE'S TAKEN
MY GRANDFATHER PRISONER.

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:48.444
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:49.778
PEGASUS IS
THE BAD GUY HERE.

00:13:49.778 --> 00:13:51.580
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT,
YOU CRAZY LITTLE KID?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.748
YOU'RE WRONG.

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:54.483
I HAVE TO PROTECT
MY BROTHER'S COMPANY,

00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:56.285
AND YUGI'S THE ONE
PEGASUS HAS TO BEAT

00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:57.453
IN ORDER TO TAKE IT OVER.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:13:59.922
WAIT, I GET IT.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.724
MOKUBA IS TRYING TO SAVE
HIS BROTHER'S COMPANY

00:14:02.724 --> 00:14:04.393
BY DEFEATING YUGI
IN A DUEL

00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:06.862
SO PEGASUS DOESN'T GET
TO FACE YUGI AT ALL!

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:08.263
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?

00:14:08.263 --> 00:14:09.965
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WHAT DO I MEAN"?

00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:11.834
I WASN'T TALKIN'
TO YOU.

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:13.502
[CHUCKLES] SORRY,
WHAT'D <i>YOU</i> MEAN, TEA?

00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:14.736
[SIGHS]

00:14:14.736 --> 00:14:17.272
IF MOKUBA CAN KEEP PEGASUS
FROM BEATING YUGI,

00:14:17.272 --> 00:14:19.541
THEN HE WON'T BE ABLE
TO TAKE OVER KAIBA'S COMPANY.

00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:21.276
AH,
THAT MUST BE IT!

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:22.544
HUH?

00:14:22.544 --> 00:14:23.912
HEY,
WHERE'D HE GO?

00:14:23.912 --> 00:14:26.248
IF I CAN'T BEAT YOU...

00:14:26.248 --> 00:14:27.516
I'LL HAVE YOU
DISQUALIFIED.

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:29.384
MY STAR CHIPS!

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.488
Tristan: HOLD UP,
YOU LITTLE PUNK!

AFTER I DEFEATED KAIBA
IN OUR DUEL,

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.632
I OPENED HIS MIND.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:45.868

HIS THOUGHTS AND ACTIONS.

WASN'T THE RIGHT WAY,

00:15:02.217 --> 00:15:03.685
WHAT CAN I DO?

BY TRUSTING IN ME,

BRING PEGASUS DOWN

AH, IT'S NO USE.

I'VE GONE OVER IT
A DOZEN TIMES IN MY MIND,

FIGURE IT OUT.

THE ANSWER.

BEEN DOMINATING THE MATCH.

BUT YUGI
WOULDN'T GIVE UP.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.883
AGAINST ALL ODDS,
AND WITH ABSOLUTE FAITH
IN HIS GRANDFATHER'S DECK,

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:11.386
HE SOMEHOW DREW THE ONE CARD
THAT ASSURED HIS VICTORY.

BUT YUGI CLAIMS
THAT THE CARDS HAVE A HEART.

00:16:31.239 --> 00:16:33.108
IT SOUNDS CRAZY, I KNOW.

00:16:33.108 --> 00:16:34.643
BUT COULD YUGI BE RIGHT?

00:16:34.643 --> 00:16:36.311
IS THERE REALLY
A HEART OF THE CARDS

THE OUTCOME OF A DUEL?

I'LL KNOW FOR SURE
IS TO FACE YUGI AGAIN,
