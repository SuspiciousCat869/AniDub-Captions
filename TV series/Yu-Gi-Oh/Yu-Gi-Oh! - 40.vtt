00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.307
ANYONE WHO WAS
ANYONE WAS THERE.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:59.045
BUT BY FAR, THE ONE
THAT IMPRESSED
ME MOST...WAS YOU.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:00.447
EVEN THOUGH WE
WERE ONLY CHILDREN,

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:03.083
I KNEW I WAS IN LOVE.
[GIGGLES]

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:07.020
WE WERE DRAWN TO EACH OTHER,
AND FROM THAT MOMENT ON,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.723
WE WERE INSEPARABLE,
YOU AND I.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.326
YOU INFLAMED MY PASSIONS,

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.261
INSPIRED ME TO
BECOME A PAINTER.

00:08:15.261 --> 00:08:17.364
AND YOU WERE MY
FAVORITE SUBJECT.

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:20.200
I WAS SO IN LOVE.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.303
AND JUST WHEN
I THOUGHT THINGS
COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER,

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:28.241
YOU AGREED TO TAKE
MY HAND ONCE AGAIN,
THIS TIME, IN MARRIAGE.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:32.112
THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST
DAY OF MY LIFE.
BUT IT WAS CUT SHORT.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:34.647
FOR IT SEEMED,
JUST AS WE SAID OUR VOWS,

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.650
YOU WERE STRUCK DOWN
BY A DEVASTATING DISEASE

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.620
AND TAKEN FROM ME
AND THIS WORLD.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.923
IT WAS AS IF A BLOW HAD
STRUCK ME FROM THE HEAVENS.

00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:46.292
I WAS FILLED WITH SORROW.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.295
FROM THAT MOMENT ON,
I COULD NO LONGER PAINT.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.798
MY HEART GREW
BITTER AND COLD.

00:08:51.798 --> 00:08:55.735
UNABLE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA
THAT OUR LIFE TOGETHER
WAS FOREVER LOST,

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:58.538
I DECIDED TO SCOUR
THE EARTH IN AN ATTEMPT

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.776
TO FIND ANY WAY TO REACH YOU
BEYOND THIS MORTAL VEIL.

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:06.246
MY JOURNEY EVENTUALLY
BROUGHT ME TO THE GREAT
PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT,

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.715
THAT MYSTERIOUS LAND
WHOSE ANCIENT PEOPLE

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:11.484
BELIEVED IN A LIFE
BEYOND THE HERE AND NOW--

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:14.020
A BELIEF I WANTED
TO EMBRACE.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.922
I HAD JUST
BEGUN TO EXPLORE

00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.925
THAT ANCIENT CITY
WHEN FATE INTERVENED.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.165
THANK YOU.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.067
STRANGER,
HEED MY ADVICE.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.034
HUH?

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.236
YOU HAVE
JOURNEYED FAR,

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.705
SEEKING TO CURE
THE ACHE WITHIN
YOUR SOUL.

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:35.375
OHH.
TAKE GREAT CARE.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:38.211
THE SEARCH
TO HEAL THE PAINS
OF A BROKEN HEART

00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:41.314
MIGHT LEAD TO EVEN
GREATER HEARTACHE.

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.549
WAIT! HOW DO YOU KNOW?

00:09:42.549 --> 00:09:44.551
IT MATTERS NOT.
GO HOME!

00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.186
Pegasus: BUT I COULDN'T.

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:48.121
I REALIZED IF HE SOMEHOW
KNEW OF MY PAIN,

00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:49.722
MAYBE HE COULD
HELP ME HEAL IT.

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:53.827
I FOLLOWED HIM
AGAINST HIS WISHES,
OR SO I THOUGHT.

00:09:56.896 --> 00:09:58.698
ALTHOUGH THE PASSAGE
SEEMED TO LEAD

00:09:58.698 --> 00:10:01.701
TO THE BOWELS
OF THE EARTH,
STILL I FOLLOWED,

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.771
AND MY FOOTSTEPS LED ME
TO A HIDDEN CRYPT,

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.974
APPARENTLY BURIED BENEATH
CENTURIES OF CIVILIZATION.

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:10.743
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.079
SO, YOU CHOSE NOT
TO HEED MY WARNING.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:15.915
[GRUNTS]

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:18.151
Pegasus:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
LET ME GO!

00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:21.988
I AM A GUARDIAN
OF THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.290
ONCE THIS SACRED PLACE
HAS BEEN DISCOVERED,

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.459
THE ONLY WAY TO LEAVE
IS TO BE CHOSEN.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.595
IT MUST BE
YOUR DESTINY.

00:10:28.595 --> 00:10:30.296
BUT HOW COULD THESE
MILLENNIUM ITEMS BE

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.265
PART OF MY DESTINY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:33.600
UHH.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.834
YOU WILL NOW
BE TESTED

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:37.904
BY THE ITEM ITSELF:
THE MILLENNIUM EYE.

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.209
THE EYE ITSELF?
BUT HOW?

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.513
EACH MILLENNIUM ITEM
AWAITS THE DAY
ITS FATED POSSESSOR

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:51.284
APPEARS TO CLAIM IT
AND PUNISHES THOSE
WHO ARE UNDESERVING.

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:52.485
PUNISHES?

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:54.754
NOW, IF YOU
PASS ITS TEST,

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:55.855
IT WILL EMPOWER YOU
TO SEE MORE

00:10:55.855 --> 00:10:57.724
THAN YOU'VE
EVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:10:57.724 --> 00:10:59.692
AND IF I FAIL
ITS TEST?

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:02.028
IF YOU ARE NOT THE ONE
DESTINED TO POSSESS IT,

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:05.198
ALL THAT AWAITS YOU
IS NIGHTMARES BEYOND

YOU ARE
THE CHOSEN ONE.

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:22.282
NOW YOUR EYES WILL BE
OPENED TO DIMENSIONS

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:51.945

HAVE ONCE AGAIN BEEN
ENGULFED BY DESPAIR.

FOR THAT BRIEF MOMENT...

THAT LATER PEGASUS
GOT AN INSPIRATION.

UPSET THE COSMIC BALANCE,

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.489
BUT PERHAPS I SHOULD
BEGIN MY SEARCH HERE.

00:13:09.489 --> 00:13:12.392
THROUGH THE CENTURIES,
THOSE WHO HAVE
COME TO POSSESS

00:13:12.392 --> 00:13:15.361

WITH THIS BOY.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:24.904
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.074
THE MILLENNIUM KEY
WILL UNLOCK HIS MIND

00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:44.657

CONTAINS TWO CHAMBERS.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.693
NEVER HAVE I
SEEN SUCH A THING.

00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.227
ONE IS A ROOM
OF A PURE INNOCENCE,

00:13:48.227 --> 00:13:50.363
DEVOID OF MALICE.

00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:53.266

NOT POSSIBLY BELONG

TO THE CRIMINAL THAT
STOLE THE MILLENNIUM EYE.

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.171
BUT WAIT!

IN THE OTHER CHAMBER,
I DETECT ANOTHER PRESENCE.

MUCH MORE MYSTERIOUS.

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:13.152
TREAD
CAUTIOUSLY.

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:14.721
I WILL ALLOW
NO HARM TO COME

VESSEL I SHARE.

OF MANY PEOPLE,

00:14:23.763 --> 00:14:27.533
BUT I'VE NEVER
ENCOUNTERED A CHAMBER
SO DANK AND MYSTERIOUS.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:31.304
I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M
IN A TOMB OF AN ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN PHARAOH.

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:33.439
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
ENTERED MY MIND.

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:36.008
EXPLAIN YOURSELF
BEFORE YOU TRESPASS
FURTHER.

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.111
I DEMAND
AN EXPLANATION
FOR YOUR INTRUSION.

00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:42.749
HMM. I SEEK A CRIMINAL
WHO HAS STOLEN THE POWER
OF A MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:46.185
IT HAS BEEN FIVE LONG
MILLENNIA SINCE THOSE
ANCIENT ITEMS WERE CREATED.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:50.056
THEIR MAGICAL ENERGIES
WERE TRAPPED IN THEM
BY A BRAVE PHARAOH.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.025
COMBINED, THESE
SEVEN MILLENNIUM ITEMS POSSESS

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.161
POWER ENOUGH
TO CONQUER THE WORLD.

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:58.998
HENCE, MANY EVIL MEN
HAVE VENTURED TO GATHER
THESE ITEMS FOR THEMSELVES.

00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:00.199
HMM.

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.801
IT IS MY HERITAGE

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:03.636
TO GUARD
THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:07.840
AND MY CHARGE TO PUNISH
THE THIEF WHO STOLE
PEGASUS' MILLENNIUM EYE.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.110
AND YOU ACCUSE ME OF
BEING THAT CRIMINAL?

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.247
YOU HAVE ALREADY
TAKEN REFUGE IN
THE VESSEL OF ANOTHER.

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:15.381
THAT DOES NOT
BODE WELL.

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.350
BUT IF YOU ARE
NOT THE CRIMINAL,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.852
THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR FROM MY SEARCH.

00:15:19.852 --> 00:15:21.888
GUILTY UNTIL
PROVEN INNOCENT?

00:15:21.888 --> 00:15:24.490
AN ANCIENT CONCEPT
FOR THIS MODERN AGE.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.093
HOWEVER, I HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:28.494
I'M NOT
YOUR CRIMINAL.

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:32.031
THEN GRANT ME PASSAGE
TO YOUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:34.434
FINE. I'LL OPEN
THE DOORS FOR YOU.

00:15:34.434 --> 00:15:35.835
[SNAP]

00:15:35.835 --> 00:15:37.870
YOU MAY SEARCH THEM
TO YOUR HEART'S
CONTENT.

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:41.874
[THINKING] HMM.

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:45.745
NEVER HAVE I SEEN
SUCH COMPLEXITY
AS IN THIS ONE'S MIND.

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:48.080
TRULY, HE IS
AN EXTRAORDINARY
INDIVIDUAL.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.052
AND NOW,
I WILL LEAVE YOU TO
YOUR EXPLORATION.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:55.855
THERE ARE MYSTERIES
WITHIN MYSTERIES HERE,

00:15:55.855 --> 00:15:57.557
LEVELS BEYOND LEVELS,

00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:00.259
SO I MUST PROBE
EACH CHAMBER
FOR THE TRUTH.

00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:02.995
AAH!

00:16:05.164 --> 00:16:06.966
IT WAS A TRAP!

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:09.569
[THINKING]
DESPITE HIS COOPERATION,
SOMETHING IN HIS MIND

00:16:09.569 --> 00:16:11.904
CONSPIRES TO KEEP ME
FROM THE TRUTH.

00:16:11.904 --> 00:16:14.841
SO MANY DOORS,
SO MANY FALSE ENTRIES,

00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:17.043
ALL DESIGNED TO DISTRACT ME
FROM THE PROPER PATH.

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:21.080
BUT NO MATTER HOW
THEY TRY TO CONFUSE
AND DISORIENT ME,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.517
MY MILLENNIUM KEY
WILL SHOW ME THE TRUE WAY.

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:28.554
IT DRAWS ME HERE.
THE TRUTH LIES WITHIN.

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:30.389
IT APPEARS SAFE ENOUGH.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.360
STILL, I SHALL PROCEED
WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

00:16:38.598 --> 00:16:40.900
[SCREAMING]

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.835
ANOTHER TRAP!

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.005
[THINKING] NEVER HAVE
I SEEN MENTAL DEFENSES
SO STRONG.

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:48.674
[GROANING]
THIS COULD BE
THE END OF ME.

00:16:54.614 --> 00:16:56.616
[THINKING] IF I FALL
INTO THIS DEEP DARKNESS,

00:16:56.616 --> 00:16:59.719
I WILL BE TRAPPED ETERNALLY
WITHIN HIS CRYPTIC MIND.

00:16:59.719 --> 00:17:00.920
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THE SPIRIT OF

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.121
MY PUZZLE'S DOING
THIS TO YOU,

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.524
BUT I CAN'T
LET HIM HURT YOU.
HUH?

00:17:04.524 --> 00:17:06.158
[THINKING]
IT'S THE INNOCENT ONE!

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.426
LET ME HELP YOU UP.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.729
AHH!

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:13.432
I SEEK ONLY THE TRUTH.
BUT IT'S STRANGE,
MY WAY IS BLOCKED.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:15.334
IT'S STRANGE,
ALL RIGHT.

00:17:15.334 --> 00:17:17.003
BUT I DON'T
THINK THE SPIRIT
OF THE PUZZLE

00:17:17.003 --> 00:17:18.538
IS DOING THIS
ON PURPOSE.

00:17:18.538 --> 00:17:19.939
I GET THE FEELING
THAT THERE ARE

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.208
SOME MEMORIES HIDDEN
EVEN FROM HIM.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:23.943
I SURE WISH I KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE.

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.179
HUH?
HUH?

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:29.315
Man, thinking: THE DOOR,
IT OPENS FOR YOU,

00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:32.151
AS IF SEEKING TO ANSWER
YOUR CURIOSITY.

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.954
BUT WHY? WHY DOES
IT YIELD TO YOU?

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:40.493
Yugi: WHAT IS ALL
THIS? WHAT ARE THESE
STONE TABLETS?

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:43.629
5,000 YEARS AGO,
EGYPTIAN KINGS PLAYED

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.665
A GAME OF GREAT
AND TERRIBLE POWER.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:49.835
THESE SHADOW GAMES
WERE PLAYED WITH REAL
MAGIC AND REAL MONSTERS.

00:17:49.835 --> 00:17:51.904
BUT THOSE GAMES
ERUPTED INTO A WAR

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.440
THAT THREATENED TO DESTROY
THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.643
UNTIL A BRAVE PHARAOH
LOCKED THE MAGIC AWAY,

00:17:57.643 --> 00:17:59.579
SEALING THE MONSTERS
IN STONE TABLETS.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.348
BUT HOW COULD
YOUR OTHER PERSONALITY

00:18:02.348 --> 00:18:04.116
HAVE KNOWLEDGE
OF THIS ANCIENT HISTORY?

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:07.720
AND WHY DO I
SUDDENLY SENSE HERE,
IN HIS UNCONSCIOUS MIND,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.591
MAGIC THAT THE WORLD
HAS NOT KNOWN
FOR FIVE MILLENNIA?

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.225
THEY LOOK JUST
LIKE THE MONSTERS

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:15.294
ON THE CARDS WE USE
TO PLAY WITH TODAY.

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:16.762
OHH!
OHH!

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:21.534
LOOK OUT!
A NEW THREAT APPEARS.

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:22.635
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:27.707
HE PREPARES TO STRIKE!

00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:30.710
HE IS ANOTHER
MENTAL DEFENSE
AGAINST ANY INTRUDERS.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.112
THE MAGICIAN INTENDS
TO DESTROY US BOTH.

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.647
NO WAY!

00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:38.584
UNLESS WE CAN STOP HIM,
WE WILL NEVER LEAVE
THIS CHAMBER.

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:40.953
WAIT! THIS SURFACE
ON WHICH I STAND

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.555
MAY BE THE MEANS
OF OUR SALVATION.

00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:45.491
IF THAT OTHER IMAGE
SPAWNED THE ESSENCE
OF THE DARK MAGICIAN,

00:18:45.491 --> 00:18:48.694
THEN THIS ONE MUST
CONTAIN THE MAGICAL
ENERGY OF HIS NEMESIS,

00:18:48.694 --> 00:18:50.863
THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON.

00:18:50.863 --> 00:18:53.733
IF I CAN USE THE POWER
OF THE MILLENNIUM KEY
TO UNLEASH ITS MIGHT,

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:55.601
IT WILL OBLITERATE
THE MAGICIAN.

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.337
NO! STOP!

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:00.272
WHY SHOULD I?

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:02.775
BECAUSE HE'D
NEVER HURT ME.

00:19:04.343 --> 00:19:08.147
DARK MAGICIAN,
WE ARE NOT INTRUDERS!
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.883
STAND ASIDE AND LET US
LEAVE IN PEACE!

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:13.052
WE WILL NOT REVEAL
THE HIDDEN SECRETS.

00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:15.321
YOU KNOW ME.
YOU TRUST ME.

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:19.058
WHAT'S THIS?

00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:21.427
[THINKING]
THE DARK MAGICIAN,
WHO IN ANCIENT TIMES

00:19:21.427 --> 00:19:23.929
OBEYED ONLY THE PHARAOH,
GIVES HEED TO THIS YOUTH?

00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:24.997
IMPOSSIBLE!

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:28.334
UNLESS THIS BOY
IS THE CHOSEN ONE.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:31.270
THE PROPHECY COMES TO PASS.

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:33.906
Both: AAH!

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:43.616
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY RUDE
INTRUSION INTO YOUR MIND.

00:19:43.616 --> 00:19:46.218
I DID NOT REALIZE THAT
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:50.389
AND THAT THE ANCIENT
PREDICTIONS HAVE FINALLY
BEEN FULFILLED AT LAST!

00:19:50.389 --> 00:19:51.824
IN MY SEARCH
FOR A THIEF,

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:53.592
I INSTEAD FOUND
THE MOST WORTHY,

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:55.795
ONE FATED TO UNLOCK
ALL THE MAGIC.

00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:57.930
THE THEFT OF PEGASUS'
MILLENNIUM EYE WAS

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.266
BUT THE FIRST SIGN
THAT EVIL ONCE AGAIN

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:02.401
WALKS THE EARTH, BRINGING
MADNESS IN ITS WAKE.

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:05.137
AS IN ANCIENT TIMES,
CHAOS ONCE MORE

00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:07.807
THREATENS TO ENVELOP
AN UNSUSPECTING WORLD,

00:20:07.807 --> 00:20:11.744
AND ONLY HE WHO SOLVED
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE
CAN SAVE IT.

00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:12.812
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:20:12.812 --> 00:20:13.813
IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE

00:20:13.813 --> 00:20:14.847
YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THIS?

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:19.151
TAKE GREAT CARE.
BE ON YOUR GUARD,

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.486
FOR WHOEVER
THE THIEF IS

00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:22.455
WHO STOLE PEGASUS'
MILLENNIUM ITEM,

00:20:22.455 --> 00:20:24.590
HE WILL ALSO
COME SEEKING YOURS.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.059
WOW! THAT'S
ALMOST TOO SCARY
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.095
BUT IF A GUY
LIKE YOU COULDN'T
FIND HIM,

00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:30.563
HOW DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO?

00:20:30.563 --> 00:20:34.333
WAIT! DON'T GO!
I'VE GOT A LOT
MORE QUESTIONS.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.302
LIKE, WHO ARE YOU?

00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:38.938
MY NAME IS SHADI,
AND I AM CERTAIN

00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:40.673
THAT WE WILL MEET
AGAIN ANOTHER DAY.

00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:43.776
BUT UNTIL THEN,
STAY TRUE TO
YOUR DESTINY.

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:47.980
REMEMBER, THE FATE
OF THE WORLD RESTS
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.248
[SIGHS]
