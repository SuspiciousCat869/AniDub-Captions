BUT HE'S STILL
PRETTY MUCH CONSIDERED

00:08:06.342 --> 00:08:08.210
THE TOP DUELIST
IN ALL THE WORLD.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.379
NOT ANYMORE.

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:11.947
THAT'S RIGHT,
TOUGH GUY.

00:08:11.947 --> 00:08:14.350
I BET EVER
SINCE YUGI MOPPED
THE FLOOR WITH YOU,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.052
YOU CAN'T EVEN
LAY A TRAP CARD
WITHOUT FLINCHIN'!

00:08:17.052 --> 00:08:18.521
OK, JOEY.
LET IT GO.

00:08:18.521 --> 00:08:19.755
THIS IS REALLY
THE WRONG GUY

00:08:19.755 --> 00:08:20.756
TO PICK
A FIGHT WITH.

00:08:20.756 --> 00:08:22.024
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
MONEY BAGS?

00:08:22.024 --> 00:08:24.693
CARE TO PROVE ME WRONG?

00:08:24.693 --> 00:08:27.296
ON ONE CONDITION...
HUH?

00:08:27.296 --> 00:08:29.532
WE PLAY USING
MY NEWEST INNOVATION

00:08:29.532 --> 00:08:31.600
IN HOLOGRAPHIC
DUEL TECHNOLOGIES.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.769
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:36.405
IT MEANS THAT
IF JOEY'S REALLY
THAT EAGER TO DUEL ME,

00:08:36.405 --> 00:08:39.875
HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO DO IT USING MY
LATEST HOLOGRAPHIC SYSTEM.

00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:42.978
IT'S A NEW HI-TECH
DUELING DEVICE
THAT ALLOWS PLAYERS

00:08:42.978 --> 00:08:45.614
THE REALISM
OF ARENA MATCHES
IN ANY SETTING.

00:08:45.614 --> 00:08:48.450
LOOKS LIKE JUST
A REGULAR OLD
BRIEFCASE TO ME.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.353
IT'S IN THE BRIEFCASE,
YOU MORON.

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:00.930
HMM...

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.665
ITS TECHNOLOGY
IS UNPRECEDENTED.

00:09:02.665 --> 00:09:03.766
LOOKS LIKE
A FLYIN' SAUCER.

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:05.701
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.

00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:08.871
THIS IS THE MOST
STATE-OF-THE-ART
DISPLAY MODULATOR EVER BUILT.

00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:11.607
SO, IF YOU THINK YOU
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO HANDLE IT,

00:09:11.607 --> 00:09:13.609
JUST STRAP IT ON.

00:09:18.247 --> 00:09:20.716
OK. NOW WHAT HAPPENS?

00:09:20.716 --> 00:09:22.418
FIRST, INSERT
YOUR DUELING DECK

00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:24.486
INTO THE DISPLAY DRIVE
RECOGNIZER.

00:09:24.486 --> 00:09:25.955
A LIFE POINT COUNT
WILL LIGHT UP

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:27.857
AND KEEP SCORE FOR YOU
THE ENTIRE MATCH.

00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:30.159
THEN CHOOSE
A CARD TO PLAY

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:32.061
AND SET IT ON
THE DIGITAL CARD READER.

00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:34.063
I THINK THE REST
WILL EXPLAIN ITSELF.

00:09:35.397 --> 00:09:36.699
HUH, COOL.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.968
ALL SET?

00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:40.236
THEN LET'S DUEL.

00:09:40.236 --> 00:09:41.604
YOU GOT IT.

00:09:41.604 --> 00:09:43.072
NOW, BRACE YOURSELF...

00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:44.073
UNH!

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:47.409
FOR MY BATTLE OX!

00:09:51.046 --> 00:09:53.515
Tristan: WHOA! CHECK OUT
ALL THOSE LIGHTS!

00:09:53.515 --> 00:09:55.017
IT'S LIKE RAINING GLITTER.

00:09:55.017 --> 00:09:57.786
Téa: YEAH, IT'S
LIKE SOMETHING FROM
AN ENCHANTED DREAM.

00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:00.022
EW!

00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:01.156
OR A NIGHTMARE!

00:10:01.156 --> 00:10:02.324
WHOA!

00:10:02.324 --> 00:10:04.393
NO WAY!
THAT'S A HOLOGRAM?

00:10:04.393 --> 00:10:07.062
A HOLOGRAM OF
UNPRECEDENTED REALISM.

00:10:07.062 --> 00:10:08.831
IT BREATHES,
IT SNARLS.

00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:12.334
MY NEW DUELING DISK
TECHNOLOGY EVEN
SIMULATES ITS ODOR.

00:10:12.334 --> 00:10:14.069
YOU'RE TELLIN' ME!

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:15.905
THAT THING
REALLY STINKS.

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:17.907
GOOD THING HE
WON'T BE AROUND
FOR MUCH LONGER.

00:10:19.108 --> 00:10:21.043
ALL RIGHTY...

00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:22.211
HERE GOES NOTHIN'!

00:10:26.615 --> 00:10:29.018
GO, ARMORED LIZARD!

00:10:30.152 --> 00:10:32.321
[ROARS]

00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:34.323
GO, BATTLE OX!

00:10:34.323 --> 00:10:35.791
AXE SLAM ATTACK!

00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:37.393
[GROWLING]

00:10:41.363 --> 00:10:42.431
YES!

00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:43.799
HE WITHSTOOD YOUR ATTACK!

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:45.134
OH, DID HE?

00:10:45.134 --> 00:10:46.201
LOOK AGAIN!

00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:51.507
OK...

00:10:51.507 --> 00:10:53.509
THAT'S REAL ENOUGH
FOR ME.

00:10:59.002 --> 00:11:00.437
Joey: I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT!

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:02.706
THAT UGLY OVERGROWN OX!

00:11:02.706 --> 00:11:04.975
HE CUT MY LIZARD
IN HALF!

00:11:04.975 --> 00:11:08.245
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY
ISN'T FOR THE FAINT
OF HEART, JOEY.

00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:11.048
IT'S INTENDED
TO FORCE DUELISTS
TO THINK ON THEIR FEET.

00:11:11.048 --> 00:11:13.483
IF IT'S TOO MUCH
FOR YOU, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GIVE UP NOW.

00:11:13.483 --> 00:11:15.819
FAT CHANCE!

00:11:17.287 --> 00:11:18.856
DON'T YOU WORRY, KAIBA.

00:11:18.856 --> 00:11:19.923
I'M A QUICK LEARNER.

00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:22.559
WATCH.

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:23.894
SET THE CARD,

00:11:23.894 --> 00:11:25.329
SPIN THE DISK,

00:11:25.329 --> 00:11:26.763
AND...

00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:27.965
BINGO!

00:11:27.965 --> 00:11:29.299
THE FLAME SWORDSMAN!

00:11:29.299 --> 00:11:31.702
READY TO SLAUGHTER
THAT SIRLOIN OF YOURS.

00:11:31.702 --> 00:11:32.903
ATTACK!

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:34.671
FLAMING SWORD OF BATTLE!

00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:36.173
BUT, JOEY,

00:11:36.173 --> 00:11:38.809
THE BATTLE OX
IS RESISTANT TO ALL
FIRE-TYPE CREATURES.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.813
NOW HE TELLS ME.

00:11:42.813 --> 00:11:46.617
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED
THAT YOU'D MAKE SUCH
AN AMATEUR MISTAKE?

00:11:46.617 --> 00:11:48.552
MAYBE FROM NOW ON,
YOU OUGHT TO LET YUGI

00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:50.487
PICK ALL OF
YOUR MOVES FOR YOU.

00:11:50.487 --> 00:11:52.689
OR, BETTER YET,
WHY DON'T I TEACH YOU

00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:55.425
SOME OF THE ADVANCED MOVES
OF THE GAME THE HARD WAY?

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.662
MYSTIC HORSEMAN
AND BATTLE OX...

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.633
MERGE INTO RABID HORSEMAN!

00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:14.478
YOU THINK I'M AFRAID
OF THAT DEFORMED PONY?

00:12:14.478 --> 00:12:18.048
I'LL SHOW YOU
SOMETHING THAT YOU
SHOULD BE AFRAID OF.

00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:20.350
SWAMP BATTLEGUARD,
ATTACK!

00:12:22.753 --> 00:12:24.888
AX RAIDER, AVENGE
MY BATTLEGUARD!

00:12:26.657 --> 00:12:28.558
GO, BATTLE STEER!

00:12:28.558 --> 00:12:30.127
UH, GAROOZIS?

00:12:30.127 --> 00:12:31.194
OK. UH,

00:12:31.194 --> 00:12:32.195
LET'S SEE HERE, UH,

00:12:32.195 --> 00:12:33.597
SMASHING ROCK...

00:12:33.597 --> 00:12:34.598
AW!

00:12:36.433 --> 00:12:37.434
UH...

00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:39.202
RUDE KAISER!

00:12:47.778 --> 00:12:49.046
HA HA HA!

00:12:49.046 --> 00:12:50.213
THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY,

00:12:50.213 --> 00:12:53.450
FALL TO THE DIRT
LIKE A WHIMPERING DOG.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.420
[THINKING] MAN, IT TOOK
EXODIA FOR EVEN YUGI
TO BEAT THIS GUY.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.155
I NEED TO COME UP
WITH A KICK-BUTT CARD
OR--

00:12:58.155 --> 00:12:59.790
Téa: COME ON, JOEY!
HUH?

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.158
YOU'RE THE BEST
AT FINDING WAYS

00:13:01.158 --> 00:13:02.359
TO COME BACK
FROM BEHIND!

00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:03.527
SHE'S RIGHT, JOEY.

00:13:03.527 --> 00:13:04.594
NOW, GET UP.

00:13:04.594 --> 00:13:05.862
NO WAY KAIBA
GETS AWAY

00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:06.964
WITH CALLING YOU
A CANINE!

00:13:06.964 --> 00:13:09.700
YOU'RE RIGHT, TRISTAN.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.468
NO ONE CALLS ME
A WHIMPERIN' DOG.

00:13:11.468 --> 00:13:13.470
AND ONCE HE SEES
WHAT I GOT IN STORE
FOR HIM,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.539
HE'S GONNA BE
THE ONE IN THE DIRT.

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:16.707
CHECK THIS OUT!

00:13:16.707 --> 00:13:19.109
RED EYES BLACK DRAGON!

00:13:20.978 --> 00:13:22.946
[ROARS]

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.884
JOEY'S
BEST CARD!

00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:29.486
KAIBA'S IN
BIG TROUBLE NOW!

00:13:29.486 --> 00:13:32.923
INFERNO FIRE BLAST!

00:13:35.926 --> 00:13:37.561
TAKE THAT!

00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:39.596
IT'S JUST LIKE
A NOVICE TO REJOICE

00:13:39.596 --> 00:13:41.398
WHEN THERE'S NO REASON
TO CELEBRATE.

00:13:41.398 --> 00:13:42.933
TRUE, THE ROUND
MAY BE YOURS,

00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:44.968
BUT THE DUEL IS
ABOUT TO BECOME MINE.

00:13:44.968 --> 00:13:46.069
SAY WHAT?

00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:48.305
YOUR RED EYES
IS A POWERFUL DRAGON,

00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:51.408
BUT HIS FEROCITY
PALES IN COMPARISON
TO MY BEAST...

00:13:51.408 --> 00:13:52.409
[GASPS]

00:13:54.711 --> 00:13:58.315
THE LEGENDARY
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON!

00:13:58.315 --> 00:14:00.317
[ROARS]

00:14:02.652 --> 00:14:03.653
[GASPS]

00:14:03.653 --> 00:14:05.055
BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON,

00:14:05.055 --> 00:14:06.390
WHITE LIGHTENING
ATTACK,

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.391
NOW!

00:14:09.459 --> 00:14:11.461
AAH!

00:14:19.603 --> 00:14:20.604
NO!

00:14:20.604 --> 00:14:21.605
I LOST!

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.567
Kaiba: THAT'S RIGHT, JOEY.
STAY DOWN.

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:31.037
STAY DOWN LIKE
THE SNIVELING, DEFEATED
DOG I'VE TURNED YOU INTO.

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:32.638
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
JOEY?

00:14:35.508 --> 00:14:36.976
IT'S OK,
KIDDO.

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:40.246
I'D SAY MY DUEL DISK
SYSTEM HAS PROVEN
QUITE EFFECTIVE.

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:42.248
NOT ONLY DID
ITS STUNNING REALISM

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:44.617
JAR JOEY INTO COMPLETE
AND UTTER SUBMISSION,

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:46.285
BUT JUST LOOK AT HIM.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.087
HE'S MOPING LIKE
A FRIGHTENED DOG

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:50.123
WITH HIS TAIL
BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:53.059
WHICH IS EXACTLY
HOW I INTEND
TO LEAVE PEGASUS.

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:54.360
Yugi: BUT THIS
IS JOEY.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.862
Téa: YEAH,
YOU JERK!

00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:58.698
DID YOU HAVE TO TAKE
HIS CONFIDENCE AWAY
WITH HIS DRAGON?

00:14:58.698 --> 00:15:00.099
JOEY WAS
JUST STARTING
TO BELIEVE

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:01.634
IN HIMSELF
AS A DUELIST.

00:15:01.634 --> 00:15:03.236
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:05.438
BEATING HIM DOESN'T
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO HUMILIATE HIM.

00:15:05.438 --> 00:15:06.606
QUIET, YUGI.

00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:09.075
DON'T GIVE THAT CREEP
THE SATISFACTION.

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:10.576
HA. LOOK, KID,

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.912
DO YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT IF YOU WERE
DUELING PEGASUS

00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:15.515
HE WOULD'VE BEEN
ANY MORE MERCIFUL
WITH YOU THAN I WAS?

00:15:15.515 --> 00:15:18.918
I UNDERSTAND THAT
THE HEART OF THE CARDS
IS A POWERFUL PHILOSOPHY

00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.453
AND THAT IT ALL
WORKS WELL FOR YOU,

00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:22.288
BUT I NEED TO DUEL
MY OWN WAY NOW.

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.257
I CAN'T RISK
TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.792
AND MAYBE JOEY
SHOULDN'T EITHER.

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:27.693
UNLESS HE LIKES
LIFE AS A DOG.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.862
SCROUNGING ON THE SCRAPS
OF PAST VICTORIES

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:31.864
AND BEGGING FOR MERCY
FROM TRUE DUELISTS.

00:15:31.864 --> 00:15:33.166
PLEASE, KAIBA.

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:34.700
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.002
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:15:36.002 --> 00:15:37.570
OH, YEAH?

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.505
WELL, THAT'S
THE ATTITUDE
YOU HAVE TO TAKE

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:42.475
IF YOU WANT TO STAND
A CHANCE AGAINST
MAXIMILLION PEGASUS.

00:15:42.475 --> 00:15:44.377
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
YUGI.

00:15:44.377 --> 00:15:46.913
THIS IS THE MAN
WHO CREATED DUEL MONSTERS.

00:15:46.913 --> 00:15:50.049
HE HAS EVERY CARD
THAT'S EVER BEEN MADE
AT HIS DISPOSAL.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:54.320
HE'S MASTERED
EVERY STRATEGY
THAT'S EVER BEEN PLAYED.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.655
PEGASUS ALWAYS MAKES SURE

00:15:55.655 --> 00:15:57.790
THAT HE HAS EVERY
POSSIBLE ADVANTAGE

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.459
WORKING IN HIS FAVOR.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.361
IF I'M TO STAND ANY CHANCE
AGAINST HIM AT ALL,

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:05.665
I'LL HAVE TO PLAY
BY MY OWN RUTHLESS RULES,

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:07.100
NOT HIS.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.468
OPEN YOUR EYES.

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.736
EVEN WITH YOUR
PRODIGIOUS TALENTS, YUGI,

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.805
YOU'LL BE DEFEATED
LIKE ALL THE OTHERS.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.307
BECAUSE WHEN PEGASUS DUELS

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.210
HE USES MUCH MORE
THAN MERE SKILL.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.779
I'VE SEEN HIM USE
A MAGIC THAT'S STRONGER
THAN ANY CARD.

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:23.983
IT WAS AT THE
INTERCONTINENTAL TOURNAMENT

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:25.785
IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:29.822
I HAD BEEN INVITED
AS PEGASUS' GUEST OF HONOR.

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.758
A SKILLED HOT-SHOT DUELIST
CALLED BANDIT KEITH

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.694
HAD MADE IT
TO THE FINAL MATCH.

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:36.262
HE WAS PLAYING WELL,

00:16:36.262 --> 00:16:39.298
BUT I COULD SEE
THAT PEGASUS WAS STILL
JUST TOYING WITH HIM.

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:42.135
OF COURSE,
KEITH HAD NO IDEA.

00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:43.202
HEH HEH HEH.

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.604
I WISH YOU COULD
SEE THE EXPRESSION

00:16:44.604 --> 00:16:45.838
ON YOUR FACE, PEGASUS.

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.807
IT'S PRICELESS.

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.609
TELL YOU WHAT,
IF YOU ASK NICE,

00:16:49.609 --> 00:16:51.277
I'LL FINISH YOU FAST.

00:16:51.277 --> 00:16:53.913
BOY! I WANNA BE
A DUELIST LIKE HIM!

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.819
HA! THIS CARD
CLINCHES IT FOR ME.

00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:02.855
ANY FINAL WORDS,
CUTIE PIE?

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.724
HEY, I'M TALKIN'
TO YOU!

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:07.960
Kaiba: PEGASUS JUST STARED
STRAIGHT INTO KEITH'S EYES

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.896
WITH UNNERVING CONFIDENCE.

00:17:09.896 --> 00:17:11.998
THEN HE SCRIBBLED SOMETHING
ON A PIECE OF PAPER

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:14.100
AND CALLED OVER
SOME KID FROM THE CROWD.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.902
HUH?

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:17.403
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:19.138
ASKIN' FOR HELP'S ILLEGAL.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:21.374
I DON'T NEED HELP.

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.243
A CHILD COULD
DEFEAT YOU,
BANDIT KEITH,

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:25.978
AND I'M GOING
TO PROVE IT.

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:28.981
BUT I JUST STARTED
TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY
LAST WEEK!

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:32.418
JUST FOLLOW
THESE INSTRUCTIONS
AND YOU'LL WIN.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.055
UH...

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.590
[THINKING]
WHAT'S HE UP TO?

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.759
HELLO, KAIBA.

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:44.864
AH, I DO HOPE
YOU'RE ENJOYING
THE TOURNAMENT SO FAR.

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:47.700
OH, I KNOW IT MUST
SEEM SO CRUDE TO YOU.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.336
NOT LIKE THE HOLOGRAPHIC
DUELING STATIONS

00:17:50.336 --> 00:17:53.039
YOUR COMPANY IS DEVELOPING,
EH, KAIBA?

00:17:54.774 --> 00:17:57.243
[THINKING] IF PEGASUS
THINKS HE'S GONNA
THROW OFF MY GAME

00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.579
WITH HIS LAME THEATRICS,
HE'S DEAD WRONG.

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:02.782
HA. I'VE GOT
THIS MATCH IN THE BAG.

00:18:02.782 --> 00:18:05.218
GARNECIA ELEFANTIS!

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:06.385
GOOD CARD,

00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:08.187
BUT THE NOTE SAYS
WHEN YOU PLAY THAT,

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:11.324
I SHOULD PLAY THIS ONE
IN ATTACK MODE.

00:18:11.324 --> 00:18:12.658
NO WAY!

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.828
UH, I THINK I JUST TOOK
ALL YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:16.829
WHAT?!

00:18:16.829 --> 00:18:18.464
YOU LITTLE SNOT-NOSED BRAT!

00:18:18.464 --> 00:18:21.000
THERE IS NO WAY YOU
COULD HAVE KNOWN I WAS
GONNA PLAY THAT CARD!

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.001
GIVE ME THAT!

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:24.337
HUH?!

00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:25.371
IT'S ALL HERE!

00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:26.706
THE CARD I PLAYED,
HOW TO BEAT IT,

00:18:26.706 --> 00:18:27.707
EVERYTHING!

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:29.709
HUH?

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.279
SAM IS THE WINNER.

00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:35.147
OH!

00:18:36.315 --> 00:18:38.384
Kaiba: I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW HE DID IT.

00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:41.654
I ONLY HOPE MY NEW DUEL
DISK SYSTEM WILL GIVE ME
THE EDGE I NEED

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.322
TO BEAT HIM ONCE
AND FOR ALL.

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.991
THAT STORY...

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:47.093
IT REMINDS ME OF
WHEN I FACED PEGASUS.

00:18:47.093 --> 00:18:50.029
I SEE YOU'RE
ABOUT TO USE
A KUMORI DRAGON.

00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.030
WHAT?

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.332
I KNOW EVERY MOVE
YOU'LL MAKE

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:55.768
BEFORE YOU
CAN EVEN MAKE IT.

00:18:55.768 --> 00:18:59.272
IT WAS LIKE PEGASUS
WAS ABLE TO SEE
ALL MY CARDS.

00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:00.539
BUT, KAIBA,

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:02.842
THAT'S STILL NO EXCUSE
TO TAKE IT OUT ON US

00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:05.244
AND TURN JOEY INTO
YOUR NEW SYSTEM'S
GUINEA PIG!

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.345
PERHAPS.

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.147
BUT THAT SYSTEM
COULD BE MY ONLY WAY

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.316
TO BEAT PEGASUS,
SO I HAD TO TEST IT.

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:11.584
THIS IS WAR FOR ME, YUGI.

00:19:11.584 --> 00:19:13.819
YOUR FRIEND
WAS A CASUALTY.

00:19:15.621 --> 00:19:18.758
KAIBA, WE MAY
NOT AGREE WITH
EACH OTHER'S METHODS,

00:19:18.758 --> 00:19:22.461
BUT AT LEAST WE BOTH
UNDERSTAND THAT PEGASUS
MUST BE STOPPED.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.599
I HOPE YOU SUCCEED IN
RESCUING YOUR BROTHER.

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:28.968
AND I HOPE YOU
SUCCEED IN YOUR VENTURES.

00:19:28.968 --> 00:19:31.170
LET'S JUST
HOPE OUR PATHS
DON'T CROSS AGAIN

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.105
BEFORE THIS IS ALL OVER.

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.078
Pegasus: HA HA HA!

00:19:39.078 --> 00:19:40.880
I CAN SENSE YOU, KAIBA.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.016
HA HA HA!

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:46.319
BUT ARE YOU HUNTING FOR ME,

00:19:46.319 --> 00:19:48.154
OR AM I HUNTING YOU?

00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:49.155
HA HA HA!
