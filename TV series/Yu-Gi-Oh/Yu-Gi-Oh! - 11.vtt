00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.806
I'M STILL HERE, AIN'T I?

00:07:23.806 --> 00:07:27.343
YUGI, NO OFFENSE,
BUT I WANT YOU TO
KEEP OUTTA THIS ONE.

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:28.644
AH--

00:07:28.644 --> 00:07:29.812
HMM.

00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:35.017
ALL RIGHT, THEN IT'S
DINO FEEDING TIME!

00:07:39.055 --> 00:07:41.057
Téa: WE BELIEVE
IN YOU, JOEY!

00:07:41.057 --> 00:07:43.259
JUST DON'T FORGET
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR!

00:07:44.827 --> 00:07:46.829
[THINKING]
WHAT I'M FIGHTIN' FOR?

00:07:46.829 --> 00:07:48.798
I GOT THAT PART DOWN.

00:07:48.798 --> 00:07:51.801
IT'S <i>WHO</i> I'M FIGHTIN'
THAT'S MAKIN' ME SWEAT.

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:53.803
EH HEH HEH!

00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:55.905
REX, DON'T
FORGET OUR DEAL!

00:07:55.905 --> 00:07:57.907
BEAT HIM, AND YOU
GET TO DUEL WITH ME.

00:07:57.907 --> 00:08:01.777
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU REDUCED YOURSELF TO
BEIN' MAI'S ATTACK DOG.

00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:03.613
AT LEAST
I'M NO DUELING MONKEY.

00:08:03.613 --> 00:08:05.615
GRRR!
WHOA!

00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:08.117
SO HOW MANY CHIPS DO YOU
WANNA LOSE TO MY DINOS?

00:08:08.117 --> 00:08:11.120
I GOT 2,
BUT I PLAN ON
DOUBLIN' 'EM RIGHT HERE!

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.990
YOU WISH! I BET YOUR DECK
ISN'T EVEN PREPARED

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.625
FOR THE FIELDS
WE'RE PLAYING ON.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:17.560
[THINKING]
MAN, IF HE ONLY KNEW.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.995
I STILL HAVE A HARD TIME

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:20.329
TELLIN' ONE FIELD
FROM ANOTHER,

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.899
LET ALONE USING 'EM IN
ANY KIND OF STRATEGIC WAY.

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:25.601
MY BEST BET'S GONNA BE
HITTIN' HIM HARD AND FAST,

00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:28.504
AND I THINK I KNOW
JUST THE CARDS
TO DO THE JOB:

00:08:28.504 --> 00:08:30.973
BABY DRAGON AND TIME WIZARD.

00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:33.409
IF I USE 'EM TOGETHER,
I CAN SPEED UP TIME

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.479
AND MAKE MY DRAGON
SUPERPOWERFUL.

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:39.682
HEY, IT WORKED ONCE BEFORE
WHEN I DUELED MAI,

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:42.318
SO HERE'S HOPIN'
IT'LL DO THE JOB AGAIN.

00:08:42.318 --> 00:08:43.719
Rex: QUIT STALLIN'.

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:44.787
LET'S DUEL!

00:08:44.787 --> 00:08:47.023
BRING IT!

00:08:48.057 --> 00:08:49.192
HMM...

00:08:49.192 --> 00:08:51.827
HEY, TéA, KEEP
ROOTING JOEY ON FOR US.

00:08:51.827 --> 00:08:53.396
I GOTTA GO SEE
ABOUT SOMETHING.

00:08:53.396 --> 00:08:55.331
WHA? YUGI!

00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:57.934
HUH?

00:08:57.934 --> 00:08:59.402
PAY DIRT!

00:08:59.402 --> 00:09:01.971
I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED
FOR A BETTER HAND.

00:09:01.971 --> 00:09:03.506
HEE HEE HEE HEE!

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:05.007
HUH?!

00:09:05.007 --> 00:09:07.009
WHERE'D YUGI GO?

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:10.980
OH, WELL. WAIT'LL HE SEES
WHAT I DID ALL BY MYSELF.

00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:13.883
BABY DRAGON...

00:09:13.883 --> 00:09:15.284

[CHORTLES]

00:09:16.852 --> 00:09:18.087
HUH?

00:09:18.087 --> 00:09:20.957
[THINKING] THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S A BABY DRAGON.

00:09:20.957 --> 00:09:23.459
REX KNOWS HE'S TOAST.

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.394
YOU NEVER LEAVE A BABY
UNATTENDED,

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:27.463
AND YOU'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT WHY!

00:09:27.463 --> 00:09:29.298
TWO-HEADED KING REX...

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:30.800
ATTACK!

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.401
[RAWWRRR]
[RAWWRRR]

00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:33.436
OH...

00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:35.771
[BABY DRAGON SQUEALS]

00:09:35.771 --> 00:09:37.039
POOR BABY.

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:39.275
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE FOUND OUT
WHAT HE WAS MADE OF.

00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:41.344
BUT I DIDN'T
GET TO PLAY MY COMBO.

00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:43.079
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:46.282
BECAUSE EVEN 3-YEAR-OLDS
KNOW BETTER THAN TO DEFEND
ON THEIR FIRST MOVE.

00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:49.752
HA! I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY DID THAT,
YOU ROOKIE!

00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:51.654
EVERYBODY
MAKES MISTAKES, JOEY.

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:53.623
JUST TRY
NOT TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE.

00:09:53.623 --> 00:09:56.325
[LAUGHING]
YOU DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU?

00:09:56.325 --> 00:09:58.894
LITTLE JOEY'S ALREADY MADE
THE ONE FATAL MISTAKE

00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:00.630
THAT'S GONNA COST HIM
THIS ENTIRE DUEL,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.599
AND THAT WAS EVER
AGREEING TO THIS MATCH
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:05.801
EH-EH...

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:14.407
[GROWLS]

00:10:14.407 --> 00:10:16.842
HA! WITH YOUR
BABY DRAGON CRUSHED,

00:10:16.842 --> 00:10:20.413
MY 2-HEADED KING REX
CAN TERRORIZE THE FIELD
FOR THE REST OF THE MATCH.

00:10:20.413 --> 00:10:21.747
[GROWLS]
ALL RIGHT,

00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:23.182
MAYBE I DID SCREW UP,

00:10:23.182 --> 00:10:24.317
BUT I THINK
I STILL HAVE

00:10:24.317 --> 00:10:25.384
ONE MONSTER
IN MY HAND

00:10:25.384 --> 00:10:26.385
THAT CAN BEAT
THAT THING.

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:28.454
LEOGUN!

00:10:29.922 --> 00:10:32.491
[GROWLS]

00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:34.327
SHOW THAT
OVERGROWN IGUANA

00:10:34.327 --> 00:10:36.462
WHO THE REAL
KING OF BEASTS IS!

00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:38.731
HA HA HA!
YOU AMATEUR.

00:10:38.731 --> 00:10:40.132
SINCE WE'RE
ON A WILDERNESS FIELD,

00:10:40.132 --> 00:10:42.635
MY KING REX GETS
A NICE, FAT POWER BONUS.

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:45.504
TOUGH LUCK
FOR YOUR PUSSYCAT.

00:10:45.504 --> 00:10:46.839
FIELD BONUS?!

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:47.974
NOW HE TELLS ME!

00:10:47.974 --> 00:10:50.176
Rex: KING REX!
FOOT STOMP!

00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:54.313
OUCH!

00:10:54.313 --> 00:10:57.917
Rex, thinking:
THE QUICKER I BASH
THIS TENDERFOOT,

00:10:57.917 --> 00:11:00.920
THE SOONER I'LL GET
TO HAVE MY CHANCE
AT BEATING MAI.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.955
LET'S GO!
YOU'RE THE APPETIZER!

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.924
I WANNA GET ON
TO THE MAIN COURSE!

00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:07.026
I STILL GOT
PLENTY TO SERVE UP.

00:11:07.026 --> 00:11:08.527
THAT IS, IF I'VE
FINALLY FIGURED OUT

00:11:08.527 --> 00:11:10.896
HOW TO USE
THIS FIELD POWER BONUS
THING RIGHT.

00:11:10.896 --> 00:11:12.865
HERE GOES NOTHIN'.

00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:14.233
AXE RAIDER!

00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:18.738
HEY, HEY!

00:11:18.738 --> 00:11:20.640
HE GOT
THE POWER
BONUS.

00:11:23.142 --> 00:11:25.211
Joey: I DID IT!

00:11:25.211 --> 00:11:27.546
DON'T LET IT
GO TO YOUR HEAD!

00:11:27.546 --> 00:11:29.348
SWORD ARM OF DRAGON!

00:11:29.348 --> 00:11:32.785
CUT THAT AXE RAIDER
DOWN TO SIZE!

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:36.222
SWORD TAIL SLASH!

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.228
Joey, thinking:
THAT'S MY THIRD MONSTER
HE'S TRASHED.

00:11:42.228 --> 00:11:44.797
EVEN <i>WITH</i>
A FIELD POWER BONUS,
I CAN'T BEAT HIM.

00:11:44.797 --> 00:11:46.098
Téa: JOEY!

00:11:46.098 --> 00:11:48.934
DON'T LET
THAT DINO-DORK
INTIMIDATE YOU.

00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:50.736
REMEMBER, WE'RE ALL
RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

00:11:50.736 --> 00:11:51.937
[THINKING]
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:11:51.937 --> 00:11:53.906
THAT'S WHY YUGI
AND TRISTAN DITCHED ME.

00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.443
WHAT A NIMROD.

00:11:57.443 --> 00:11:58.844

BIG, DUMB...

00:12:00.212 --> 00:12:01.881

00:12:01.881 --> 00:12:02.882
YUGE?

00:12:02.882 --> 00:12:03.983
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

00:12:03.983 --> 00:12:05.451
YOU SHOULD BE
HELPING JOEY.

00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:06.752
JOEY MADE IT
PRETTY CLEAR

00:12:06.752 --> 00:12:08.354
HE DIDN'T WANT
MY HELP ON THIS ONE.

00:12:08.354 --> 00:12:09.388
AND SINCE YOU LEFT,

00:12:09.388 --> 00:12:11.123
I FIGURED MAYBE
I SHOULD, TOO.

00:12:11.123 --> 00:12:12.992
ME BEING THERE
AND YOU BEING THERE

00:12:12.992 --> 00:12:14.560
ARE 2 TOTALLY
DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.096
WITHOUT YOUR COACHING,
JOEY WON'T LAST 2 MINUTES

00:12:17.096 --> 00:12:19.632
AGAINST THAT CONNIVING
LITTLE FREAKASAURUS.

00:12:19.632 --> 00:12:21.400
I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE SAYS,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.103
YOU GOTTA GO BACK THERE
AND HELP HIM OUT PRONTO!

00:12:24.103 --> 00:12:25.304
I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:12:25.304 --> 00:12:27.273
JOEY NEEDS TO FIGHT
THIS DUEL ON HIS OWN,

00:12:27.273 --> 00:12:28.340
AND I GOTTA LET HIM.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.842
YUGI!

00:12:29.842 --> 00:12:32.411
IF I GO BACK
ON MY PROMISE
AND HELP JOEY,

00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:33.479
HE'LL BE DISQUALIFIED.

00:12:33.479 --> 00:12:34.880
BESIDES, WE'VE GOTTA
BELIEVE IN HIM

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.348
SO HE BELIEVES
IN HIMSELF.

00:12:36.348 --> 00:12:37.850
[MOANS]

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.351
YEAH, WELL...

00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:41.320
MAYBE I DON'T THINK
HE CAN WIN.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.688
BUT, TRISTAN,
THIS IS ABOUT

00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:45.324
SOMETHING MORE
IMPORTANT THAN
WINNING OR LOSING.

00:12:45.324 --> 00:12:46.625
THIS IS ABOUT JOEY
LEARNING TO BE

00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:48.928
A STRONG BIG BROTHER
FOR HIS LITTLE SISTER.

00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:50.463
AND EVEN THOUGH
HE DOESN'T NEED
OUR HELP,

00:12:50.463 --> 00:12:52.531
HE NEEDS TO KNOW
HE HAS OUR SUPPORT.

00:12:53.766 --> 00:12:55.568
I DON'T KNOW.

00:12:55.568 --> 00:12:58.104
[THINKING] MAYBE
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

00:12:58.104 --> 00:12:59.805
MAYBE THE ONLY WAY
TO HELP MY SISTER

00:12:59.805 --> 00:13:01.640
<i>WAS</i> BY RELYING
ON MY FRIENDS.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.642
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:13:03.642 --> 00:13:05.644
I CAN'T START
THINKING THAT WAY.

00:13:05.644 --> 00:13:07.346
IF I CAN'T RELY
ON MYSELF,

00:13:07.346 --> 00:13:10.082
HOW CAN I EXPECT
MY LITTLE SISTER TO?

00:13:10.082 --> 00:13:11.584
NOW THINK.

00:13:11.584 --> 00:13:14.386
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING IN THIS HAND
THAT I CAN PLAY.

00:13:14.386 --> 00:13:17.156
UHH! HAH!

00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:18.157
WAIT!

00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:20.159
I STILL HAVE
THIS TIME WIZARD.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:23.395
TOO BAD I DON'T HAVE
MY BABY DRAGON TO
PLAY IT WITH ANYMORE.

00:13:23.395 --> 00:13:25.097
OH, WELL, I GUESS
IT COULDN'T HURT

00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:26.599
TO PUT IT OUT
ON THE FIELD ANYWAY.

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:27.600
HERE GOES NOTHIN'.

00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:30.936
TIME WIZARD!

00:13:30.936 --> 00:13:33.939
Mai, thinking:
HMM. THAT'S THE CARD
JOEY BEAT <i>ME</i> WITH.

00:13:33.939 --> 00:13:35.441
I SHOULD WARN REX.

00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:36.442
RAPTOR,

00:13:36.442 --> 00:13:37.777
WATCH THAT TIME WIZARD.

00:13:37.777 --> 00:13:39.345
AH, WITHOUT YUGI'S HELP,

00:13:39.345 --> 00:13:41.180
THIS CHUMP DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.782
[THINKING]
I KNOW JOEY'S TYPE.

00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:44.750
HE'LL TRY AND PLAY
A MONSTER NEXT,

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.220
AND THEN HE'LL BE IN FOR
THE PREHISTORIC POUNDING
OF HIS LIFE.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.289
[THINKING]
MAYBE REX IS RIGHT.

00:13:50.289 --> 00:13:52.892
JOEY WAS ABLE TO DEFEAT
MY HARPY LADIES,

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:55.361
BUT ONLY BECAUSE YUGI
COACHED HIM THROUGH IT.
