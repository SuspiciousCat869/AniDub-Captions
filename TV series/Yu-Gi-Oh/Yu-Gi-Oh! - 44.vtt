AND WHAT CARD CAN
TURN BACK THE CLOCK, JOEY?

00:19:17.593 --> 00:19:18.694
OH.

00:19:18.694 --> 00:19:20.062
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:20.062 --> 00:19:23.032
THE ONE YOU GAVE ME
BEFORE PEGASUS'S
TOURNAMENT.

00:19:23.032 --> 00:19:24.900
THE TIME WIZARD.
IT CAN MAKE THINGS

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.469
LIKE THEY WERE
1,000 YEARS AGO.

00:19:26.469 --> 00:19:28.504
BUT...IF THE HANDS
LAND ON SKULLS,

00:19:28.504 --> 00:19:29.672
IT'LL TAKE
OUR LIFE POINTS.

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:31.007
WE'VE GOT
TO RISK IT.

00:19:31.007 --> 00:19:34.143
SETO AND MOKUBA'S
FUTURE HANG
IN THE BALANCE.

00:19:34.143 --> 00:19:35.511
MM-HMM.

00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:38.114
HERE GOES NOTHIN'.
COME ON, TIME WIZARD.

00:19:38.114 --> 00:19:40.983
TAKE THESE RUINS
BACK 1,000 YEARS!

00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:42.618
TIME MAGIC!

00:19:42.618 --> 00:19:44.220
Card: TIME MAGIC.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.490
Mai: SOMETHING'S
HAPPENING.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.524
OH!
OH!
OH!

00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:52.928
Yugi: JOEY!
I THINK IT'S WORKING!

00:19:52.928 --> 00:19:55.765
THE RUINS...THEY'RE
REBUILDING THEMSELVES!

00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:58.200
Yugi: NO, JOEY.
TIME'S REBUILDING THEM.

00:20:01.537 --> 00:20:03.939
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING!

00:20:03.939 --> 00:20:05.708
UHHH!
UHHH!

00:20:06.842 --> 00:20:07.843
OH!
OH!
OH!

00:20:07.843 --> 00:20:09.512
Mai: OLD SIN LAU...

00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:11.580
IT'S...IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.516
AHH...
IT DIDN'T WORK.

00:20:14.684 --> 00:20:15.851
[RUMBLING]

00:20:15.851 --> 00:20:17.019
HUH?
AAH!

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:19.488
Yugi: I THINK YOU SPOKE
TOO SOON, JOEY!

00:20:19.488 --> 00:20:22.124
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING...
BUT WHAT?

00:20:22.124 --> 00:20:24.060
OHHH...

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.127
OH...

00:20:25.127 --> 00:20:26.562
OHH! OHH!
OHH! OHH!
WHOA! OH!

00:20:26.562 --> 00:20:27.730
YES!

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.964
Tristan:
I CAN'T HOLD 'EM.

00:20:28.964 --> 00:20:31.667
TéA, WE'RE
IN BIG TROUBLE HERE.

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:32.668
UNHH!

00:20:32.668 --> 00:20:35.604
WE'VE GOT TO HANG ON!
YUGI!

00:20:35.604 --> 00:20:37.840
COME BACK SOON...

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.510
OR YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO COME BACK AT ALL!
