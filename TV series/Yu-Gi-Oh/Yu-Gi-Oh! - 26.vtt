TRAP?

00:14:51.962 --> 00:14:55.766
I PLAYED A CARD FACE DOWN.
DON'T YOUR REMEMBER?

00:14:55.766 --> 00:14:58.802
IT'S CALLED PROPHECY,
AND IT GIVES ME THE RIGHT

00:14:58.802 --> 00:15:00.837
TO GUESS WHETHER THE CARD
YOU'RE ABOUT TO PLAY

00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:03.974
HAS AN ATTACK POWER
HIGHER OR LOWER THAN 2,000.

00:15:03.974 --> 00:15:06.276
AND IF I MANAGE TO GUESS
CORRECTLY, KAIBA BOY,

00:15:06.276 --> 00:15:09.546
THEN THE CARD IN QUESTION
BECOMES MINE.

00:15:09.546 --> 00:15:11.081
WHAT?
YOU CAN'T JUST--

00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:15.819
AND I THINK I'LL PROPHESIZE
THAT IT IS INDEED OVER 2,OOO.

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:17.254
OHHH!

00:15:17.254 --> 00:15:20.424
BUT, WAIT. WAIT.
SOMETHING ELSE IS COMING.

00:15:20.424 --> 00:15:22.859
YES. YES. I SEE BLUE.

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:24.061
I SEE WHITE!

00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:26.697
COULD IT BE?
YES! OF COURSE!

00:15:26.697 --> 00:15:30.567
I SEE THE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON!

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:32.002
UHHHHH!

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:34.271
WAS I RIGHT?

00:15:34.271 --> 00:15:35.739
TELL ME I WAS RIGHT.

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:39.042
I WAS RIGHT, RIGHT?
I SO HOPE I WAS RIGHT.

00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:40.911
ENOUGH! HERE! TAKE IT!

00:15:41.912 --> 00:15:44.481
[CHUCKLES PLAYFULLY]
HMM.

00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:47.517
NOW THE MOST VALUABLE CARD
IN YOUR DECK IS MINE.

00:15:47.517 --> 00:15:49.052
[THINKING]
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

00:15:49.052 --> 00:15:51.254
THERE'S NO WAY
HE COULD'VE SEEN
MY BLUE EYES

00:15:51.254 --> 00:15:52.522
BEFORE I PLAYED IT.

00:15:52.522 --> 00:15:54.791
HOW DID HE KNOW?

00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:57.394
PEGASUS MUST BE UP
TO HIS OLD TRICKS.

00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:58.395
YOU GOT
<i>THAT</i> RIGHT.

00:15:58.395 --> 00:15:59.896
[THINKING]
HE MUST BE USING

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:01.932
HIS MILLENNIUM EYE
TO LOOK AT KAIBA'S
CARDS,

00:16:01.932 --> 00:16:03.800
JUST LIKE HE DID
WITH ME.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.303
POOR KAIBA. EVEN
HIS GREAT SKILLS

00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:08.739
DON'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST PEGASUS'
POWERS.

00:16:08.739 --> 00:16:11.008
NOW I HAVE 2 THINGS
YOU CARE ABOUT, KAIBA--

00:16:11.008 --> 00:16:13.977
YOUR DRAGON
<i>AND</i> YOUR BROTHER.
[CHUCKLES PLAYFULLY]

00:16:13.977 --> 00:16:16.913
HMM. LET'S SEE
WHAT ELSE I CAN TAKE.

00:16:16.913 --> 00:16:19.349
AFTER YOUR TURN,
OF COURSE.

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:22.386
WITHOUT MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON,

00:16:22.386 --> 00:16:24.221
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO SWITCH
MY MONSTER

00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:25.222
TO DEFENSE MODE.

00:16:25.222 --> 00:16:27.658
GOODY. NOW
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN.

00:16:27.658 --> 00:16:31.128
[THINKING] HMM.
KAIBA LOOKS SO ANXIOUS.

00:16:31.128 --> 00:16:32.462
I WONDER WHY.

00:16:32.462 --> 00:16:34.631
PERHAPS I SHOULD LOOK
INTO THE MATTER.

00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:35.866
[WHIRRING SOUND]

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:39.236
YES. LET'S LOOK
AT WHAT CARDS HE'S HOLDING.

00:16:44.207 --> 00:16:46.209
AH. A VIRUS CARD, EH?

00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:49.212
AND SAGGI
THE DARK CLOWN.
I SEE.

00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:50.814
YOU'RE PLANNING
TO CONTAMINATE MY DECK

00:16:50.814 --> 00:16:52.883
BY USING THOSE TWO
IN A COMBO ATTACK.

00:16:52.883 --> 00:16:55.485
BRILLIANT. AND NORMALLY
A MOVE LIKE THAT

00:16:55.485 --> 00:16:58.555
WOULD CLINCH
THE MATCH FOR YOU.
BUT NOT TODAY, KAIBA...

00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.224
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU TRY
AND MAKE THAT MOVE ON ME,

00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:04.327
I'LL HAVE A LITTLE
SOMETHING OF MY OWN
WAITING FOR YOU.

00:17:04.327 --> 00:17:05.562
HA HA HA HA!

00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:07.898
I'LL LAY ONE CARD
FACE DOWN ON THE FIELD

00:17:07.898 --> 00:17:10.701
AND ONE MONSTER
FACE DOWN IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:13.637
AND I'M AFRAID
THAT'S THE BEST MOVE

00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:14.971
THAT I COULD
COME UP WITH.

00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:16.907
MY TURN!

00:17:16.907 --> 00:17:20.610
[THINKING] AND MY CHANCE
TO FINISH THIS DUEL
IN ONE MOVE!

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.679
COMBO ATTACK!

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:25.148
[THINKING]
INFECTING SAGGI
WITH THIS CRUSH CARD

00:17:25.148 --> 00:17:26.516
AND THEN
HAVING HIM ATTACK

00:17:26.516 --> 00:17:28.685
WILL SPREAD A VIRUS
THROUGH PEGASUS' DECK.

00:17:28.685 --> 00:17:31.521
EVERY MONSTER HE HAS
WITH OVER
1,500 ATTACK POINTS

00:17:31.521 --> 00:17:33.590
WILL BE DISEASE-RIDDEN
AND USELESS.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.625
WAIT. I REMEMBER
THIS MOVE.

00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:37.994
YEAH.
IT'S THE SAME THING
KAIBA USED ON YUGI

00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:39.262
IN <i>THEIR</i> DUEL.

00:17:39.262 --> 00:17:42.065
BUT THIS TIME, PEGASUS
IS GONNA CATCH THE BUG.

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:43.734
Yugi: DON'T COUNT ON IT.
HUH?
HUH?

00:17:43.734 --> 00:17:46.136
PEGASUS KNOWS
THAT IT'S COMING!

00:17:46.136 --> 00:17:48.138
SINCE YOU JUST PLAYED
YOUR CRUSH CARD,

00:17:48.138 --> 00:17:51.074
I THINK NOW WOULD BE
AN OPPORTUNE TIME
TO ACTIVATE THIS.

00:17:51.074 --> 00:17:52.242
HUH?

00:17:52.242 --> 00:17:54.177
NEGATIVE ENERGY!

00:17:54.177 --> 00:17:56.379
IT DOUBLES YOUR CLOWN'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:17:56.379 --> 00:17:58.782
AND SINCE THE CRUSH CARD
CAN ONLY BE HOSTED

00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:01.084
BY MONSTERS WITH LESS
THAN 1,000 POINTS,

00:18:01.084 --> 00:18:05.455
MY MAGIC MAKES
SAGGI THE DARK CLOWN
TOO STRONG FOR THE JOB.

00:18:05.455 --> 00:18:08.058
SO SORRY.
HAH HAH HAH HAH!

00:18:08.058 --> 00:18:10.460
[THINKING] HE HAD
THE PERFECT DEFENSE
ALL SET UP

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.162
BEFORE I EVEN ATTACKED.

00:18:12.162 --> 00:18:13.497
BUT HOW?

00:18:13.497 --> 00:18:16.333
OH, WHAT'S WRONG, KAIBA?
YOU LOOK SO SAD.

00:18:16.333 --> 00:18:19.302
KEEP YOUR CHIN UP.
I'M SURE IT WAS
JUST A LUCKY MOVE

00:18:19.302 --> 00:18:20.804
ON MY PART.

00:18:20.804 --> 00:18:23.006
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY, KAIBA...

00:18:23.006 --> 00:18:26.543
IT'S BETTER TO BE LUCKY
THAN GOOD. HA HA HA HA!

00:18:26.543 --> 00:18:27.944
AH! TALK ABOUT LUCK.

00:18:27.944 --> 00:18:29.346

AND THANKS
TO MY DARK ENERGY

00:18:31.047 --> 00:18:32.382
HE'S TWICE AS STRONG.

[GASPS]

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.352
BUT I'M SURE
HE'S STILL NO MATCH

00:18:35.352 --> 00:18:37.487
FOR YOUR STALWART CLOWN.

HAH HAH HAH--
UH--OH...HO HO...

YAAAHH!

OH, MY!
OH...
OHHH...
HUH?

00:18:46.897 --> 00:18:49.733
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT
A RABBIT PUNCH
WAS A WIMPY MOVE.

00:18:49.733 --> 00:18:52.068
I'VE NEVER SEEN KAIBA
SO SHAKEN BEFORE.

00:18:53.236 --> 00:18:54.538
THIS IS BAD.

00:18:54.538 --> 00:18:55.806

JUST STARTED,

00:18:55.806 --> 00:18:58.275

1,000 LIFE POINTS BEHIND!

LIKE A NOVICE.
