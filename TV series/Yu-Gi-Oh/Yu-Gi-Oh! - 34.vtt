WHERE FATE INTERVENES

00:07:51.271 --> 00:07:52.272
WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT,

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:54.474
WITH CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN
TURN YOUR WORLD UPSIDE DOWN.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:59.346
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'VE ETCHED THE PERFECT
PORTRAIT OF YOUR FUTURE

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.581
AND YOUR LIFE
COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER--

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:04.150
JUST WHEN YOU LET DOWN
YOUR GUARD AT LAST

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:06.386
AND OPEN YOUR HEART--

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.155
WHEN, AGAINST ALL ODDS,
YOU'VE FOUND THAT ONE
SPECIAL PERSON

00:08:11.124 --> 00:08:13.126
IN ALL THE WORLD THAT
FILLS YOUR HEART WITH JOY,

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.096
THE PERSON YOU KNOW
YOU ARE DESTINED TO SPEND

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.531
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH--

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:19.499
THAT'S WHEN TRAGEDY STRIKES,

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.536
WHEN FATE HITS YOU
WITH A COLD SLAP OF REALITY

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:25.372
AND SHOWS YOU WHO'S BOSS.

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:27.240
YES, THE WORLD
HAS TAUGHT ME

00:08:28.475 --> 00:08:30.076
THAT ONLY THE STRONG
AND THE RUTHLESS SURVIVE.

00:08:31.745 --> 00:08:33.146
IN MEMORY OF ALL
I HAVE LOST,

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:34.948
I FIGHT ON
WITH ALL I POSSESS,

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:36.750
AND I INTEND TO WIN!

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:39.786
I'M NOT GONNA MISS
THIS TIME, YUGI.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.921
I'M GONNA BLAST
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:44.691
DRAGON, ATTACK...
THE HAT ON THE FAR LEFT.

00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:47.527
GO NOW! MOLTEN FIREBALL.

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:50.296
[ROARS]

HEH HEH HEH.

00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:08.548
HUH?

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:12.218
YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP--
SPELLBINDING CIRCLE.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.755
THAT DROPPED MY SKULL'S
ATTACK POINTS.

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.724
NOW HE'S VULNERABLE
TO AN ATTACK.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.693
I CAN'T RISK BOTH MY MONSTERS.
GAROOZIS, DEFENSE MODE.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.697
NOW YOU'RE ON THE DEFENSIVE,
AND IT'S A NICE CHANGE.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.332
UHH...

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:27.333
YUGI'S SPELLBINDING CIRCLE

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.335
HAS WIPED OUT
JOEY'S ATTACK ADVANTAGE.

00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:32.305
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT,
BUT IT'S STILL
A CLOSE MATCH.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:33.706
YOU SAID IT.

00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:35.608
YUGI COULD ATTACK
WITH THE DARK MAGICIAN,

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.511
BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD THAT
ATTACK REALLY DO HIM?

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:41.714
BOTH THE DARK MAGICIAN
AND THE SKULL DRAGON HAVE
EQUAL ATTACK STRENGTHS.

00:09:43.216 --> 00:09:45.618
AS STRONG
AS THEY ARE, A BATTLE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.187
WOULD JUST RESULT
IN A STANDOFF.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.254
A STALEMATE, HUH?

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.591
SOMEHOW, ONE OF THEM IS GOING
TO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:53.326
TO TIP THINGS IN THEIR FAVOR.

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:54.060
HMM...

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:56.930
[THINKING] YUGI'S THE TOUGHEST
OPPONENT I'VE EVER FACED.

00:09:58.631 --> 00:09:59.432
BUT I'LL BEAT HIM!

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.235
[THINKING] JOEY'S REALLY LEARNED
A LOT THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:03.770
HE PLAYS LIKE A PRO.

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:05.305
BUT IN THE DUEL
AGAINST PEGASUS,

00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:07.240
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN
AN EXPERT DUELIST.

00:10:07.907 --> 00:10:09.909
IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE
WHO CAN ALSO STAND UP

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.478
TO THE POWER OF HIS
MILLENNIUM ITEM.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:12.979
JOEY, YOU'VE DUELED WELL,

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.382
BUT THE TIDE OF THIS BATTLE
IS ABOUT TO TURN.

00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:18.151
[THINKING]
MOST IMPRESSIVE.

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:20.386
DESPITE THE BOND
THAT THESE TWO SHARE,

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:23.323
MY MILLENNIUM EYE TELLS ME
THAT THEY ARE INDEED

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.692
DUELING EACH OTHER WITH
EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.761
[THINKING] WITH MY
GRANDPA'S SOUL AT STAKE,

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.064
I REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE.
I HAVE TO WIN THIS.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.032
ALL RIGHT, JOEY!
PREPARE YOURSELF.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.602
I'M GOING TO OBLITERATE
YOUR DRAGON.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:38.738
YOU WHAT? I'M READY FOR YOU.
BRING IT ON.

00:10:39.973 --> 00:10:41.741

00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:43.810

00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:44.811
EHH?

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.180
THIS IS IT, JOEY.
THE CARD I DREW

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:51.217
WILL VANQUISH
YOUR SKULL DRAGON
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:54.954
THE BOOK OF SECRET ARTS.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:10.003
I PLAY THE BOOK
OF SECRET ARTS!

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.538
OHH...

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:13.306
AND WITH ITS ANCIENT MAGIC,

00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:17.310
MY DARK MAGICIAN BECOMES
300 ATTACK POINTS STRONGER.

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:23.516
GO, DARK MAGICIAN!

00:11:25.218 --> 00:11:27.854
ATTACK THE BLACK
SKULL DRAGON!

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:34.494
JOEY, BLACK SKULL IS BEATEN.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:37.363
YUNH.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:38.364
EXCELLENT WORK, YUGI-BOY.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.767
YOU TOOK OUT HIS
VERY BEST MONSTER.

00:11:41.234 --> 00:11:42.235
OHH...

00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.673
[THINKING] MAN, I WAS COUNTING
ON THAT BLACK SKULL DRAGON

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.208
TO WIN THIS DUEL.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:49.742
NOW, NOT ONLY IS HE GONE,

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.911
BUT I GOT A SOUPED-UP
DARK MAGICIAN TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.846
[THINKING] JOEY'S KEPT ME
DOWN ALL MATCH LONG,

00:11:55.582 --> 00:11:56.983
BUT NOW I FINALLY
HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.

00:11:58.418 --> 00:12:00.687
NOT ONLY IS MY DARK MAGICIAN
300 POINTS STRONGER THAN NORMAL,

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:05.858
BUT HE'S READY TO SHOW OFF
A FEW HIDDEN POWERS, TOO.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.361
POOR JOEY. HE REALLY
GOT SLAMMED THERE.

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:11.764
YOU THINK THIS DUEL'S
OVER FOR HIM?

00:12:12.265 --> 00:12:13.866
WELL, IT DEPENDS ON
WHAT HE DOES NEXT.

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:15.301
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:12:15.802 --> 00:12:17.604
LOSING THAT BLACK SKULL DRAGON
WAS A HEAVY LOSS,

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:19.739
BUT NOT A CRITICAL ONE.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.507
IF JOEY COULD JUST
PULL HIMSELF TOGETHER,

00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:23.843
HE CAN STILL WIN THIS DUEL.

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:27.146
[THINKING] EHH, HOW COULD I GO
FROM TOP OF THE HEAP

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.482
TO DOWN IN THE DUMPS
IN ONE TURN?

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:30.783
NEVER GONNA WIN NOW.

FOR EACH OTHER.

MUST BE THE TIME WIZARD.

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:05.398
SO CROSS YOUR FINGERS
AND GET SET TO ADJUST
YOUR CLOCKS,

00:16:06.666 --> 00:16:11.304
BECAUSE HERE IT COMES--
GO, TIME ROULETTE.

00:16:23.249 --> 00:16:24.050
COME ON, TIME WARP!

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.252
[THINKING] OHH...

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:33.226
ALL RIGHT. JACKPOT.

00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:34.894
HMM.

00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.029
GO, TIME WARP.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:41.968
[ROARS]

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.238
UNH...

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:46.239
SORRY, YUGE,

00:16:46.606 --> 00:16:47.807
BUT I'M AFRAID
MY TIME WARP

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.076
HAS MADE DARK MAGICIAN
A SICKLY OLD MAN.

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:52.445
LOOK AT THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.580
HE'S AGED, LIKE,
A THOUSAND YEARS.

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:56.349
HE'S NO MATCH
FOR JOEY'S DRAGON.

00:16:56.983 --> 00:16:57.650
HMM...

00:16:58.918 --> 00:16:59.585
[GROANS]

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.022
[THINKING] ALL RIGHT.
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT.

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.726
THIS IS IT.
I'M REALLY GONNA DO IT.

00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:10.496
ALL I GOTTA DO IS ATTACK,

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:12.798
AND I'LL HAVE ACTUALLY
BEAT YUGI!

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.034
I'M GONNA WIN! ATTACK!

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:19.272
NOXIOUS NOSTRIL GUST.

00:17:21.307 --> 00:17:24.110
I COUNTER WITH MAKIU,
THE MAGICAL MIST.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.580
HUH? MY ATTACK'S
GETTING SMOTHERED.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:31.217
OHH.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.385
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:35.254
HOW DID YOU PLAY MAKIU
WHILE IT WAS STILL MY TURN?

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:36.889
WITH MAGIC.

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.525
A MAGIC SO POWERFUL THAT
IT TOOK MY DARK MAGICIAN

00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:41.227
A THOUSAND YEARS
TO LEARN IT.

00:17:41.761 --> 00:17:42.428
SAY WHAT?

00:17:42.929 --> 00:17:44.530
THAT TIME WARP DID AGE
MY DARK MAGICIAN.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.033
BUT IT MADE HIM STRONGER,
NOT WEAKER.

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:50.369
AND WITH AGE
COMES GREAT WISDOM.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:53.906
A THOUSAND YEARS OF WISDOM
THAT HAVE TRANSFORMED HIM
INTO...

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:56.275
THE DARK SAGE!

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:58.878
OHH...

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:00.613
AN ULTIMATE MAGICIAN
WHOSE NEW POWERS

00:18:01.814 --> 00:18:04.216
LET ME PLAY
ONE MAGIC CARD DURING
EVERY ONE OF YOUR TURNS

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:05.985
AND EVERY ONE OF MINE.

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.654
AND THE MAGIC CARD I CHOSE
TO COUNTER YOUR ATTACK:

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:10.456
MAKIU, THE MAGICAL MIST.

00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:13.125
WITH ITS ENCHANTED
RAINFALL UPON THE FIELD,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.261
YOUR DRAGON'S SMOKE STREAM
WAS NEUTRALIZED

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:17.430
BEFORE IT REACHED MY MAGE.

00:18:18.164 --> 00:18:18.831
[ALL GASP]

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.367
NOW I INVOKE HIS POWERS
FOR MY TURN

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.570
AND DRAW THIS MAGIC CARD.

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:30.810
YOU FOUGHT A VALIANT DUEL,
MY FRIEND,

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.879
AND THIS IS THE HARDEST MOVE
I'VE EVER HAD TO MAKE.

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.648
BUT THIS ENDS NOW.

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.149
AAH!

00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:40.186
I PLAY MONSTER REBORN AND
CALL THE BLACK SKULL DRAGON

00:18:42.021 --> 00:18:42.822
BACK FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:44.156
[ROARS]

00:18:45.057 --> 00:18:46.926
THEN IT'S OVER.

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:52.465
YUGI, GO FOR IT. IT'S COOL.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.237
ALL RIGHT.
BLACK SKULL DRAGON...

00:19:00.139 --> 00:19:03.342
MOLTEN FIREBALL ATTACK.

00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.579
[ALL GASP]

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:20.926
I TELL YA,
THAT WAS REALLY
TOUGH TO WATCH.

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:25.731
YEAH. JUST IMAGINE HOW
THOSE TWO MUST BE FEELING.

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:27.933
(CRYING)
I'M JUST GLAD IT'S OVER.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.502
AND I'M SO PROUD OF THEM BOTH.

00:19:30.202 --> 00:19:31.003
THEY DUELED THEIR HARDEST,

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.372
BUT NEVER ONCE FORGOT
THEIR FRIENDSHIP.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.342
[THINKING] HMM. WELL,
TOUCHING AS THAT MAY BE,

00:19:37.743 --> 00:19:39.545
YOU REALLY OUGHT TO SAVE
YOUR TEARS, LITTLE GIRL.

00:19:40.813 --> 00:19:42.014
AFTER ALL, YOU'LL
BE NEEDING THEM

00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.618
ONCE I FACE YUGI
IN THE DUELING ARENA.

00:19:49.155 --> 00:19:51.157
WELL, YUGI, WE KNEW ONE OF US
HAD TO LOSE.

00:19:51.657 --> 00:19:54.260
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT
ONE OF US GOT TO WIN, TOO.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:56.095
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
HERE, THIS IS YOURS NOW.

00:19:58.097 --> 00:19:58.764
HUH?

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.332
GO AHEAD, IT'S ALL YOURS.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.068
YOU SHOW CROQUET THIS CARD,

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.770
AND HE'LL GIVE YOU
3 MILLION BUCKS IN PRIZE MONEY.

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.406
NO, JOEY.
YOU SHOULD KEEP IT.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.341
YOUR SISTER
NEEDS THAT MONEY.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:10.543
YUGE.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.312
I DIDN'T ENTER
INTO THIS TOURNAMENT
TO GET RICH, JOEY.

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.581
I'M JUST
HERE TO SAVE MY GRANDPA
AND THE KAIBA BROTHERS.

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:18.317
PLEASE, USE THIS MONEY
FOR SERENITY'S OPERATION.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:20.553
REALLY?

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:21.987
YUGI.

00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:24.390
WHAT DO YOU SAY, JOEY?

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:26.058
HEY, IT'S WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN
WANTING, BUDDY.

00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.429
LOOK AT HIM, ALWAYS PLAYING
THE TOUGH GUY. HUH?

00:20:33.065 --> 00:20:34.266
YUGI, WHEN I LOST THE DUEL,

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:37.269
I LOST ALL HOPE
OF SAVING MY SISTER.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:38.871
BUT NOW...YUGI, THANK YOU.

00:20:41.474 --> 00:20:43.843
NOW GO AND TAKE DOWN
PEGASUS.
