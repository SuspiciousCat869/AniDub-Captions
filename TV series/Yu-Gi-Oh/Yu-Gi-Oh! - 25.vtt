00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.653
TOTALLY. LET'S GO.

00:07:11.653 --> 00:07:13.488
IT'S TIME TO DUEL.

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.559
YUGI'S STILL LOST
IN HIS OWN HEAD.

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.194
Tristan: WELL, MAYBE
A LITTLE DUEL ACTION

00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:21.563
WILL SNAP HIM OUT OF IT.

00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:23.298
ALL RIGHT, MAI.

00:07:23.298 --> 00:07:25.133
I'M PLAYING
THE PETITE ANGEL

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:26.267
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.804
[SQUEAKS]

00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:31.606
WHAT IS THAT?

00:07:31.606 --> 00:07:34.309
COME ON, TéA!
THAT IS NOT FUNNY!

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:35.977
[CHUCKLES]

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:38.546
I PLAY HARPIE LADY.

00:07:38.546 --> 00:07:40.315
ATTACK MODE!

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.550
[SHRIEKS]

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.219
[SQUEAKS]

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:45.553
Téa: UH...

00:07:45.553 --> 00:07:48.523
Mai: AND I'LL
LAY THIS, TOO, FACE DOWN.

00:07:48.523 --> 00:07:49.991
RIGHT. UM...

00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:50.992
ATTACK!
HUH?

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.795
[SQUEAKS]

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:56.898
WHOA!
THAT WAS CLOSE.

00:08:00.335 --> 00:08:01.336
[ALL GASP]

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:03.838
[SQUEAKS]
AAH!

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:05.173
[TREMBLES]

00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:07.141
YOU KNOW, TéA, IF
YOU'RE TREMBLING WITH FEAR

00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:08.843
AFTER JUST THE FIRST ROUND,

00:08:08.843 --> 00:08:10.745
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
QUIT RIGHT HERE.

00:08:10.745 --> 00:08:12.847
UGH. NO WAY, MAI.

00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:14.749
I'M IN IT TO WIN IT.

00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:17.185
GO, FAIRY'S GIFT!

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.723
UGH! ANOTHER
OF THESE CUTESY CARDS.

00:08:21.723 --> 00:08:24.826
COME ON, WHAT ARE WE HAVING,
A DUEL OR A PAGEANT?

00:08:24.826 --> 00:08:25.827
HMM!

00:08:25.827 --> 00:08:27.328
HMM? HUH?

00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:29.330
WABOKU?

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.533
[THINKING]
OH, I REMEMBER THIS.

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:34.035
IT'S A TRAP CARD,
A POWERFUL ONE.

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.170
IF ONLY I COULD REMEMBER
WHAT IT DOES!

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.672
THINK, TéA, THINK!

00:08:37.672 --> 00:08:40.909
HMM. I JUST
BETTER FIGURE IT OUT
BEFORE I REALLY NEED IT.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.910
THIS, TOO!
HUH?

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.946
FACE DOWN!

00:08:44.946 --> 00:08:45.947
HMM!

00:08:46.948 --> 00:08:48.750
OK. A ROCKY START,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.652
BUT I THINK
TéA'S BACK ON TRACK.

00:08:50.652 --> 00:08:52.253
I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT, JOEY.

00:08:52.253 --> 00:08:54.556
EVERYTHING IS
RIDING ON THIS DUEL.

00:08:55.757 --> 00:08:57.258
GO, FAIRY'S GIFT!

00:08:57.258 --> 00:08:59.961
ATTACK WITH
ENCHANTED DUST!

00:09:01.963 --> 00:09:04.198
[THINKING]
WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:06.768
MY FAIRY'S
ATTACK POWER IS HIGHER
THAN THAT HARPIE'S.

00:09:06.768 --> 00:09:08.670
IT SHOULD
BE TAKING HER DOWN!

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.005
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:12.006
BUT WHAT?

00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:13.007
OHH!

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.012
OH, NO!

00:09:18.012 --> 00:09:19.981
SORRY, HON,

00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.584
BUT I ACTIVATED
MY MAGIC CARD--

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:25.186
THE ROSE WHIP,
A PERSONAL FAVORITE.

00:09:25.186 --> 00:09:28.356
IT GIVES MY HARPIE
300 EXTRA ATTACK POINTS.

00:09:28.356 --> 00:09:29.390
UH...

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.825
MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO DEFEND HER

00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:32.360
FROM YOUR SILLY
PIXIE DUST

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.796
AND TAKE OUT
YOUR FAIRY AS WELL.

00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:36.364
UGGHH.

00:09:40.663 --> 00:09:42.799
[THINKING] TOO LATE
TO CALL OFF MY FAIRY'S
ATTACK NOW.

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:44.367
I JUST HAVE TO HOPE
FOR THE BEST.

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.337
NOW, MY HARPIE LADY,
WHIPLASH ATTACK!

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:54.844
AAH!

00:09:59.549 --> 00:10:00.516
HOW ABOUT THAT?

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:02.518
YOUR FAIRY TURNED TO DUST!

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:03.519
[GROANS]

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.554
CLEVER MOVE.

00:10:04.554 --> 00:10:05.588
Joey and Tristan:
HUH?

00:10:05.588 --> 00:10:07.123
MAI TRICKED TéA
INTO ATTACKING

00:10:07.123 --> 00:10:09.759
BY MAKING HER THINK
THAT HER FAIRY
HAD THE MOST POINTS,

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:11.227
BUT WHAT
MAI DIDN'T REVEAL

00:10:11.227 --> 00:10:12.729
UNTIL AFTER
TéA ATTACKED

00:10:12.729 --> 00:10:14.030
WAS THAT
SHE HAD A MAGIC CARD

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.065
WAITING TO POWER UP
HER HARPIE LADY.

00:10:16.065 --> 00:10:18.601
ANOTHER
MISTAKE LIKE THAT,
AND IT'S ALL OVER.

00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:21.838
IF YOU HAD ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY
UP AGAINST, TéA,

00:10:21.838 --> 00:10:24.173
YOU'D CALL IT QUITS
RIGHT NOW.

00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:26.676
THIS ISN'T GOING
TO GET ANY EASIER, YOU KNOW.

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:29.645
JUST GIVE UP AND
GO BACK TO CHEERLEADING!

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:32.248
NO. I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YUGI DOWN, MAI.

00:10:32.248 --> 00:10:35.618
PLEASE. IF THIS IS THE START
OF SOME FRIENDSHIP RANT,

00:10:35.618 --> 00:10:36.786
JUST SAVE IT.

00:10:36.786 --> 00:10:38.921
I'VE HEARD ALL
YOUR LAME SPEECHES BEFORE,

00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:41.491
AND FROM THAT LOOK
ON YUGI'S FACE,

00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:45.228
I'D SAY HE HAS, TOO.
HA HA HA.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:46.562
TAKE THAT BACK!

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:48.030
COME ON, ADMIT IT!

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.732
EVERYONE SEES
HOW SCARED YOU ARE.

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.733
[GROANS]

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.101
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE GIRL

00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:54.604
WHO'S ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLED
INTO THE BIG LEAGUES,

00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:56.973
BUT WHATEVER.
YOU'LL LEARN THE HARD WAY.

00:10:56.973 --> 00:10:58.207
UGGGHHH.

00:10:58.207 --> 00:11:00.443
[SLY LAUGH] HMM.

00:11:00.443 --> 00:11:02.111
HARPIE'S FEATHER DUSTER.

00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:04.647
MY TURN, HON,

00:11:04.647 --> 00:11:06.249
AND I'M PLAYING THIS,

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.216
FACE DOWN.

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:08.785
[THINKING]
FACE DOWN AGAIN?

00:11:08.785 --> 00:11:10.720
I HATE IT
WHEN SHE DOES THAT.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.222
MAKES IT HARD TO KNOW
WHAT TO PLAY NEXT.

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:14.590
SHINING FRIENDSHIP.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.260
HEY!
THAT'S LIKE ALL OF US.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.296
WE'RE ALL
IN THIS TOGETHER.

00:11:20.296 --> 00:11:24.033
BOY, I WISH
THIS CARD WAS AS STRONG
AS OUR REAL FRIENDSHIP,

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:25.701
THEN IT WOULD BE
ABLE TO BEAT ANYTHING.

00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:28.871
[SIGHS] IT WOULD
HAVE JOEY'S COURAGE,

00:11:28.871 --> 00:11:29.972
TRISTAN'S SPIRIT,

00:11:29.972 --> 00:11:32.141
AND YUGI'S HEART.

00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:33.242
YOU CAN DO IT, TéA.

00:11:33.242 --> 00:11:35.011
Tristan:
WE'RE WITH YOU.
GO, TéA.

00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:36.979
YUGI.

00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:38.147
ARE YOU WITH ME?

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:39.515
[GROANS]

00:11:41.818 --> 00:11:45.154
[THINKING] MAYBE
THIS CARD IS AS STRONG
AS OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:48.624
WELL,
THERE'S REALLY ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.893
SHINING FRIENDSHIP
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:54.664
YOU KEPT ME WAITING
ALL THIS TIME

00:11:54.664 --> 00:11:56.165
FOR THAT
LITTLE BUTTERBALL?

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:57.166
FINE, THEN!

00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:00.169
HARPIE LADY!
WHIPLASH ATTACK!

00:12:02.205 --> 00:12:04.307
NOT SO FAST, MAI.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:05.708
I PLACED A TRAP,

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:07.410
AND I REMEMBER NOW
WHAT IT DOES,

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.378
SO I'M
ACTIVATING WABOKU!

00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:10.379
Mai: WABOKU!

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:11.481
THAT'S RIGHT!

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.583
AND WABOKU REDUCES
THE ATTACK POINTS

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.485
OF MY OPPONENT'S
CREATURES TO ZERO,

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:17.420
SO MY SHINING FRIENDSHIP
IS UNHARMED.

00:12:19.956 --> 00:12:21.891
I THINK I TAUGHT
TéA THAT MOVE.

00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:23.092
YEAH...

00:12:23.092 --> 00:12:25.294
IF BY TEACHING
YOU MEAN "GETTING SCHOOLED"

00:12:25.294 --> 00:12:26.996
EVERY TIME
SHE BEAT YOU WITH IT.

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:28.965
WATCH IT.

00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:29.966
YOU'RE RIGHT, MAI,

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:31.467
MAYBE I AM
SCARED UP HERE

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:33.803
DUELING YOU FOR SUCH
INCREDIBLY HIGH STAKES.

00:12:33.803 --> 00:12:35.771
BUT THIS CARD
REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING

00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:38.307
THAT HELPS ME
FACE THAT FEAR--

00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:39.542
MY FRIENDS.

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:42.345
AND I KNOW WITH ALL
OF THEM BACKING ME UP,

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.313
I WILL WIN!

00:12:44.313 --> 00:12:45.681
HMM?

00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:49.085
IT'S LIKE THE CARD SAYS:
SHINING FRIENDSHIP.

00:12:49.085 --> 00:12:50.920
NO MATTER HOW DARK
THINGS MAY GET,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.855
THE SPECIAL BOND
I SHARE WITH MY FRIENDS

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.825
WILL ALWAYS FIND
A WAY TO SHINE THROUGH.

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:56.993
I MAY BE SCARED,

00:12:56.993 --> 00:12:59.161
BUT THAT FEAR WON'T
KEEP ME FROM DUELING

00:12:59.161 --> 00:13:01.230
OR FROM HELPING YUGI

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.267
OR FROM
WINNING THIS DUEL!

00:13:04.267 --> 00:13:07.603
YUGI, IS ANY OF THIS STUFF
GETTING THROUGH TO YOU?

00:13:07.603 --> 00:13:08.804
DON'T YOU SEE?

00:13:08.804 --> 00:13:10.773
TéA'S PUTTING HERSELF
ON THE LINE FOR YOU.

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:12.341
Bakura: EVEN THOUGH
SHE'S FRIGHTENED,

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.243
SHE STILL BATTLES ON.

00:13:14.243 --> 00:13:17.246
IT'S QUITE INSPIRING,
REALLY.

00:13:17.246 --> 00:13:19.248
Mai: NICE SPEECH, TéA.

00:13:19.248 --> 00:13:20.983
IN FACT,
IT WAS SO STIRRING,

00:13:20.983 --> 00:13:23.219
I ALMOST FEEL
THE NEED TO THROW UP.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.387
CAN IT!

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.556
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOUR INSULTS!

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.825
[THINKING] HMM.
THE MAGICIAN OF FAITH.

00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:31.827
I'M PLAYING THIS
IN DEFENSE MODE!

00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:33.195
AND THAT'S NOT ALL!

00:13:33.195 --> 00:13:35.731
I'M PLAYING THE SILVER
BOW AND ARROW CARD

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.801
WHICH RAISES
MY CREATURE 300 POINTS!

00:13:40.369 --> 00:13:42.138
FINE WITH ME.
UH...

00:13:42.138 --> 00:13:44.840
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T
HAVE MAGIC CARDS, TOO.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.242
CYBER SHIELD!

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.178
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS MAKEOVER.

00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:57.253
NOW HARPIE LADY'S ATTACK
WILL BE 500 POINTS STRONGER.

00:13:58.688 --> 00:13:59.889
BUT WAIT,

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:01.958
I'LL ALSO PLAY
THIS DE-SPELL CARD.

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.993
OHH!
SORRY, CUPID,

00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:06.495
YOU'VE BEEN
DE-ACCESSORIZED.

00:14:06.495 --> 00:14:08.898

OHH!

00:14:08.898 --> 00:14:09.966
NOT GOOD.

HOLD ON, TéA.
THIS MIGHT BE ROUGH.

00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:16.238

I THINK I'LL ATTACK
YOUR FACE-DOWN CARD

00:14:16.238 --> 00:14:18.608
TO DEMOLISH
ANY HOPES YOU HAVE LEFT.

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:24.947

NO MORE CHANCES!

DON'T YOU KNOW
THE RULES YET, TéA?

00:14:34.266 --> 00:14:37.102
SINCE I FLIPPED
YOUR MAGICIAN OF FAITH
OVER WITH MY ATTACK,

00:14:37.102 --> 00:14:39.104
YOU GET A CARD BACK
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

00:14:39.104 --> 00:14:40.105
OH.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.643
I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU
SERIOUSLY HOPE TO BEAT ME

KNOW THE RULES?

LOOK, HONEY,

I'M SURE THAT
EVERYONE'S REALLY IMPRESSED

THAT YOU'VE
LASTED THIS LONG,

00:14:50.482 --> 00:14:53.185
BUT ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS DELAYING THE INEVITABLE.

COME ON, WHAT YOU'RE
DOING IS POINTLESS.

00:14:58.156 --> 00:15:00.058
YUGI'S ALREADY
GIVEN UP ON HIMSELF.

00:15:00.058 --> 00:15:02.694
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR HIM.

00:15:02.694 --> 00:15:04.530
HE HAS TO FIGHT
FOR HIMSELF.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:07.900
HE HAS TO STAND UP TO ANYONE
WHO DARES TO GET IN HIS WAY.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.068
AND WHATEVER'S
GOING ON IN HIS HEAD, TéA,

00:15:10.068 --> 00:15:12.304

ON HIS OWN.

WHY, MAYBE MAI'S RIGHT.

00:15:14.907 --> 00:15:16.475

I HAVE TO FIGHT HARDER.

MAYBE I GAVE UP
TOO EASILY.

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THE THING
YOU'RE FIGHTING AGAINST

00:15:20.112 --> 00:15:22.247
IS SOME
KIND OF MAGICAL SPIRIT

THAT CAN
TAKE CONTROL OF YOU,

LIVING INSIDE OF YOU?

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:30.055
FACE IT, TéA,
YUGI'S CHECKED OUT,

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:31.156
HE'S GIVEN UP,

HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THIS MATCH,

00:15:32.457 --> 00:15:33.992

ABOUT YOU.

00:15:33.992 --> 00:15:36.528

THE HUMILIATION
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE ODDS ARE
AGAINST BEATING YOU.

00:15:45.704 --> 00:15:47.205

DON'T LET THESE

BUT I'VE
NEVER FELT STRONGER.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.096
SO YOU BETTER GET
YOUR STAR CHIPS READY,

00:16:11.096 --> 00:16:12.731
BECAUSE
I'M ABOUT TO BEAT YOU!

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:19.504
AND THERE'S NOT
A THING YOU CAN SAY
OR DO THAT'LL STOP ME.

00:16:19.504 --> 00:16:22.007
YOU MAY HAVE A TENDENCY
TO RUN AT THE MOUTH,

00:16:22.007 --> 00:16:23.775
BUT YOU'VE
GOT A LOT OF SPUNK.

GIVE ME YOUR BEST SHOT.

00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:27.813
Téa, thinking: THIS
ELF'S LIGHT'S A GOOD CARD.

00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:31.116
IT WOULD GIVE ME
A MAJOR POWER BOOST
TO MY SHINING FRIENDSHIP.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.652
AND I ALSO
HAVE A DE-SPELL CARD.

00:16:33.652 --> 00:16:36.655
I CAN USE THAT TO GET RID
OF MAI'S CYBER SHIELD.

00:16:36.655 --> 00:16:40.425
PLUS, SINCE I RECOVERED
MY SILVER BOW AND ARROW
FROM THE GRAVEYARD,

00:16:40.425 --> 00:16:42.260
I CAN ADD
ITS 300-POINT POWER BOOST

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.529
TO THE 400-POINT BOOST

00:16:44.529 --> 00:16:47.065
THAT I GET FROM
MY ELF'S LIGHT CARD!

00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:51.069
THEN MY SHINING FRIENDSHIP'S
ATTACK POWER WILL BE 2,000.

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:52.137
I JUST HOPE
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH.
