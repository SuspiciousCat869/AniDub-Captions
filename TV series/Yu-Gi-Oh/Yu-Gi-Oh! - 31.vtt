HUH?

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.864
AND QUIT ALL
YOUR CRYING, ALREADY.

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:12.532
YOU LOOK LIKE
A BIG BABY.

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:15.435
[SNIFFLES] WHO'S CRYING?
I GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.370
MM.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.273
STUPID THING WON'T COME OUT.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.541
HERE.
HUH?

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.210
JUST DON'T GO BLOWING
YOUR NOSE IN IT.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.580
YOU KNOW,
EVERY TIME I THINK
I'VE GOT YOU FIGURED,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.416
YOU SURPRISE ME, JOEY.

00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:30.517
HUH?

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:32.385
TéA TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:33.753
HOW YOUR DUELING TO WIN

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.789
THE TOURNAMENT'S
PRIZE MONEY FOR HER

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.424
SO SHE CAN HAVE
THAT OPERATION.

00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:39.893
SOUNDED LIKE
A BAD SOAP OPERA,
TO BE HONEST,

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:42.195
BUT THEN, WHO DOESN'T
LOVE A BAD SOAP OPERA?

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:43.263
ANYWAY,

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.365
SEE YOU AROUND, HON.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:47.801
HUH?

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:50.971
MAI'S CARD.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.473
WAIT! MAI!

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:54.474
TAKE IT.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.443
I DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE.

00:07:56.443 --> 00:07:59.946
SO, DOES THIS MEAN THAT
WE'RE FINALLY FRIENDS, MAI?

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.048
DON'T YOU HAVE A DUEL
TO RUN OFF TO?

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.049
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.718
ONE THING THOUGH--
WHOA.

00:08:04.718 --> 00:08:05.719
WHAT?

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:07.387
TAKE HIM DOWN.

00:08:07.387 --> 00:08:09.823
HUH? RIGHT.

00:08:10.857 --> 00:08:12.959
DORK.
OF COURSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

00:08:17.063 --> 00:08:18.465
Téa: IT'S JOEY!

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:19.599
All: HE MADE IT

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.401
HMM?
HUH?

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.036
HUH!

00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:26.339
YAY!
YEAH!

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:32.245
SO, THE PUNK'S COME BACK
TO GIVE US THE BAD NEWS, HUH?

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:33.546
LET ME GUESS.

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:36.916
YOU COULDN'T FIND
THAT CARD ANYWHERE. HA HA HA.

00:08:36.916 --> 00:08:39.452
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:08:39.452 --> 00:08:40.820
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.127
[THINKING] IMPOSSIBLE!
<i>I'M</i> USING HIS CARD!

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:49.029
VERY WELL, THEN.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:51.164
THE DUEL WILL PROCEED
AS SCHEDULED.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:52.165
[ALL SIGH]

00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:53.666
I'M ALREADY BEAT.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.002
ALL RIGHT, KEITH,
NAP TIME IS OVER.

00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:57.170
TIME TO DUEL.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.772
FINE. YOU KNOW,

00:08:58.772 --> 00:09:01.574
A PART OF ME
WANTED YOU TO SHOW UP.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:04.244
A NICE LITTLE
WARM-UP MATCH
MIGHT DO ME SOME GOOD.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:06.679
I'LL WARM YOU UP
AND WEAR YOU OUT.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.081
JUST YOU TRY IT!

00:09:08.081 --> 00:09:10.817
THE SECOND MATCH OF THESE
PLAYOFFS WILL NOW COMMENCE.

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:14.154
JOEY WHEELER, BANDIT KEITH,
PREPARE TO DUEL.

00:09:14.154 --> 00:09:16.589
[CHEERING]

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:18.191
[THINKING] COME ON, JOEY.

00:09:18.191 --> 00:09:20.026
YOU HAVE TO WIN THIS MATCH
OR YOU'RE OUT.

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.861
READY? BEGIN.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.063
LET'S DUEL!
LET'S DUEL!

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.435
JOEY WHEELER,

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:29.936
BANDIT KEITH,

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:32.772
YOUR PEERS
AND GRACIOUS HOST

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.707
AWAIT YOUR BOUT,

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.609
SO LET THIS DUEL COMMENCE.

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.013
[THINKING] OK, JOEY,

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.514
YOUR SISTER'S
COUNTING ON YOU.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.316
[LAUGHS]

00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.818
SO TELL ME HOW IT FEELS

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.753
TO BE AN AMATEUR
GOING UP AGAINST

00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:49.456
THE INTERCONTINENTAL
DUELING CHAMPION?

00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.291
WHOO-HOO!

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:53.693
THE INTERCONTINENTAL
CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:56.629
I COULD WIN A BETTER
PRIZE THAN THAT
IN A BOX OF CEREAL.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:57.864
HUH. PUNK.

00:09:57.864 --> 00:09:59.799
I'LL TEACH YOU
TO RESPECT MY TITLE.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:03.169
ONE CARD FACE-DOWN
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:07.540
HERE WE GO, GUYS.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.676
DO YOU THINK
THAT TITLE GIVES
KEITH AN EDGE?

00:10:09.676 --> 00:10:12.812
NAH. JOEY'S GOT SOMETHING
A LOT BETTER THAN TITLES,

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:13.847
HE'S GOT GUTS.

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:15.081
AND HEART, TOO.

00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.283
JUST REMEMBER WHAT
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR, JOEY,

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.818
AND YOU CAN'T LOSE.

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.920
RIGHT. NOW TAKE IT
TO 'EM, BUD.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.223
THIS IS
THE MOMENT YOU'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR.

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:26.993
[THINKING] OK, THEN.
IT'S TIME TO GO TO WORK.

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:30.463
SERENITY,
THIS DUEL'S FOR YOU, SIS.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.831
MY TURN,

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:34.367
AND I'M THROWING A MONSTER
CARD IN DEFENSE MODE, TOO.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:37.203
WELL, THIS AIN'T GONNA BE
A VERY EXCITING MATCH

00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:39.506
IF WE'RE BOTH JUST PLAYING
DEFENSE ALL DAY,

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:43.643
SO I THINK I'LL SWITCH
MY CARD TO ATTACK MODE.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.778
GO, PENDULUM MACHINE!

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.382
A MACHINE MONSTER.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:50.617
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:10:50.617 --> 00:10:52.819
AND HE'S ABOUT
TO GO INTO OVERDRIVE

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.255
ON THAT
DEFENSE CARD OF YOURS.

00:10:57.023 --> 00:10:59.092
SLASHING BLADE ATTACK!

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:04.731
OUCH. THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:05.865
WELL, IT ISN'T...BAD.

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:06.866
HUH?

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.134
YUGI IS RIGHT.

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.603
NOW THAT KEITH'S
CARD IS SET IN
ATTACK MODE,

00:11:10.603 --> 00:11:12.772
JOEY CAN SEE PRECISELY
HOW STRONG IT IS.

00:11:12.772 --> 00:11:14.040
NOW ALL HE HAS TO DO

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.408
IS PLAY SOMETHING
STRONGER,

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.243
AND HE'LL BE ABLE
TO DESTROY IT.

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.678
[THINKING] STILL,

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:21.681
I WONDER WHY
BANDIT KEITH PLAYED
A MACHINE MONSTER.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.850
SO, ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE YOU MOVE, OR WHAT?

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.885
I SURE AM,
AND IT'S A BIG ONE,

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.021
ALL THANKS TO YOUR
LOUSY MOVE.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.556
GILTIA THE KNIGHT,

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:32.292
MASH THAT MACHINE
INTO SCRAP METAL.

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:33.493
[GROWLS]

00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:34.727
WOW.

00:11:34.727 --> 00:11:36.629
GILTIA THE KNIGHT,
HAS A HIGHER ATTACK POWER

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:38.364
THAN KEITH'S MONSTER.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.734
SOUL SPEAR, ATTACK!

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:47.373
WHAT? MY ATTACK'S
NOT WORKING.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.676
HUH?
GREAT SCOTT,
IT'S NOT.

00:11:49.676 --> 00:11:52.212
YUG, THAT CAN'T
BE RIGHT, CAN IT?

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.346
[EVIL LAUGH]

00:11:53.346 --> 00:11:54.814
YOU BET IT'S RIGHT.

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:57.317
ALL OF MY MACHINE MONSTERS
ARE PROTECTED BY

00:11:57.317 --> 00:11:58.952
MAGIC-RESISTANT ARMOR,

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:02.155
SO THAT MAKES ALL OF YOUR
MAGIC ATTACKS WORTH SQUAT.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.256
[EVIL LAUGH]

00:12:03.256 --> 00:12:04.958
THAT'S WHY HE PLAYED
A MACHINE CARD--

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.259
THEY'RE MAGIC-PROOF,

00:12:06.259 --> 00:12:08.661
AND NOT JUST AGAINST
MAGICAL-TYPE MONSTERS,

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:11.731
BUT THEY CAN WITHSTAND
ATTACKS FROM ANY CARD
THAT USES MAGIC.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.067
MAN, CAN'T WE EVER
CATCH A BREAK?

00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.236
MY TURN...
HUH?

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:20.039
AND I GOT ANOTHER WELL-OILED
MACHINE ALL READY FOR YOU.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.375
LAUNCHER SPIDER!

00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:26.079
MORE MACHINES.
JUST GREAT.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.481
HIS WHOLE DECK IS
PROBABLY FULL OF THEM.

00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:30.950
NOW, SPIDER,
UHH!

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.652
SHOCK-ROCKET ATTACK!

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.558
COME ON, PUNK, FIGHT ME BACK.

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:40.260
IT'S MORE FUN
WHEN YOU STRUGGLE.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.095
[THINKING] OH, MAN!

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:44.197
I'D KNEW I'D GET A ROUGH
MATCH FROM KEITH,

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:47.934
BUT I WASN'T PREPARED
FOR THESE BIG METAL BULLIES.

00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:49.769
THEY'RE TOUGH, TRUE.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.038
STILL, NO MACHINE IS
WITHOUT ITS GLITCH.

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:54.507
SO WHAT'S THEIR
GLITCH, YUGI?

00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.576
OH, I'M NOT SURE.

00:12:56.576 --> 00:12:57.910
MACHINE MONSTERS ARE
SOME OF THE MOST

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.146
POWERFUL MONSTERS
IN THE DUELING WORLD.

00:13:00.146 --> 00:13:02.882
NOT ONLY ARE THEY IMPERVIOUS
TO MAGIC ATTACKS,

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:06.085
BUT THEY HAVE AN AMAZINGLY
STRONG OFFENSE AS WELL.

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:09.656
BUT THEY CAN ONLY USE
THAT STRONG OFFENSE ONE WAY:

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:11.491
AGAINST HEAD-ON ATTACKS.

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.760
MAYBE IF JOEY PLAYS
HIS CARDS RIGHT,

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.962
HE CAN USE THAT
TO HIS ADVANTAGE.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.630
[THINKING] HMM.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.899
ATTACKING THOSE
METAL FREAKS WILL
JUST GET ME CLOBBERED,

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:20.900
SO...

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.002
I'LL PLAY THIS FACE-DOWN

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:25.071
AND THIS MONSTER CARD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:27.674
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DWEEB,
AFRAID TO FIGHT LIKE A MAN?

00:13:27.674 --> 00:13:28.675
UHH!

00:13:28.675 --> 00:13:30.677
HMM.

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:33.513
IF THIS GUY KEEPS THROWING
CARDS IN DEFENSIVE MODE,

00:13:33.513 --> 00:13:35.114
I'LL NEVER
GET AT HIS LIFE POINTS.

00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:38.084
I GOT TO DRAW HIM OUT,
GET HIM TO ATTACK ME,

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:40.553
THEN HE'LL BE OPEN
FOR SOME REAL DAMAGE.

00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:43.489
[LAUGHS] I'LL LAY A CARD
FACE-DOWN, TOO,

00:13:43.489 --> 00:13:45.625
AND THIS IN DEFENSE. OOP.

00:13:49.128 --> 00:13:52.065
MY MISTAKE.
JUST FORGET WHAT YOU SAW.

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:53.666
ANYHOW, AS I WAS SAYING,

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.968
I'LL PLAY THIS CARD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:58.705
WHATEVER THAT WAS,
IT SURE LOOKED UGLY.

00:13:58.705 --> 00:14:00.073
BUT NOT METAL.

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:01.708
[THINKING]
HA HA HA HA HA.

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:02.842
TRISTAN'S RIGHT.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.877
THAT CARD WASN'T
A MACHINE,

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:07.213
IT WAS A SHADOW MONSTER
CALLED ZOA,

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.016
A BEAST MY
FLAME SWORDSMAN
COULD TOAST EASILY.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.585
AND UNLIKE
MACHINE MONSTERS,

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:15.521
IT'S TOTALLY VULNERABLE
TO MAGIC. HA HA.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.857
YEAH! CHECK OUT
JOEY'S BIG GRIN.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.991
SOMETHING'S UP.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:19.992
I DON'T KNOW.

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:21.194
HUH? KNOW WHAT?

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:24.864
GO, FLAME SWORDSMAN,
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:29.268
THE ATTACK POINTS
OF THAT ZOA CARD
KEITH DROPPED--

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:31.204
THEY'RE HIGHER
THAN ITS DEFENSE.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:32.705
SO WHAT?

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.140
OH, I SEE.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.442
AND I'LL ADD THIS
MAGIC CARD, TOO.

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:39.212
SINCE ZOA'S ATTACK
IS MORE THAN HIS DEFENSE,

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:40.279
IT MAKES LITTLE SENSE

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:42.014
TO PLAY HIM IN
DEFENSIVE MODE,

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:45.685
UNLESS KEITH
IS TRYING TO LURE JOEY
INTO ATTACKING HIM.

00:14:45.685 --> 00:14:47.053
GO, SALAMANDRA.

00:14:47.053 --> 00:14:50.456
HIS MAGIC RAISES
MY ATTACK POWER
BY 700 POINTS.

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:53.459
SO THEN KEITH MUST HAVE
SHOWN ZOA ON PURPOSE.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:54.527
JOEY, WAIT!

00:14:54.527 --> 00:14:56.329
SWORDSMAN, ATTACK!

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.331
I GOT YOU.

00:14:58.331 --> 00:15:00.299
MY TRAP ACTIVATES.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:01.467
WHAT?

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:03.736
GO, MAGIC METAL FORCE!

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.471
NOW ZOA IS METAL ZOA,

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:09.041
WITH 400 ATTACK
AND DEFENSE POINTS STRONGER.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:10.376
AH, NO BIG THING.

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:13.045
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL,
BLONDIE,

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.248
THAT NEW METALLIC PAINT JOB
HE'S SPORTING

00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:18.251
DEFLECTS ALL MAGIC ATTACKS
BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:19.719
MY SWORDSMAN!

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:22.422
THAT'S RIGHT.
JUST WATCH THIS.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.425
NO!

00:15:33.366 --> 00:15:35.935
[THINKING]
MY SWORDSMAN'S BEEN
OUTMANEUVERED.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:40.206
HA HA HA! YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN THE LOOK ON YOUR
LOSER FACE, YOU DWEEB,

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:42.575
WHEN YOUR SWORDSMAN'S
OWN ATTACK TOASTED HIM.

00:15:42.575 --> 00:15:43.576
IT WAS PRICELESS.
HA HA HA HA!

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:44.877
HEH HEH.

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:47.079
HMM...

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:48.848
AND I'M JUST GETTING
STARTED.

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:50.183
SAY WHAT?

00:15:50.183 --> 00:15:51.551
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:54.420
NEXT ON MY LIST
IS THAT LITTLE
DEFENSE CARD OF YOURS,

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.789
BUT HE WON'T BE
DEFENDING MUCH LONGER.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:58.724
A STOP DEFENSE CARD?

00:15:58.724 --> 00:16:02.228
LET'S SEE WHAT
YOU'RE HIDING THERE.

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:04.197
AN AXE RAIDER, HUH?

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:05.832
NO PROBLEM.

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:08.801
NOT FOR MY METAL ZOA,
ANYWAY.

00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:11.370
OH, NO! JOEY'S
LIFE POINTS
WILL BE ALL GONE

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.406
IF THAT METAL ZOA'S
ATTACK HITS.

00:16:13.406 --> 00:16:14.474
HANG TOUGH, BUD.

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:16.342
SAYONARA, SUCKER.

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:19.879
METAL ZOA, ATTACK
THE AXE RAIDER.

00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:20.880
OOH...

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.881
[RAHHRR]

00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:23.216
HUH?
HUHH!

00:16:23.216 --> 00:16:24.217
HUH?

00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:26.152
[THINKING]
WHERE'D HE GO?

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.454
OF COURSE!

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.490
NICE MOVE.
HUH?

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.958
ALL RIGHT!

00:16:31.958 --> 00:16:33.960
YOU FELL RIGHT IN MY TRAP,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.394
JUST LIKE I PLANNED.

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.897
NO WAY! <i>YOU</i> SET
A TRAP FOR <i>ME?</i>

00:16:37.897 --> 00:16:40.266
PERFECT! THE CHASM
OF SPIKES CARD.

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.602
NOW NOT ONLY
IS METAL ZOA DESTROYED,

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:44.504
BUT ONE QUARTER
OF HIS ATTACK POINTS

00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:46.672
WILL BE DEDUCTED
FROM KEITH'S LIFE POINTS.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.108
AHH...

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:50.142
NOT BAD, HUH?

00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:52.445
I ONLY WISH
YOU COULD HAVE SEEN

00:16:52.445 --> 00:16:54.780
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
WHEN THAT METAL ZOA
OF YOURS

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:55.882
GOT SHISH-KEBABED.

00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:57.316
IT WAS PRICELESS.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.552
YOU TELL HIM.
IT'S ABOUT TIME

00:16:59.552 --> 00:17:01.621
SOMEONE GAVE THAT
BANDIT KEITH JERK

00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:03.456
A TASTE OF
HIS OWN MEDICINE.

00:17:03.456 --> 00:17:05.024
THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY WAY

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:06.859
HE'S TURNING THE TABLES
ON KEITH.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.861
I THINK JOEY MIGHT HAVE
FINALLY FOUND THE GLITCH

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:10.329
IN THOSE MACHINE MONSTERS.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.298
RATHER THAN TRY
AND BEAT THEM

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:15.234
IN A DIRECT ASSAULT,
HE'S LETTING HIS TRAPS
DO ALL THE WORK.

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:18.337
AND NOW KEITH'S
ONLY WINNING BY
100 LIFE POINTS.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:19.505
ALL RIGHT!

00:17:19.505 --> 00:17:21.240
GO, JOE, GO!

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.642
MY TURN.

00:17:22.642 --> 00:17:24.477
AND FIRST I'M LAYING
THIS FACE-DOWN.

00:17:24.477 --> 00:17:26.479
OH, AND IT'S
A TRAP CARD,

00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:28.147
SO DON'T BOTHER
ATTACKING.

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:31.017
WOW! WILL YOU JUST
LOOK AT HIM DUEL?

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:33.586
CAREFUL. YOU HAVEN'T WON
THIS DUEL YET, JOEY.

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:35.021
YOU AMATEUR!

00:17:35.021 --> 00:17:37.523
THAT'S GOTTA BE
THE LOUSIEST BLUFF
I'VE EVER HEARD

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:39.392
IN MY ENTIRE
DUELING CAREER.

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:42.828
AND NEXT, I'M SWITCHING
MY AXE RAIDER BACK TO
DEFENSIVE MODE

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:45.765
AND THROWING THIS IN
ATTACK MODE.

00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:50.169
GO, GARUSIES.
NOW, JUNK THAT
PENDULUM MACHINE.

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:52.104
ATTACK!

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:55.007
WITH BATTLE BLADES,
STRIKE!

00:17:57.977 --> 00:17:59.345
PUNK.

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:00.780
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.182
TAKE A PERMANENT
VACATION AT
THE SCRAP YARD,

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.283
YOU HUNK OF JUNK.

00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:05.618
NOW IT'S MY TURN!

00:18:05.618 --> 00:18:06.986
LAUNCHER SPIDER!

00:18:06.986 --> 00:18:08.688
DEMOLISH GARUSIES!

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:15.261
HAH! I KNEW YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANOTHER TRAP CARD.

00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:16.529
WRONG AGAIN, KEITH.

00:18:16.529 --> 00:18:18.197
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS BLUFFING

00:18:18.197 --> 00:18:20.399
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
PAY FOR IT.

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:21.400
WHAT'S THAT?

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.568
KUNAI WITH CHAINS.

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:24.003
AND ONCE ACTIVATED,

00:18:24.003 --> 00:18:26.939
IT RAISES
MY ATTACK POWER
500 POINTS.

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:28.874
ATTACK, GARUSIES.

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:30.810
BATTLE AXE CRUSH!

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.450
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S STILL CLOSE,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.119
BUT JOEY HAS JUST
WON HIMSELF
A SLIGHT LEAD.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:42.855
I KNEW HE'D MAKE
A COMEBACK! HA HA HA!

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.790
[THINKING] JOEY'S
TRUSTING HIS INSTINCTS

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.592
AND BELIEVING IN
HIS CARDS.

00:18:46.592 --> 00:18:48.527
HE'S DUELING LIKE
A TRUE CHAMPION.

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:50.196
WAY TO GO, JOEY!

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:51.464
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,

00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.132
YOU'LL BE DUELING PEGASUS
IN NO TIME!

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:55.001
HMM.

00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:59.038
UHH! I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM
MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME.

00:18:59.038 --> 00:19:01.173
WHAT'S WRONG, MR. CHAMP?

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:03.643
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR COOL

00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.678
TO AN AMATEUR LIKE ME.

00:19:05.678 --> 00:19:08.581
HUH. HA HA HA HA!

00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:11.517
WHAT THE--
WHAT'S THE BIG JOKE?

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.953
THE JOKE IS ON YOU,
BLONDIE.

00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:16.422
YOU'RE ALREADY COUNTING
THE TOURNAMENT'S PRIZE MONEY,

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.991
AND THIS DUEL
AIN'T EVEN CLOSE
TO BEING OVER YET.

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.226
OH, YEAH?

00:19:20.226 --> 00:19:23.596
YOU THINK YOUR TRAPS
WILL LAST YOU FOREVER?

00:19:23.596 --> 00:19:26.098
YOU'RE GONNA RUN OUT
SOONER OR LATER,

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.701
AND THEN I'LL BRING OUT
MY BIGGER MACHINES

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:31.504
AND REALLY GIVE
OUR AUDIENCE A SHOW.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:35.241
YOU'RE GOIN' DOWN,
YOU SNIVELING LITTLE
WANNABE.

00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:37.443
NOBODY BEATS BANDIT KEITH.

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:39.478
NOBODY!
