00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:36.184
READING MY MIND
WILL TELL YOU
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

00:08:36.184 --> 00:08:39.087
[THINKING] HOW?
HOW IS HE DOING THIS?

00:08:39.087 --> 00:08:41.957
YOU SEE, PEGASUS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT CARD IS,

00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:44.059
BECAUSE I AM
NO LONGER YUGI MOTO,

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.862
BUT SOMEONE ELSE
ALTOGETHER.

00:08:46.862 --> 00:08:48.797
THROUGH THE MAGIC OF
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:08:48.797 --> 00:08:51.099
2 MINDS INHABIT
THIS BODY.

00:08:51.099 --> 00:08:53.468
NOW, EACH TIME
YOU TRY TO READ
ONE OF OUR MINDS,

00:08:53.468 --> 00:08:55.570
WE'LL USE
THE MIND SHUFFLE.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.506
[THINKING] MIND SHUFFLE?

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.641
TOLD YA! YUGI'S
BATTLING PEGASUS

00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:01.710
WITH NOT ONE,
BUT 2 MINDS.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.679
OH, I GET IT.
SO WHEN PEGASUS TRIES
TO READ ONE OF HIS MINDS,

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:06.615
YUGI CAN SWITCH BACK
TO THE OTHER ONE.

00:09:06.615 --> 00:09:10.018
I GUESS IT'S TRUE,
2 MINDS ARE BETTER THAN ONE.

00:09:10.018 --> 00:09:13.388
IT'S ALL OVER.
GIVE US BACK OUR PRISONER NOW,

00:09:13.388 --> 00:09:15.991
AND WE MAY STILL
LET YOU LEAVE IN ONE PIECE.

00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.426
FACE IT. YOU'VE GOT
NOWHERE ELSE TO RUN.

00:09:18.426 --> 00:09:20.729
BAKURA,
HE'S RIGHT.

00:09:20.729 --> 00:09:23.198
SO, PUNK,
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

00:09:23.198 --> 00:09:24.533
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:26.501
YOU IGNORANT
MORTALS.

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:27.769
IT'S FAR
FROM ALL OVER.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:29.671
WE HAVE BARELY EVEN
BEGUN TO PLAY.

00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.340
AND I'LL
SHOW YOU THE CARDS
FATE HAS DEALT YOU.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.176
STOP TALKING NONSENSE!
GIVE UP!

00:09:34.176 --> 00:09:35.443
RIGHT NOW!

00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:37.779
[THINKING] WHAT'S WITH
BAKURA ALL OF A SUDDEN?

00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:40.615
WAIT A MINUTE!
I THINK I REMEMBER HIM

00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:42.617
ACTING LIKE
THIS ONCE BEFORE!

00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:45.387
IT WAS WHEN THE EVIL
SPIRIT FROM BAKURA'S
MILLENNIUM RING

00:09:45.387 --> 00:09:47.222
DRAGGED US ALL
TO THE SHADOW REALM!

00:09:47.222 --> 00:09:49.257
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
JUST A BAD DREAM,

00:09:49.257 --> 00:09:51.560
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
IT REALLY DID HAPPEN.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.930
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THAT EVIL BAKURA
IS BACK AGAIN.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.498
NOW I'LL TEACH YOU
THE TRUE MEANING OF FEAR,

00:09:56.498 --> 00:09:58.700
AS I SUMMON
THE MAN-EATER BUG...

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.602
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:00.602 --> 00:10:03.505
WITH THE POWER
OF MY MILLENNIUM RING!

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:06.208
[LAUGHS]

00:10:07.776 --> 00:10:09.678
UNH! WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:10:13.148 --> 00:10:16.418
OH, NO! HE'S
BROUGHT THE MONSTER
ON THE CARD TO LIFE!

00:10:16.418 --> 00:10:18.119
AND HE'S GONNA
SIC IT ON US!

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:25.621
NOW, YOU MORTAL FOOLS
PREPARE TO MEET
YOUR DOOM!

00:10:26.688 --> 00:10:27.789
[ROARS]

00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:29.024
HERE IT COMES!

00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:32.094
RUN! LET'S GET
OUT OF HERE!

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:39.601
PRESENT-DAY HUMANS
ARE SO FUN TO TERRORIZE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:41.937
NO, I DON'T.
BUT THEN AGAIN,

00:10:41.937 --> 00:10:44.540
I AM
A PRESENT-DAY HUMAN.
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.441
[CHUCKLES]

00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:48.911
ME? SOMEONE WITH GREAT POWER,

00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:50.045
SOON TO BE GREATER.

00:10:50.045 --> 00:10:52.281
BUT I CAN'T SPEND
THE DAY HAVING FUN.

00:10:52.281 --> 00:10:54.683
I HAVE THINGS TO DO.

00:10:54.683 --> 00:10:57.319
SO I'LL SUMMON
THE MORPHING JAR
TO THIS PLANE

00:10:57.319 --> 00:11:00.088
AND PUT AN END
TO THEIR PATHETIC WHINING.

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:04.459
WHAT IS THAT?!

00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:06.862
[MEN SCREAM]

00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:11.166
THE JAR'S MAGIC
WILL SEND THESE RIDICULOUS
THUGS TO THE GRAVEYARD.

00:11:11.166 --> 00:11:13.302
[CHUCKLES]

00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:14.736
[THINKING] WHOA!

00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:20.776
[DISTANT ROAR]

00:11:20.776 --> 00:11:23.211
WHERE THE HECK
ARE WE?

00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:25.948
AND WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT THING?

00:11:25.948 --> 00:11:26.982
AAH!
AAH!

00:11:29.618 --> 00:11:32.454
SO, STILL TRYING
TO READ MY MIND,
PEGASUS?

00:11:32.454 --> 00:11:33.455
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

00:11:33.455 --> 00:11:36.358
NO THANKS, YUGI BOY.

00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:40.395
MY MIND-SCANNING ABILITIES
ARE ONLY ONE OF MANY
SKILLS THAT I POSSESS

00:11:40.395 --> 00:11:42.531
AND THAT YOU
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT,

00:11:42.531 --> 00:11:45.334
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHO INVENTED THIS GAME?

00:11:45.334 --> 00:11:49.271
BESIDES, I CAN SENSE
THAT YOU ARE PREPARED
TO SWITCH MINDS.

00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:53.275
YES, YOU'RE READY TO SWITCH
AGAIN THE MOMENT I BEGIN
TO PROBE YOUR MIND.

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:57.279
SO, RATHER THAN
WASTE BOTH OUR TIME,
LET'S MOVE ON, SHALL WE?

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:59.982
YOU'VE STILL NO DEFENSE
AGAINST MY TOON MONSTERS,

00:11:59.982 --> 00:12:01.516
AND IT'S ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

00:12:01.516 --> 00:12:04.186
TILL I FIND WHICH HAT
HIDES YOUR DARK MAGICIAN.

00:12:04.186 --> 00:12:05.687
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:05.687 --> 00:12:08.557
THEN PICK A HAT,
AND WE'LL SEE
JUST HOW IMPRESSIVE

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:11.226
YOUR MASTERY OF
DUEL MONSTERS REALLY IS.

00:12:11.226 --> 00:12:12.861
BUT I SUSPECT THAT
YOU'VE RELIED

00:12:12.861 --> 00:12:14.796
ON THE MAGIC
OF YOUR MILLENNIUM EYE

00:12:14.796 --> 00:12:17.866
FOR SO LONG,
YOUR DUELING SKILLS
HAVE DIMINISHED.

00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:21.036
[CHUCKLES] EVEN IF
YOUR LITTLE THEORY WAS TRUE,

00:12:21.036 --> 00:12:25.807
I'M STILL FAR AND AWAY
A SUPERIOR DUELIST TO YOU.

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:28.477
WE SHALL SEE, PEGASUS.
MAKE YOUR NEXT MOVE.

00:12:28.477 --> 00:12:32.781
TOON SUMMONED SKULL,
ATTACK THE MIDDLE HAT.

00:12:36.618 --> 00:12:38.420
[GROWLS]

00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:44.326
[THINKING] HMM,
DID I GET HIM?

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:48.296
I THINK I GOT HIM.
I MUST'VE GOTTEN HIM.

00:12:48.296 --> 00:12:51.733
[GASPS] NO!
I MISSED AGAIN!

00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:55.904
[CHUCKLES]
WHAT A SHAME, PEGASUS.
ANOTHER TURN WASTED.

00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:57.973
AND FOR MY NEXT TURN,

00:12:57.973 --> 00:13:00.375
A QUICK CHANGE
IS IN ORDER.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.546
SO, YOU'VE SWITCHED AGAIN.

00:13:04.546 --> 00:13:06.214
Yugi: THAT'S RIGHT,
PEGASUS.

00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:10.052
AND OUR
MIND SHUFFLE STRATEGY
IS WORKING PERFECTLY.

00:13:10.052 --> 00:13:11.687
[THINKING] GREAT!
THE LIVING ARROW CARD

00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:13.655
COULD REALLY
TURN THIS MATCH AROUND.

00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:16.525
SO I'LL JUST PLAY
THIS CARD FACEDOWN,

00:13:16.525 --> 00:13:18.326
AND I'LL SEE YOU
LATER, PEGASUS.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.932
Yami Yugi: YOU'RE
LOOKING FRUSTRATED.

00:13:23.932 --> 00:13:26.301
[THINKING] HE'S PLAYED
ANOTHER CARD FACEDOWN,

00:13:26.301 --> 00:13:29.137
AND THERE'S NO POINT
IN TRYING TO READ
THIS YUGI'S MIND,

00:13:29.137 --> 00:13:32.374
BECAUSE HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT CARD IT IS, EITHER.

00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:36.178
[THINKING]
SO, YUGI'S PLAYED
ANOTHER CARD FACEDOWN,

00:13:36.178 --> 00:13:39.014
AND EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT CARD IS,

00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:41.650
I HAVE FAITH IN YUGI

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:44.386
AND FAITH IN
THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:49.091
I'M BECOMING ANNOYED.

00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:50.992
EUREKA!

00:13:50.992 --> 00:13:54.396
THE CARD THAT WILL
DEVASTATE YOUR DARK MAGICIAN.

00:13:54.396 --> 00:13:58.600
MAGICAL NEUTRALIZING
FORCE ACTIVATE.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.735
[GASPS]

00:14:02.738 --> 00:14:06.942
THIS SPECIAL CARD
ACTS TO ELIMINATE
ANY AND ALL MAGIC EFFECTS

00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:09.411
CURRENTLY ACTIVE
ON THE OPPONENT'S FIELD,

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.346
WHICH MEANS
THE CONCEALING EFFECT

00:14:11.346 --> 00:14:13.482
OF YOUR MAGICAL HATS
NOW DISAPPEARS.

00:14:16.718 --> 00:14:19.888
OH, NO! THE MAGIC HATS
ARE EVAPORATING!

00:14:19.888 --> 00:14:23.658
THE DARK MAGICIAN
IS REVEALED!

00:14:23.658 --> 00:14:27.229
IT'S ALL OVER FOR HIM
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:14:27.229 --> 00:14:30.565
YOU CAN ONLY WATCH
AS I SAVOR MY FINAL VICTORY.

00:14:30.565 --> 00:14:33.001
DOES YOUR HEART GROW COLD

00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:35.470
KNOWING THAT YOUR DEMISE
IS ONLY MOMENTS AWAY?

00:14:36.938 --> 00:14:40.408
COME ON OUT,
TOON SUMMONED SKULL.

00:14:40.408 --> 00:14:43.545
SHOW THEM THE FACE OF VICTORY!

00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:47.149
[THINKING] NO!
HIS TOON MONSTERS ARE
VIRTUALLY UNSTOPPABLE,

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:49.918
AND MY DARK MAGICIAN
IS TOTALLY UNPROTECTED.

00:14:49.918 --> 00:14:52.487
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO, UNLESS...

00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:57.058
TOON SUMMONED SKULL,
ATTACK THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:14:57.058 --> 00:14:59.261
LIGHTNING STRIKE ATTACK!

00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:04.633
[GASPS]

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:10.735
DEVASTATE HIS DARK MAGICIAN!

00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:15.574
I DON'T HAVE A MOVE,
BUT YUGI MIGHT.

00:15:15.574 --> 00:15:16.975
Yugi: PEGASUS!

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:19.111
[THINKING] NO,
THEY'VE SWITCHED AGAIN!

00:15:19.111 --> 00:15:21.847
I DEFEND MY MAGICIAN

00:15:21.847 --> 00:15:24.449
WITH THE CARD
I PLAYED FACEDOWN.

00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:27.719
THE MAGIC CARD...
LIVING ARROW!

00:15:28.854 --> 00:15:31.723
WHAT? YOUR HIDDEN CARD
IS THE LIVING ARROW?

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:34.659
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT IS MY SECRET CARD.

00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:37.362
AND SINCE
YOU'RE THE CREATOR
OF DUEL MONSTERS,

00:15:37.362 --> 00:15:40.132
YOU MUST KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE LIVING ARROW CARD...

00:15:40.132 --> 00:15:41.199
[GROWLS]

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.401
AND HOW IT CAN FUSE
WITH ANY CARD

00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:45.203
AN OPPONENT
MIGHT PUT INTO PLAY.

00:15:45.203 --> 00:15:46.972
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER THAT CARD

00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:48.773
IS A MONSTER CARD
OR A MAGIC CARD!

00:15:50.475 --> 00:15:53.311
Yami Yugi:
WE'VE THWARTED YOUR
MIND-READING MAGIC,

00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:57.716
AND NOW WE'RE GOING
TO USE YOUR VERY OWN
MAGIC CARD AGAINST YOU!

00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:01.720
PEGASUS, I USE
THE LIVING ARROW CARD

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.055
TO FUSE WITH
YOUR MAGICAL
NEUTRALIZING CARD

00:16:04.055 --> 00:16:07.259
AND FIRE IT RIGHT BACK
AT TOON WORLD!

00:16:08.994 --> 00:16:10.629
[GASPS] HMM.

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:13.098
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
'CAUSE IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:15.567
FOR YOU TO STOP
MY SUMMONED SKULL ATTACK.

00:16:18.203 --> 00:16:21.940
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN
IS VANQUISHED.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.875
SORRY, PEGASUS.
HUH?

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:27.112
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN
MY OTHER DOWN CARD.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:30.015
IT'S A TRAP CARD,
AND IT'S ONE
OF MY FAVORITES,

00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:31.082
MIRROR FORCE!

00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:32.484
A TRAP?

00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:38.523
IT DEFLECTS BACK
SUMMONED SKULL'S ATTACK,

00:16:38.523 --> 00:16:40.392
AND SINCE THE OTHER CARD
NEUTRALIZED THE MAGIC

00:16:40.392 --> 00:16:42.360
THAT MADE YOUR
TOONS UNTOUCHABLE,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.729
YOUR TOON MONSTERS
RETURN TO THEIR
ORIGINAL FORM

00:16:44.729 --> 00:16:48.833
AND APPEAR ON THE FIELD
JUST IN TIME TO
CATCH THE BLAST.

00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:51.803
AAH!

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.705
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

00:16:53.705 --> 00:16:56.808
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE DESTROYED
ALL MY BELOVED TOONS.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:17:00.145
AAH! NO! NO! NO! NO!

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:02.314
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE,
A BAD DREAM.

00:17:02.314 --> 00:17:04.349
THIS CAN'T TRULY
BE HAPPENING!

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:06.318
OH!

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:09.354
WE DID IT. ALL THE TOONS
ARE DESTROYED.

00:17:09.354 --> 00:17:11.623
[THINKING] YES,
AND IT WAS YOUR PLAN, YUGI.

00:17:11.623 --> 00:17:13.258
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

00:17:13.258 --> 00:17:16.661
SCORE STANDS AT YUGI,
900, PEGASUS, 600.

00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:18.163
UH, SORRY, SIR.

00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:20.532
[THINKING] YUGI HAS
PROVEN FORMIDABLE INDEED.

00:17:20.532 --> 00:17:23.902
AND HIS MILLENNIUM ITEM
IS EVEN MORE INTRIGUING
THAN I IMAGINED.

00:17:23.902 --> 00:17:26.838
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE
IN THE LEAD, YUGE!

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:28.340
[THINKING] AT LAST!

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.842
THOSE CREEPY
TOON MONSTERS SEEMED
ALMOST UNBEATABLE,

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:34.045
BUT I KNEW YUGI'D
FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO DEFEAT THEM.

00:17:34.045 --> 00:17:35.847
I JUST KNEW IT!

00:17:37.949 --> 00:17:40.352
Bakura: AS YOU
CAN SEE, THERE'S NOT
A SINGLE PARTICLE

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:42.921
OF THOSE PATHETIC FOOLS
LEFT IN THIS DIMENSION.

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.757
I HAVE NO PATIENCE
FOR OBSTACLES THAT
GET IN MY WAY.

00:17:45.757 --> 00:17:47.025
REMEMBER THAT.

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.493
HUH? I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DID THAT,

00:17:48.493 --> 00:17:50.195
AND I PROBABLY
DON'T WANNA KNOW.

00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.864
JUST TELL ME WHO YOU ARE,
WHAT YOU WANT.

00:17:52.864 --> 00:17:54.966
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT REALLY
OUR FRIEND BAKURA.

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:56.368
YOU'RE THE ONE YUGI BEAT.

00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.603
HE BANISHED YOU
TO THE GRAVEYARD,

00:17:58.603 --> 00:18:02.140
AND IN THE PROCESS,
HE FREED BAKURA FROM
YOUR MIND CONTROL.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.242
YES, BUT THAT
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

00:18:04.242 --> 00:18:06.211
IF BAKURA
HADN'T BETRAYED ME.

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.079
I'VE DECIDED
I NEED A NEW HOST.

00:18:08.079 --> 00:18:11.049
YOU WON'T TAKE ME
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:14.185
NOT YOURS.
I WANT A VESSEL WITHOUT
A MIND OR SOUL OF ITS OWN.

00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:16.354
YOU WANT MOKUBA.

00:18:16.354 --> 00:18:20.225
NOW, TURN HIM OVER,
OR FACE THE SAME FATE
AS THOSE GUARDS.

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:25.864
[LAUGHS]

00:18:25.864 --> 00:18:28.566
YUGI, I'M IMPRESSED.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:29.901
HUH?

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.437
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
YOU WERE JUST ANOTHER BOY

00:18:32.437 --> 00:18:34.205
WHO SHOWED SOME FAINT
DUELING PROMISE.

00:18:34.205 --> 00:18:38.143
BUT WITH MY GENTLE GUIDANCE,
WELL, JUST LOOK AT YOU NOW.

00:18:38.143 --> 00:18:42.147
YOU'RE ONE STEP AWAY
FROM BECOMING WORLD CHAMPION.

00:18:42.147 --> 00:18:44.349
YOU'VE BEEN TO
THE SHADOW REALM AND BACK.

00:18:44.349 --> 00:18:47.852
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
YOU'VE FINALLY
BEGUN TO MASTER

00:18:47.852 --> 00:18:51.022
THE POWER OF YOUR
MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.
AND YOU SEE, YUGI BOY,

00:18:51.022 --> 00:18:54.326
FOR ME, THAT'S WHAT
THIS WHOLE TOURNAMENT
HAS BEEN ABOUT.

00:18:54.326 --> 00:18:57.762
FOR I PLAN TO TAKE
POSSESSION OF YOUR PUZZLE.

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:59.497
MY PUZZLE?

00:18:59.497 --> 00:19:00.799
NO!

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:04.202
YES! YOU AND I WILL
FINISH THIS CONTEST

00:19:04.202 --> 00:19:06.171
IN THE SHADOW REALM, YUGI.

00:19:06.171 --> 00:19:09.708
AND THIS TIME,
IT'S WINNER TAKE ALL!
