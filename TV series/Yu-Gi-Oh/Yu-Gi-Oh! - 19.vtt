00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:56.803
Bakura: GOOD LUCK!

00:07:56.803 --> 00:07:58.972
Both: QUIET, FOOLS.
TIME TO DUEL.

00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:01.808

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:06.980
[THINKING] HUH?
WHY WOULD HE
PLAY THAT CARD?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.548
IT DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE ANY ATTACK POINTS.

00:08:08.548 --> 00:08:10.016
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:13.487
WHAT'S THAT?

00:08:13.487 --> 00:08:14.588
LOOK, THE FLOOR!

00:08:14.588 --> 00:08:17.290
SOMETHING'S
COMING OUT
OF IT!

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:21.261
STRIKE THAT.
A WHOLE BUNCH
OF THINGS

00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:23.029
ARE COMING
OUT OF IT.

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:27.000
A MAZE?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.903
QUITE RIGHT,
AND UNLESS YOU CAN
NAVIGATE IT CORRECTLY,

00:08:29.903 --> 00:08:31.972
YOU'LL BE LOST IN
ITS PASSAGEWAYS FOREVER.

00:08:31.972 --> 00:08:35.075
Both: NOW! NO MORE QUESTIONS.
NO MORE STALLS.

00:08:35.075 --> 00:08:36.943
MAKE YOUR MOVE,
THE LABYRINTH CALLS.

00:08:40.914 --> 00:08:42.783
[THINKING] SOON PEGASUS
WILL BE SORRY

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:45.819
FOR THE PAIN HE'S CAUSED
ME AND MY BROTHER.

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:54.828
DOESN'T HE REALIZE
THAT NOTHING
WILL STOP ME

00:08:54.828 --> 00:08:56.630
FROM GETTING HIM BACK?

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:03.136
WELL, HE'LL
SOON FIND OUT.

00:09:04.204 --> 00:09:06.072
MAKE YOUR
MOVE! GO!
NOW! NOW! GO!

00:09:06.072 --> 00:09:07.574
Joey: HOLD YOUR
HORSES ALREADY!

00:09:07.574 --> 00:09:10.143
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
THIS TAG TEAM THING WORKS.

00:09:10.143 --> 00:09:11.344
IT'S SIMPLE.
WE ALL START

00:09:11.344 --> 00:09:13.647
WITH 2000 LIFE POINTS
LIKE ANY DUEL.

00:09:13.647 --> 00:09:17.517
HOWEVER, IF JUST
ONE DUELIST LOSES
THOSE 2000 POINTS,

00:09:17.517 --> 00:09:20.120
THEN HIS TEAMMATE
LOSES WITH HIM.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.190
[THINKING] MAN.
YUGI'S PUTTIN' A LOT
OF FAITH IN ME.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.658
I CAN'T
LET HIM DOWN.

00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:27.027
THE PLAYERS ON EACH TEAM
WILL ALTERNATE TURNS

00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:29.196
WITH EVERY PASSING ROUND.
IT IS SIMPLE.

00:09:29.196 --> 00:09:30.764
I WILL PLAY, THEN YUGI,

00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:33.133
THEN MY BROTHER, THEN JOEY,
THEN BACK TO ME.

00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:36.703
NOW, AS FOR
THE ACTUAL GAME PLAY
IN THE LABYRINTH ARENA,

00:09:36.703 --> 00:09:38.438
IT, TOO, IS QUITE SIMPLE.

00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:40.507
ALL MONSTERS YOU SUMMON
DURING THIS MATCH

00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:42.642
WILL ACT LIKE PIECES
ON A GAME BOARD.

00:09:42.642 --> 00:09:45.145
AS FOR MOVING,
EACH MONSTER CAN MOVE

00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:47.481
THE NUMBER OF SPACES
EQUAL TO ITS POWER LEVEL.

00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:49.149
[CHIRPS]

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:52.986
AND WHILE YOUR
GAME PIECES ARE MOVING,
OURS WILL BE MOVING, TOO.

00:09:52.986 --> 00:09:55.956
FINALLY, IF YOU SOMEHOW
MANAGE TO GET PAST OUR CREATURES

00:09:55.956 --> 00:09:57.791
AND FIND YOUR WAY
THROUGH THE MAZE,

00:09:57.791 --> 00:10:00.994
YOUR REWARD WILL BE
A CHOICE OF 2 DOORS.

00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:02.963
HMM.

00:10:02.963 --> 00:10:04.397
SELECT THE
CORRECT DOOR,

00:10:04.397 --> 00:10:06.600
AND FIND THE PATH
TO FREEDOM
AND FRESH AIR.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.969
SELECT THE WRONG DOOR,
AND FIND ONLY DESPAIR.

00:10:08.969 --> 00:10:11.304
AAH! I'VE
HAD JUST
ABOUT ENOUGH

00:10:11.304 --> 00:10:13.006
OF ALL YOUR
LAME-BRAIN
RHYMIN'.

00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:14.274
AND WHAT
DO YA MEAN,

00:10:14.274 --> 00:10:16.476
ONE DOOR LEADS
TO DESPAIR?
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:10:16.476 --> 00:10:18.478
Both: OK, THEN.

00:10:18.478 --> 00:10:20.480
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CLUE.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.850
WHILE EVERYTHING
ONE OF US TELLS YOU
SHALL BE TRUE...

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.953
...THE OTHER
WILL SPEAK NOTHING
BUT LIES TO YOU.

00:10:28.154 --> 00:10:29.389
[YUGI THINKING]
TRUTHS AND LIES?

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:30.657
WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

00:10:30.657 --> 00:10:33.326
[PEGASUS LAUGHS]
COME NOW, YUGI.

00:10:35.495 --> 00:10:39.332
IT'S JUST A RIDDLE,
AND YOU HAD BETTER SOLVE IT.

00:10:39.332 --> 00:10:41.968
OTHERWISE, YOU WON'T
SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY

00:10:41.968 --> 00:10:44.371
OR YOUR GRANDPA EVER AGAIN!

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:49.368
FROM THIS POINT FORWARD,

00:10:49.368 --> 00:10:51.804
ONE OF US WILL SPEAK
NOTHING BUT THE TOTAL TRUTH.

00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:54.240
AND THE OTHER WILL
SPEAK EVERYTHING
BUT THE TRUTH.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.509
SO, YOU SEE,
IT IS QUITE SIMPLE.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:58.477
TO LEARN WHICH
OF THE 2 IS
THE RIGHT DOOR...

00:10:58.477 --> 00:11:00.713
...YOU HAVE ONLY
TO ASK, NOTHING MORE.

00:11:00.713 --> 00:11:02.481
WAIT.
HMM?

00:11:02.481 --> 00:11:05.084
WHAT IF YOU'RE
LYING TO ME
RIGHT NOW?

00:11:05.084 --> 00:11:07.386
NO, I
NEVER LIE.

00:11:09.488 --> 00:11:11.090
DON'T BE FOOLED!

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.758
MY DOOR IS MOST
CERTAINLY THE DOOR

00:11:12.758 --> 00:11:14.493
THAT WILL
GUARANTEE YOU'RE FREED.

00:11:14.493 --> 00:11:17.730

IS THE DOOR THAT'LL
GRANT SAFE PASSAGE,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.498
IF THEY'D ONLY HEED.

00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:21.300
[THINKING]
WAIT A SEC.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.068
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
AN OLD RIDDLE I KNOW.

00:11:23.068 --> 00:11:25.905
SURE, THE LIAR,
THE TRUTH TELLER,

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:27.706
THE CHOOSING BETWEEN
2 DIRECTIONS...

00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:29.308
BUT HOW'D
THE REST OF IT GO?

00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:31.377
HEY, YUGI, I THINK
I KNOW THIS RIDDLE.

00:11:31.377 --> 00:11:33.846
IT STARTS WITH
A FORK IN THE ROAD.
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:11:33.846 --> 00:11:34.947
THERE'S THIS KID
TRYING TO GET

00:11:34.947 --> 00:11:36.482
TO THE VILLAGE
OF TRUTH-TELLERS.

00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:39.285
THING IS, THERE'S
A VILLAGE OF LIARS
RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:40.686
THE KID DOESN'T KNOW
WHICH WAY TO GO,

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:42.688
SO HE ASKS A VILLAGER
FOR DIRECTIONS.

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:47.092
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW
IF THIS VILLAGER'S FROM
TRUTHVILLE OR LIARSBERG.

00:11:47.092 --> 00:11:49.995
SO, THE VILLAGER GUY
SAYS HE'LL ANSWER
ONE QUESTION,

00:11:49.995 --> 00:11:51.263
AND THAT'S THE RIDDLE.

00:11:51.263 --> 00:11:53.265
WHAT SHOULD THE KID ASK
TO GET TO TRUTHVILLE?

00:11:53.265 --> 00:11:56.602
SO, THE KID ASKS THE GUY
TO TAKE HIM TO
HIS OWN VILLAGE.

00:11:56.602 --> 00:11:59.205
'CAUSE A TRUTHFUL GUY
WOULD HAVE TO TAKE HIM
TO THE VILLAGE OF TRUTH,

00:11:59.205 --> 00:12:00.739
ON ACCOUNT
OF BEING TRUTHFUL,

00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:02.174
AND A LIAR WOULD
HAVE TO TAKE HIM

00:12:02.174 --> 00:12:05.177
TO THE VILLAGE
OF TRUTH, TOO,
'CAUSE THAT'D BE LYIN'.

00:12:05.177 --> 00:12:07.446
SO, FIRST
WE GOTTA FIND OUT

00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:08.914
WHICH ONE OF YOU
TELLS THE TRUTH.

00:12:08.914 --> 00:12:10.149
THEN PROCEED.

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:12.651
IN FACT, WE'LL ALLOW YOU
EACH ONE QUESTION.

00:12:12.651 --> 00:12:14.887
OK, LIKE
THE KID IN RIDDLE

00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:16.322
ASKED THE GUY
TO SHOW HIM HIS VILLAGE,

00:12:16.322 --> 00:12:19.358
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS ASK YOU TO SHOW ME
YOUR DOOR.

00:12:19.358 --> 00:12:23.829
SO BOTH OF YA,
SHOW ME THE DOOR
THAT YOUR GUARDIN'.

00:12:25.397 --> 00:12:27.533
[THINKING] HA!
NOW THE TRUTHFUL GUY'LL

00:12:27.533 --> 00:12:29.401
HAVE TO POINT
TO HIS OWN DOOR,

00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:32.137
AND THE LIAR
WILL HAVE TO POINT
TO THE OTHER GUY'S DOOR.

00:12:36.475 --> 00:12:37.943
BINGO!

00:12:40.479 --> 00:12:44.516
WORKED LIKE A CHARM.
PARA'S THE LIAR,
DOX TELLS THE TRUTH.

00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:46.252
NOW YUGI JUST
HAS TO ASK DOX

00:12:46.252 --> 00:12:48.621
WHICH DOOR
LEADS OUTTA HERE
AND WE'RE SET.

00:12:50.522 --> 00:12:52.625
[THINKING] HMM,
I DON'T KNOW.

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:54.460
THAT SEEMED
A LITTLE TOO EASY.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.128
YO, YUGE.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE

00:12:56.128 --> 00:12:57.496
SOMETHIN' FOR
THE EFFORT, HERE?

00:12:57.496 --> 00:12:59.331
I HATE TO
DISAPPOINT YOU, JOEY,

00:12:59.331 --> 00:13:02.034
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE'VE SOLVED THIS RIDDLE
JUST YET.

00:13:02.034 --> 00:13:05.104
IN FACT, I THINK
WE'RE GOING DOWN

00:13:05.104 --> 00:13:07.640
THE WRONG ROAD OURSELVES,
SO TO SPEAK.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.975
BUT I TOLD YA,
YUGE. I HEARD
THIS ONE BEFORE.

00:13:09.975 --> 00:13:12.711
YOUR RIDDLE HAS SOME THINGS
IN COMMON WITH OUR PRESENT
PREDICAMENT,

00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:14.246
BUT THERE ARE
SOME KEY DIFFERENCES,

00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:16.382
AND TRUST ME, JOEY,
THOSE KEY DIFFERENCES

00:13:16.382 --> 00:13:18.717
CHANGE THE ENTIRE NATURE
OF THE PROBLEM.

00:13:18.717 --> 00:13:20.019
HUH?

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:22.454
Yugi: IN YOUR RIDDLE,
THERE WAS ONLY ONE PERSON

00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:24.123
TO QUESTION
AT THE CROSSROADS,

00:13:24.123 --> 00:13:26.492
BUT IN OUR SITUATION,
WE HAVE 2,

00:13:26.492 --> 00:13:28.027
PARA AND DOX.

00:13:28.027 --> 00:13:31.864
NOW, BOTH PARA AND DOX
HAVE TOLD US THE EXACT
SAME THING.

00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:34.366
ONE OF THEM WILL SPEAK
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:37.369
AND THE OTHER WILL SPEAK
NOTHING BUT LIES.

00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:39.605
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH THAT ALREADY.

00:13:39.605 --> 00:13:41.607
[BOTH MOAN]

00:13:41.607 --> 00:13:44.243
Yugi: BECAUSE IF THEY WERE,
AS THEY SAID,

00:13:44.243 --> 00:13:46.445
ONE TRUTH-TELLER
AND ONE LIAR,

00:13:46.445 --> 00:13:48.113
THE LIAR COULD NEVER
ADMIT TO IT.

00:13:48.113 --> 00:13:50.015
THAT WOULD BE TELLING
THE TRUTH.

00:13:50.015 --> 00:13:52.117
THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD
BOTH MAKE THAT STATEMENT

00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:54.153
IS IF THEY WERE BOTH LYING,

00:13:54.153 --> 00:13:58.223
AND THAT MEANS WE CAN'T
TRUST EITHER PARA, DOX,
OR THEIR RIDDLE.

00:13:58.223 --> 00:14:00.159
WOW.
MY BRAIN HURTS.

00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:01.860
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, JOEY.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.797
THAT RIDDLE WAS JUST
MEANT TO THROW US
OFF COURSE.

00:14:04.797 --> 00:14:06.098

00:14:06.098 --> 00:14:07.666
AND FIGURE OUT

LATER.

I'VE NEVER PLAYED
ON A LABYRINTH FIELD BEFORE.

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:21.947
I'LL GO FIRST,

00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:23.649
WITH MY BEAVER WARRIOR.

A RAT FOR A MAZE.

RUNNING OUT.

ALREADY IN TOO FAR.

00:15:05.758 --> 00:15:07.893
REAPING CLAW SLASH!

00:15:09.161 --> 00:15:10.429
UHH!
UNH!

00:15:10.429 --> 00:15:12.431
GOOD-BYE, BEAVER WARRIOR.

00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:14.933
[SNARLS]

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:17.169
OH, IT CAME
OUT OF THE WALL,

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:18.804
AND NOW
IT'S GOING BACK,

00:15:18.804 --> 00:15:21.039
WHERE OUR GUYS
CAN'T GET AT IT.

00:15:22.741 --> 00:15:24.176
VERY LETHAL.

00:15:24.176 --> 00:15:26.912
THEY'RE CHEATIN'!
IT MOVED TOO MANY
SPACES!

00:15:26.912 --> 00:15:28.147
ON THE CONTRARY.

00:15:28.147 --> 00:15:30.516
THE WALL SHADOW
DIDN'T MOVE ANY SPACES.

00:15:30.516 --> 00:15:32.050
IT MOVED ON THE WALL.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.920
THAT'S RIGHT,
AND THE WALL DOESN'T
HAVE ANY SPACES.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.954
[GROWLS]

00:15:35.954 --> 00:15:37.589
[THINKING] THIS IS NOT GOOD.

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:40.659
OUR MONSTERS
HAVE TO COUNT SPACES
AS THEY WALK THE MAZE,

00:15:40.659 --> 00:15:43.862
WHILE THEIR WALL SHADOW CAN
MOVE THROUGH THE MAZE WALLS,

00:15:43.862 --> 00:15:46.865
AND THAT MEANS HE CAN STRIKE
WHEN WE LEAST EXPECT IT.

00:15:52.095 --> 00:15:55.265
SO, NOW YOU KNOW OUR STRATEGY
IS UNLEASHING A MONSTER

00:15:55.265 --> 00:15:56.767
THAT YOU CANNOT SEE.

00:15:56.767 --> 00:15:58.435
YOU FOOLS!
YOU WON'T KNOW

00:15:58.435 --> 00:16:00.637
WHEN THE WALL SHADOW
IS ABOUT TO LAND
A BLOW.

00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:01.738
HA.

00:16:01.738 --> 00:16:03.207
WE'LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:05.309
AXE RAIDER
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:16:06.777 --> 00:16:10.180
AND I'LL ALSO
PLACE ONE OTHER CARD
FACEDOWN ON THE FIELD.

00:16:12.082 --> 00:16:13.884
[GRUNTS]

00:16:13.884 --> 00:16:17.621
Joey: BUT SINCE I CAN'T SEE
YOUR SHIFTY, LITTLE MONSTER,
I CAN'T ATTACK IT,

00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.523
SO I WON'T ADVANCE
AT ALL THIS TIME.

00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:22.192
I'LL JUST KEEP AXE RAIDER
AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WALL

00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:24.328
AND YOUR SNEAKY WEASEL
AS POSSIBLE,

00:16:24.328 --> 00:16:28.332
AND I'LL STILL BE READY
TO ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT,
RIGHT?

00:16:28.332 --> 00:16:30.400
RIGHT. THAT'S
A GOOD MOVE, JOEY.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.936
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
FAR AWAY FROM THE WALL,

00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:35.572
YOU CAN AVOID
ANY SNEAK ATTACK
BY THE WALL SHADOW.

00:16:35.572 --> 00:16:37.541
[THINKING] SO FAR, SO GOOD.

00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:39.309
I HAVEN'T COST US
ANY LIFE POINTS.

00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:40.711
GOOD MOVE.

00:16:40.711 --> 00:16:42.713
I HOPE JOEY
CAN KEEP THIS UP.

00:16:42.713 --> 00:16:43.981
DON'T SWEAT IT.

00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:46.483
WITH YUGI
AS HIS PARTNER,
JOEY CAN'T LOSE.

00:16:46.483 --> 00:16:47.784
Tristan: I HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:16:47.784 --> 00:16:48.885
HUH?
HUH?

00:16:48.885 --> 00:16:50.554
THIS TAG TEAM STUFF
IS TRICKY

00:16:50.554 --> 00:16:53.290
'CAUSE THEY CAN FOCUS
ON ATTACKING THE WEAKEST
DUELIST FIRST.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.591
Téa: YOU MEAN JOEY.

00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:55.859
MY TURN,

00:16:55.859 --> 00:16:58.228
AND I LAY THIS CARD
FACEDOWN.

00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:00.130
JIRAI GUMO.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.666
[THINKING]
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
ANY OPPOSING MONSTER

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:05.435
THAT STEPS ON THE SPACE
WITH JIRAI GUMO'S SYMBOL

00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:08.605
WILL INSTANTLY FALL VICTIM
TO ITS FATAL SURPRISE.

00:17:08.605 --> 00:17:10.140
HA HA HA HA!

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.577
I'LL ALSO LAY
THE LABYRINTH TANK
IN ATTACK MODE

00:17:13.577 --> 00:17:15.812
AND MOVE IT FORWARD
7 SPACES.

00:17:21.318 --> 00:17:23.120
Para: GOOD JOB,
BROTHER.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.289
THAT SHOULD
HELP TRAP THEM
WITHIN OUR MAZE.

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:26.823
THANK YOU, BROTHER.

00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:28.792
IT'S MY TURN.

00:17:30.827 --> 00:17:34.331
I PLAY THE CELTIC GUARDIAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:17:34.331 --> 00:17:36.066
[SNARLS]

00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:38.535
ADVANCES 4 PACES
INTO THE MAZE.

00:17:39.836 --> 00:17:41.938
BUT THE CELTIC GUARDIAN'S
ATTACK STRENGTH

00:17:41.938 --> 00:17:44.641
IS MUCH LOWER
THAN THAT OF WALL SHADOW'S.

00:17:44.641 --> 00:17:45.842
THEN HE'LL BE
WIPED OUT.

00:17:45.842 --> 00:17:47.144
HYAH!

00:17:47.144 --> 00:17:49.680
Both: HYA-YA-YA-YAH!

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.149
YOU FOOL!
DID YOU NOT LEARN ANYTHING?

00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:56.186
WALL SHADOW,
ATTACK CELTIC GUARDIAN NOW!

00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:57.387
[SNARLS]

00:17:58.655 --> 00:18:00.190
YOUR GUARDIAN IS DOOMED,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.958
AND YOUR LIFE POINTS
WITH IT.

00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:07.698
[SNARLS]

00:18:07.698 --> 00:18:09.199
HMM. I'M AFRAID NOT.

00:18:09.199 --> 00:18:10.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.169
Joey: KUNAI WITH CHAIN!

00:18:12.169 --> 00:18:13.170
WHAT IS THIS?

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.672
Joey: MY TRAP CARD WORKED!

00:18:15.672 --> 00:18:17.941
REEL HIM IN, AXE RAIDER!

00:18:20.177 --> 00:18:22.412
HA HA. THE CARD I PLAYED
FACEDOWN BEFORE

00:18:22.412 --> 00:18:24.948
WAS A TRAP CARD--
KUNAI WITH CHAIN.

00:18:24.948 --> 00:18:27.117
IT CAPTURES ANY OPPONENT
THAT ATTACKS.

00:18:27.117 --> 00:18:29.386
I LAID THAT TRAP CARD
TO HELP YUGI.

00:18:29.386 --> 00:18:32.222
IT RAISED THE CELTIC
GUARDIAN'S ATTACK POWER
BY 500,

00:18:32.222 --> 00:18:34.424
PUTTING
IT'S STRENGTH HIGHER
THAN WALL SHADOW'S.

00:18:34.424 --> 00:18:38.362
Yugi: CELTIC GUARDIAN,
ATTACK WALL SHADOW!

00:18:39.896 --> 00:18:41.898
Joey: SO,
NOW IT'S LIGHTS OUT
FOR YOUR SHADOW.

00:18:41.898 --> 00:18:43.400
N-NO!

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.002
Both: WALL SHADOW IS BEATEN!

00:18:46.002 --> 00:18:47.404
HEE HEE HEE HEE.

00:18:47.404 --> 00:18:48.972
WHAT A TEAM!

00:18:48.972 --> 00:18:51.641
YEAH, THEY'RE
WORKING TOGETHER TO BEAT
THOSE WACKY BROTHERS.

00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:54.745
[THINKING]
JOEY'S REALLY GETTING
TO BE A MUCH BETTER PLAYER.

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:56.113
HE'S THINKING STRATEGICALLY.

00:18:56.113 --> 00:18:59.449
AAH! TO STOP OUR DECLINE,
THESE TWO WE MUST HALT!

00:18:59.449 --> 00:19:01.918
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

00:19:01.918 --> 00:19:04.888
HA. IF WE KEEP THIS UP,
WE'LL WIN THIS DOUBLE
DUEL

00:19:04.888 --> 00:19:06.857
AND HAVE ENOUGH
STAR CHIPS TO ENTER
THE CASTLE.

00:19:06.857 --> 00:19:08.091
TEAMWORK, YUGI!

00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:10.093
RIGHT,
BUT WE HAVEN'T WON YET.

00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:11.661
WE'VE GOT TO KEEP
ON OUR GUARD

00:19:11.661 --> 00:19:14.030
IF WE'RE GOING TO BEAT
THE PARADOX BROTHERS

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.502
AND WIN OUR WAY
OUT OF THIS TWISTED,
UNDERGROUND LABYRINTH.

00:19:18.502 --> 00:19:19.936
A TOAST TO YUGI

00:19:19.936 --> 00:19:21.772
FOR WINNING THE FIRST ROUND

00:19:21.772 --> 00:19:24.608
WITH THE HELP
OF HIS LITTLE PAL JOEY.

00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:25.842
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:19:25.842 --> 00:19:27.511
HMM?

00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:28.912
MASTER PEGASUS,

00:19:28.912 --> 00:19:32.549
A THOUSAND PARDONS
FOR INTERRUPTING,
YOUR GREATNESS.

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:36.787
I'M GROWING TIRED OF YOUR
CONSTANT INTERRUPTIONS,
CROQUET.

00:19:36.787 --> 00:19:38.588
I THOUGHT YOU'D
WANT TO KNOW

00:19:38.588 --> 00:19:40.557
SETO KAIBA'S
BEEN SPOTTED
ON THE ISLAND.

00:19:40.557 --> 00:19:42.392
I ALREADY KNOW THAT,

00:19:42.392 --> 00:19:44.628
WHY ARE YOU,
THE HEAD OF MY SECURITY,

00:19:44.628 --> 00:19:47.063
ALWAYS THE LAST
TO LEARN THESE THINGS?

00:19:47.063 --> 00:19:49.199
DON'T WORRY.
KAIBA WILL COME TO US.

00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:50.934
AFTER ALL,

00:19:50.934 --> 00:19:52.803
WE HAVE THE BAIT.

TO YOU, BROTHER?

YOU SAID YOU'D ALWAYS
BE HERE FOR ME.

WELL, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:20:06.016 --> 00:20:08.318
YOU NEVER FAILED ME BEFORE.

00:20:08.318 --> 00:20:10.554
GIVE IT BACK!
GIVE IT TO ME!

[SOBS]

00:20:12.556 --> 00:20:13.690
AAAAH!

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.058
I GIVE! I GIVE!

00:20:15.058 --> 00:20:16.259
HERE, MOKUBA.

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:17.594
THANKS.

00:20:21.498 --> 00:20:23.900
[THINKING] YOU ALWAYS
COME THROUGH FOR ME,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.902
SO WHERE ARE YOU NOW, SETO?

00:20:25.902 --> 00:20:27.804
WHY HAVEN'T YOU FOUND ME?

00:20:27.804 --> 00:20:29.039
I NEED YOU!

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:31.208
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
STOPPED PEGASUS?

[THINKING]
I'M COMING, MOKUBA.

00:20:38.014 --> 00:20:39.850
I'M COMING TO SAVE YOU,

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.285
AND IF PEGASUS TRIES
TO GET IN MY WAY,

00:20:42.285 --> 00:20:43.286
HE'LL LIVE TO REGRET IT.
