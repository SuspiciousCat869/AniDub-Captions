00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.253
THAT'S DANGEROUS.

00:07:07.253 --> 00:07:09.189
OH, YEAH?
WELL, I CAN TAKE
CARE OF MYSELF,

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.291
AND IF NOT,
I'VE GOT TEDDY
TO PROTECT ME.

00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:13.159
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
TEDDY?

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:14.794

I, REBECCA,

I'VE TRAVELED THE WORLD

[GIGGLES]

I REMEMBER READING
SOMETHING.

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:08.448
AN ARTICLE,
JUST BEFORE WE LEFT

ABOUT A DUEL MONSTERS

A MAJOR SENSATION.

WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:25.331
ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY DUELING CREDENTIALS, PAL?

00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:27.133
HEY, DON'T
GIVE ME ANY LIP!

SECOND IN
THE DUELIST KINGDOM

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.572
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:08:32.572 --> 00:08:34.607
YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SPELL "CREDENTIALS."

00:08:34.607 --> 00:08:35.642
KNOCK IT OFF.

00:08:35.642 --> 00:08:36.909

TO BE ON MY SIDE.

BUT, REBECCA,
I'M CONFUSED.

00:08:55.628 --> 00:08:57.797
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOUR CHAMPIONSHIP
ENTITLES YOU

TO MY BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON CARD?

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:01.601
NO, I DON'T THINK THAT.

00:09:01.601 --> 00:09:03.503

WHEE! THANK YOU, TEDDY!

00:13:09.681 --> 00:13:12.083
HMM.

00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:18.222
MM.

00:13:18.222 --> 00:13:19.724
WELL, I'M WAITING.

00:13:19.724 --> 00:13:21.125
ARE YOU GONNA PLAY
OR WHAT?

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:24.028
HEY, DON'T YOU DISTRACT ME
WHEN I'M THINKING!

00:13:24.028 --> 00:13:27.065
WHAT NEXT? DECISIONS,
DECISIONS, DECISIONS.

00:13:27.065 --> 00:13:30.068
THAT KID COULD
DRIVE YOU CRAZY
REALLY EASILY.

00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:32.704
OH, I GUESS I'M STUCK
WITH THIS ONE.

00:13:32.704 --> 00:13:34.439
HMM...HERE WE GO.

00:13:35.773 --> 00:13:37.675
I PLAY SANGAN
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:13:41.212 --> 00:13:44.215
AWW, HE'S SO CUTE,
ISN'T HE?

00:13:44.215 --> 00:13:45.416
NOT FOR LONG.

00:13:45.416 --> 00:13:47.051
YOU CAN KISS SANGAN
GOOD-BYE!

00:13:47.051 --> 00:13:48.052
OH!

00:13:48.052 --> 00:13:49.520
CELTIC GUARDIAN,
ATTACK!

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.825
UHH--UHH!

00:13:53.825 --> 00:13:56.027
THAT CELTIC GUARDIAN
SENT MY POOR SANGAN

00:13:56.027 --> 00:13:57.829
TO THE GRAVEYARD, TOO.

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:59.097
YOU'RE SO MEAN!

00:13:59.097 --> 00:14:00.631
GIMME A BREAK.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:03.701
I'M NOT BEING MEAN.
I'M JUST PLAYING
THE GAME.

00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:05.336
DID YOU HEAR THAT, TEDDY?

00:14:05.336 --> 00:14:07.405
NASTY OLD YUGI
IS YELLING AT ME.

00:14:07.405 --> 00:14:09.407
AND I'M NOT YELLING
AT YOU!

00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:11.943
HUH? WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:13.845
WE HAVEN'T LOST
JUST YET, TEDDY?

00:14:13.845 --> 00:14:15.646
IF SANGAN GOES
TO THE GRAVEYARD

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:18.082
I CAN PULL
A NEW MONSTER?

00:14:18.082 --> 00:14:20.451
MM-HMM. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:14:20.451 --> 00:14:21.452
HMM?

00:14:21.452 --> 00:14:23.621
I DON'T KNOW.
THAT GIRL'S WEIRD.

00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:26.090
GENIUSES ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE ECCENTRIC, YOU KNOW.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.226
COME ON YOU GUYS.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'.

00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:29.660
THAT LITTLE TWERP'S
NO GENIUS.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.028
SHE'S JUST A NUT CASE.

00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:33.798
[THINKING]
HMM...REBECCA'S STRATEGY IS

00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:36.801
STRANGELY FAMILIAR TO ME.

00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:39.103
NOW, LET'S GET DOWN
TO BUSINESS.

00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:40.304
KID GLOVES ARE OFF.

00:14:40.304 --> 00:14:42.807
YOU'VE MET YOUR MATCH, YUGI.

00:14:42.807 --> 00:14:46.110
SUDDENLY SHE'S A LOT
MORE SERIOUS.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.781
I PLAY A MAGIC CARD,
TRIBUTE TO THE DOOMED!

00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:52.717
IT LETS ME
THROW AWAY ONE CARD
FROM MY OWN HAND.

00:14:52.717 --> 00:14:54.452
IN EXCHANGE,
I GET TO WIPE OUT

00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:57.722
ONE OF MY OPPONENT'S MONSTERS
FROM THE FIELD.

00:14:57.722 --> 00:15:00.558
HEH...JUST WATCH!

00:15:06.063 --> 00:15:09.100
CELTIC GUARDIAN
WENT BYE-BYE.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.570
AND TO FINISH MY TURN,
I PLAY ONE MORE CARD
IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:15:14.572 --> 00:15:16.340
HMM.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.708
MM-HMM.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.111
HERE IS WHERE THINGS START
TO GET INTERESTING, YUGI.

00:15:20.111 --> 00:15:22.313
MARK MY WORDS--
THE BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON

00:15:22.313 --> 00:15:23.481
WILL BE MINE AGAIN!

00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:25.183
AM I HAVING
HALLUCINATIONS,

00:15:25.183 --> 00:15:28.019
OR DID SHE JUST PUT ON
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
PERSONALITY?

00:15:28.019 --> 00:15:29.520
UH-UH. SHE'S
A LOT SMARTER

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.822
THAN SHE LED US
TO BELIEVE.

00:15:30.822 --> 00:15:32.423
WATCH OUT
FOR HER, YUGI.

00:15:32.423 --> 00:15:33.424
YEAH.

00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:34.725
[THINKING]
TéA'S RIGHT.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:36.561
THAT LITTLE KID STUFF
WAS JUST AN ACT.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.496
REBECCA'S A SERIOUS
DUELIST.

00:15:38.496 --> 00:15:40.231
ALL RIGHT, REBECCA...

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.434
I ATTACK
WITH SUMMONED SKULL!

00:15:46.671 --> 00:15:48.940
BIG MISTAKE, YUGI.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.076
THE CARD I PLAYED
WAS THE MILLENNIUM SHIELD.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:53.578
THE MILLENNIUM SHIELD!

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.446
IT HAS 3,000 DEFENSE POINTS,

00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:59.250
AND YOUR SKULL ONLY HAS
2,500 ATTACK POINTS.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.451
HA HA HA HA!

00:16:00.451 --> 00:16:02.887
SO YOU LOSE
500 LIFE POINTS!

00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:11.550
Rebecca: WHEE!
YUGI'S DOWN 500 POINTS!

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.752
HEY, THAT LITTLE SQUIRT
CAN ACTUALLY DUEL.

00:16:13.752 --> 00:16:15.821
SOMEONE'S TRAINED HER
VERY WELL.

00:16:15.821 --> 00:16:17.923
[THINKING]
WAIT. I'VE SEEN
THAT CARD BEFORE,

00:16:17.923 --> 00:16:20.225
WITH ITS OVERWHELMING
DEFENSE POWER.

00:16:20.225 --> 00:16:22.428
I REMEMBER NOW.

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:24.630
IT'S CALLED
THE MILLENNIUM SHIELD.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.298
INTERESTING CARD,
ISN'T IT?

00:16:26.298 --> 00:16:27.900
IT CERTAINLY IS.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.803
YOUR DEFENSE
IS NOW IMPENETRABLE,
PROFESSOR HAWKINS.

00:16:30.803 --> 00:16:32.805
AUTHUR. CALL ME ARTHUR.

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:36.542
Grandpa, thinking: IT WAS
AT AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIG
IN EGYPT SO MANY YEARS AGO

00:16:36.542 --> 00:16:38.377
THAT I'D NEARLY FORGOTTEN.

00:16:38.377 --> 00:16:39.845
BUT ALMOST CARD FOR CARD,

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:42.047
MY FRIEND
PROFESSOR HAWKINS AND I

00:16:42.047 --> 00:16:43.549
PLAYED THIS SAME DUEL.

00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:47.052
WHY ARE YOU SO SURPRISED
THAT I WON THAT LAST EXCHANGE?

00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:49.254
I TOLD YOU I WAS
A CHILD PRODIGY.

00:16:49.254 --> 00:16:51.557
THIS DUEL HAS BEEN
EASY SO FAR.

00:16:51.557 --> 00:16:53.759
[AS TEDDY]
RRRRUFF HIM UP, REBECCA!

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:54.994
RIGHT, TEDDY!

00:16:54.994 --> 00:16:58.464
I PLAY A MAGIC CARD:
RING OF MAGNETISM.

00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:04.670
NOW WHY WOULD
SHE PLAY THAT?

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.838
[THINKING] HMM.

00:17:05.838 --> 00:17:07.673
COMBINING IT WITH
THE MILLENNIUM SHIELD

00:17:07.673 --> 00:17:09.174
ACTUALLY WEAKENS
THE SHIELD'S

00:17:09.174 --> 00:17:10.943
OVERWHELMING
DEFENSIVE POWER.

00:17:10.943 --> 00:17:12.544
HA HA! POOR YUGI.

00:17:12.544 --> 00:17:14.446
HE'S CONFUSED, TEDDY.

00:17:14.446 --> 00:17:16.115
HEE HEE HEE!

00:17:16.115 --> 00:17:18.083
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:20.519
NOTHING. I'M GOING
TO PASS THIS TURN.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:23.622
AHA! HE'S TAKING
A WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE.

00:17:23.622 --> 00:17:26.325
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T THINK
OF A MOVE, I CAN.

00:17:26.325 --> 00:17:28.427
CANNON SOLDIER,
ATTACK MODE!

00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:34.133
BE VERY CAREFUL, YUGI!

00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:35.200
HUH?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.002
IF SHE SACRIFICES
A MONSTER NEXT,

00:17:37.002 --> 00:17:38.837
SHE CAN TURN
CANNON SOLDIER'S ASSAULT

00:17:38.837 --> 00:17:40.939
DIRECTLY ON
YUGI'S LIFE POINTS.

00:17:40.939 --> 00:17:42.941
YEAH, BUT SHE'S NEVER
GONNA GET THE CHANCE,

00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:44.443
'CAUSE YUGI'S
SUMMONED SKULL'S

00:17:44.443 --> 00:17:46.345
GONNA BLOW
CANNON SOLDIER AWAY.

00:17:46.345 --> 00:17:47.646
Tristan: LET'S HOPE SO,

00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:50.749
OTHERWISE THAT SOLDIER
WILL DO A LOT OF DAMAGE.

00:17:50.749 --> 00:17:54.119
SUMMONED SKULL,
ATTACK CANNON SOLDIER!

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.754
LIGHTNING STRIKE!

00:17:58.257 --> 00:17:59.925
WASTE OF ENERGY.

00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:02.294
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
WITH HIS ATTACK.

00:18:05.764 --> 00:18:06.965
HUH?

00:18:06.965 --> 00:18:08.667
HA HA HA HA!
SEE?

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:11.003
THE RING OF MAGNETISM
DRAWS ALL YOUR ATTACKS

00:18:11.003 --> 00:18:12.271
TO MY MILLENNIUM SHIELD.

00:18:12.271 --> 00:18:15.107
GET IT? WHILE THE RING
OF MAGNETISM IS IN PLAY,

00:18:15.107 --> 00:18:16.508
MY MONSTERS ARE ALL SAFE,

00:18:16.508 --> 00:18:19.011
'CAUSE ALL YOU CAN ATTACK
IS MY MILLENNIUM SHIELD.

00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:21.680
AND IT'S GOT
A DEFENSE POWER OF 2,500.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.815
HA!

00:18:22.815 --> 00:18:24.249
[THINKING] UNH!
IT'S A STANDOFF.

00:18:24.249 --> 00:18:25.818
SUMMONED SKULL'S
ATTACK POWER

00:18:25.818 --> 00:18:27.820
IS EXACTLY EQUAL
TO THE DEFENSE POWER

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.288
OF HER
MILLENNIUM SHIELD.

00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:31.290
I HAVE TO BREAK THROUGH
THAT SHIELD SOMEHOW

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.558
IN ORDER TO WIN.

00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:34.827
SO, ARE YOU HAVING
A GOOD TIME, TEDDY?

00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:36.161
GOOD.

00:18:36.161 --> 00:18:38.430
'CAUSE THIS DUEL'S GONNA
GET EVEN BETTER NOW.

00:18:39.631 --> 00:18:41.166
[GIGGLES]

00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:43.669
[THINKING] OH, COOL,
IT'S THE SHADOW GHOUL.

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:45.938
THIS LITTLE BABY
WILL COME IN HANDY

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:47.172
A LITTLE LATER.

00:18:47.172 --> 00:18:48.841
BUT FOR NOW,
LET'S SUMMON

00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:50.943
ANOTHER WIMPY WITCH
OF THE BLACK FOREST,

00:18:50.943 --> 00:18:52.444
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:53.445
HUH?

00:18:53.445 --> 00:18:54.780
SO LONG, WITCH.

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.982
YOU GET USED AS A SACRIFICE
TO MY CANNON SOLDIER,

00:18:56.982 --> 00:18:58.584
SO HE CAN TURN ALL HIS POWER

00:18:58.584 --> 00:19:00.152
DIRECTLY ON
YUGI'S LIFE POINTS.

00:19:00.152 --> 00:19:02.321
[SCREAMS]

00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:04.423
CANNON SOLDIER,
YOU GOT HER ENERGY,

00:19:04.423 --> 00:19:06.925
NOW BLOW YUGI AWAY!

00:19:09.862 --> 00:19:12.397
UNH! UHH!

00:19:12.397 --> 00:19:13.665
HA HA!

00:19:13.665 --> 00:19:15.634
WELL, THAT TOOK YOU
DOWN A PEG.

00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:18.003
400 PEGS,
TO BE EXACT.

00:19:18.003 --> 00:19:20.672
AND NOW I GET TO DRAW
ANOTHER CARD.

00:19:20.672 --> 00:19:21.874
[GIGGLES]

00:19:21.874 --> 00:19:22.875
SHE'S REAL GOOD.

00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:24.309
SHE MUST'VE LEARNED
DUELING

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:26.512
FROM SOMEBODY AS EXPERIENCED
AS YOU, GRAMPS.

00:19:26.512 --> 00:19:28.280
JOEY, YOU MAY
BE RIGHT.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.315
HUH! I WAS TAUGHT
BY SOMEONE

00:19:30.315 --> 00:19:32.851
MORE TALENTED
THAN A MOTO COULD EVER BE.

00:19:32.851 --> 00:19:35.287
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS THE BEST DUELIST EVER.

00:19:35.287 --> 00:19:36.855
YOUR GRANDFATHER?

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:38.357
IS WHAT I SUSPECT TRUE?

00:19:38.357 --> 00:19:41.360
REBECCA, WHAT'S
YOUR LAST NAME?

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.062
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH
TO ASK.

00:19:44.062 --> 00:19:47.733
YES, MY NAME
IS REBECCA HAWKINS.

00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:50.369
AND MY GRANDFATHER IS
PROFESSOR ARTHUR HAWKINS,

00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:53.038
THE MAN WHOSE BLUE EYES
WHITE DRAGON YOU STOLE

00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:55.207
AND WHOSE FRIENDSHIP
YOU BETRAYED.

00:19:55.207 --> 00:19:56.275
Tristan: THAT'S CRAZY.

00:19:56.275 --> 00:19:57.276
Joey: ABSOLUTELY NUTS.

00:19:57.276 --> 00:19:58.544
YOU'RE WRONG, REBECCA.

00:19:58.544 --> 00:20:00.979
MY GRANDFATHER WOULD
NEVER BETRAY A FRIEND.

00:20:00.979 --> 00:20:02.614
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,

00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:04.650
