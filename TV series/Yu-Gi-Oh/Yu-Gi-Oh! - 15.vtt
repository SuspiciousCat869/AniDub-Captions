WHAT IF THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT

00:15:07.391 --> 00:15:08.692
HAD LOCKED IN PLACE,

00:15:08.692 --> 00:15:11.528
NOT ONLY YOUR MONSTERS,
BUT YOUR CASTLE AS WELL?

00:15:11.528 --> 00:15:13.397
THEN WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN NEXT?

00:15:13.397 --> 00:15:15.165
IT CAN'T BE!

00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:16.467
CAN IT?

00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:18.569
RIGHT NOW, THE ONLY THING
HOLDING UP YOUR CASTLE

00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:20.404
ARE THE SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT.

00:15:20.404 --> 00:15:21.905
AND WHEN THIS TURN ENDS

00:15:21.905 --> 00:15:24.408
EACH AND EVERY SWORD
WILL VANISH.

00:15:24.408 --> 00:15:25.576
BUT...THAT MEANS...

00:15:25.576 --> 00:15:26.944
IT'S OVER!

00:15:26.944 --> 00:15:29.947
AND NOW YOUR WORLD'S
ABOUT TO COME
TUMBLING DOWN.

00:15:29.947 --> 00:15:31.915
AAH! NO!

00:15:31.915 --> 00:15:34.418
NO ONE DEFEATS PANIK!

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:36.887
MY TURN IS OVER.

00:15:40.891 --> 00:15:42.726
RUN, MONSTERS!
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:44.228
IT'S NO GOOD.

00:15:44.228 --> 00:15:46.397
THE CHAOS SHIELD
IS KEEPING THEM
FROM RUNNING ANYWHERE.

00:15:46.397 --> 00:15:47.898
YOU'VE TRAPPED THEM
ALL INSIDE.

00:15:47.898 --> 00:15:50.000
AAAH!

HE WON!

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:17.728
AND PANIK'S NOT
TAKING IT WELL.

00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:18.796
I'LL SAY.

00:16:18.796 --> 00:16:21.298
PANIK'S HAVING
A PANIC ATTACK.

00:16:21.298 --> 00:16:25.302
NOBODY BEATS PANIK.
NOBODY!

00:16:27.071 --> 00:16:29.740
LOOK AT HIM,
THAT SMUG LITTLE WORM,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.543
STILL HE MOCKS ME!

00:16:32.543 --> 00:16:35.345
I MAY NOT HAVE
DEFEATED YOU, YUGI,

00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:38.615

ELIMINATE YOU!

AND HE CAN'T ESCAPE.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.059
WE'LL SEE
WHO'S THE COWARD NOW.

00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:50.160
FIRE!

NOT ONLY DID IT
PROTECT YUGI,

00:17:38.408 --> 00:17:42.179
BUT IT ALSO SAVED ALL OF US
FROM THE FLAMES, TOO.

00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:46.550
YUGI, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

DIDN'T YOU LEARN
ANYTHING FROM THIS DUEL?

YOUR DEFENSES UP.
