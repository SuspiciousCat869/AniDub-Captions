00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:48.557
IT'S MY TURN.

00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:50.493
[THINKING] HMM. OK.

00:07:50.493 --> 00:07:52.495
THE ONLY MONSTER YUGI'S
GOT ON THE FIELD

00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:54.630
IS THAT REPTILIAN LAUNCH PAD.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.899
I COULD SEND HARPY LADY
TO DESTROY IT,

00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:59.168
THEN YUGI'S LIFE POINTS
WOULD DROP TO ZERO

00:07:59.168 --> 00:08:00.536
AND I'D BE THE WINNER.

00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:03.606
BUT THERE'S THAT OTHER CARD
HE'S LAID FACE-DOWN.

00:08:03.606 --> 00:08:05.808
IF IT'S A TRAP,
I'D BE WALKING RIGHT INTO IT,

00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.276
AND THAT COULD FINISH ME.

00:08:07.276 --> 00:08:10.246
THIS IS THE TOUGHEST DECISION
I'VE HAD TO MAKE ALL GAME--

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:13.182
TO ATTACK
OR NOT TO ATTACK.

00:08:13.182 --> 00:08:14.183
[GASPS]

00:08:16.652 --> 00:08:19.355
BRING ON
YOUR ASSAULT, MAI.

00:08:20.656 --> 00:08:22.057
HMM.

00:08:24.093 --> 00:08:25.528
NOW I WILL...

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.865
NOT ATTACK.

00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:31.700
I'M NOT FALLING
INTO YOUR TRAP,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.869
AND THERE ARE OTHER MOVES
THAT I CAN MAKE.

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:36.038
FOR EXAMPLE...

00:08:36.038 --> 00:08:39.241
I CAN USE THIS CARD
TO TRIPLE MY HARPY ATTACK FORCE.

00:08:39.241 --> 00:08:42.411
I PLAY ELEGANT EGOTIST!

00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:54.190
NOT BAD, HUH?

00:08:55.257 --> 00:08:57.059
THAT ENDS MY TURN, YUGI,

00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:00.095
BUT NEXT TIME AROUND,
YOU'LL GET A TASTE
OF MY LADIES' CLAWS,

00:09:00.095 --> 00:09:02.565
AND I PROMISE
YOU WON'T ENJOY IT.

00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:04.767
[LAUGHS]

00:09:05.868 --> 00:09:07.536
THAT'S TOO BAD, MAI.

00:09:07.536 --> 00:09:09.305
YOU REALLY SHOULD
HAVE ATTACKED ME.

00:09:09.305 --> 00:09:11.807
HMM. WELL,
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:13.309
NO, IT'S FACT.

00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:15.177
IF YOU HAD CALLED
AN ATTACK, THEN
YOU WOULD HAVE WON.

00:09:15.177 --> 00:09:17.313
BUT YOUR TRAP CARD.

00:09:17.313 --> 00:09:18.914
IT'S NOT A TRAP, MAI.

00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:21.917
IT'S A MONSTER
RECOVERY CARD.

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:22.952
[GASPS]

00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:24.753
YOU FELL FOR MY BLUFF.

00:09:24.753 --> 00:09:27.356
IT'S A WHOLE NEW
DUEL NOW, MAI.

00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:31.894
FOR THIS TURN,
I'LL ACTIVATE THE
MONSTER RECOVERY CARD,

00:09:31.894 --> 00:09:34.263
PULL ALL MY MONSTERS
BACK INTO MY DECK,

00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:37.833
RESHUFFLE, AND NOW
I CAN DRAW 5 NEW CARDS.

00:09:40.302 --> 00:09:43.072
[THINKING] OH, NO!
NOT ONE OF THESE CARDS

00:09:43.072 --> 00:09:46.308
IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO BRING DOWN
MAI'S HARPIES.

00:09:46.308 --> 00:09:48.177
EACH OF MY 3 HARPY LADIES

00:09:48.177 --> 00:09:51.513
NOW HAS
AN ATTACK POWER OF 2450.

00:09:51.513 --> 00:09:54.083
THERE ARE ONLY
A HANDFUL OF CARDS
IN ALL OF DUEL MONSTERS

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:55.818
THAT CAN STAND UP
AGAINST THAT,

00:09:55.818 --> 00:09:59.088
AND FROM THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE,
YOU HAVEN'T DRAWN ONE.

00:09:59.088 --> 00:10:01.657
YUGI, DON'T LET UP!
KEEP FIGHTING!

00:10:01.657 --> 00:10:03.759
WITHOUT A MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:05.828
MAI'S FREE TO ATTACK
MY LIFE POINTS DIRECTLY.

00:10:05.828 --> 00:10:07.796
I'LL NEVER SURVIVE
AGAINST HER.

00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:09.131
UNLESS...

00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:12.635
THIS CARD,
IN DEFENSIVE MODE!

00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:14.970
BUT YOU CAN'T.
SHADOW OF EYES.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:18.641
IT LURES ALL MONSTERS
INTO ATTACK MODE, REMEMBER?

00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:20.409
<i>ALL</i> MONSTERS? NO, MAI.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:22.945
AND THAT'S WHAT'LL
SAVE MY LIFE POINTS
THIS TURN.

00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:28.117
MYSTICAL ELF!

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:31.387
[HUMMING]

00:10:31.387 --> 00:10:32.554
[GASPS]

00:10:32.554 --> 00:10:34.990
SHADOW OF EYES MAY LURE
MEN INTO BATTLE,

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.993
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK
ON FEMALE MONSTERS.

00:10:37.993 --> 00:10:40.029
NO! I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:42.164
YOU'LL HAVE TO ATTACK IT
INSTEAD OF ME.

00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:43.632
MADE IT! WHEW!

00:10:43.632 --> 00:10:45.534
WITH ALL
OF HIS LIFE
POINTS INTACT.

00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:47.603
SURE, HE MAY HAVE
GOTTEN THROUGH THIS TURN,

00:10:47.603 --> 00:10:50.039
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN
HE'S OUT OF THE WOODS
JUST YET.

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:52.608
IT WON'T TAKE MAI LONG
TO DESTROY THAT MYSTICAL ELF.

00:10:52.608 --> 00:10:53.676
OH.

00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:56.211
OK, SO LET'S SEE
WHERE WE STAND.

00:10:56.211 --> 00:10:58.547
YOU'RE ON THE BOARD
WITH ONE MEASLY ELF,

00:10:58.547 --> 00:11:00.249
AND IT'S MY TURN.

00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:03.052
FIRST I'LL USE
THIS MONSTER REBORN CARD

00:11:03.052 --> 00:11:05.054
TO BRING BACK AN OLD FRIEND.

00:11:05.054 --> 00:11:06.889
[THINKING]
MONSTER REBORN!

00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:10.392
WHAT'S THAT?!

00:11:11.527 --> 00:11:14.730
REMEMBER HARPY'S PET DRAGON?
HE'S BA-A-ACK!

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.966
AND HE GETS 300
MORE ATTACK POINTS
FOR EACH HARPY ON THE FIELD.

00:11:17.966 --> 00:11:21.136
OH, NO! HE NOW HAS
2900 ATTACK POINTS.

00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:23.806
AND EVERY SINGLE POINT
AIMED RIGHT AT YOU.

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:27.876
HARPY LADIES,
COMBINE YOUR POWER!

00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:32.548
EXTERMINATOR ATTACK!

00:11:35.718 --> 00:11:36.985
[ALL GASP]

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:39.221
Téa: SHE WIPED OUT
HIS LAST DEFENSE!

00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:44.990
YOUR TIME'S RUN OUT, YUGI.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.794
NEXT TURN I ELIMINATE
THE REMAINDER OF YOUR
LIFE POINTS!

00:11:48.794 --> 00:11:51.830
AND THEN, LOOKS LIKE
I GO ON TO THE FINALS.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.833
[THINKING] HE MIGHT AS WELL
ADMIT IT, I'M UNSTOPPABLE.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:58.070
THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN DO
AGAINST MY MONSTER'S
ATTACK POWER.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.439
ONE MORE TURN
AND IT'S ALL OVER.

00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:03.075
[THINKING] NO!
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO!

00:12:03.075 --> 00:12:05.477
BUT I NEED MORE TIME!
THE NEXT CARD I DRAW

00:12:05.477 --> 00:12:08.380
IS GOING TO DECIDE THE
FATE OF SO MANY LIVES.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.083
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF
I DRAW THE WRONG CARD?

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:14.787
WHAT HAPPENS TO GRANDPA?
TO JOEY AND HIS SISTER?

00:12:14.787 --> 00:12:18.090
AND TO KAIBA AND MOKUBA.
I CAN'T DO THIS!

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.392
WE CAN DO THIS!

00:12:20.392 --> 00:12:21.727
TOGETHER.

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:24.964
JUST TRUST ME, AND TRUST
IN THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:12:24.964 --> 00:12:26.899
COME ON, NOW.
WE BOTH KNOW

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:30.035
I'LL WIPE OUT ANY CARD
YOU PLAY ON MY NEXT TURN.

00:12:30.035 --> 00:12:31.870
SWORDS OF
REVEALING LIGHT!

00:12:34.006 --> 00:12:36.308
SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT?

00:12:36.308 --> 00:12:39.545
[THINKING] HE ACTUALLY DREW
SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT?

00:12:39.545 --> 00:12:41.046
HOW CAN ANYBODY
BE THAT LUCKY?

00:12:41.046 --> 00:12:44.049
ALL RIGHT! THAT HOLDS
MAI AT BAY FOR 3 TURNS!

00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:47.753
AND BUYS YUGI SOME TIME
TO FIGURE A WAY
OUT OF THIS MESS.

00:12:47.753 --> 00:12:50.656
MM-MM. DECIDED TO
GO DOWN FIGHTING, HUH?

00:12:50.656 --> 00:12:53.459
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
A SURRENDER WOULD BE EASIER,

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:56.262
BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY
DETERMINED TO GO OUT
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY,

00:12:56.262 --> 00:12:58.931
I'LL BE ONLY TOO HAPPY
TO LIGHT THE FIRE.

00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:01.267
NO, MAI.
WHAT I INTEND TO DO

00:13:01.267 --> 00:13:03.235
IS TO GO OUT IN
A BLAZE OF VICTORY.

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:07.239
HARPY'S PET DRAGON
IS THE MOST POWERFUL
MONSTER SHE'S GOT.

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:09.908
UNLESS WE CAN
DEFEAT IT, THERE'S
NO WAY TO WIN.

00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:13.512
WE <i>CAN</i> DEFEAT IT,
BUT ONLY AT GREAT RISK.

00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:15.714
IT INVOLVES
THE BLACK LUSTER RITUAL,

00:13:15.714 --> 00:13:18.617
AND 3 TURNS
MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH.

00:13:18.617 --> 00:13:21.020
BLACK LUSTER RITUAL?
WHAT'S THAT?

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.423
IF I CAN DRAW
THE CORRECT CARDS,
YOU'LL SEE SOON ENOUGH.

00:13:24.423 --> 00:13:28.394
MY ONLY MOVE
FOR THIS TURN,
I PLAY KORIBO!

00:13:30.896 --> 00:13:32.131
OH.

00:13:32.131 --> 00:13:36.035
IT'S THE ATTACK OF
THE GIANT 3-TOED HAIRBALL.

00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:38.370
LOOK, IT'S TOTALLY
FEROCIOUS, YUGI.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.074
I THINK IT WANTS
TO ATTACK HARPY'S
PET DRAGON SINGLE-HANDED.

00:13:42.074 --> 00:13:44.743
[LAUGHS]

00:13:46.078 --> 00:13:49.014
HMM. WHAT, YOU DON'T
THINK THAT'S FUNNY, YUGI?

00:13:49.014 --> 00:13:50.616
IT'S NOT, MAI.

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:52.818
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT,
BUT DON'T MISTAKE
THE KORIBO

00:13:52.818 --> 00:13:54.987
FOR A JOKE WHEN IT'S
AN IMPORTANT STEP

00:13:54.987 --> 00:13:56.755
ON MY WAY TO VICTORY
IN THIS DUEL.

00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:59.058
THAT HAIRBALL COULDN'T BE
AN IMPORTANT STEP

00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:01.994
ON THE WAY TO ANYTHING,
EXCEPT MAYBE CHOKING A CAT.

00:14:01.994 --> 00:14:05.397
ANYWAY, I CAN'T ATTACK
AS LONG AS SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT

00:14:05.397 --> 00:14:08.400
IS STILL IN PLAY,
SO I DRAW THIS ONE CARD,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.235
AND THAT WILL END MY TURN.

00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:12.271
BUT SOON,
YOU'RE GONNA BE HISTORY.

00:14:12.271 --> 00:14:14.173
HMM.

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:16.508
[THINKING] THAT KORIBO
WAS A GOOD START,

00:14:16.508 --> 00:14:18.911
BUT WITH JUST THE CARDS
I'VE GOT IN MY HAND NOW,

00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.280
I CAN'T INITIATE
THE BLACK LUSTER RITUAL.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.449
I STILL NEED
ONE MORE CARD.

00:14:24.683 --> 00:14:27.720
BUT THIS ISN'T
THE CARD I NEED!

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.987
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:28.987 --> 00:14:30.789
[THINKING] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF MANEUVER

00:14:30.789 --> 00:14:33.325
YOU'RE TRYING TO PULL,
KIDDO, BUT GO FOR IT.

00:14:33.325 --> 00:14:37.196
IF YOU GOTTA LOSE,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
LOSE WITH SOME FLAIR.

00:14:37.196 --> 00:14:39.465
THIS CARD
WORKED FOR YOU.

00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:42.434
MONSTER REBORN!

00:14:44.169 --> 00:14:48.307
I USE MONSTER REBORN
TO BRING BACK GAIA,
THE FIERCE KNIGHT!

00:14:48.307 --> 00:14:51.009
OH, FIERCE KNIGHT,
SCHMIERCE KNIGHT.

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:54.012
I GUESS HE'S AN IMPROVEMENT
OVER THAT LITTLE KORIBO,

00:14:54.012 --> 00:14:56.949
BUT HE HARDLY REPRESENTS
A THREAT TO MY HARPIES

00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:59.318
AND THEIR SUPERCHARGED PET.

00:14:59.318 --> 00:15:01.120
2 TURNS TO GO.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.122
THAT'LL BE ENOUGH, MAI.

00:15:03.122 --> 00:15:05.591
STILL NOT
THE RIGHT CARD.

00:15:05.591 --> 00:15:06.592
YUGI.

00:15:06.592 --> 00:15:08.394
JUST MAINTAIN
YOUR COOL, TéA.

00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:09.395
HUH?

00:15:09.395 --> 00:15:10.562
RELAX.

00:15:10.562 --> 00:15:11.997
YOU CAN TELL FROM
THE LOOK IN HIS EYES,

00:15:11.997 --> 00:15:14.466
HE'S NOT ABOUT TO GIVE UP.

00:15:14.466 --> 00:15:15.901
HMM.

00:15:16.969 --> 00:15:19.104
[THINKING] AH, I SEE.

00:15:19.104 --> 00:15:21.707
VERY DARING, YUGI-BOY.

00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:25.677
YOU MEAN TO ATTEMPT
THE LEGENDARY
BLACK LUSTER RITUAL.

00:15:25.677 --> 00:15:27.446
BUT YOU'VE ONLY
ONE TURN LEFT

00:15:27.446 --> 00:15:29.815
IN WHICH TO DRAW
THE NECESSARY CARD.

00:15:29.815 --> 00:15:32.418
ARE YOU REALLY PREPARED
TO RISK EVERYTHING

00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:35.788
ON THE OUTCOME OF
A SINGLE DRAW? ARE YOU?

00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:38.524
IT'S MY TURN NOW.

00:15:38.524 --> 00:15:40.359
HA HA! HA!
I DID IT!

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:42.127
I DREW ANOTHER
HARPY LADY CARD.

00:15:42.127 --> 00:15:44.596
ON MY NEXT TURN,
I CAN PLAY THIS CARD,

00:15:44.596 --> 00:15:46.765
GIVING ME
A TOTAL OF 4 HARPIES,

00:15:46.765 --> 00:15:49.802
AND RAISING PET DRAGON'S
ATTACK POWER TO 3200.

00:15:49.802 --> 00:15:52.337
ONCE YUGI'S SWORDS
OF REVEALING LIGHT WEAR OFF,

00:15:52.337 --> 00:15:53.939
IT'S ALL OVER FOR HIM.

00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:56.508
Joey: MAI ISN'T EVEN TRYING
TO HIDE HER NEXT MOVE.

00:15:56.508 --> 00:15:57.943
SHE'S GOT
SO MUCH FIREPOWER,

00:15:57.943 --> 00:15:59.711
SHE THINKS SHE'S
GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

00:15:59.711 --> 00:16:01.113
MY TURN IS OVER,

00:16:01.113 --> 00:16:03.749
AS ARE THE EFFECTS OF YOUR
SWORDS OF REVEALING LIGHT.

00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:07.753
DIDN'T GET MUCH HELP
OUT OF YOUR 3 FREE TURNS,
DID YOU, YUGI?

00:16:07.753 --> 00:16:09.388
HUH.

00:16:09.388 --> 00:16:11.356
[THINKING]
ONE CARD.

00:16:11.356 --> 00:16:13.725
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS.

00:16:13.725 --> 00:16:14.726
MM.
MM.

00:16:14.726 --> 00:16:16.462
AHH.
AH.

00:16:16.462 --> 00:16:17.563
[CHUCKLES]

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.201
[THINKING] NO!

00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:23.702
NO!

00:16:23.702 --> 00:16:26.171
I--I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:28.006
YUGI WAS RIGHT.

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:31.210
THERE'S TOO MUCH RIDING
ON THE DRAW OF A SINGLE CARD.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.011
WHO AM I TO GAMBLE
WITH THE LIVES

00:16:33.011 --> 00:16:35.013
OF YUGI'S FRIENDS
AND FAMILY?

00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:36.515
AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IF I SHOULD FAIL?

00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:44.645
THERE'S TOO MUCH RIDING
ON THE DRAW OF THIS NEXT CARD.

00:16:44.645 --> 00:16:48.115
I SHOULDN'T BE RISKING
YUGI'S FRIENDS
AND FAMILY THIS WAY.

00:16:48.115 --> 00:16:50.451
IT'S...TOO DANGEROUS.

00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:52.152
I CAN'T.

00:16:52.152 --> 00:16:53.754
WE <i>CAN</i> DO IT,

00:16:53.754 --> 00:16:55.088
TOGETHER.

00:16:55.088 --> 00:16:56.557
YUGI?

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:57.758
I'M WITH YOU.

00:16:57.758 --> 00:16:59.126
AND WE'RE NOT ALONE.

00:16:59.126 --> 00:17:01.895
WE HAVE THE SUPPORT
OF ALL MY FRIENDS.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:04.131
JUST LIKE I'VE HAD
FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:06.300
AH. WITH ALL OF YOU
AT MY SIDE,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.634
I WAS FOOLISH
TO LOSE FAITH.

00:17:07.634 --> 00:17:09.203
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID--

00:17:09.203 --> 00:17:11.638
YOU AND I HAVE TO TRUST
IN EACH OTHER,

00:17:11.638 --> 00:17:13.974
AND IN THE HEART
OF THE CARDS.

00:17:13.974 --> 00:17:17.444
AND ONCE WE PUT
OUR HEARTS IN THE GAME,

00:17:17.444 --> 00:17:20.113
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN'T DO!

00:17:20.113 --> 00:17:21.148
[GASP]

00:17:21.148 --> 00:17:22.716
[THINKING]
SUCH POWER.

00:17:22.716 --> 00:17:25.018
I'VE NEVER FELT
SUCH TREMENDOUS STRENGTH.

00:17:25.018 --> 00:17:26.720
NEVER.

00:17:29.189 --> 00:17:30.357
WELL, MAI...

00:17:30.357 --> 00:17:31.358
HMM...

00:17:31.358 --> 00:17:33.694
YOU'VE PUT UP
A GOOD FIGHT,

00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:35.128
BUT NOW THE DUEL ENDS.

00:17:35.128 --> 00:17:36.597
HUH?

00:17:36.597 --> 00:17:38.165
STARTING WITH
THIS CARD!

00:17:38.165 --> 00:17:40.901
WHAT?!
BLACK LUSTER RITUAL!

00:17:45.405 --> 00:17:47.074
WATCH. THE BLACK
LUSTER RITUAL

00:17:47.074 --> 00:17:49.409
WORKS BY SACRIFICING
ALL OF THE MONSTERS

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:51.011
I HAVE PLACED
ON THE FIELD.

00:17:51.011 --> 00:17:53.580
[WHINNY]

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.021
COMBINING THE ENERGIES OF
MY 2 SEPARATE MONSTERS...

00:18:02.322 --> 00:18:06.159
[WHINNYING]

00:18:06.159 --> 00:18:09.997
AND THE FORCES OF LIGHT
AND DARKNESS INTERTWINED,

00:18:09.997 --> 00:18:12.633
OPENING THE GATES OF CHAOS!

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.335
BRINGING FORTH...

00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:16.503
[RROARRH!]

00:18:16.503 --> 00:18:17.738
OH, NO!

00:18:17.738 --> 00:18:20.641
THE BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER!

00:18:22.743 --> 00:18:26.647
IS THAT REALLY THE LEGENDARY
BLACK LUSTER SOLDIER?

00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:29.349
NOW, BLACK LUSTER
SOLDIER,

00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:32.019
CHAOS ATTACK!

00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:40.661
HARPY'S PET DRAGON
IS VANQUISHED.

00:18:40.661 --> 00:18:42.095
[GASP]

00:18:42.095 --> 00:18:43.964
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:18:43.964 --> 00:18:46.166
MY MOST POWERFUL MONSTER--

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:47.467
IT'S GONE!

00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:48.702
THIS IS OUTSTANDING.

00:18:48.702 --> 00:18:50.470
FOR A MINUTE THERE,
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.172
THAT YUGI'D BE ABLE
TO PULL IT OFF.

00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:54.174
I DON'T THINK MAI DID,
EITHER.

00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:55.809
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
THERE'D BE A WAY

00:18:55.809 --> 00:18:58.779
OF BRINGING THAT
KICK-BUTT MONSTER
OUT OF YUGI'S DECK?

00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:01.315
OHH...

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:02.883
[THINKING]
THE DUEL IS OVER.

00:19:02.883 --> 00:19:05.319
MY SPIRIT IS BROKEN.

00:19:05.319 --> 00:19:08.021
SHE'S LOST THE WILL
TO FIGHT ON.

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.157
OHH...

00:19:10.157 --> 00:19:13.160
[THINKING]
OH, ONE TURN AWAY.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.494
IF I'D ONLY
BEEN ABLE TO PLAY

00:19:14.494 --> 00:19:16.163
ONE MORE HARPY LADY CARD

00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:19.666
BEFORE THE BLACK LUSTER
SOLDIER APPEARED,
I WOULD HAVE WON!

00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:21.501
BUT I CAN'T REVIVE
THE PET DRAGON,

00:19:21.501 --> 00:19:23.170
AND THERE'S NO OTHER
CARD IN MY DECK

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.672
THAT CAN DEFEAT
THAT ULTIMATE WARRIOR.

00:19:25.672 --> 00:19:29.142
UH...MAI?

00:19:29.142 --> 00:19:31.645
SO DOES THIS MEAN
THAT YOU SURRENDER?

00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:32.613
NO WAY.

00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:35.115
UM...WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19:35.115 --> 00:19:36.350
MAI SURRENDERED.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.185
WHEN A DUELIST
PLACES THEIR HAND

00:19:38.185 --> 00:19:39.686
OVER THE DECK
LIKE THAT,

00:19:39.686 --> 00:19:41.521
IT MEANS THEY CONCEDE
THE DUEL.

00:19:41.521 --> 00:19:42.756
POOR MAI.

00:19:42.756 --> 00:19:45.292
I'D RATHER NOT SEE
MY HARPY LADIES DESTROYED

00:19:45.292 --> 00:19:46.627
IN THE NEXT TURN.

00:19:46.627 --> 00:19:49.329
THE DUEL IS YOURS, YUGI.

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:53.834
WAIT, MAI.

00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:55.035
THERE'S SOMETHING

00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:56.870
I WANT TO SAY TO YOU.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.871
HUH?

00:19:57.871 --> 00:19:59.206
THANK YOU.

00:19:59.206 --> 00:20:00.974
YOU SAID A DUELIST
CAN LEARN MORE

00:20:00.974 --> 00:20:03.310
FROM DEFEAT
THAN VICTORY,
AND YOU WERE CORRECT.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.878
BUT YOU, MAI,

00:20:04.878 --> 00:20:07.014
YOU TAUGHT ME
A LOT TODAY.

00:20:07.014 --> 00:20:09.349
I HAD TO CONFRONT
MY OWN FEARS,

00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:11.018
MY OWN WEAKNESSES,

00:20:11.018 --> 00:20:13.520
OR I COULD NEVER
HAVE DEFEATED YOU.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.522
IT'S AWFULLY NICE OF YOU
TO SAY THAT, YUGI,

00:20:15.522 --> 00:20:19.192
BUT IT SEEMS TO ME
I ALSO STILL HAVE
A LOT MORE TO LEARN.

00:20:19.192 --> 00:20:22.529
ABOUT DUELING
AND ABOUT MYSELF.

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:25.032
BUT THEN I SUPPOSE
NO DUELIST EVER LEARNS

00:20:25.032 --> 00:20:26.500
<i>ALL</i> THERE IS TO KNOW.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.535
AND MAYBE THE MOST
IMPORTANT LESSON

00:20:28.535 --> 00:20:31.371
IS THAT DEFEAT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE FOREVER.

00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:33.273
YOU WON THIS DUEL, YUGI,

00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:34.708
BUT THERE'LL BE OTHERS.

00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:37.544
YOU AND I WILL MEET
IN THE ARENA AGAIN, KIDDO.

00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:40.247
AND WHEN WE DO,
YOU BETTER WATCH OUT.

00:20:40.247 --> 00:20:41.982
MM-HMM.

00:20:41.982 --> 00:20:43.984
HMM.
