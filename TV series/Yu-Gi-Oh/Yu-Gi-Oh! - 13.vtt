[THINKING]
THE DARK MAGICIAN!

00:07:54.163 --> 00:07:55.732
HE'S MY FAVORITE
CARD!

00:07:55.732 --> 00:07:57.700
BUT IS IT
ALSO MY SOUL-CARD?

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.302
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I PLAY IT?

00:07:59.302 --> 00:08:03.306
[CHUCKLES]
WITH A NEW HAND...

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:05.241
COMES A WHOLE
NEW PERSPECTIVE.

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:06.909
THE GAME...

TO FREAK ME OUT,

BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE'S UP TO.

00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:17.720

TO RISK PLAYING...

HUH?

00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:25.328
AND I'LL PLAY
A MAGIC CARD

00:08:25.328 --> 00:08:26.896
THAT LET'S ME
REVIVE MONSTERS

00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:28.164
FROM THE GRAVEYARD.

JOEY? YUGI?

00:08:37.273 --> 00:08:39.475
YOU GUYS DREAMIN'
THIS, TOO?

00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:41.110
NAH, THEY AIN'T
NO DREAM, TRISTAN.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.812
THIS IS JUST ME
GOING INSANE.

00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:44.714
S'ALL ONE BIG DELUSION.
HUH?

00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:46.682
BUT JUST ONE SECOND AGO,
I WAS UP THERE.

00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:48.651
YEAH. IF YOU'RE
DOWN HERE,

00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:50.887
WHO'S THAT UP THERE?

00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:51.888
I DON'T KNOW.

00:08:51.888 --> 00:08:52.989
DON'T YOU?

00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:55.358
WELL, I HAVE NOTICED
THAT SOMETIMES,

00:08:55.358 --> 00:08:56.492
WHEN I DUEL,

00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:58.461

MM.

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:02.632
AND SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE
I CAN HEAR A STRONG VOICE

00:09:02.632 --> 00:09:05.001
CALLING OUT TO ME
FROM MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE,

00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:07.136
AN ANCIENT,
POWERFUL VOICE.

00:09:07.136 --> 00:09:08.571
HUH?
REALLY?

00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:10.473
I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S
ALL ABOUT, GUYS,

00:09:10.473 --> 00:09:12.141
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
WE CAN TRUST HIM,

00:09:12.141 --> 00:09:14.010
WHOEVER HE IS.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.245
HEY, IF DA BIG GUY
IS OK IN YOUR BOOK,

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:17.447
THEN HE'S OK BY ME.

00:09:17.447 --> 00:09:18.448
YEAH!

00:09:18.448 --> 00:09:20.383
SO, NOW WHAT?

00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:22.051
MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY
AND FIND TéA?

00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:23.786
SHE MUST STILL BE
IN THE DECK.

00:09:23.786 --> 00:09:25.388
THEN WE SHOULD TRY
AND WIN DIS THING

00:09:25.388 --> 00:09:26.656
BEFORE HER CARD
GETS PLAYED.

00:09:26.656 --> 00:09:28.057
GOOD IDEA.

00:09:28.057 --> 00:09:30.326

SOME BAKURA!

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:32.328
HANG ON, JOEY,

00:09:32.328 --> 00:09:33.696
SO I HAVE TO MOVE.

DARK MAGIC ATTACK!

00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:38.367

WE'LL HAVE TO SEND
ALL THE CARDS IN OUR HANDS

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:49.111
TO THE GRAVEYARD AGAIN.

00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:50.246
I'M SORRY.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.981
S'OK, MAN, I DID
THE SAME THING.

00:09:52.982 --> 00:09:54.550

00:09:57.487 --> 00:10:00.423
HMM, ISN'T THAT TéA'S
FAVORITE CARD?

00:10:00.423 --> 00:10:02.825
DO YOU SUPPOSE
THAT HER MORTAL SOUL

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:04.327
IS TRAPPED WITHIN IT?

00:10:04.327 --> 00:10:06.329
HMM, I WONDER?

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:08.531
MAYBE YOU SHOULD PLAY IT
AND FIND OUT.

00:10:08.531 --> 00:10:10.867
BUT, THEN AGAIN,

00:10:10.867 --> 00:10:13.002
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M LAYING HERE,

00:10:13.002 --> 00:10:15.671

BE PUTTING HER
IN DANGER.

A DILEMMA,

00:10:18.608 --> 00:10:19.876
AND WHILE YOU DECIDE,

00:10:19.876 --> 00:10:22.545
I'LL JUST ACTIVATE

FROM EACH OF YOUR MONSTERS
ON THE FIELD,

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:39.262
AND YOU'LL FEEL
LIKE EACH AND EVERY POINT

00:10:39.262 --> 00:10:41.597
HAS BEEN RIPPED
FROM YOUR BEATING HEART.

00:10:41.597 --> 00:10:43.266
BIG YUGI!
ARE YOU OK?

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:46.302
YES, BUT ONE MORE
ATTACK LIKE THAT,

00:10:46.302 --> 00:10:48.070
AND IT'S OVER.

WHOA! THAT TRAP CARD
JUST NAILED YUGI'S
LIFE POINTS.

00:10:54.893 --> 00:10:57.095
OR MAYBE I SHOULD SAY,
OUR LIFE POINTS.

00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:58.196
ANOTHER HIT
LIKE THAT,

00:10:58.196 --> 00:10:59.431
AND IT COULD BE OVER
FOR ALL OF US.

00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:02.233
TéA'S SOUL CARD IS
NOT SAFE IN MY HAND.

00:11:02.233 --> 00:11:03.401
I'LL HAVE
TO PLAY IT.

I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED,

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:35.834
BUT IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THE MILLENNIUM ITEMS

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:37.669
BAKURA AND I HAVE.

00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:39.437
