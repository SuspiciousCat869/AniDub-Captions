TO BRING HIM BACK,

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:11.925
BUT THEN HE'D BE COMING
BACK A BABY DRAGON,
WOULDN'T HE?

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:14.027
Joey: HUH? WHAT ARE YA
TALKING ABOUT?

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.929
OH, RIGHT! BECAUSE
THE TIME MACHINE

00:08:15.929 --> 00:08:16.930
BRINGS BACK
YOUR MONSTER

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.065
THE WAY IT WAS
ONE TURN BEFORE.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.867
AND SINCE
KEITH'S MONSTER
DIDN'T RUST OVER

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.002
UNTIL THIS TURN,

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.937
IT CAME BACK THE WAY
IT WAS LAST TURN...

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.306
UNFAZED BY
JOEY'S TIME WIZARD.

00:08:26.306 --> 00:08:28.208
PUNK, I KNEW YOU
WERE GONNA USE

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:29.809
THAT DWEEBY LITTLE
TIME WIZARD

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:31.711
TO TRY AND RUST UP
MY DRAGON.

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:34.247
YOU FORGET! I SAW
EVERY CARD IN YOUR DECK

00:08:34.247 --> 00:08:36.149
WHEN YOU DUELED BONZ!

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:40.086
GRR. DUELS ARE MORE
THAN JUST ABOUT
THE CARDS YOU USE.

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.922
YEAH, THEY'RE ABOUT
BACKBONE, TOO,

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.657
AND JUDGING FROM
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.626
WHEN MY DRAGON CAME BACK
THROUGH TIME,

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.695
I'D SAY YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE ONE!

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.163
NOW MAKE YOUR MOVE!

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:54.467
I'LL THROW A MONSTER
IN DEFENSE MODE,
AND THAT'S IT.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:55.702
THAT'S IT IS RIGHT

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.405
'CAUSE MY MACHINES
ARE GONNA KEEP ON COMIN'!

00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:00.073
GO SLOT MACHINE!

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.408
ATTACK MODE!

00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:04.644
NOW YOUR TURN, DRAGON.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:07.580
BLAST THAT DEFENSE CARD
TO KINGDOM COME.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.082
PROTON BLAST!

00:09:11.818 --> 00:09:15.355
[THINKING]
HMM. I COULD THROW
A MONSTER OUT

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:17.023
AND DESTROY KEITH'S
SLOT MACHINE,

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:18.425
BUT THEN HE'D
JUST TURN AROUND

00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:21.094
AND DESTROY
WHATEVER CARD I PLAY
WITH THAT DRAGON.

00:09:21.094 --> 00:09:23.263
EVEN MY STRONGEST
CARD OF ALL,

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:26.933
THE RED EYES BLACK
DRAGON WOULDN'T
STAND A CHANCE.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:28.268
POOR JOEY.

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:29.836
HE'S IN A TOUGH BIND.

00:09:29.836 --> 00:09:31.971
JOEY,
BELIEVE IN YOUR CARDS!

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.774
YOU NEED TO TRUST THEM
IF YOU'RE GONNA
BEAT THAT THING.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.876
HMM...HMM!

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:41.614
I'M GONNA LAY
ONE CARD FACEDOWN

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:42.782
AND...

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.818
THROW THE RED EYES
BLACK DRAGON

00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:45.819
IN ATTACK MODE!

00:09:45.819 --> 00:09:47.720
[ROARS]

00:09:50.857 --> 00:09:52.792
AND THAT'LL DO IT
FOR ME.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:55.328
THAT RED EYES DRAGON
MAY BE THE BEST CARD

00:09:55.328 --> 00:09:57.964
YOU GOT IN YOUR
ENTIRE DECK, DWEEB,

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:01.167
BUT HE'S STILL NO MATCH
FOR THIS KIND OF
BLASTIN' POWER.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:02.168
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.404
[WHIRRING]

00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:07.507
SAY BYE-BYE TO YOUR
PRIZED POSSESSION.

00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:10.076
PROTON BLAST ATTACK!

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.478
NOT SO FAST.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:13.746
WHAT'S THAT?

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:16.182
IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
CALLED COPYCAT.

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:19.452
IT LETS ME COPY ONE CARD
THAT YOU'VE USED,

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:23.256
AND I'M CHOOSIN' TO COPY
MAGIC METAL FORCE.

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.993
NOW MY RED EYES
BLACK DRAGON

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:29.696
IS A RED EYES
BLACK METAL DRAGON!

00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.133
[ROARS]

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:35.001
AND THAT MAKES HIM
STRONG ENOUGH

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.769
TO WITHSTAND
YOUR ATTACK!

00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:39.939
ARGH!

00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.610
ALL RIGHT!
NOW KEITH'S DRAGON

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.145
IS THE ONE
IN TROUBLE!

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:47.347
Joey: RED EYES,
COUNTER ATTACK!

00:10:47.347 --> 00:10:49.582
FLASH, FLARE,
BLAST!

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:52.819
UNGH!

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.521
GRR!

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.356
HOW DO YA LIKE
THAT, KEITH?

00:10:56.356 --> 00:10:58.691
YOUR TRIPLE BLAST
DRAGON MACHINE

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.227
HAS BEEN REDUCED
TO A PILE OF SMOKIN'
METAL DEBRIS.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:04.030
[THINKING]
AND WITH MY SISTER'S
SIGHT ON THE LINE,

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.633
I PLAN ON GETTING
EVEN TOUGHER ON YA.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.039
Tristan:
CHECK IT OUT!

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:14.307
SINCE KEITH'S
DRAGON'S GONE,

00:11:14.307 --> 00:11:16.442
JOEY'S METAL
RED EYES IS
THE TOUGHEST CARD

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:17.677
ON THE BLOCK.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.612
Yugi: YEAH, BUT DON'T
COUNT KEITH OUT YET.

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:20.947
THERE MUST BE
SOME REASON

00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:22.882
HE PLAYED THAT
SLOT MACHINE MONSTER.

00:11:22.882 --> 00:11:24.551
I KNEW YOU WERE
AN AMATEUR,

00:11:24.551 --> 00:11:26.819
AND NOW I'M GONNA
SHOW YOU HOW COME.

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:29.155
HUH?!

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:31.591
AMATEUR? UM...

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:34.994
DIDN'T I JUST GO
AND BLAST YOUR BEST
MONSTER TO BITS?

00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:37.497
THAT'S RIGHT!
KEEP TALKIN', TOUGH GUY!

00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:39.499
I'M LAYING THIS CARD
FACEDOWN,

00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:43.036
AND I'M SWITCHING
MY SLOT MACHINE MONSTER
TO DEFENSIVE MODE.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.271
Joey, thinking:
BOY, IS KEITH
LOSIN' IT!

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.640
THAT SLOT MACHINE
CAN'T TAKE A BLAST
FROM MY RED EYES

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.209
NO MATTER
WHAT MODE HE'S IN.

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:51.044
GUESS HE'LL
HAVE TO LEARN
THE HARD WAY.

00:11:51.044 --> 00:11:52.345
BAD MOVE, CHIEF.

00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:54.480
FIRST, I'LL LAY
THIS FACEDOWN,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.816
AND NOW, MY RED EYES
WILL ATTACK!

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.718
FLASH, FLARE, BLAST!

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:02.488
MAN, YOU'RE AS PREDICTABLE
AS YOU ARE BRAINLESS. AAH.

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:05.358
I'M PLAYING THE CARD
I HAD FACEDOWN.

00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:06.993
GO SEVEN COMPLETED!

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:09.829
HUH? HOW COME
THAT MIDDLE SLOT

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:11.130
JUST SWITCHED TO A SEVEN?

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:16.603
HE'S STILL THERE?

00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:17.937
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:20.006
THAT'S 'CAUSE
MY SEVEN COMPLETED CARD

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:22.141
RAISES MY SLOT'S
DEFENSIVE POINTS...

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.644
TO 3000,
TO BE EXACT,

00:12:24.644 --> 00:12:26.212
AND THAT'S
MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO DEFLECT

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:29.082
YOUR RED EYES
BLACK DRAGON'S
STRONGEST ATTACK.

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:31.117
AUGH! AND 'CAUSE
MY ATTACK

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:32.518
IS LOWER THAN
ITS DEFENSE,

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:33.886
I LOSE
LIFE POINTS.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.222
MAN, THIS STINKS!

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:37.924
THAT FLASH, FLARE,
BLAST

00:12:37.924 --> 00:12:40.493
IS THE STRONGEST
ATTACK JOEY HAS,
TOO.

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:42.495
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE I GOT?

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:45.231
TWO MORE SEVEN COMPLETED CARDS
IN MY DECK,

00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:49.168
EACH ABLE TO POWER UP
MY SLOT'S DEFENSE OR ATTACK
BY 700 POINTS.

00:12:49.168 --> 00:12:50.703
YEAH, WELL, JUST
'CAUSE YOU HAVE 'EM

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.405
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'LL
DRAW 'EM, KEITH.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:54.107
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:56.342
[THINKING]
OH, I AIN'T TOO
WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.180
HMM?

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.482
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.784
CHECK OUT WHAT CARD
I JUST DREW.

00:13:04.784 --> 00:13:07.854
I THINK I'LL GO AHEAD
AND TAKE IT FOR A SPIN.

00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:10.423
THIS TIME,
FOR MY ATTACK POWER.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:12.859
AW, MAN.

00:13:12.859 --> 00:13:14.594
IF I DON'T DO
SOMETHING SOON,

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:16.596
MY LIFE POINTS
ARE GONNA GET
CLEANED OUT.

00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:17.730
OH, NO!

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.799
ONE MORE OF THOSE
SEVEN COMPLETED CARDS,

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.367
AND THAT SLOT WILL HAVE
POWERED UP ENOUGH

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:23.670
TO DESTROY JOEY'S
RED EYES DRAGON.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.505
AND ANY OTHER CARD
HE HAS, TOO.

00:13:25.505 --> 00:13:27.440
NEXT, I'M THROWIN'
THIS DOWN.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.441
HEH!

00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:30.143
GO BLAST SPHERE

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:34.681
AND ATTACH YOURSELF
TO JOEY'S DRAGON.

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:36.149
[ROARS]

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.150
[CLANK]

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.118
HUH?
BLAST SPHERE?

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:40.353
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:13:40.353 --> 00:13:41.854
AND ONCE I END MY TURN,
IT'LL SELF-DESTRUCT,

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:45.358
GIVING OFF 2900 POINTS
OF DAMAGE TO YOUR DRAGON.

00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:47.293
SELF-DESTRUCT?!

00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:48.561
[THINKING]
OH, NO!

00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.563
AND I THOUGHT
I JUST HAD
THAT SLOT MACHINE

00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:52.165
TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.100
[ROARS]
[TICKING]

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.637
OK, DWEEB.
I'M ENDIN' MY TURN NOW.

00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:59.572
YOUR TIME'S UP.

00:13:59.572 --> 00:14:01.374
[ROARS]

00:14:01.374 --> 00:14:02.775
UHH!

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:06.913
BLAMMO! HA!

00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:10.149
HEH HEH HEH...
HUH?

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:14.620
BUT THAT DRAGON SHOULD
BE BLOWN TO BITS!

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.122
THIS AIN'T RIGHT!

00:14:16.122 --> 00:14:18.291
OH, IT'S RIGHT,

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:20.560
THANKS TO MY HANDY
DRAGON NAILS CARD.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.130
IT MADE MY RED EYES
600 ATTACK POINTS
STRONGER.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.566
OF COURSE! THE BLAST
GOT DEFLECTED.

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:29.469
YOU DWEEB! NOW MY
LIFE POINTS GO DOWN.

00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:31.738
Joey: AW, YOU'RE
GONNA MAKE ME CRY.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:32.939
HMPH.

00:14:32.939 --> 00:14:34.540
I'LL MAKE YOU CRY,
ALL RIGHT.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.910
JUST YOU WAIT.
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.680
WELL, LOOKY WHAT
I GOT HERE!

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.616
I THINK I'LL POWER UP
MY SLOT'S ATTACK AGAIN!

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.918
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.320
WELL, WOULD YA
LOOK AT THAT!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.255
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:51.190
GRR!

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.291
BOTH THEIR MONSTERS

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.726
HAVE THE SAME
ATTACK POINTS NOW.

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.195
AND JOEY AND KEITH HAVE
ALMOST THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.097
OF LIFE POINTS REMAINING,
TOO.

00:14:58.097 --> 00:14:59.699
HMM, THIS NEXT TURN

00:14:59.699 --> 00:15:01.334
COULD DECIDE
THE WHOLE MATCH.

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:02.335
