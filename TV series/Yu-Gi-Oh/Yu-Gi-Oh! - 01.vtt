00:08:10.975 --> 00:08:12.310
SOUNDS LIKE AN EXCUSE.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.079
YOUR FRIENDS CAN CARE
FOR YOUR GRANDFATHER,

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:17.148
WHILE YOU AND I DUEL,

00:08:17.148 --> 00:08:18.316
UNLESS YOU'RE AFRAID?

00:08:18.316 --> 00:08:19.483
Joey: TAKE HIM, YUGI.

00:08:19.483 --> 00:08:20.818
HUH?

00:08:20.818 --> 00:08:23.387
WE CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOUR GRANDPA,

00:08:23.387 --> 00:08:25.790
WHILE YOU TAKE CARE
OF CREEPY KAIBA.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.559
TEACH THAT RICH,
SPOILED BRAT WHAT
A REAL DUEL'S ALL ABOUT.

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:30.161
FOR YOUR GRANDPA, YUGI.

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.863
I DON'T KNOW.

00:08:31.863 --> 00:08:34.265
TRUST ME. YOU'RE,
LIKE, THE BEST PLAYER
I'VE EVER SEEN,

00:08:34.265 --> 00:08:35.900
AND YOU'VE GOT
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.535
YOU CAN DO THIS, YUGI.

00:08:37.535 --> 00:08:39.170
I KNOW YOU CAN.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.372
Tea: WE ALL DO.

00:08:41.372 --> 00:08:43.875
OK, GRANDPA,
I'LL DO IT.

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:45.810
I KNOW YOU WILL, MY BOY.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.145
EVERYONE,
PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER,

00:08:48.145 --> 00:08:51.148
AND I'LL MARK US
WITH A SPECIAL SIGN.

00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:52.884
HUH?
WHAT GIVES, TEA?

00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:54.919
IT'S A SYMBOL
OF OUR FRIENDSHIP,

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.120
SO WHEN YUGI'S DUELING,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.288
NO MATTER
HOW TOUGH IT GETS,

00:08:57.288 --> 00:08:58.556
HE'LL KNOW
THAT HE'S NOT ALONE.

00:08:58.556 --> 00:08:59.891

[SIREN]

00:09:05.162 --> 00:09:09.033
JOEY, TRISTAN AND I
WILL TAKE YUGI'S GRANDPA
TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:11.802
WHY DON'T YOU
GET BACK IN THERE
AND CHEER YUGI ON?

00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:14.005
OK, TAKE GOOD CARE
OF HIM, TEA.

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:17.241
Kaiba: I DESIGNED
THIS VIRTUAL STADIUM MYSELF.

00:09:17.241 --> 00:09:18.876
IMPRESSIVE, HMM?

00:09:18.876 --> 00:09:22.513
I THINK YOU'LL AGREE
IT ADDS A BIT MORE LIFE
TO THE GAME.

00:09:22.513 --> 00:09:25.182
WE EACH BEGIN
WITH 2,000 LIFE POINTS.

00:09:25.182 --> 00:09:27.919
FIRST PLAYER
TO HIT ZERO LOSES.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:30.288
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY, RUNT?

00:09:30.288 --> 00:09:32.890
Yugi: PLAYTIME IS OVER,
KAIBA!

00:09:36.794 --> 00:09:42.433

00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:57.181
HUH? WHAT THE--

00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.117
Yami Yugi:
NOW, KAIBA,
PREPARE YOURSELF,

00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:02.119
BECAUSE IT'S TIME
TO DUEL!

00:10:06.337 --> 00:10:07.939
Kaiba:
VIRTUAL SYSTEMS READY,

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:10.675
SO LET'S BEGIN.

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:13.878
I ATTACK WITH THE MIGHTY
HITOTSU-ME GIANT.

00:10:13.878 --> 00:10:15.079
BRACE YOURSELF, YUGI.

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:19.283
YOU'VE NEVER DUELED
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:10:19.283 --> 00:10:22.019
HE'S BROUGHT THE MONSTER
ON THE CARD TO LIFE.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.155
IT'S MY VIRTUAL SIMULATOR.

00:10:24.155 --> 00:10:26.991
IT CREATES LIFELIKE HOLOGRAMS
OF EVERY DUEL MONSTER.

00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:29.861
SO THIS IS HOW
YOU BEAT MY GRANDFATHER.

00:10:29.861 --> 00:10:32.864
WELL, NOW IT'S MY TURN.

00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:36.934
I CALL ON THE WINGED DRAGON,
GUARDIAN OF THE FORTRESS!

00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:46.477

REAL MONSTERS?!

ALL RIGHT!
GO, YUGI!

00:10:59.757 --> 00:11:03.728
WELL, PLAYED, YUGI,
FOR A BEGINNER,

00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:05.463

DEAL WITH THIS?

SAGGI THE DARK CLOWN?

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:12.770
BUT THAT CARD
HAS HARDLY ANY
ATTACK STRENGTH.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.007
TRUE, YOUR WINGED DRAGON'S
ATTACK IS 1,400,

00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:18.843
WHILE MY DARK CLOWN'S
IS ONLY 600,

00:11:18.843 --> 00:11:21.846
BUT IF I COMBINE IT
WITH THIS CARD--

00:11:21.846 --> 00:11:23.848
A MAGIC CARD!

00:11:23.848 --> 00:11:26.784
EXACTLY--
THE NEGATIVE ENERGY GENERATOR.

00:11:26.784 --> 00:11:30.321
IT MULTIPLIES
MY MONSTER'S ATTACK BY 3.

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:35.326
DARK CLOWN, ATTACK
WITH DARK LIGHT.

00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:45.937
Kaiba: AS YOU CAN SEE,
COMBINING CARDS
CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE.

00:11:45.937 --> 00:11:50.775
[THINKING] HE'S GOOD.
HE KNOWS EVERY ASPECT
OF THIS GAME.

00:11:50.775 --> 00:11:52.877
BUT MY GRANDPA PUT ALL
HIS GAMING KNOWLEDGE,

00:11:52.877 --> 00:11:56.347
HIS WHOLE HEART
INTO ASSEMBLING
THIS DECK.

00:11:56.347 --> 00:12:00.351
I HAVE TO BELIEVE
THAT IT HOLDS
SOME SECRET STRATEGY.

00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:01.819
THIS CARD IS USELESS.

00:12:01.819 --> 00:12:03.754
I CAN'T BEAT THE DARK CLOWN
WITH THIS.

00:12:03.754 --> 00:12:05.189
I'LL HAVE TO USE
A DIFFERENT MONSTER.

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:07.758
IN DEFENSE MODE,
THE MONSTER WILL BE
SACRIFICED,

00:12:07.758 --> 00:12:09.694
BUT MY OVERALL LIFE POINTS
WILL BE SAFE.

AS YOUR GRANDFATHER.

00:13:40.184 --> 00:13:42.820
WAS THE ONLY ONE TO POSSESS

WON'T STAND A CHANCE

ARE FREE TO ATTACK.

YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY
STAND AGAINST MY 3

00:17:12.285 --> 00:17:16.189
IT'S OVER, YUGI.
YOU WERE NEVER A MATCH FOR ME.

ALL ALONG.

HE ONLY WANTED
GRANDPA'S CARD

00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:23.063
SO IT COULDN'T BE USED
AGAINST HIM.

00:17:23.063 --> 00:17:25.165

IS TO ASSEMBLE

ALL THE PIECES
OF EXODIA,

00:17:39.446 --> 00:17:41.615
DON'T LOSE FAITH.
CONCENTRATE.

00:17:41.615 --> 00:17:45.085
OUR FRIENDSHIP SYMBOL.

00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:50.156
YUGI, WE'RE
RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

00:17:50.156 --> 00:17:52.892
YUGI, YOU'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

00:17:52.892 --> 00:17:55.295
YOU CAN DO IT.
JUST KICK KAIBA'S BUTT.

00:17:55.295 --> 00:17:56.630
THEY'RE RIGHT.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.797
I'VE GOT
TO BELIEVE IN THE CARDS

00:17:57.797 --> 00:17:59.332
LIKE MY FRIENDS
BELIEVE IN ME.

00:17:59.332 --> 00:18:03.436
TRY YOUR LAST PATHETIC CARD,
SO I CAN END THIS, YUGI.

00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:07.340
MY GRANDPA'S DECK
HAS NO PATHETIC CARDS,
KAIBA.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.409
BUT IT DOES CONTAIN...

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:12.746
THE UNSTOPPABLE EXODIA.

00:18:12.746 --> 00:18:14.714
AAH! IMPOSSIBLE!

00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:17.384
I'VE ASSEMBLED
ALL 5 SPECIAL CARDS.

00:18:17.384 --> 00:18:19.352
ALL 5
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE.

00:18:28.695 --> 00:18:31.698
EXODIA--IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!

00:18:31.698 --> 00:18:33.767
NO ONE'S EVER BEEN ABLE
TO CALL HIM.

00:18:33.767 --> 00:18:37.737
EXODIA, OBLITERATE!

00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:43.877
[SCREAMING]

00:18:48.748 --> 00:18:51.251
YOU DID IT!
YUGI, YOU WON!

00:18:51.251 --> 00:18:54.654
THIS CAN'T BE!
MY BROTHER NEVER LOSES!

00:18:54.654 --> 00:18:56.890
YOU PLAY
ONLY FOR POWER, KAIBA,

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.692
AND THAT
IS WHY YOU LOST,

00:18:58.692 --> 00:19:00.894
BUT IF YOU PUT
YOUR HEART IN THE GAME,

00:19:00.894 --> 00:19:03.096
THERE IS NOTHING
YOU CAN'T DO.

00:19:03.096 --> 00:19:06.966
BUT--BUT HOW?
HOW COULD I HAVE LOST TO HIM?!

00:19:06.966 --> 00:19:10.303
KAIBA, IF YOU
TRULY WANT TO KNOW,

00:19:10.303 --> 00:19:12.739
OPEN YOUR MIND!

00:19:14.774 --> 00:19:16.276
UNH.

00:19:16.276 --> 00:19:17.444
THERE, KAIBA.

00:19:17.444 --> 00:19:20.013
MAYBE NOW
YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE.

00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:21.881
[GASPS]

00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:23.983
GRANDPA'S AWAKE!

00:19:23.983 --> 00:19:27.721
YUGI WON.

00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:29.689
MR. PEGASUS, SIR,

00:19:29.689 --> 00:19:31.391
SETO KAIBA,
OUR UNCONTESTED CHAMPION--

00:19:31.391 --> 00:19:33.660
HE'S BEEN DEFEATED
IN A DUEL, SIR,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.629
BY SOMEONE NAMED YUGI.

00:19:36.629 --> 00:19:37.964
HMM.
