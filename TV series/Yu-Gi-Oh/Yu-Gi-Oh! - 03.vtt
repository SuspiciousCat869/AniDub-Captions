Announcer:
LAST TIME ON <i>YU-GI-OH...</i>

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:09.841
DRAW YOUR LAST PATHETIC CARD
SO I CAN END THIS, YUGI.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.544
MY GRANDPA'S DECK HAS NO
PATHETIC CARDS, KAIBA,

00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:15.580
BUT IT DOES CONTAIN...

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.549
THE UNSTOPPABLE EXZODIA.

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:21.119
I'VE ASSEMBLED
ALL 5 SPECIAL CARDS,

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.554
ALL 5 PIECES
OF THE PUZZLE.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:27.859
AAH!

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.027
SETO KAIBA'S
OUR UNCONTESTED CHAMPION.

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:33.264
HE'S BEEN DEFEATED
BY SOMEONE NAMED YUGI.

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:34.932
WHAT COULD IT BE?

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:36.033
HUH?

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.468
SOME KIND OF GLOVE.

00:00:37.468 --> 00:00:38.770
AND STARS.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.105
MAYBE THERE'S
AN EXPLANATION
ON THE VIDEO.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.810
GREETINGS, LITTLE YUGI.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.678
I AM MAXIMILLION PEGASUS.

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:48.780
HUH?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.481
YOUR IMPRESSIVE DEFEAT
OF SETO KAIBA

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:51.682
INTRIGUED ME SO MUCH

00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:53.518
I'VE DECIDED
TO INVESTIGATE

00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:55.987
YOUR AMAZING DUELING
SKILLS PERSONALLY.

00:00:55.987 --> 00:00:58.222
I'M DONE WITH
YOUR GAMES.

00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:01.058
YOU PRESUME I'M GIVING YOU
A CHOICE IN THE MATTER...

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:02.927
BUT I'M NOT.

00:01:02.927 --> 00:01:06.464
YOU SEE, I HAVE
FOUND THAT, GIVEN
THE PROPER INCENTIVE,

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:08.966
ANYONE CAN BE MADE
TO PLAY MY GAME.

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:12.336
YUGI!

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:16.007
HOW ELSE WILL
YOU EVER RECLAIM
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S SOUL?

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:17.308
MWA HA HA HA!
GRANDPA!

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:19.944
GRANDPA!

D-D-D-D-D-D-DUEL!

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.744
Yugi, thinking:
HOW DID I GET
INTO THIS MESS?

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:29.547
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT GRANDPA'S
ACTUALLY GONE.

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:31.682
ONE MINUTE,
HE'S RIGHT BESIDE US,

00:02:31.682 --> 00:02:33.718
AND THE NEXT,
PEGASUS SHOWS UP

00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:37.321
AND USES SOME KIND
OF WEIRD MAGIC TO
STEAL HIS SOUL AWAY.

00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:38.990
BUT WHY?

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.059
WHAT COULD PEGASUS
POSSIBLY WANT WITH ME?

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.862
AND COULD IT HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH
MY MILLENNIUM PUZZLE?

00:02:44.862 --> 00:02:46.597
WELL, I'LL GET
GRANDPA BACK.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:48.699
I'LL BEAT PEGASUS
AT HIS OWN GAME...

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.001
WHATEVER THAT IS.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.138
Joey: WONDER WHO
THIS IS FROM.

00:02:57.008 --> 00:02:59.010
HEY, THERE, BIG BROTHER.
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.311
I REALLY MISS YOU.

00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:01.746
SERENITY?

00:03:01.746 --> 00:03:03.314
[LAUGHS]

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:05.750
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S
BEEN 6 YEARS SINCE
WE'VE SEEN EACH OTHER.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.953
I'LL NEVER FORGET
THE DAY MOM TOOK ME
TO LIVE WITH HER.

00:03:08.953 --> 00:03:10.521
JOEY!

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.658
SERENITY! DON'T GO!

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:15.726
WAIT!

00:03:15.726 --> 00:03:16.928
JOEY!

00:03:16.928 --> 00:03:18.262
I'M SENDING YOU
THIS VIDEO

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:21.198
JUST SO YOU DON'T FORGET
YOUR LITTLE SISTER'S FACE.

00:03:21.198 --> 00:03:24.201
IT SEEMS LIKE I'M
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:27.038
I WAS HOPING TO SEE YOU
ONCE MORE BEFORE--

00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:29.173
WELL, UH, YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:30.207
BYE-BYE, BROTHER.

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:32.610
RUN OUT OF TIME?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.211
IT CAN'T BE.

00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.081
SO LONG.
TAKE CARE, JOEY.

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:41.185
[GASPS]

00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:42.186
SERENITY.

00:03:46.824 --> 00:03:49.427
HUH? WHAT'S THIS?

00:03:52.463 --> 00:03:53.898
IT'S FROM PEGASUS!

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.201
[GASPS]

00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:00.304
IT'S AN INVITATION
TO THE TOURNAMENT
AT DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.039
Tea: A TOURNAMENT
AT DUELIST KINGDOM?

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.341
ISN'T THAT AN ISLAND?

00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:06.310
SO THAT'S WHERE PEGASUS
IS KEEPING YOUR GRANDPA?

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.346
MAYBE. THE ONLY WAY
TO KNOW FOR SURE

00:04:08.346 --> 00:04:09.780
IS TO BECOME
A CONTESTANT.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.249
THE BOAT'S GOING
TO BE LEAVING IN 2 DAYS.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:17.922
BUT YOU CAN'T GO.
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS.

00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:19.323
I HAVE TO GO.

00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:21.525
IT'S THE ONLY CLUE I HAVE
FOR RESCUING GRANDPA.

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:23.494
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:27.498
PEGASUS USED SOME KIND
OF WEIRD SPELL TO GRAB
YOUR GRANDPA'S SOUL AWAY.

00:04:27.498 --> 00:04:31.002
AND NOW HE'S TOYING
WITH YOU, FORCING YOU
TO DUEL IN THE TOURNAMENT.

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:34.805
RIGHT. AND WITHOUT
INVITATIONS, WE CAN'T
EVEN GO THERE WITH YOU.

00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:36.607
I WISH WE COULD
HELP YOU, PAL.

00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:38.409
THIS IS BAD.

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.413
HUH? HEY, YUGI...

00:04:42.413 --> 00:04:43.914
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:04:43.914 --> 00:04:46.083
ACCORDING TO THIS CARD,

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:50.421
THE TOURNAMENT WINNER
TAKES THE GRAND PRIZE
OF $3 MILLION!

00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:51.922
3 MIL?

00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:53.591
SO WHAT, TRISTAN?

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.093
WHO CARES ABOUT MONEY
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:57.428
HEY, GIVE ME THAT!

00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:59.997
AHH. 3 MILLION.

00:04:59.997 --> 00:05:01.966
GUESS JOEY DOES.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.435
3 MILLION
IN COLD CASH.

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:12.276
JOEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UP HERE?

00:05:12.276 --> 00:05:13.277
HMM?

00:05:13.277 --> 00:05:14.779
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:16.747
UH, NOTHIN'.

00:05:16.747 --> 00:05:18.783
I'M JUST THINKIN' ABOUT
A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF.

00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:21.285
YUGI, YOU DO KNOW

00:05:21.285 --> 00:05:23.788
THAT I CARE ABOUT
YOUR GRAMPS, RIGHT?

00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:25.790
I MEAN, HE TAUGHT ME ABOUT
THE HEART OF THE CARDS.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.792
OF COURSE I KNOW.

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:29.427
I MEAN IT!

00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:31.295
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER,
I'LL HELP YOU
BEAT PEGASUS.

00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:32.797
HMM...

00:05:32.797 --> 00:05:34.065
[LAUGHS]

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:36.100
THAT REALLY MEANS
A LOT TO ME, JOEY.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.301
I'M GLAD WE'RE FRIENDS.

00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:39.070
REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME WE MET?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.971
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.

00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:43.207
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:05:44.942 --> 00:05:46.777
Yugi: THE WAY GRANDPA
EXPLAINED IT TO ME,

00:05:46.777 --> 00:05:50.715
THE PUZZLE WAS
ORIGINALLY FOUND IN
SOME EGYPTIAN RUINS.

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:54.285
MY GRANDPA GAVE IT
TO ME AND KIND OF
DARED ME TO SOLVE IT.

00:05:54.285 --> 00:05:56.654
IT WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLE
THING I'D EVER SEEN.

00:05:56.654 --> 00:05:58.989
AS SOON AS I TOUCHED IT,
I KNEW IT WAS SPECIAL.

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:00.925
I MADE A WISH
ON THE PUZZLE.

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:03.127
I ASKED IT
TO GIVE ME
A REAL FRIEND,

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:05.730
AND I THINK THE PUZZLE
CAME THROUGH FOR ME.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.032
THAT WAS WHEN I MET UP
WITH YOU AND TRISTAN,

00:06:08.032 --> 00:06:12.036
ALTHOUGH YOU SURE DIDN'T ACT
LIKE MY FRIENDS AT FIRST.

00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:16.040
HA! YOU MEAN WHEN WE WERE
PLAYING KEEP-AWAY WITH
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.776
IT WAS FOR YOU, MAN.

00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:20.111
WE JUST WANTED
TO TOUGHEN YOU UP

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.012
SO YOU COULD STAND UP
TO THE REAL BULLIES.

00:06:23.214 --> 00:06:25.049
WE WERE ONLY
TEASING YOU.

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:26.550
Yugi: TEASING?

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.452
YOU TOOK A PIECE OF
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE

00:06:28.452 --> 00:06:30.387
AND THREW IT
OUT THE WINDOW!

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.557
Yugi: AND I WAS
THE ONE THAT TRIED

00:06:33.557 --> 00:06:37.394
TO HELP YOU GUYS OUT
WHEN THAT BULLY
PICKED ON YOU.

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:39.897
Joey: HE WAS
A MEAN ONE, ALL RIGHT.

00:06:39.897 --> 00:06:41.098
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:42.099
SHH!

00:06:43.768 --> 00:06:45.035
WELL, LOOK WHAT
JUST SHOWED UP.

00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:46.170
IT'S LITTLE YUGI,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.171
JUST IN TIME
TO WATCH ME

00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:48.839
MOP THE FLOOR
WITH THESE GUYS.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:50.908
GET BACK!
LEAVE THEM ALONE!

00:06:50.908 --> 00:06:53.811
WHO'S GONNA STOP ME?
A LITTLE SHRIMP LIKE YOU?

00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:55.913
I DON'T THINK SO.
GET LOST.

00:06:55.913 --> 00:06:59.083
I WON'T LET YOU.
THESE GUYS ARE
MY FRIENDS.

00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:00.151
HUH?

00:07:00.151 --> 00:07:01.152
[BULLY LAUGHS]

00:07:01.152 --> 00:07:02.586
OK, TOUGH GUY.

00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.555
YOU JUMP TO THE HEAD
OF THE LINE!

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:11.484
[BULLY LAUGHS]

00:07:11.484 --> 00:07:13.486
SAY YOUR PRAYERS,
YOU RUNT.

00:07:13.486 --> 00:07:14.921
UHH!

00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:16.189
[GRUNTS]

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:17.457
AAH!

00:07:17.457 --> 00:07:19.993
Joey: YOU STOOD UP
FOR US, YUGI.

00:07:19.993 --> 00:07:21.461
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.

00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:25.465
BECAUSE OF YOU, WE GOT
THAT MORON EXPELLED.

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:27.300
AND TRISTAN AND I LEARNED
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.235
TO HAVE A TRUE FRIEND.

00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:32.472
Yugi: WELL,
AT LEAST YOU RETRIEVED
THE LOST PUZZLE PIECE.

00:07:32.472 --> 00:07:33.506
IF YOU HADN'T
DONE THAT,

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:34.741
I COULD NEVER
HAVE SOLVED

00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:36.109
THE MILLENNIUM PUZZLE.

00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:41.381
I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE, YUGI.

00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:43.349
I'VE BEEN ACTING
LIKE A REAL JERK.

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:45.351
OH, WERE YOU ACTING?

00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.953
[LAUGHS]

00:07:46.953 --> 00:07:48.888
I GUESS I DESERVED
THAT ONE.

00:07:48.888 --> 00:07:50.623
IF YOU ASK ME,
I THINK TRISTAN AND I

00:07:50.623 --> 00:07:52.325
MAY HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:53.426
HUH?

00:07:53.426 --> 00:07:55.328
YOU KNOW, YUGI,
YOU'RE A TOUGHER KID

00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:56.596
THAN I EVER GAVE
YOU CREDIT FOR.

00:07:56.596 --> 00:07:58.698
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HANG OUT MORE OFTEN.

00:07:58.698 --> 00:07:59.699
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:01.401
MMM.

00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:03.837
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER
IS YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND

00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:04.838
I'VE EVER HAD.

00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:06.239
YEAH.

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:09.175
IT'S TOO BAD
YOU CAN'T GO WITH ME
TO RESCUE GRANDPA.

00:08:09.175 --> 00:08:10.910
DON'T WORRY. SOMEHOW,

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.880
SOME WAY, I PROMISE,
WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.914
[GASPS]

00:08:14.914 --> 00:08:16.015
TOGETHER?

00:08:16.015 --> 00:08:19.385
HEH. YOU BET.
WE'RE A TEAM, YUGI.

00:08:19.385 --> 00:08:22.789
BUT HOW CAN YOU GO
WITHOUT AN INVITATION?

00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:23.957
HMM...

00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:29.129
Saruwatari:
ATTENTION, ALL DUELISTS.

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:30.463
WELCOME TO THIS EVENT

00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:32.999
SPONSORED BY
INDUSTRIAL ILLUSIONS.

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:35.135
YOU RECEIVED WITH
YOUR INVITATION

00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:38.505
THE STAR CHIPS THAT
WILL GRANT YOU ENTRY
INTO THE CONTEST.

00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:41.841
YOU ARE ALL ELITE,
INVITED BY US AFTER
CLOSE OBSERVATION

00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:44.043
OF YOUR PAST
DUEL MONSTERS CONTESTS.

00:08:44.043 --> 00:08:46.379
YOU EACH HAVE A FAIR
AND EQUAL CHANCE TO WIN.

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:49.082
IT ALL COMES DOWN
TO HOW WELL YOU'VE
CHOSEN YOUR CARDS,

00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:51.751
AND HOW WELL YOU PLAY.
NOW THEN, DUELISTS,

00:08:51.751 --> 00:08:53.186
CROSS THE OCEAN,

00:08:53.186 --> 00:08:55.421
AND ENTER
THE DUELIST KINGDOM!

00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:01.528
Man: PRESENT YOUR STAR KITS
AS YOU BOARD THE VESSEL.

00:09:01.528 --> 00:09:03.530
THANK YOU. NEXT.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:04.831
Second man: HEY, YOU!
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.100
ONLY OFFICIAL CONTESTANTS
ARE ALLOWED ON BOARD.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.202
Joey: HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT OFFICIAL?

00:09:09.202 --> 00:09:11.171
BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL
DUELISTS AREN'T TRYING

00:09:11.171 --> 00:09:13.139
TO SNEAK ON BOARD
THROUGH THE LOWER HATCHES.

00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.207
[GRUNTING]

00:09:14.207 --> 00:09:15.708
JOEY, WHAT THE--

00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:17.010
STOP YOUR STRUGGLING.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.578
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO THROW YOU OUT.

00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:20.446
NO WAY!
I CAME HERE TO DUEL,

00:09:20.446 --> 00:09:21.981
AND I'M GONNA DUEL.

00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:23.449
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:24.584
HEY, YUGI!

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:25.718
JOEY!

00:09:25.718 --> 00:09:27.720
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, JOEY?

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.690
HA HA. DID YOU REALLY
THINK I'D LET YOU
DO THIS ON YOUR OWN?

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.692
COME ON, HELP ME OUT.

00:09:32.692 --> 00:09:34.127
ALL RIGHT THERE,
BRING IT UP...

00:09:34.127 --> 00:09:36.696
THEY'RE DISTRACTED.
LET'S GO.

00:09:36.696 --> 00:09:37.697
RIGHT.

00:09:37.697 --> 00:09:38.698
HE'S WITH ME.

00:09:38.698 --> 00:09:39.899
YOU GOTTA
LET HIM ON.

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:41.534
ONLY PEOPLE
WITH A STAR CHIP

00:09:41.534 --> 00:09:43.670
CAN GET ON BOARD.
THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.704
UNDERSTAND?

00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:46.706
BUT JOEY HAS
A STAR CHIP.

00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:47.707
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU?

00:09:47.707 --> 00:09:48.975
I DO?

00:09:48.975 --> 00:09:50.710
SEE?

00:09:52.478 --> 00:09:53.980
WHAT'S THIS?

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.481
ACCORDING TO THIS CARD,

00:09:55.481 --> 00:09:57.984
A STAR CHIP'S PROOF
THAT ONE IS A DUELIST.

00:09:57.984 --> 00:10:00.019
HMM. THAT MAY BE,
BUT ALL PARTICIPANTS

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:03.456
ARE GIVEN 2 STAR CHIPS.
YOU'LL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE.

00:10:03.456 --> 00:10:06.659
MAYBE, BUT I'D
RATHER TAKE THAT RISK

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:07.961
THAN BE
WITHOUT MY FRIEND

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:09.362
WHEN WE GET
TO THE DUELIST KINGDOM.

00:10:09.362 --> 00:10:10.363
I NEED HIM.

00:10:10.363 --> 00:10:11.798
YUGI.

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:13.233
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:10:13.233 --> 00:10:14.634
[DIALING]

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:17.337
MR. PEGASUS, WE'VE
GOT A PROBLEM, SIR.

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.140
WHOA!

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.141
SHH!

00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.977
DON'T YOU SHUSH ME,
TRISTAN.

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:24.978
PIPE DOWN.

00:10:30.516 --> 00:10:32.819
I'M GLAD THEY LET YOU
ON BOARD, JOEY.

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:35.989
ONLY BECAUSE YOU
SACRIFICED ONE OF
YOUR STAR CHIPS FOR ME.

00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:38.691
BUT IF ANY OF THE OTHER
PLAYERS FIND OUT

00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:40.460
WE ONLY HAVE
ONE STAR CHIP EACH,

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.929
THEY COULD REALLY TRY
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:45.064
THEN BE QUIET ABOUT IT.

00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:46.633
HMM...

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:56.535
KIND OF EXCITING,
ISN'T IT, YUGI?

00:10:56.535 --> 00:10:57.569
YEAH.

00:10:57.569 --> 00:10:59.605
Mai: WELL, WHAT
DO WE HAVE HERE?

00:10:59.605 --> 00:11:01.573
Both: HUH?

00:11:01.573 --> 00:11:02.708
WOW.

00:11:02.708 --> 00:11:04.576
SO, YOU'RE THE YUGI KID

00:11:04.576 --> 00:11:06.578
EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT, HUH?

00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:08.580
WHOA! CHECK IT OUT.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.683
BUT I'M AMAZED
THAT A SQUIRT LIKE YOU

00:11:11.683 --> 00:11:13.051
COULD BEAT KAIBA.

00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.720
YOU'RE FAMOUS, YOU KNOW.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.555
THANKS VERY MUCH, I THINK.

00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:18.657
HEY, MISS, I'M
A REALLY GOOD FRIEND

00:11:18.657 --> 00:11:20.559
OF THE FAMOUS YUGI,
THE MASTER DUELIST.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:22.260
IN FACT--
LOOK!

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.363
YOU'RE EITHER A CHAMP
OR A CHUMP.

00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:25.697
CUT THIS GUY LOOSE.

00:11:25.697 --> 00:11:26.999
HE'S FASHION-CHALLENGED

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:29.301
AND DESERVES TO BE
CRUSHED IN THE GAMES.

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:33.071
PLEASE, CRUSH ME.

00:11:33.071 --> 00:11:35.507
I'LL CRUSH YOU ALL,
EVENTUALLY.

00:11:35.507 --> 00:11:37.576
THE NAME'S MAI.

00:11:37.576 --> 00:11:38.877
HOW ARROGANT!

00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:40.078
THERE'S NOBODY BETTER

00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:42.314
AT PLAYING DUEL MONSTERS
THAN YUGI.

00:11:42.314 --> 00:11:44.383
SHH. QUIET.
THEY'LL HEAR YOU.

00:11:44.383 --> 00:11:46.618
I DON'T CARE.
HE'S STILL THE BEST.

00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:49.554
Joey: HEY,
IS THIS A JOKE OR WHAT?

00:11:49.554 --> 00:11:51.690
THIS IS
A LUXURY CRUISER.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.959
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
BETTER ROOMS SOMEWHERE.

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:55.627
YOU AGAIN?
WE CUT YOU A BREAK,

00:11:55.627 --> 00:11:56.995
AND NOW YOU'RE
CAUSING MORE TROUBLE?

00:11:56.995 --> 00:11:58.964
DO YOU WANT TO GET
THROWN OUT OF HERE?

00:11:58.964 --> 00:12:02.534
HUH? HEY, AREN'T YOU
THAT KID YUGI?

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:04.136
UH, YEAH. AND YOU'RE...

00:12:04.136 --> 00:12:05.203
WEEVIL AND REX,

00:12:05.203 --> 00:12:07.039
THE
DINO-DUELIST.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.341
HEH. YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME
WITH THOSE GUYS.

00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:11.009
THE PRIVATE ROOMS
ONLY GO TO FINALISTS

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:13.011
FROM THE LAST CHAMPIONSHIP,
LIKE US.

00:12:14.012 --> 00:12:15.113
CONGRATULATIONS

00:12:15.113 --> 00:12:16.648
ON WINNING
THE REGIONALS,
WEEVIL.

00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:17.816
IT WAS NOTHING.

00:12:17.816 --> 00:12:20.752
YEAH. I WENT EASY ON HIM
THAT TIME.

00:12:20.752 --> 00:12:22.254
YEAH? WELL, THIS TIME,

00:12:22.254 --> 00:12:23.755
YUGI AND I ARE GONNA
TAKE THE TOURNAMENT.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:24.756
RIGHT, YUGI?

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:26.024
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:27.659
WINNING THE LAST
CHAMPIONSHIP

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:29.961
DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT
MUCH OF AN ACHIEVEMENT.

00:12:29.961 --> 00:12:32.230
I GUESS I CAN'T REALLY
CALL MYSELF THE CHAMPION

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.267
UNTIL I DEFEAT
THE DUELIST
WHO BEAT KAIBA.

00:12:35.267 --> 00:12:37.069
BUT I'M SURE I'LL END UP
BATTLING YOU

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:38.637
IN THE BIG TOURNAMENT,
YUGI.

00:12:38.637 --> 00:12:41.273
FRANKLY,
I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

00:12:41.273 --> 00:12:43.275
I LOOK FORWARD
TO IT, TOO.

00:12:43.275 --> 00:12:46.344
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO SOME DINO-DEMOLITION.

00:12:46.344 --> 00:12:48.113
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE SECRET.

00:12:48.113 --> 00:12:49.948
IT'S SOMETHING NONE
OF THE OTHER PLAYERS

00:12:49.948 --> 00:12:51.249
KNOW ABOUT THE GAMES
YET.

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:53.151
OH,
ISN'T THAT CHEATING?

00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:55.754
THE OTHER DUELISTS
WILL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH,

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:57.789
BUT THERE ARE NEW RULES
ON THE ISLAND

00:12:57.789 --> 00:12:59.591
THAT REQUIRE MORE STRATEGY.

00:12:59.591 --> 00:13:01.193
AH, RULES ARE FOR WIMPS.

00:13:01.193 --> 00:13:03.628
IN DUELING,
YOU EITHER SMASH YOUR OPPONENT

00:13:03.628 --> 00:13:05.163
OR GET SMASHED YOURSELF.

00:13:05.163 --> 00:13:07.532
IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER.

00:13:07.532 --> 00:13:08.633
STRENGTH IS GOOD,

00:13:08.633 --> 00:13:10.068
BUT YOU ALSO NEED
TO COMBINE THEM

00:13:10.068 --> 00:13:11.169
WITH OTHER TYPES
OF CARDS.

00:13:11.169 --> 00:13:12.604
WHO ASKED YOU?

00:13:12.604 --> 00:13:13.839
STAY OUT OF MY WAY

00:13:13.839 --> 00:13:16.141
OR I'LL STOMP YOU
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

00:13:16.141 --> 00:13:19.144
WE'LL SEE WHO STOMPS WHO
WHEN WE GET TO THE ISLAND.

00:13:19.144 --> 00:13:21.713
IGNORE HIM. LET'S SCOPE OUT
THE COMPETITION.

00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:22.681
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?

00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:24.616
CHECK OUT THOSE CHUMPS.

00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:28.086
THEY'RE ALREADY TRADING
OVER THERE.

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:31.289
PLAYERS HERE ARE SWAPPING CARDS
AND STRENGTHENING THEIR DECKS,

00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:33.091
GETTING READY
FOR THE BIG TOURNAMENT.

00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:34.392
IT'S ALSO A GOOD CHANCE

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:36.595
TO GET A FEEL
FOR YOUR OPPONENT'S CARDS.

00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.230
[THINKING]
OH, I BET THIS
IS HOW WEEVIL

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.231
GETS SO MUCH INSIGHT

00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:40.766
INTO HIS OPPONENT'S
STRATEGY.

00:13:40.766 --> 00:13:42.400
Joey:
WHOA, STRONG CARDS.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.835
HEY, WANT TO TRADE?
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

00:13:43.835 --> 00:13:45.837
ANYBODY?
HELP ME OUT HERE.

00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:47.139
GUESS JOEY'S TRADING.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.540
IF YOU'VE
COME ALL THIS WAY

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.509
AND YOU'RE STILL TRYING
TO IMPROVE YOUR DECK,

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:51.943
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
PRETTY DESPERATE.

00:13:51.943 --> 00:13:54.780
I'LL CATCH YOU
ON THE FLIP SIDE.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.749
THIS IS TRULY,
TRULY OUTRAGEOUS.

00:13:57.749 --> 00:14:00.085
YOU EXPECT A LADY LIKE ME
TO STAY IN THIS DUMP

00:14:00.085 --> 00:14:01.820
WITHOUT EVEN A SHOWER?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:02.821
RULES ARE RULES, MA'AM.

00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:03.855
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:04.856
CALL YOUR SUPERIOR.

00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:07.125
GET HIM ON THE PHONE
RIGHT NOW.

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:08.226
KEEP ACTING UP,

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:09.828
AND THEY'LL THROW
YOU OFF THE BOAT.

00:14:09.828 --> 00:14:11.329
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:13.832
A CHAMPION
WITH A LUXURY ROOM.

00:14:13.832 --> 00:14:16.401

HA!

00:14:32.417 --> 00:14:34.419
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, TRISTAN.

00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:40.692
Tea: LOOK.
ISN'T THAT BAKURA?

00:14:40.692 --> 00:14:41.693
Tristan: BAKURA?

00:14:41.693 --> 00:14:43.595

00:14:43.595 --> 00:14:45.764

WITH THESE
NEW MAGIC CARDS,

00:15:29.207 --> 00:15:30.742
COMBINED WITH
YOUR MONSTERS,

A REAL STRONG DECK.

00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:32.844
ALL RIGHT!

00:15:32.844 --> 00:15:33.912

I'M READY TO WIN

I THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO FIND

IT'S A BIT HARDER
THAN THAT, JOEY.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:41.820
HERE, ADD THIS
TO YOUR DECK.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.823
IT CAN BE HELPFUL
IN A TIGHT SPOT.

00:15:44.823 --> 00:15:46.625
THANKS. I'LL TAKE IT.

00:15:46.625 --> 00:15:48.560
I CAN'T GET OVER

[THINKING] HMM.

00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:06.278
WHAT IF YOU WIN?

00:16:06.278 --> 00:16:08.546
IF I WIN,
YOU AGREE TO CLEAR
OUT OF THE ROOM

00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:10.415
FOR THE REST
OF THE TRIP, OK?

00:16:10.415 --> 00:16:12.417
CLEAR OUT?
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE.

00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:13.418
YOU'VE GOT A DEAL.

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:14.686
HMM.

00:16:14.686 --> 00:16:17.923
THE FIRST CARD
IS SHADOW OF EYES.

00:16:17.923 --> 00:16:21.459
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:23.595
THE SECOND CARD
IS HARPY'S LADY,

00:16:23.595 --> 00:16:25.463

OH, NO.

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:30.468
SHE'S RIGHT AGAIN.

00:16:30.468 --> 00:16:32.404
HEH.

00:16:32.404 --> 00:16:33.939
THIS IS MY OWN
CARD TECHNIQUE.

00:16:33.939 --> 00:16:35.941
I ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT CARDS I HAVE

00:16:35.941 --> 00:16:38.343
AND CAN PICK ANY ONE
I LIKE AT ANY TIME.

00:16:38.343 --> 00:16:40.445
SO, GO AHEAD
AND DEAL 'EM, REX.

AHH, THE EVENING WINDS
SURE FEEL NICE.

00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:52.958
SO, DID YOU TRADE
FOR ANY GOOD CARDS, YUGI?

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.093
NO. I'M GONNA DUEL
WITH THE CARDS

00:16:55.093 --> 00:16:56.461
I BROUGHT
ALONG WITH ME.

00:16:56.461 --> 00:16:57.963
I FIGURED AS MUCH.

00:16:57.963 --> 00:17:01.900
YOU USED THE EXODIA CARDS
IN YOUR DUEL WITH KAIBA, RIGHT?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.035
THOSE ARE THE STRONGEST CARDS
OF THEM ALL.

00:17:04.035 --> 00:17:05.537
AND REALLY RARE.

00:17:05.537 --> 00:17:09.040
COULD I POSSIBLY
SEE THOSE LEGENDARY CARDS?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.375
I DON'T SEE
WHY NOT.

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:13.511
JUST BE CAREFUL
WITH THEM, OK?

00:17:15.046 --> 00:17:16.481
HERE.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.453
SO, THESE ARE THE CARDS
TO SUMMON EXODIA.

00:17:21.453 --> 00:17:22.887
FOR A LONG TIME,

00:17:22.887 --> 00:17:25.457
I'VE BEEN TRYING COME UP
WITH SOME KIND OF STRATEGY

00:17:25.457 --> 00:17:26.958
TO FINALLY BEAT THESE CARDS,

00:17:26.958 --> 00:17:29.461
BUT I COULDN'T
COME UP WITH ANYTHING...

00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:33.264
UNTIL JUST THIS MOMENT.

00:17:33.264 --> 00:17:34.432
HUH?

00:17:34.432 --> 00:17:38.236

NOW THERE'S NO ONE
WHO CAN CHALLENGE ME.

HA HA HA.

00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:55.544
THOSE WERE THE EXODIA CARDS
THAT MY GRANDPA GAVE ME!

00:17:55.544 --> 00:17:56.545
I'LL GET 'EM!

00:17:56.545 --> 00:17:57.746

JOEY! SWIM BACK
TO THE SHIP!

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.566
NO WAY! AT LEAST THIS TIME
THERE'S SOMETHING I CAN DO

00:18:17.566 --> 00:18:20.502
TO HELP SOMEONE
I CARE ABOUT.

00:18:20.502 --> 00:18:22.037
CURRENT SURE IS STRONG,
THOUGH.

00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:23.239
IT'S HARD TO FIGHT.

00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:24.773
BUT IF I PUNK OUT NOW,

I'M NEVER ABLE

I CAN PAY FOR THE OPERATION.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.222
