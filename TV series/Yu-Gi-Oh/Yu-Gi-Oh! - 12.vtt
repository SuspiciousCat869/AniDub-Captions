US GALS HAVE GOT
TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER,

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.987
ESPECIALLY WITH A BUNCH
OF BOZOS LIKE THEM AROUND.

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:55.189
I DON'T SEE
WHY YOU EVEN BOTHER
HANGING OUT WITH THEM.

00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:58.158
THAT'S EASY, MAI.
THEY'RE MY BEST FRIENDS.

IT SURE SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE IN THE ZONE.

SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
