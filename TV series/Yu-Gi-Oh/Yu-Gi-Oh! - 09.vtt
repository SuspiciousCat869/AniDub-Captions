UNFORTUNATELY,
IT WASN'T SMART ENOUGH.

00:15:35.297 --> 00:15:36.933
YOU PLAYED RIGHT
INTO MY HAND.

00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:38.903
DEFENSE PARALYSIS!

00:15:38.903 --> 00:15:39.905
A TRAP!

00:15:42.644 --> 00:15:43.912
[SCREECHES]

00:15:43.912 --> 00:15:46.985
HMM, NOW ALL
YOUR MONSTER CARDS
ON THE FIELD

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:49.289
HAVE BEEN SWITCHED
INTO ATTACK MODE.

00:15:49.289 --> 00:15:51.494
[GASPS]
YUGI!

00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:53.966
WHILE THAT DEFENSE
PARALYSIS CARD'S
ON THE FIELD,

00:15:53.966 --> 00:15:56.170
MY MONSTERS CAN'T
DEFEND THEMSELVES.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.508
I'VE GOT TO THINK
OF A WAY OUT.

00:15:58.508 --> 00:16:00.344
HA! IT'S TIME!

00:16:00.344 --> 00:16:02.081
BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON,

00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:03.818
USE YOUR WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:16:09.562 --> 00:16:11.265
UHH!

00:16:11.265 --> 00:16:14.104
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR YOUR CURSE OF DRAGON.

00:16:14.104 --> 00:16:15.106
YUGI!

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:24.590
NO DARK MAGICIAN THERE.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.927
NEXT FIELD.

00:16:25.927 --> 00:16:27.796
Computer: WE'VE EXHAUSTED
ALMOST EVERY POSSIBILITY

00:16:27.796 --> 00:16:29.767
OF LOCATING YUGI MOTO.

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:31.069
HUH?

00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:33.842
Computer: FIELD 146 IS
THE FINAL ACTIVE DUEL.

00:16:33.842 --> 00:16:35.779
THEN HE'S GOTTA
BE THERE.

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.749
SEARCH FIELD 146.

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:39.185
Computer:
YOU GOT IT.

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:42.224
WHAT'S THAT?!

00:16:42.224 --> 00:16:44.194
LOOKS LIKE I CRASHED.

00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:45.531
REBOOT.

00:16:48.703 --> 00:16:50.573
BACK ON LINE.

00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:52.944
ENTER FIELD 146.

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:55.583
Computer:
I'M FROZEN AGAIN.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:56.585
HUH?

00:16:56.585 --> 00:16:57.854
IT'S WORSE THIS TIME.

00:16:57.854 --> 00:16:59.791
HANG ON.
WATCH THIS.

00:17:03.365 --> 00:17:06.871
GOTCHA.
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

00:17:06.871 --> 00:17:09.709
SO, A VIRUS.
A GOOD ONE.

00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.148
THAT MEANS
JUST ONE THING.

00:17:12.148 --> 00:17:15.621
SEARCHING FOR YUGI'S CARDS
ACTIVATES THE VIRUS.

00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:18.594
YUGI'S INSIDE.
GET READY TO GO IN.

00:17:18.594 --> 00:17:20.597
Computer:
BUT THE SECURITY DOOR!

00:17:20.597 --> 00:17:22.134
WE'VE COME THIS FAR ALREADY,

00:17:22.134 --> 00:17:24.338
AND I'M NOT GONNA BLOW IT!

00:17:24.338 --> 00:17:26.576
ACTUALLY, YES I AM.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.616
HUH?

00:17:30.616 --> 00:17:32.119
WHAT'S THAT?!

00:17:32.119 --> 00:17:33.856
Computer:
IT'S A VIRTUAL FORTRESS.

00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:35.960
SENSORS INDICATE
THAT ALL OF THE DATA

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.064
FROM YUGI'S DUELS
IS PROCESSED HERE.

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.705
YOU WON'T BLOW YOUR WAY
THROUGH THIS THING.

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:43.407
IT'S THE ULTIMATE DEFENSE,

00:17:43.407 --> 00:17:45.578
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO PENETRATE

00:17:45.578 --> 00:17:47.749
WITHOUT THE PASSWORD.

00:17:47.749 --> 00:17:50.320
HMM, A PASSWORD.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.727
IF I KNOW PEGASUS,
THAT EGOMANIAC
WOULD NEVER THINK

00:17:53.727 --> 00:17:55.197
THAT ANYONE WOULD
OUTSMART HIM

00:17:55.197 --> 00:17:57.334
AND GET
EVEN THIS FAR.

00:17:57.334 --> 00:17:58.837
WE'RE GOING IN!

00:17:58.837 --> 00:18:00.641
Computer:
THE PASSWORD?

00:18:00.641 --> 00:18:02.845
HA! PEGASUS.

00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:05.816
HA.

00:18:05.816 --> 00:18:08.656
[THINKING] HOW CAN I DEFEAT
HIS BLUE EYES WHITE DRAGON?

00:18:08.656 --> 00:18:10.225
HA HA HA!

00:18:10.225 --> 00:18:12.062
YUGI, YOU GOTTA
ADMIT FOR A STIFF

00:18:12.062 --> 00:18:13.832
THIS KAIBA'S
SURE GOT GAME!

00:18:13.832 --> 00:18:17.439
THAT'S NOT MY BROTHER!
THERE'S JUST NO WAY!

00:18:17.439 --> 00:18:19.443
YUGI, YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT HIM.

00:18:19.443 --> 00:18:22.181
EVERYONE THINKS
HE'S A BAD GUY,

00:18:22.181 --> 00:18:24.552
BUT I KNOW MY BROTHER,
AND HE'S NOT MEAN LIKE THIS.

00:18:24.552 --> 00:18:27.325
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:29.562
THAT THING'S NOT HIM!

00:18:29.562 --> 00:18:32.335
UHH! YOU JUST GOTTA
BELIEVE ME!

00:18:32.335 --> 00:18:34.672
[THINKING] I WISH I COULD
BE AS SURE AS YOU, MOKUBA.

00:18:34.672 --> 00:18:36.508
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO BELIEVE.

00:18:36.508 --> 00:18:38.947
THE ONLY THING
I DO KNOW FOR SURE,

00:18:38.947 --> 00:18:41.719
THIS DUEL'S NOT OVER YET.

00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:43.489
Yugi:
MAGICAL HATS!

00:18:43.489 --> 00:18:45.392
CONCEAL
THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:18:46.494 --> 00:18:47.529
HUH?

00:18:47.529 --> 00:18:49.633
Yugi: HE'S
UNDER THERE SOMEWHERE,

00:18:49.633 --> 00:18:51.037
BUT WHICH ONE?

00:18:51.037 --> 00:18:53.575
HMM. ARE YOU SO DESPERATE
THAT YOU HAVE

00:18:53.575 --> 00:18:56.614
YOUR DARK MAGICIAN
DOING SIMPLE HAT TRICKS?

00:18:56.614 --> 00:19:00.287
IT'S NOT A TRICK,
AND IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE.

00:19:00.287 --> 00:19:02.025
YOUR MOVE, BUT YOU'D
BETTER THINK TWICE

00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:03.627
BEFORE YOU CHOOSE.

00:19:03.627 --> 00:19:05.130
JUST DO THE MATH.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.638
4 HATS, ONLY 25% CHANCE
YOU'LL FIND
THE DARK MAGICIAN.

00:19:09.638 --> 00:19:12.144
THE REAL QUESTION IS,

00:19:12.144 --> 00:19:14.114
WHAT ELSE IS HIDING
BENEATH THOSE HATS?

00:19:14.114 --> 00:19:15.483
WAY TO GO, YUGI!

00:19:15.483 --> 00:19:17.053
HEY, THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO CALL

00:19:17.053 --> 00:19:18.890
PULLIN' ONE
OUTTA YOUR HAT!

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.161
[GASPS] ALL RIGHT!

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.632
Computer: YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE PASSWORD.

00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:25.903
THE VIRTUAL FORTRESS
IS UNLOCKED.

00:19:25.903 --> 00:19:27.640
WE NOW HAVE ACCESS
TO YUGI'S DATA,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.610
AND IT WAS JUST HIS TURN.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.346
PEGASUS THINKS
HE CAN MAKE UP

00:19:31.346 --> 00:19:32.883
ALL THE RULES
IN THIS GAME,

00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:34.712
BUT HE COULD
NEVER HAVE IMAGINED

00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:36.168
THIS BRAND-NEW TWIST.

00:19:36.168 --> 00:19:37.637
I'M BACK!

00:19:50.247 --> 00:19:52.382
HMM, SO PREDICTABLE.

00:19:52.382 --> 00:19:54.651
I KNOW WHERE
THE DARK MAGICIAN HIDES.

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:56.386
IF YOU'RE SO SURE,
THEN MOVE.

00:19:57.135 --> 00:20:01.023
IT'S A SHAME THIS DUEL'S
GOING TO END SO SOON.

00:20:01.023 --> 00:20:02.324
WHITE LIGHTNING!

00:20:05.094 --> 00:20:06.762
[THINKING] IF HE ATTACKS
THE RIGHT HAT,

00:20:06.762 --> 00:20:09.098
I'LL LOSE MORE
THAN JUST THIS DUEL.

00:20:09.098 --> 00:20:10.633
MUCH MORE!
