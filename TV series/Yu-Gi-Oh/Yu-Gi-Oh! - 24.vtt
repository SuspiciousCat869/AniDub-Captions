00:07:26.977 --> 00:07:29.346
TO SAVE
MY ULTIMATE DRAGON.

00:07:29.346 --> 00:07:32.649
MY MAMMOTH GRAVEYARD
HAS ATTACK POINTS
OF 1,200.

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:34.818
THAT MEANS THAT
EACH TURN THAT GOES BY,

00:07:34.818 --> 00:07:36.320
HE DRAINS 1,200 POINTS

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.889
FROM YOUR ULTIMATE DRAGON'S
ATTACK POWER.

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:41.858
SOON IT WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH
FOR ME TO DESTROY.

00:07:41.858 --> 00:07:42.993
[THINKING] HE'S RIGHT.

00:07:42.993 --> 00:07:44.995
MY DRAGON'S GETTING WEAKER
EVERY TURN,

00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:47.597
AND THERE'S NOTHING IN MY DECK
THAT CAN REVERSE IT.

00:07:47.597 --> 00:07:48.799
[WEAK GROWL]

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:52.469
ALL RIGHT!
THAT SINGLE ATTACK

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:54.738
IS BRINGING YUGI
BACK FROM THE BRINK.

00:07:54.738 --> 00:07:56.073
WAY TO GO, YUGI.

00:07:56.073 --> 00:07:57.174
HA! YOU'RE THE MAN.

00:07:57.174 --> 00:07:58.575
GREAT MOVE!

00:07:58.575 --> 00:07:59.743
YOU'VE HAD IT, KAIBA.

00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:01.878
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA WIN
THIS MATCH.

00:08:01.878 --> 00:08:03.380
[THINKING]
THAT'S JUST LIKE YUGI.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.248
EVEN WHEN THINGS
ARE LOOKING BAD,

00:08:05.248 --> 00:08:06.984
HE ALWAYS MANAGES
TO FIND A WAY

00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:08.885
TO OVERCOME
HIS OPPONENT.

00:08:08.885 --> 00:08:11.488
[THINKING] NEVER THOUGHT
I'D LIVE TO SEE THE DAY

00:08:11.488 --> 00:08:13.156
THAT KAIBA WAS OUTFOXED.

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:15.158
THAT YUGI PUNK IS GOOD.

00:08:15.158 --> 00:08:17.160
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.829
HE'S INTENSE, THAT ONE.

00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:21.665
IT'S LIKE HE WOULDN'T
LET NOTHIN' STOP HIM
FROM WINNING.

00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:24.034
Joey: SO WHAT DO
YOU SAY NOW, KAIBA?

00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:26.670
GUESS 3 HEADS
AREN'T BETTER THAN ONE.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.671
HMM.

00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:29.973
UHH, CAN'T LOSE.

00:08:29.973 --> 00:08:33.076
THE FATE OF MOKUBA'S SOUL
RIDES ON THIS GAME.

00:08:33.076 --> 00:08:34.411
ATTACK NOW,
ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:36.413
NEUTRON BLAST!

00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:39.316
AGAIN?

00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.285
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN?

00:08:42.285 --> 00:08:44.488
THE KURIBOH MULTIPLY FASTER
THAN YOU CAN ELIMINATE THEM

00:08:44.488 --> 00:08:46.156
WITH YOUR NEUTRON BLASTS.

00:08:46.156 --> 00:08:47.157
UHH.

00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:49.493
[WARBLING]

00:08:51.028 --> 00:08:52.662
NO. I WILL NOT,

00:08:52.662 --> 00:08:54.498
CAN NOT BE DEFEATED.

00:08:54.498 --> 00:08:55.899
I'LL DRAW ONE MORE CARD

00:08:55.899 --> 00:08:58.001
AND LET MY MAMMOTH
FINISH MY TURN.

00:08:58.001 --> 00:08:59.736
[THINKING]
SOON MY ULTIMATE DRAGON

00:08:59.736 --> 00:09:02.205
WILL BE WEAK ENOUGH FOR
YUGI TO DESTROY OUTRIGHT.

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:04.374
I'VE GOT TO KEEP TRYING.
IT'S MY ONLY HOPE.

00:09:04.374 --> 00:09:06.243
GO, ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:09:06.243 --> 00:09:08.311
NEUTRON BLAST!

00:09:12.983 --> 00:09:14.251
[WARBLING]

00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:16.953
ONCE AGAIN YOUR ATTACK
HAS FAILED, KAIBA.

00:09:16.953 --> 00:09:18.355
MY DEFENSE HOLDS.

00:09:18.355 --> 00:09:20.991
AND YOU HAVE
NO OTHER STRATEGY
TO USE AGAINST ME.

00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:22.759
YOUR TIME
IS RUNNING OUT.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:25.495
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
CHALLENGED ME, KAIBA.

00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:26.963
YOU SEE?

00:09:26.963 --> 00:09:30.033
MY MAMMOTH TAKES
ANOTHER 1,200 POINTS
FROM YOUR DRAGON.

00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:33.904
EVEN MY WEAKEST MONSTERS
CAN DESTROY IT NOW.

00:09:36.006 --> 00:09:38.742
[THINKING]
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
I'VE FAILED.

00:09:38.742 --> 00:09:40.544
I'VE FAILED
MY BROTHER.

00:09:40.544 --> 00:09:42.479
I'VE FAILED MOKUBA.

00:09:42.479 --> 00:09:44.481
HIS SOUL WILL BE
TRAPPED...FOREVER.

00:09:46.249 --> 00:09:47.984
HUNH!

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:53.156
Mokuba: SETO!

00:09:53.156 --> 00:09:54.257
AAH.

00:09:54.257 --> 00:09:55.425
HELP, SETO!

00:09:55.425 --> 00:09:57.160
PLEASE HELP ME.

00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:01.598
BROTHER, PLEASE!

00:10:01.598 --> 00:10:04.468
YOU PROMISED!
YOU PROMISED TO HELP ME!

00:10:04.468 --> 00:10:05.969
UHH.

00:10:05.969 --> 00:10:06.970
MOKUBA!

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.472
AAAH.

00:10:08.472 --> 00:10:09.473
SETO, HURRY!

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:10.974
I'M COMING!
I'LL HELP YOU!

00:10:10.974 --> 00:10:13.343
DON'T LET ME DOWN!
HELP ME!

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:14.344
BIG BROTHER, AAAH!

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.449
MOKUBA!

00:10:21.318 --> 00:10:22.319
UHH! OHH!

00:10:23.487 --> 00:10:25.489
YOU'RE ROTTEN
TO THE CORE, KAIBA,

00:10:25.489 --> 00:10:27.491
JUST LIKE
THAT DRAGON.

00:10:27.491 --> 00:10:28.492
UHH-AAH.

00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:30.327
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:31.328
UHH.

00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:32.329
WHY, SETO?

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:33.597
WHY DIDN'T YOU
HELP HIM?

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:35.732
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D ALWAYS
BE THERE FOR HIM.

00:10:35.732 --> 00:10:38.001
YOU PROMISED HIM,
SETO KAIBA!

00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:39.136
YOU PROMISED!

00:10:39.136 --> 00:10:40.137
UHH! UHH! UHH!

00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:43.306
MOKUBA!

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.252
HMM.

00:10:55.252 --> 00:10:57.254
[WEAK GROWL]

00:11:00.123 --> 00:11:02.325
[THINKING] KAIBA
HASN'T SAID A WORD.

00:11:02.325 --> 00:11:04.628
IT'S LIKE
HE'S IN ANOTHER WORLD.

00:11:04.628 --> 00:11:05.962
WHAT'S WITH KAIBA?

00:11:05.962 --> 00:11:08.465
HE'S JUST STANDING THERE,
COMPLETELY SPACING OUT.

00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:10.600
MAYBE IT'S FINALLY
SUNK IN HE'S LOST.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.236
TRUE. IN JUST A MINUTE
IT WILL ALL BE OVER.

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:15.939
BUT IT'S ALMOST SAD
TO SEE A PLAYER
OF HIS CALIBER

00:11:15.939 --> 00:11:17.607
TAKE LOSING SO HARD.

00:11:17.607 --> 00:11:18.608
OHH.

00:11:19.676 --> 00:11:21.311
[THINKING] LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
GONNA BE A NEW CHAMP.

00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:23.780
[WEAK ROAR]

00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:26.917
OHH.

00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.754
[THINKING] IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT CARD I DRAW NOW.

00:11:30.754 --> 00:11:33.823
ANY MONSTER CAN DEFEAT
HIS WEAKENED DRAGON.

00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:37.527
CELTIC GUARDIAN.

00:11:38.662 --> 00:11:39.663
HUNH!

00:11:41.364 --> 00:11:42.465
THIS IS IT, KAIBA!

00:11:42.465 --> 00:11:45.635
PREPARE TO MEET
YOUR DEMISE!

00:11:52.642 --> 00:11:54.377
CELTIC GUARDIAN,

00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:56.846
ATTACK ULTIMATE DRAGON!

00:12:00.517 --> 00:12:01.818
[ROARS]

00:12:05.522 --> 00:12:07.023
Both: ALL RIGHT!

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:08.158
[THINKING] THIS IS SO COOL.

00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:09.492
ONCE YUGI DEFEATS KAIBA,

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.528
HE'LL BE ABLE TO
RESCUE HIS GRANDFATHER.

00:12:11.528 --> 00:12:13.496
Joey: HEY,
THE ULTIMATE DRAGON'S
STILL STANDING.

00:12:13.496 --> 00:12:14.531
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:15.765
Bakura: THAT'S BECAUSE

00:12:15.765 --> 00:12:18.635
THE ULTIMATE DRAGON IS
A FUSION OF 3 BLUE-EYES.

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:21.471
EACH OF ITS 3 HEADS HAS
ITS OWN ATTACK POWER.

00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:23.607
CELTIC GUARDIAN
TOOK OUT ONE OF THEM,

00:12:23.607 --> 00:12:25.942
AND KAIBA LOST
THE 500 POINTS DIFFERENCE

00:12:25.942 --> 00:12:27.277
IN THEIR ATTACK STRENGTH.

00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:29.813
BUT WHEN THE CELTIC GUARDIAN

00:12:29.813 --> 00:12:32.148
TAKES OUT ANOTHER
WEAKENED HEAD NEXT TURN,

00:12:32.148 --> 00:12:34.818
THAT WILL WIPE KAIBA OUT
AND WIN THE MATCH.

00:12:34.818 --> 00:12:36.987
Joey: YOU MEAN...
KAIBA'S TOAST.

00:12:36.987 --> 00:12:38.822
YUGI...

00:12:38.822 --> 00:12:41.324
IT CAN'T END THIS WAY.

00:12:41.324 --> 00:12:43.326
IF I DON'T DEFEAT YOU
IN THIS DUEL,

00:12:43.326 --> 00:12:45.562
PEGASUS WILL KEEP
MOKUBA PRISONER...

00:12:45.562 --> 00:12:46.830
FOREVER.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.465
I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

00:12:48.465 --> 00:12:50.300
AND EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T HAVE A CARD

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.801
THAT CAN KEEP YOU
FROM ATTACKING,

00:12:51.801 --> 00:12:53.803
I THINK I STILL
HAVE A STRATEGY

00:12:53.803 --> 00:12:55.739
THAT WILL STOP YOU
IN YOUR TRACKS.

00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:57.040
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.842
I'M GOING TO
FORCE YOUR HAND

00:12:58.842 --> 00:13:00.577
AND WIN THIS BATTLE,
YUGI.

00:13:01.578 --> 00:13:04.581
Joey: LOOKS MORE LIKE
HE'S RETREATING TO ME.

00:13:06.349 --> 00:13:07.350
IS THIS A TRICK?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.551
YEAH.
WHAT'S HE UP TO?

00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:11.588
UHH.

00:13:11.588 --> 00:13:13.490
KAIBA!

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.025
STOP THIS!

00:13:21.362 --> 00:13:23.031
Joey: WHAT'S KAIBA
UP TO NOW?

00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:24.332
DOES HE THINK
THIS CHEAP STUNT'S

00:13:24.332 --> 00:13:26.100
GONNA KEEP YUGI
FROM WINNING THE MATCH

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.535
AND SAVING HIS GRANDPA?

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:28.603
Kaiba: YOU'RE MOVE,
YUGI.

00:13:28.603 --> 00:13:30.471
YOU CAN ATTACK
MY BLUE-EYES AGAIN

00:13:30.471 --> 00:13:32.473
AND WIPE OUT MY
REMAINING LIFE POINTS,

00:13:32.473 --> 00:13:34.475
BUT IF YOU DO,
THE RESULTING SHOCK WAVES

00:13:34.475 --> 00:13:36.611
MIGHT CAUSE ME
TO LOSE MY BALANCE.

00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:37.845
DON'T TEMPT ME!

00:13:37.845 --> 00:13:40.581
MY FATE IS COMPLETELY
IN YOUR HANDS, YUGI.

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:42.583
YOU'LL DECIDE THIS DUEL,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:44.319
OF COURSE,
IF YOU DON'T SURRENDER,

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:45.386
I MIGHT BE HURT.

00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:46.954
YOU WOULDN'T WANT THAT,
WOULD YOU?

00:13:46.954 --> 00:13:47.955
STOP IT, KAIBA!

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:49.590
YOU KNOW
THIS IS DANGEROUS!

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.958
AH, KAIBA'S BLUFFING.

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.261
COME ON,
DROP THIS CHEAP PLOY

00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:55.229
AND GET DOWN
FROM THAT LEDGE
AND PLAY FAIR!

00:13:55.229 --> 00:13:57.432
YOU KNOW THAT YUGI
DOESN'T WANNA HURT YOU.

00:13:57.432 --> 00:13:59.300
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.468
HE KNOWS.

00:14:00.468 --> 00:14:02.570
HE'S COUNTING ON YUGI
TO SURRENDER.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.305
HMM? BUT HE CAN'T
DO THAT.

00:14:05.306 --> 00:14:06.974
IF HE LOSES
TO KAIBA,

00:14:06.974 --> 00:14:09.143
HE WON'T GET
INTO THE CASTLE.

00:14:09.143 --> 00:14:10.511
HA HA HA HA!

00:14:10.511 --> 00:14:12.814
LOOKS LIKE
KAIBA'LL DO ANYTHING
TO COME OUT AHEAD,

00:14:12.814 --> 00:14:14.082
JUST LIKE ME.

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:15.450
Yugi: I'M WARNING YOU,
KAIBA.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.984
DON'T PUSH ME TOO FAR.

00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:19.087
I MUST WIN TO RESCUE
MY GRANDFATHER.

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:21.989
AND I MUST WIN THIS DUEL
TO RESCUE MOKUBA.

00:14:21.989 --> 00:14:25.326
THE DIFFERENCE IS,
I'M WILLING TO RISK
ANYTHING TO DO IT.

00:14:25.326 --> 00:14:28.296
YOU KNOW, I CAN STAND
UP HERE ALL DAY, YUGI.

00:14:28.296 --> 00:14:30.631
AND I'M CERTAIN
YOU WON'T MAKE ANY ATTACK

00:14:30.631 --> 00:14:32.533
FOR FEAR THAT YOU MIGHT
KNOCK ME OFF.

00:14:32.533 --> 00:14:35.069
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW
BY NOT ATTACKING,

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:39.040
YOU GIVE UP
THE ONLY CHANCE YOU HAVE
TO SAVE YOUR GRANDPA.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.241
HUNH.

00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:42.977
WHICH MEANS I HAVE
THE ADVANTAGE OVER YOU.

00:14:42.977 --> 00:14:44.145
FOR IN MY CASE,

00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:45.813
THERE'S NOTHING
HOLDING ME BACK.

00:14:47.415 --> 00:14:48.750
AH, A MAGIC CARD.

00:14:49.784 --> 00:14:50.785
REBORN THE MONSTER.

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:54.789
WHICH I'LL USE TO RESURRECT
THE BLUE-EYES HEAD

00:14:54.789 --> 00:14:56.591
THAT WAS JUST DESTROYED
BY YOUR GUARDIAN.

00:14:56.591 --> 00:14:58.726
WHAT? RESTORE A HEAD
OF THE BLUE-EYES?

00:15:00.895 --> 00:15:03.965
NOW ONE OF MY BLUE-EYES
WITH ITS NORMAL
ATTACK POINTS OF 3,000

00:15:03.965 --> 00:15:05.833
HAS JUST BEEN REBORN.

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.969
WITH ALL OF YOUR KURIBOHS
IN DEFENSE MODE,

00:15:07.969 --> 00:15:09.470
I COULDN'T TOUCH YOU,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.472
BUT NOW THAT YOU'VE PUT
AN ATTACK MONSTER
ON THE FIELD,

00:15:11.472 --> 00:15:13.474
I CAN TAKE OUT THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE POINTS.

00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:14.842
WHICH I'LL DO NEXT TURN.

00:15:14.842 --> 00:15:17.812
2 OF ULTIMATE DRAGON'S HEADS
ARE STILL WEAKENED,

00:15:17.812 --> 00:15:21.015
BUT THE THIRD CAN WIPE OUT
YOUR GUARDIAN IN A BREATH.

00:15:21.015 --> 00:15:22.817
OUR LIFE POINTS
ARE EQUAL, YUGI.

00:15:22.817 --> 00:15:24.519
STRIKE NOW
IF YOU DARE.

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:26.988
OTHERWISE, NEXT TURN,
I SWEAR I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN.

00:15:27.989 --> 00:15:30.491
[THINKING] IF I DEFEAT
ONE OF THE WEAKER BLUE EYES,
I WIN,

00:15:30.491 --> 00:15:33.528
BUT WHAT IF THE DUEL BATTLE
ACCIDENTALLY KNOCKS HIM
OFF THE LEDGE?

00:15:33.528 --> 00:15:35.062
SURRENDER, YUGI.

00:15:35.062 --> 00:15:38.266
THAT IS UNLESS
YOU HAVE THE COURAGE
TO UNLEASH YOUR ATTACK!

[DRAGON ROARS]

00:15:41.302 --> 00:15:42.770
I CAN'T.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.038
WE MUST.

00:15:45.339 --> 00:15:47.175
NO!
IT'S NOT RIGHT!

00:15:47.175 --> 00:15:48.176
YUGI!

00:15:49.844 --> 00:15:51.913
THERE MUST BE
ANOTHER WAY.

00:15:51.913 --> 00:15:52.914
THERE ISN'T.

00:15:54.348 --> 00:15:56.584
[THINKING] OHH.
LOOK AT HIS FACE.

00:15:56.584 --> 00:15:59.420
IT'S LIKE YUGI'S
STRUGGLING WITHIN HIMSELF
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.422
BUT HE CAN'T RISK
HURTING KAIBA.

00:16:01.422 --> 00:16:03.191
KAIBA, I'VE NEVER
BACKED AWAY,

00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:04.792
AND I'M NOT
STARTING NOW.

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:06.527

ATTACK!

00:16:06.527 --> 00:16:08.529

WE CAN'T DO THIS.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:34.484

THAT UNDERHANDED SLEAZEBALL
WIPED YUGI OUT.

JUST NOW THE BATTLE
BETWEEN YUGI AND KAIBA
WAS DECIDED.

SETO KAIBA
WAS THE VICTOR.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.959
THANK YOU, KEMO.

00:17:25.959 --> 00:17:30.397
SHALL I ALLOW SETO KAIBA TO
ENTER THE CASTLE THEN, SIR?

00:17:30.397 --> 00:17:32.565
YES.
A DEAL IS A DEAL.

00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:34.567
DONE.
RIGHT AWAY.

00:17:35.635 --> 00:17:37.337
GOOD JOB, KAIBA-BOY.

AS YOU WISHED, I WILL BE
YOUR NEXT OPPONENT.

00:17:40.573 --> 00:17:43.076
BUT LITTLE YUGI
DIDN'T FARE NEARLY SO WELL

00:17:43.076 --> 00:17:45.345
IN THIS REMATCH
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

00:17:45.345 --> 00:17:47.580

REMAINS MINE.

THAT PUNK YUGI
COULD'VE WON THE GAME,

00:18:04.554 --> 00:18:06.556
BUT HE THREW IT AWAY
TO KAIBA.

00:18:06.556 --> 00:18:09.058
WHOEVER HEARD
OF A DUELIST DOING THAT?

[PANTING]
[PANTING]

I ALMOST
COULDN'T CONTROL IT--

THIS OTHER PRESENCE
DEEP INSIDE ME.

00:18:20.737 --> 00:18:23.973
HE WAS WILLING TO GO
ALL THE WAY AGAINST KAIBA!

WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, BUDDY?

00:18:29.345 --> 00:18:32.882
LIKE ME,
YUGI HAS SOME SORT OF
ANCIENT SPIRIT INSIDE HIM.

00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:35.351
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH OUR MILLENNIUM ITEMS.

00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:38.421
I'M AFRAID OF THIS
SPIRIT INSIDE ME.

SO AFRAID THAT I WILL
NEVER DUEL AGAIN!

I'M SORRY, SORRY
ABOUT YOUR GRANDPA...

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:48.297
BUT YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

00:18:48.297 --> 00:18:50.166
YOU COULDN'T HURT
ANOTHER PERSON,

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:51.200
NOT EVEN TO SAVE HIM.

00:18:53.236 --> 00:18:55.304
Téa: HE WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE SAVED THAT WAY.

00:18:55.304 --> 00:18:57.206
THEN I GUESS HE GOT
WHAT HE WANTED.

00:18:57.206 --> 00:18:59.709
IF YUGI HAD DONE
WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE,

00:18:59.709 --> 00:19:02.378
HE WOULD BE ENTERING
THE CASTLE, NOT ME.

TO FOLLOW THROUGH
ON HIS PLAY.

WHICH IS MORE
THAN YOU DESERVE.

HE LOST
THE GAME.

LOST ONE LOUSY

LOST HIS HEART.
