00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.268
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LOOK UNDER IT FOR YOURSELF.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.569
WISE GUY.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:18.872
[GASP]
JOEY, NO!
IT'S A TRICK!

00:07:18.872 --> 00:07:21.474
HUH?! IT'S STILL THERE.

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:22.842
I'LL TAKE THAT.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:23.910
HUH?

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.446
I MOVED THE DICE
INTO MY RIGHT HAND,

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.782
AND I NEVER EVER
HAD TO TOUCH THE CUP.

00:07:28.782 --> 00:07:30.216
THAT MAKES ME
THE WINNER.

00:07:30.216 --> 00:07:34.521
GRR! YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A DIRTY, ROTTEN
CON ARTIST!

00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.957
IF YOU WERE A REAL MAN,
YOU'D PLAY A REAL GAME!

00:07:36.957 --> 00:07:39.893
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO A MATCH OF DUEL MONSTERS!

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.161
AS YOU WISH,

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.430
BUT SINCE THIS GAME
IS YOUR SPECIALTY,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.565
I DO HAVE ONE
VERY SMALL CONDITION.

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:46.833
CONDITION?

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.070
OKAY, BUT NO MORE FUNNY STUFF,
<i>CAPISCE?</i>

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.272
I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE
A DECK OF MY OWN.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:53.273
OOH! OOH!

00:07:53.273 --> 00:07:54.374
HEY,
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:56.609
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.211
YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE NEW CARD SHOP.

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.146
MY CONDITION IS THIS:

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:04.084
WE OPEN UP NEW PACKS
AND CREATE OUR OWN
NEW DUEL MONSTER DECKS.

00:08:04.084 --> 00:08:06.453
THAT'S FAIR,
EVEN BY YOUR
HIGH STANDARDS.

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.188
WHAT'S FAIR
ABOUT THAT?

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.023
IF YOU'RE
NOT PLAYING
WITH YOUR OWN CARDS,

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:11.558
THEN THE GAME'S
JUST PURE LUCK!

00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:13.660
BESIDES, THERE'S
AN AWFUL LOT
OF CARDS

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.295
THAT WE'VE NEVER
EVEN SEEN BEFORE.

00:08:15.295 --> 00:08:17.097
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH,
PAL-O-MINE.

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:19.332
WAS I OR WAS I NOT
A FINALIST

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.101
IN THE DUEL MONSTER'S
CHAMPIONSHIP?

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:22.902
YEAH, JOEY,
BUT I DON'T THINK I--

00:08:22.902 --> 00:08:25.105
I ACCEPT YOUR CONDITION.

00:08:25.105 --> 00:08:26.906
JOEY, DON'T DO IT.
EXCELLENT,

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.709
BUT PLAYING
A GAME FOR FUN
IS SO POINTLESS.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.211
LET'S MAKE
A LITTLE WAGER.

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.079
IF I WIN, YOU'LL DO
WHATEVER I ASK

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.114
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK.

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:36.049
YOU GOT IT, DICEY-BOY,

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.019
BECAUSE WHEN I WIN,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER I WANT YOU TO,

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.421
AND I WANT YOU
TO CLOSE DOWN
YOUR STINKIN' SHOP!

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:42.922
COME ON, DUKE!
YOU CAN BEAT HIM!

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.824
YOU CAN BEAT HIM!
DO IT, DUKE!

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:47.894
FORGET ABOUT IT.
NO WAY I CAN LOSE
TO THAT SHOW-OFF!

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:48.928
HE'S TOAST.

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.430
BURNT TO A CRISP.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.665
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
JOEY'S GETTING IN
OVER HIS HEAD AGAIN.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.801
YOU CAN'T
SERIOUSLY THINK
I'M GONNA LOSE

00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:56.703
TO A GUY WITH A DIE
STUCK IN HIS EAR?!

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.039
I'M ONE
OF THE TOP-RANKED PLAYERS
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:00.774
I'M NOT SOME
SNOTTY-NOSED ROOKIE

00:09:00.774 --> 00:09:02.409
WHO JUST BROUGHT HOME
HIS FIRST DECK!

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:03.943
YOU'RE GOOD,
JOEY, BUT--

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.745
BUT NOTHIN'!
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:09.449
VERY WELL.
WE'LL HOLD THE MATCH
TODAY AFTER SCHOOL.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:13.186
I HAVE A STATE-OF-THE-ART
DUELING RING LOCATED
IN MY GAME SHOP.

00:09:13.186 --> 00:09:14.687
ALL RIGHT?
SURE.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.056
OF COURSE,
YOU'RE ALL INVITED.

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:19.626
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
YOUR FRIEND'S FINEST HOUR.

00:09:19.626 --> 00:09:24.164
[THINKING] WHY DO I THINK
THIS ISN'T GONNA END WELL?

00:09:24.164 --> 00:09:27.500
Joey: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT DICE GUY OWNS THIS PLACE.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.536
LOOKS LIKE HE SPENT
SOME MAJOR MOOLA.

00:09:29.536 --> 00:09:31.438
TOO BAD HE'S GONNA BE
CLOSING IT DOWN.

00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:33.139
[CHUCKLES]

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.641
[SIGH]
[SIGH]
[SIGH]

00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.109
JOEY'S HEART'S
IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

00:09:36.109 --> 00:09:37.343
IT'S HIS HEAD
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.978
YEAH, IF HIS HEAD
GETS ANY BIGGER

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.780
HE'S GONNA GET IT STUCK
IN THE FRONT DOOR.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.917
I'M BAD. YOU KNOW IT.
I'M BAD. I'LL SHOW IT.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.653
WELCOME TO DUKE DEVLIN'S
GAME WORLD.

00:09:46.653 --> 00:09:49.589
MR. DEVLIN WAS BEGINNING
TO WORRY ABOUT YOU.
FOLLOW ME.

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.293
AH, YOU SHOWED UP.

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:55.562
THE DUELING RING
IS ON SUB-LEVEL 6.

00:09:55.562 --> 00:09:56.930
YOUR CHARIOT AWAITS.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.667
GO AHEAD, MR. WHEELER.
CHOSE YOUR PACKS CAREFULLY.

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:03.169
WE'LL BUILD OUR OWN DECKS
FROM THESE NEW CARDS.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:05.071
HMM. COME TO PAPA.

00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:07.006
[THINKING]
WHICH PACK IS THE BEST?

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:08.942
GOTTA FEEL THE ENERGY.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.077
COME ON. OH, YEAH!

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:12.178
GET A LOAD
OF THESE BABIES!

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.214
JOEY STRUCK GOLD!

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:16.049
DID YOU GET
SOME GOOD CARDS?

00:10:16.049 --> 00:10:19.018
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THIS MATCH IS
IN THE BAG!

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.386
[THINKING]
WE SHALL SEE.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.658
Joey: ARE WE THERE?

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:27.527
HUH?

00:10:27.527 --> 00:10:29.162
Girls: GIVE ME A "D!"
GIVE ME A "U!"

00:10:29.162 --> 00:10:31.464
GIVE ME A "K!"
GIVE ME AN "E!" GO, DUKE!

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.633
THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:36.569
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
THE SMALLEST RING
IN THE PLACE,

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.538
BUT IT DOES HAVE
ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES.

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:40.206

HE'S OUR MAN!

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.841
IF HE CAN'T DO IT,
NOBODY CAN!

CAMERA ONE IN POSITION.

TV CAMERAS?

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.381
YEAH, I HAVE A LITTLE THEORY
THAT THE BIGGER THE AUDIENCE,

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.016
THE BETTER THE PERFORMANCE.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:54.220
THAT'S WHY I'VE DECIDED
TO BROADCAST THIS MATCH LIVE
TO THE ENTIRE WORLD!

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.258
I KNOW MY FANS
WILL ENJOY WATCHING ME DEFEAT
THE SECOND-BEST DUELIST.

00:10:58.258 --> 00:11:00.126
I JUST HOPE
YOU REALLY ARE SECOND BEST...

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.161
NOT SECOND-RATE.

00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.697
HMM, SECOND-RATE?
SECOND-RATE?!

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.533

OF SWORD HUNTER'S ARMOR,

RAISING HIS ATTACK POWER
BY A WHOPPING 200 POINTS.

00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:37.657
OH, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:40.960
NOT BAD. MAYBE JOEY
WON'T EMBARRASS HIMSELF
AFTER ALL.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.061
THINK HE'S GOT A SHOT?

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.162

HA! THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG, PONYTAIL.

THE MAD SWORD BEAST
REDUCES YOUR LIFE POINTS

EVEN IF YOUR STINKIN' BAT
WAS IN DEFENSE MODE.

00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.605
OW. THAT HURT.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.607
JOEY BETTER
START THINKING MORE
THAN ONE MOVE AHEAD.

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:03.776
DON'T GET
TOO COCKY, JOEY!

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:06.946
LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
I GOT THIS MATCH HERE
IN THE BAG!

00:14:06.946 --> 00:14:10.083
HA HA! I COULD BEAT
THIS 2-BIT LOSER
EVEN IN MY SLEEP!

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:11.351
[THINKING] I DON'T KNOW.

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.119
I THINK DUKE DEVLIN KNOWS
MORE ABOUT THIS GAME

00:14:13.119 --> 00:14:14.620
THAN HE'S LETTING ON.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.023
I HOPE JOEY
DOESN'T BLOW IT.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.392
THINK THAT LITTLE TRICK'S
GONNA SAVE YOUR BONY BUTT?

00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:20.460
THINK AGAIN!

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.128
I STILL GOT YOU
WHERE I WANT YOU.

00:14:22.128 --> 00:14:25.998
WE'LL SEE.
SINCE YOUR STRONGEST MONSTER
WHEN OFF TO AN EARLY GRAVE,

00:14:25.998 --> 00:14:29.802
NOW WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT TIME
FOR ME TO GO ON THE ATTACK.

00:14:29.802 --> 00:14:32.472
FIRST, I'LL PLAY
THIS CARD FACEDOWN.

00:14:32.472 --> 00:14:34.607
YEAH, YEAH.

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:38.177
THEN I SUMMON SPIKEBOT...

00:14:38.177 --> 00:14:39.512
WITH SPIKE ATTACK!

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:44.984

COME ON, JOEY!

DUKE DEVLIN'S JUST TRYING
TO PSYCHE YOU OUT!

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.721
DON'T LET THAT JOKER
GET TO YOU!

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.357
IF YOU LOSE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:52.592
DON'T YOU FORGET THAT!

00:14:52.592 --> 00:14:54.494

WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN?!

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.686
OH, I FORGOT
THOSE GOBLIN GUYS

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.889
GO INTO DEFENSIVE MODE
AFTER THEY ATTACK.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:26.592
NO PROBLEMO.
HE'S ONLY GOT
50 POINTS LEFT, ANYWAY.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.294
AND NEXT TURN,
IT'S ZERO.

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:31.397
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA
CLOSE YOUR SHOP DOWN

AND MAKE
YOUR GRANDFATHER
SO HAPPY.

00:15:40.006 --> 00:15:42.408
GO! YOU GOT HIM NOW, JOEY!

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:45.211
[THINKING]
HOW CAN DUKE DEVLIN
STILL BE SO CALM.

00:15:45.211 --> 00:15:47.013
EITHER HE'S GOT
ICE IN HIS BLOOD,

00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:50.783
OR HE'S STILL GOT
ONE LAST TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE.

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.119
JUST BE CAREFUL!
IT'S NOT OVER YET!

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.220
DON'T LET YOUR GUARD...
THOSE GIRLS ARE GONNA BE

OH, I CAN'T WATCH.

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:01.694
ENOUGH FOOLING AROUND.

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:04.730
TIME TO SUMMON ONE
OF THE MOST POWERFUL CARDS
IN MY DECK!

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.499
THE MIGHTY GRADIUS!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:11.103
THAT ALL YOU GOT?

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:12.338
'CAUSE THAT
WON'T SAVE YOU.

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:16.476
HMM. AND I USE A MAGIC CARD:
LIMITER REMOVAL,

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:20.413
WHICH DOUBLES
MY ATTACK POWER.

00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:23.683
WHAT?! HOLY CANNOLI.
THAT'S A LOT
OF POINTS!

00:16:23.683 --> 00:16:25.151
GOOD THING I GOT
ALL MY GOBLINS,

00:16:25.151 --> 00:16:27.854
OR HE'D BEAT ME
WITH ONE LOUSY SHOT.

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:31.791
WAIT. ANOTHER MAGIC CARD:
FAIRY METEOR CRUSH.

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.993
NOT THAT!

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:36.729
HMM. HEY, I NEVER HEARD
OF THAT FAIRY CARD.

00:16:36.729 --> 00:16:37.864
WHAT'S IT DO?

00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:39.966
DON'T TELL ME
THE SECOND-BEST DUELIST

00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:41.567
DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THIS CARD DOES.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:44.036
WELL, YOU MIGHT SAY
IT'S A MAGIC CARD VERSION

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.339
OF THE MAD SWORD BEAST CARD
YOU PLAYED.

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.673
MAD SWORD BEAST.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.375
HEY! THAT MEANS--

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.511
THIS CARD HAS A SPECIAL POWER.

00:16:51.511 --> 00:16:55.181
USUALLY YOUR MONSTER
IN DEFENSIVE MODE
WOULD ABSORB MY ATTACK,

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.283
BUT WITH
THE FAIRY METEOR CRUSH CARD,

00:16:57.283 --> 00:17:02.021
I CAN DEAL MY DAMAGE
DIRECTLY TO YOUR PRECIOUS
LIFE POINTS.

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.222
NO!

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.494
IT'S A PITY THIS MATCH
WAS SO SHORT.

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:10.630
I WAS HOPING
FOR AN ACTUAL CHALLENGE,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.898
BUT IT WAS
NOT MEANT TO BE.

00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:14.066
THE ONLY THING
THAT CHEERS ME UP,

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:16.636
IS KNOWING
THAT YOU'LL SOON
BECOME MY SERVANT

TO HAVING AN OBEDIENT DOG
FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

[THINKING] AAH!
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?!

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:03.215
WHEN I WAS
IN THE DUELIST KINGDOM,

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:04.750
I NEVER MADE
A MISTAKE LIKE THIS.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.887
I HAD A PURPOSE THEN--
FIGHTING FOR MY SISTER.

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:10.089
NOW, I GUESS,
I'VE JUST GONE
TO THE DOGS.
