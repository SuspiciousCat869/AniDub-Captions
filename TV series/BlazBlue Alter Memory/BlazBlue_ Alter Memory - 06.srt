00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,208
but I'll let it
slide this time.

322
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,583
Them saving his ass don't
make no never-mind to me!

323
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,375
Do you know why?

324
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,916
[HAZAMA] I've got
some tricks of my own

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,833
I still need to
shove up my sleeves.

326
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,083
[KOKONOE] Keep sleeping
for now, Lambda.

327
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,250
If I'm gonna beat
that grinning bastard,

328
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:41,333
I need your Idea Engine
working perfectly.

329
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,125
[JIN] Brother.

330
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:49,708
[gasps]

331
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:52,333
[JIN] Yukianesa.
What's wrong with you?

332
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,208
[BANG] It froze
Lord Tenjo solid.

333
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:57,916
And etched my defeat
into my face.

334
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,541
But a sword you cannot draw

335
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:02,291
is nothing more than a bauble.

336
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:07,458
Major, perhaps the fault
lies not within the blade.

337
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,041
How dare you?

338
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,666
[BANG] I know this is sudden,
and I am loath to send you out

339
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,416
into the night, but I think
you are in grave danger.

340
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,125
One of your own hunts
for you even now.

341
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,125
[JIN] I thought you wanted
a fight, bounty hunter.

342
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,083
'Til you've healed up,
there's no honor in it.

343
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,500
Besides...

344
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,000
[BANG] So long as your
sword refuses you,

345
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,916
it wouldn't be
much of a fight.

346
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,791
Now make haste.

347
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,916
[BANG SUBORDINATE 6A]
Boss, are you sure about this?

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,125
[BANG] Yes. He's free to go.

349
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,541
Once his wounds
are healed

350
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,708
and his doubts
have been swept away,

351
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,625
then we shall have
a duel for the ages.

352
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:50,625
His eyes, they had the look.

353
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,583
[BANG] The look of a
man about to do battle

354
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,833
with something enormous.

355
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,958
Like, my master's
that fateful day.

356
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,375
[JIN] The fault is mine?

357
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,500
About damn time.

358
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:23,291
[TSUBAKI] Jin, I'm really
glad that I didn't find you.

359
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,458
[NOEL] Tsubaki!

360
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,250
[gasps]

361
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,833
Noel!

362
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,791
[chuckles]

363
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:08,458
[BANG] Miss Litchi!

364
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,125
Would you please read
this letter I wrote you?

365
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,958
[LITCHI] Uh, "Episode Seven,
The Wings of Judgment"?

366
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,125
[BANG] Uh! I gave
you the wrong letter!

367
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,916
How can this be?
