1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,958
[TA] In order to negate
the world's current destiny,

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,333
the Power of Order
will awaken and destroy

3
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:16,250
the Black Beast's
preliminary form.

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,333
[RACHEL] Thus proving
that she, the Master Unit,

5
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,458
desires something beyond
this bland repetition.

6
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:26,708
[TB] Perhaps. But the future
we desire is quite different.

7
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,125
We would see a world
of tranquility.

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,208
We will appraise this Continuum
Shift, altering it as needed,

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,750
until a perfect
world is birthed.

10
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:40,375
One immune to the
vagaries of chance.

11
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,833
[RACHEL] Speaking of immunity,
Yuuki Terumi has already

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:47,041
shrugged off your
threadbare leash, has he not?

13
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,041
[TC] Yuuki Terumi's
actions have all fallen

14
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,791
within the
expected parameters.

15
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:55,000
Any interference stemming from
the use of the Sealed Armagus

16
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,833
Isayoi will be dealt with as
a part of the Continuum Shift.

17
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:02,000
[TB] At this point, I believe
you, Rachel Alucard,

18
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,583
inspire more apprehension
than does he.

19
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,625
[TA] Do you intend to shirk
your duty as a spectator

20
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,666
and interfere yet again?

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,166
[RACHEL]
You wound me.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,041
I am the rightful heir
to the Tsukuyomi.

23
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,291
Defending the Master Unit
is my raison d'être.

24
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,916
To say nothing of the fact
that the world you desire...

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,458
...seems so dull.

26
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,250
[RAGNA grunts]

27
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,041
Too slow.

28
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,750
[JIN] Finally, the truth has
made itself known to me.

29
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,916
Oh, yeah?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
[JIN] All the evil
in this world...

31
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,750
You are the festering
root of it all, Brother.

32
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,791
Bastard! What the
hell're you on ab--?

33
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,333
[RAGNA groans]

34
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,625
[JIN]
You are chaos personified.

35
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:31,541
You spew out corruption onto the
Earth with your every breath.

36
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,625
But don't let it
worry you, Brother.

37
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,208
No one in this world is
going to lay a finger on you.

38
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,041
For the simple reason
that... you die here!

39
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,458
[RAGNA roars]

40
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,625
[RAGNA]
You bastard!

41
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,000
[JIN]
Aw! What's wrong, Brother?

42
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,458
You can fight much better
than that, can't you?

43
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,416
[RAGNA] You're
pissing me off, Jin!

44
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,625
[JIN]
No Shadow, No Echo.

45
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,166
Judgment.

46
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,000
Snowstorm!

47
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,125
[RAGNA screams]

48
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:23,833
[JIN laughs]

49
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,916
You're so weak, Brother!

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,791
The fun's going to be
over far too soon!

51
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:32,500
If I kick your ass,
will you shut up already?

52
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,083
[JIN laughs]

53
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,666
[MAKOTO]
It's Tager.

54
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,083
He's the one we were
gonna meet with?

55
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,416
[HAZAMA] You're a
peach, Lieutenant.

56
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,083
You brought her right to me.

57
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,333
Hunting her down across the
whole city would have been

58
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,833
a real pain in the ass. You get
a gold star. Now, run along.

59
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,208
[NOEL] What?

60
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,500
Keep your damn star.
I didn't bring her here for you.

61
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,500
Such a sassy Beastkin.
Here I thought you were

62
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,833
being a good little soldier
and doing me a solid.

63
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,916
After all, this whole
Continuum Shift was prepared

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,458
for Noel Vermillion. I can't
start the party without her!

65
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,666
Huh? What do you mean?

66
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,791
[HAZAMA] C'mon! Do I have
to explain everything?

67
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,458
Long story short--
it's been a lot of work.

68
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,333
But it's about to pay off.
I think it's time

69
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,166
that we yank the support
characters off the stage.

70
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,791
Starting with good
ol' Tsubaki Yayoi!

71
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,791
[NOEL gasps]

72
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,166
What did you do to her?

73
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,291
[HAZAMA] I don't appreciate
your tone, Lieutenant.

74
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,291
Don't forget, I am still
your superior officer.

75
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,708
[MAKOTO] You, my superior?
Don't make me laugh!

76
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,166
[HAZAMA]
Oh, it's like that, huh?

77
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,208
Y'know, I heard you refer
to this oversized schmuck

78
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,250
from Sector Seven by name.

79
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,166
I wonder! Has Lieutenant
Makoto been in contact

80
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,625
with known enemies
of the N.O.L.?

81
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,583
Oh, the humanity!
It brings a tear to my eye

82
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,958
just entertaining
the possibility!

83
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,541
We gotta split up
and run for it, okay?

84
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:01,916
We're splitting up?

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,666
Make a break for the left.
I'll cut to the right.

86
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,875
And I'll bring up the rear.

87
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,416
[MAKOTO] Wha--?

88
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,833
Makoto!

89
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:16,041
Bolverk! Come forth!

90
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,291
[HAZAMA] Woo-hoo!

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Can you stand?

92
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,375
Go, before it's too late.

93
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,375
[NOEL gasps]

94
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,375
I got this.

95
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,583
I'm not leaving you!

96
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,208
Either we get out
of this together

97
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,708
or we don't get out at all!
Tsubaki needs both our help!

98
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,583
Good call, Noellers.
That's a lot to do by yourself.

99
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,166
[NOEL] Yeah!

100
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,583
If you're looking for a fight...

101
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,875
This is your lucky day!

102
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:02,666
Oh, no. How am I ever going
to survive two against one?

103
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,625
[TAGER groans]

104
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,791
My self-repairs
aren't done yet.

105
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,916
[KOKONOE] Don't try
anything stupid.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,083
[TAGER] The situation's
escalating over here.

107
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,875
Yeah. That's why I'm rerouting
all your remaining energy

108
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,541
into getting the transfer
system back online.

109
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,791
[TAGER] Wait, what about
evac-ing these two?

110
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,500
Getting Lambda out
there is more important.

111
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,041
[TAGER]
Yes, but...

112
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,166
[KOKONOE] Look, I don't have
time to argue about this, Tager.

113
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,958
Wait, Kokonoe--!

114
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,958
Yeah, I know.

115
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,791
[MAKOTO grunts]

116
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,708
[MAKOTO]
Hah! Hah! Yah!

117
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,333
[HAZAMA]
Oh-ho-ho, c'mon!

118
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,416
Too slow!

119
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,125
[MAKOTO yells]

120
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,791
[NOEL]
Take that!

121
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:49,791
[HAZAMA]
Uh--!

122
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,625
[MAKOTO yells]

123
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,541
[HAZAMA]
Ya got me...

124
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,458
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

125
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,791
[NOEL]
What's that?

126
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,666
Ouroboros, bitch!

127
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,708
Ah!

128
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,000
[HAZAMA] Who said
you could touch me,

129
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,416
you mangy little half-breed?

130
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,583
[HAZAMA] I know you
wanna play, Twelve,

131
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,291
but we've got a busy day later.

132
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,750
You should take a nap.

133
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,166
[HAZAMA] Your turn.

134
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,500
Somebody thinks
they're a bad-ass, huh?

135
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,791
I could stomp your
head in right now,

136
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:55,000
but where's the fun in that?

137
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,833
Damn it!
What the hell?

138
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:06,416
How does Terumi keep
knowing when to strike?

139
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,958
Guess I'd better
assume that bastard's

140
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,958
got his eyes on us
all the time, more or less.

141
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,791
But even a snake has to blink.

142
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,208
I'll wait for his
focus to shift.

143
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:20,416
Question is, what's gonna
command that freak's attention?

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,208
[KOKONOE] This has Ragna the
Bloodedge written all over it.

145
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,333
[MAKOTO screams]

146
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,875
You don't look like
you're having any fun!

147
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,291
You gonna die?
Is that all you're good for?

148
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:39,958
Makoto...

149
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,875
[laughs]

150
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,333
Huh?

151
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,083
[HAZAMA] Look who
decided to join us!

152
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,833
[NOEL] Makoto!

153
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,166
Not another inch!

154
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,875
One more step and she's
got a date with gravity.

155
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,833
Man, if she falls
all the way down,

156
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,708
you can bet your ass
she's gonna be roadkill.

157
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,208
[NOEL]
Let her go this instant!

158
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,166
Do you want her to fall?

159
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,041
You need to think before
you open your mouth.

160
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,250
Strike one!

161
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,250
[MAKOTO wails]

162
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,833
Makoto!

163
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,166
[HAZAMA] Y'know, I betcha
beating her to a pulp

164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,041
would have its charms, too!

165
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,666
[HAZAMA snickers]

166
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,916
Put her down!

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,833
[HAZAMA]
Shut your mouth, puppet!

168
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:29,208
I don't know where you get off
thinking you can boss me around!

169
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,291
[MAKOTO yells]

170
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:36,458
Stop squeezing her!
She's gonna die!

171
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,875
You don't listen!
If you tell me what to do

172
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,083
one more time, I'm going to
pulp her like an orange!

173
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,291
I'm so sorry, Captain Hazama.

174
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,041
Please don't hurt her.
I'm begging you.

175
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,500
"Don't hurt her"?
Do you have any idea

176
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:57,041
whose fault all of
this is? Answer me!

177
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,458
Whose fault it is?

178
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,875
Noel, he lies.

179
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,291
[HAZAMA]
Shut up, you!

180
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,291
[MAKOTO screams]

181
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,666
[NOEL gasps]

182
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,416
Well, gosh. Did I pet
the squirrel too hard?

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,291
[HAZAMA laughs]

184
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,875
That's Beastkin for ya!

185
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,041
A human would've had the
good sense to die by now!

186
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,375
[NOEL] Please, just...
just stop already.

187
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,166
Give it a rest. How could
you not know the score?

188
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,166
It's friggin' obvious who's to
blame for your friend's pain.

189
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,666
Obvious how?

190
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,250
It's you, all right?
You, Noel Vermillion!

191
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,916
You screwed the pooch for
everyone just by existing!

192
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,708
It was me?

193
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,000
[HAZAMA]
That's right.

194
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,791
Everything you touch
turns to crap, Lieutenant!

195
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,208
You wanna know why?
It's because you

196
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:49,208
shouldn't even be here!
Your existence ruins everything!

197
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,916
[NOEL]
I shouldn't be here?

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,500
Correct! If you hadn't been
there to steal her spot,

199
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,041
poor Tsubaki wouldn't
have turned into

200
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,125
a walking poster for
the Zero-Squadron!

201
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,208
You're such a good
friend! Way to go!

202
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,250
[NOEL gasps]

203
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,375
That girl, she never
had a chance.

204
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,416
Her life was gonna suck
either way, don't get me wrong,

205
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,041
but you sure as hell
didn't help any!

206
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,416
Don't talk that way
about Tsubaki!

207
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,166
Are you allergic to
the truth or something?

208
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,333
She's a cipher.
Nothing special about her.

209
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,458
But she could've had a little
bit of happiness in her life.

210
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,541
Too bad her bestie kicked
that plan in the nuts!

211
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,791
[NOEL]
That's not--!

212
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:31,833
Ha! Take a look at how
things should've been!

213
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,958
[HAZAMA] Look upon the truth
and despair, you mistake!

214
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,916
[NOEL] Nooo!

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,791
You saw, right?
You totally saw it!

216
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,458
You got a ringside seat to the
world as it should've been!

217
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,000
[HAZAMA] One without
any trace of you!

218
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:59,958
No. You're wrong.
I'm not a mistake.

219
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,416
[HAZAMA] No more BS, okay?
I'm just gonna say it!

220
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,000
The Azure Successor and the
Calamity Trigger are you!

221
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,166
You effed it up!

222
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,916
[gasps] I...!

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,166
[HAZAMA]
And now you know.

224
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,333
I think it's time we wrap
up the chit-chat, girls.

225
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,250
You still alive up there?

226
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,000
[MAKOTO shudders]

227
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,333
[HAZAMA] Let's put you
out of your misery.

228
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,916
[NOEL] Huh...?

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,291
Makoto... Makoto!

230
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:49,416
[NOEL gasps]

231
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,916
[HAZAMA]
Don't look so sad.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,666
She probably hasn't
even hit the ground yet.

233
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,083
[NOEL]
You bastard...

234
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,833
You'll pay for
what you've done!

235
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,791
Look who finally grew a pair!
Feel that hate!

236
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:10,000
Let it crawl into your
heart and soul! Yes! Yes!

237
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,583
[NOEL]
You killed my friend!

238
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,583
I won't let you
get away with it!

239
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,833
Atta girl! Put one
right in my head!

240
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,333
Pull the Calamity Trigger!

241
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,541
[screams]

242
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:25,375
[NOEL] I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill you!

243
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,333
Now! Quickly!
Tick-tock, Noel!

244
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,541
Pull the trigger already!
Do it, do it, do it!

245
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,291
[screams]

246
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,083
[NOEL] I hate you.
I hate you.

247
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:44,416
I hate you! I hate you,
hate you, hate you, hate you!

248
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,041
[HAZAMA cackles]

249
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:55,250
[HAZAMA] She finally disengaged
her freakin' Limiter! Yes!

250
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,750
Hate my guts!
Hate your own damn guts!

251
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,041
Hate the whole world! And
use that Eye! Use it to see

252
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:06,583
[HAZAMA] the world's despair!
Every beautiful bit of it!

253
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:12,500
I am a mistake.
The world is useless.

254
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,208
The world is useless.
The world is useless.

255
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,583
You are so right! It is!
When people look at you,

256
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,458
they see through the façade!
They fear the thing underneath!

257
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,958
[HAZAMA] What are you
gonna do, huh, Number 12?

258
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
Curl up and die?

259
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,250
Or unleash your all-encompassing
hatred upon them?

260
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,666
Come, Twelve! Join me!
Join me in the darkness!

261
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,625
[NOEL] This world...
I hate it.

262
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:06,333
With this, with this, I finally
have control over everything!

263
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:12,625
[laughs]

264
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,000
What is it?

265
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,583
[RAGNA] I'm gonna have to
kick your ass later, Jin!

266
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,166
[JIN] Damn it!

267
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,375
You again.

268
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,958
[JUBEI]
Jin, don't follow him!

269
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,416
Out of my way,
old one. Now.

270
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Just get to that underground
Cauldron, y'hear?

271
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,375
You won't have to wait for long.

272
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,875
[JIN]
To the Cauldron, huh?

273
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:42,875
[JUBEI]
That's right!

274
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,375
[JIN]
Why should I obey you?

275
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,833
[JUBEI] If you're
really itchin' to finish

276
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,625
your fight with Ragna,
you'll do it.

277
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,833
What awaits me?

278
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,791
[JUBEI]
Y'got feet, kid.

279
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,208
It's up to the young folk now.
Change the world.

280
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291
Look who showed up.

281
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,875
I thought you'd keep
me waiting for a while!

282
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:32,333
[RAGNA] Terumi! Where's Noel?
Tell me, dammit!

283
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,875
[HAZAMA "Noel"? Well, if you
mean Noel Vermillion...

284
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,333
Direct your eyes
to the center ring!

285
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,541
This sensation...
Son-of-a...!

286
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,458
[HAZAMA] Ooh! That was
pretty quick on the uptake!

287
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,916
Y'know, for you.

288
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,666
[RAGNA]
That's a Cauldron.

289
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,125
[HAZAMA]
No effin' duh!

290
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,458
Don't tell me
you're going t--!

291
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,833
Well, of course I did!

292
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,500
What the hell else was
I gonna do with her?

293
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:57,500
Terumi! You bastard!

294
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,208
[RAGNA grunts]

295
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,416
Stop the smelting
right now, dammit!

296
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,125
Can't we discuss this
like grown-ass men?

297
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,875
That's enough!
Just hang in there, Noel!

298
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,791
I'll get you out
as fast as I can!

299
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,916
Oh, no! Not the
fearsome Azure Grimoire!

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
Take me away, Ragna!
I give up!

301
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:21,166
Restriction 666 released!

302
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,833
Dimensional Interference Field
deployed! Blah, blah, blah!

303
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,625
[RAGNA and HAZAMA]
BlazBlue... activate!

304
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:36,833
What the hell? It stopped!
That's impossible!

305
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,875
[RACHEL] Hail the
conquering hero,

306
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,583
trussed up like a fowl
for the holiday feast.

307
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,125
[HAKUMEN] Hm?

308
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,750
[RACHEL] Not the most elegant
oubliette I've ever seen.

309
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,583
[HAKUMEN] Why have
you come here?

310
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,708
[RACHEL] Terumi has
taken Noel Vermillion.

311
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,083
[HAKUMEN] Hm...

312
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,625
[RACHEL] Meaning, Mr. Hero,

313
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,416
that your cue to
enter has sounded.

314
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,250
[HAKUMEN]
Once freed from this prison,

315
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,541
you know I will strike down
the Azure Successor.

316
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,333
Acceptable.

317
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,958
[HAKUMEN] You mean
to repeat the cycle.

318
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,916
I'd rather not.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,708
However, the loss of the
Master Unit is not an option.

320
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,791
[HAKUMEN] In that case,
I will play my part.

321
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,666
Though doing your bidding
vexes me to no end.

322
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,083
You scoundrel. I am a fair sight
nicer to you than Kokonoe.

323
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,125
[HAKUMEN]
Hm. It doesn't matter.

324
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,666
This restraint circle is more
than even you can handle.

325
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,541
Is that so?

326
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,625
Multiple levels of
punitive restraints.

327
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,750
Nowhere near what I would
consider foolproof.

328
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,250
[HAKUMEN]
I will not thank you.

329
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,666
Nor would I accept it.
Now, then...

330
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,208
[BOTH] Mm?

331
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,250
Princess, are you all right?

332
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,208
Of course I am.

333
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:19,208
[RACHEL] Kokonoe. Dismantling
your barrier was no easy task!

334
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,416
[gasps]

335
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,125
[NAGO] Huh?

336
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,541
[RACHEL and NAGO struggle]

337
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,958
[RACHEL]
What's this... power?

338
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,708
[IMPERATOR]
You struggle in vain.

339
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,541
Your bonds are magical.

340
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,250
Magical?

341
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,291
[RACHEL] Don't tell
me you're...!

342
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,541
[IMPERATOR] I grow rather weary
of your tiny rebellions.

343
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,250
[RACHEL] You're in no position
to judge me, Imperator!

344
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,416
Huh! Spectators belong
in the audience,

345
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,916
not taking to the stage to
steer the plot as they will.

346
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,333
Forthwith, I shall lower
the curtain upon this farce.

347
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:31,416
My power. How are
you blocking it?

348
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,958
Wanna know?
Do you really?

349
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,000
I'd hold onto my ass
if I were you, Rags!

350
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,833
Feel good about
your odds right now?

351
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,916
[TRINITY] Fight, and you
will surely perish.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,625
[RACHEL] Right now, this is a
fight you cannot hope to win.

353
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,083
Don't tell me...!

354
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:48,250
[HAZAMA] You should see the
look on your face, Ragna!

355
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,000
It's priceless!
It's like you're a kid again!

356
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,166
[RAGNA gasps]

357
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,208
Get ready, 'cause
here's a spoiler!

358
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:01,916
[HAZAMA] The one who created
the BlazBlue is yours truly.

359
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,083
[RAGNA gasps]

360
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,458
[IMPERATOR] Hazama,
please create the BlazBlue

361
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,833
for my entertainment.

362
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:12,083
[HAZAMA]
Like, right now?

363
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,875
[IMPERATOR] Episode 11,
"The Murakumo Awakens."

364
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:15,875
Are you done yet?

365
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,416
[HAZAMA] No!
