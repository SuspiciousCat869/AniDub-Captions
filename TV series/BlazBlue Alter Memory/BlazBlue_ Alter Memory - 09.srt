1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,250
[HAZAMA] The N.O.L.'s
Praetorian Guard is comprised

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,083
of brave men and women

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,083
who've sworn their
allegiance to the Imperator.

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,041
When the time came
for them to offer up

5
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,875
their souls in pursuit
of that allegiance,

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,333
they did so willingly.

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,541
Their sacrifice
changes everything.

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,916
[HAZAMA] That said,
Your Majesty has only

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,708
just been awakened.

10
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,958
For the time being,
I would beg of you to

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,916
conduct your Imperial
inspection from afar.

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,833
[HAZAMA] Izayoi and Imperator.

13
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,291
Not being able to see 'em
for crap must drive you crazy.

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,416
Takamagahara!

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,250
[grunts]

16
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:51,833
[KOKONOE]
Terumi's on the hunt, too.

17
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,083
If he finds her,
he's gonna smelt her.

18
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,166
The one time I wanna see her,
and she's nowhere!

19
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,083
Noel. Over here.

20
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,583
Where're we going?

21
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,916
Wherever Sector Seven
wants us to rendezvous.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,916
How'll you know?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,708
For now, just follow me.

24
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,708
[JIN grunts]

25
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,541
I can sense his presence.

26
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:23,125
He would take the
shortest path available.

27
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,458
[JIN] It leads to
your death, Brother!

28
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,833
[running water]

29
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,583
[LITCHI] Strange. The seithr
concentration down here

30
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,541
has grown far thicker
than it used to be.

31
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,083
[LITCHI gasps]

32
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,791
[HAZAMA] Congratulations,
my dear Doctor Litchi.

33
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,083
This place isn't easy to find.

34
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,666
[LITCHI] Says who?

35
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,916
Captain Hazama,
member of the N.O.L.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,708
Intelligence Department.

37
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,041
You stay back!

38
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,583
[chuckles] Easy, tiger.

39
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,208
Fighting you is the
furthest thing from my mind.

40
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,708
Matter of fact,
you're gonna be real glad

41
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,958
that we ran into each other.

42
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,625
Explain yourself.

43
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,250
[HAZAMA]
Take a look behind you.

44
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,375
[LITCHI gasps]

45
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,958
[ARAKUNE] Melting, my body,
my body is, melting.

46
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,291
Impossible!

47
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,791
[HAZAMA] And yet, there he is.

48
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,041
The man you love, in the flesh.

49
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,291
Well, so to speak.

50
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,791
[LITCHI] Roy!
Roy, it's me! Litchi!

51
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,375
[ARAKUNE] Li...tchi?

52
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,083
[HAZAMA] Such is the fate
of those who trifle

53
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,666
with the Boundary's power.

54
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,666
He sure as hell
ain't the man he used to be.

55
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm betting this put a crimp
on the ol' romance, huh?

56
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,458
[LITCHI] That's enough!

57
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,916
[HAZAMA] What if I told you
I could take this cesspool

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,458
and put him
out of his misery

59
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,166
by changing him back
to the way he was?

60
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,625
[gasps]

61
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,625
[NOEL] This is
the N.O.L.'s barracks.

62
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,375
There are no Praetorian
Guards here, either?

63
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,333
[MAKOTO] The Kagutsuchi
Branch is a ghost town

64
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,958
from top to bottom.

65
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,458
What?

66
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,458
[MAKOTO] I checked in with HQ.

67
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,416
They didn't order
any sort of evacuation.

68
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,750
The Praetorian Guards
just vanished.

69
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:44,375
This is it. Time to
lay it all on the table.

70
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,750
Huh?

71
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,666
There's stuff
you don't know about.

72
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,083
You're such a goody-goody.

73
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,916
I was afraid you'd go off
half-cocked if I told ya.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,875
So I sat on it.

75
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,041
Go on.

76
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,125
No. You gotta swear.

77
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,750
That even after I tell you
all you are gonna do

78
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,250
is get your butt to safety.

79
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,291
No promise, no info.

80
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,333
Uh. I swear, then.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,208
[MAKOTO]
I did some digging around

82
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,166
after we split up earlier.

83
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,583
The Kagutsuchi Branch
was totally empty.

84
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,416
And there was this
big-ass altar on top.

85
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,416
[MAKOTO] It was directly
connected to the Cauldron

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,666
down below, and it gave off
a really creepy vibe.

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,125
I don't know how
he pulled it off,

88
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:31,041
but I think that...
Captain Hazama killed 'em all.

89
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,750
[NOEL] What do you mean?

90
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,041
[MAKOTO] This whole situation
is creepy, from top to bottom.

91
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,500
And creepy is
that dude's specialty.

92
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,375
[clicking]

93
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,541
[MAKOTO] All right. We're in.

94
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:45,833
Regular comms are down,
but this should work.

95
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,666
This is Bushy-Tail.
Come in, Professor.

96
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,958
This is Bushy-Tail.
Do you copy?

97
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,416
Huh?

98
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,166
[KOKONOE] You're telling me
she's dreaming?

99
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,250
No, that's crazy-talk.

100
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,583
Her memory should've
been wiped clean.

101
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,958
Huh.

102
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,208
Maybe the leftover memories
live in the soul itself.

103
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,208
[digital ringing]

104
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,833
[KOKONOE] A distress call?

105
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:13,041
Please, pick up.

106
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,958
[KOKONOE]
What's up, Bushy-Tail?

107
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,291
I'm barely getting your signal,
so make it snappy, yeah?

108
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,750
Noel's here with me.
Come and get us.

109
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,666
[KOKONOE] Good work!
I'll send someone out

110
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,166
to collect you A-SAP.

111
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,416
Rendezvous in thirty minutes.

112
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,666
Tager, heads-up.

113
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,416
[KOKONOE] Just got
pinged by our mole.

114
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,625
Need an evac for her
and Noel Vermillion.

115
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,083
[TAGER] Come again?

116
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,000
[KOKONOE] I'm sending you
the rendezvous coordinates.

117
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,750
[MAKOTO] So, Professor Kokonoe
isn't the friendliest person

118
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,458
you're ever gonna meet.

119
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,291
But you can trust her
more than Hazama,

120
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,750
or anyone else
calling the shots

121
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,541
with the N.O.L. right now.

122
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,791
She told me recently
that keeping you away

123
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,625
from that guy should
be my top priority.

124
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,333
[NOEL] You said before that
you looked into his background

125
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,000
but couldn't find anything,
isn't that right?

126
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,083
[MAKOTO] Yeah.
There are no records for

127
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,083
a Captain Hazama anywhere.

128
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,208
Who knows who
the guy really is?

129
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,083
Yuuki Terumi.

130
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,291
[gasps]

131
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,625
[MAKOTO] Wait, where did
you hear that name?

132
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,291
[NOEL] It just
popped into my head.

133
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,416
I saw it, and Ragna was
yelling that at Hazama

134
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,791
when they fought.

135
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,666
[MAKOTO] He called him that?
Man, this whole thing

136
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,500
just keeps getting
nuttier and nuttier!

137
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,916
[RAGNA] Damn it!
Where the hell is that girl?

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,375
[RAGNA] Aaahhh!
I'm sick of this crap!

139
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,083
How am I supposed to
protect her from Terumi

140
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,166
if I can't even
track her down?

141
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,708
Can't I just
kick Terumi's ass

142
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,500
before he tries something?

143
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,458
Uh... Wait, Makoto.

144
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,708
What's up?

145
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,291
[NOEL] I still feel like
there's something else

146
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,833
about all this
that's got you worried.

147
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,541
[MAKOTO] Mhmmm.

148
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,791
It's about this Hazama guy,
whoever he may be.

149
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,750
[MAKOTO]
His whole persona is a lie,

150
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,625
so how's he wielding
so much power

151
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,583
within the N.O.L. right now?

152
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,791
That Imperial Command
to kill you and Jin

153
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,958
probably didn't exist
until he issued it.

154
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,791
Wait! That came from him?

155
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,833
I think that Hazama is
playing Tsubaki like a fiddle.

156
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:07,208
[gasps]

157
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,958
Tsubaki is probably
looking for Jin as we speak.

158
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,583
Jin is tracking Ragna,
and he's headed for

159
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,958

[TSUBAKI] Charging ars magus!
Disengaging restraint!

318
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,250
You would
die fighting. Foolish.

319
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,708
You're the fool!

320
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,208
[TSUBAKI yelps]

321
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,875
You'd kill for them.
But what has the Imperator

322
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,708
done to earn your loyalty?

323
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,750
[JIN] The Tsubaki I knew
was much smarter than that.

324
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,791
[whimpers]

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,791
[TSUBAKI breathes heavily]

326
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,625
I've lost Jin and Noel.

327
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:37,541
I have nothing left
anymore! Nothing!

328
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:40,791
[TSUBAKI sobbing]

329
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:46,333
[JIN] My purpose. I feel it.

330
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,083
Lending strength
to my existence!

331
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:53,375
In times past,
Yukianesa has controlled me.

332
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,625
But starting now,
this blade shall obey my will!

333
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,875
And now, at long last,

334
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,916
my true enemy has
been made clear to me,

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,166
the being who destroys
balance in this world!

336
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,916
Brother.

337
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,583
[JUBEI] Headin' in, huh?

338
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,958
You're not gonna tell me
what a bad idea it is, are ya?

339
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,500
You never listened before.

340
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,500
Ain't like you're
gonna start now.

341
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,750
Heh.

342
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,708
Guess you know me
pretty damn well, Master.

343
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,250
If you go in,
there's just one thing

344
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,500
you absolutely
gotta remember.

345
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:34,041
Huh?

346
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,875
Don't you die.

347
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,416
What the--?

348
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,125
Hell of a pep-talk
you give me right before

349
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,000
I head off
into a big battle!

350
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,208
You don't gotta win.
Just don't die. Got it?

351
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,541
No matter how hairy it gets,

352
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,416
you damn well better
come back in one piece.

353
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,250
[RAGNA] Cut it out! Are you
morbid today or what?

354
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,958
I know you're old,
but man, give it a rest!

355
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,541
[JUBEI] If you die in
this fight, all you are

356
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,791
is a fella who let
revenge lead him around

357
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,875
by the nose
'til it killed him.

358
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,833
But, if you march in there
and defeat Terumi...

359
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,333
[RAGNA] What? I'll be
a hero or some crap?

360
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,250
As if! I'm no hero.

361
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,041
I'm just a guy
who's gonna kick some ass

362
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,625
and smash a Cauldron,
that's all!

363
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,708
[JUBEI] Hmm.

364
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,708
[VALKENHAYN] You do not intend
to go to his aid then, Jubei?

365
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,958
[JUBEI] Hm?

366
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,166
Nah. Who wants an old-timer

367
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,625
takin' the hits for 'em?

368
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,541
Figure this is something
he's gotta do for himself.

369
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,291
[JUBEI] For better
or worse, my friend,

370
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,500
it's time for the young
folks to take the reins.

371
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,958
Valkenhayn?

372
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,125
Yes, Madam.

373
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,375
I have an errand to run
ere I return.

374
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,416
[RACHEL] See that my tea
is ready for me when I do.

375
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,083
Splendid, Madam Rachel.

376
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,250
I shall prepare a
peerless array of tea

377
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,458
and pastries for that moment.

378
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,083
No point hanging
around here, I reckon.

379
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,458
Give the boy
my best, would ya?

380
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,708
I will not.
You give it to him yourself.

381
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,416
One of these days, girl.

382
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,458
I'm gonna swat you
clean on the backside.

383
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,791
It should be around here.

384
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,000
Who're we looking for? Uh!

385
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,708
--Shh!
--Makoto!

386
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,291
[MAKOTO] People fought
and not long ago.

387
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,625
It smells like
something's still on fire.

388
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,250
[gasps]

389
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,708
[gasps] It's Hazama!

390
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,583
Oh, look. I thought
I caught a whiff

391
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,166
of acorns, Phantom.

392
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,375
Must've been the
Beastkin I was smelling.

393
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,833
[MAKOTO] Shut it, creep!

394
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,333
[HAZAMA] I can't believe
you brought the mannequin

395
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,708
straight to me like this.

396
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,208
Not too bright, ladies!

397
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,083
Mannequin?

398
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,666
Stay back! I got this!

399
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,875
[HAZAMA] It's too bad
you showed up when you did.

400
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,583
Any sooner and
you could've watched me

401
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,583
curb-stomp this cupcake.

402
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,958
[KOKONOE] What's wrong,
Tager? Answer me!

403
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,041
Run, Noel.

404
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,250
What do we do?

405
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,791
You're not gonna
lay a finger on Noel!

406
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,291
Well, not before
beating you to a pulp.

407
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,458
Your turn, squirrely!

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,291
[TSUBAKI panting]

409
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,875
[TSUBAKI]
I, I drove them away.

410
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,541
All of them, and for what?

411
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:30,166
[shaky breathing]

412
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,500
I'm sorry Jin. And Noel.

413
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,041
Please forgive me.

414
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,500
I never meant to hurt you!

415
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,291
Huh?

416
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,625
[IMPERATOR] Why do you harbor
such doubt Tsubaki Yayoi?

417
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,083
[gasps]

418
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,125
[IMPERATOR] Your life
is not yours to toss aside.

419
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,791
You exist to serve me.

420
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,625
But that means you are the--

421
00:20:56,708 --> 00:21:01,333
[IMPERATOR] Join me, Tsubaki.
Your Imperator wills it.

422
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,083
My life for you! Majesty!

423
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,958
Your days of
darkness are over,

424
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,416
for I shall smile upon you.

425
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,708
[RAGNA] Damn it!
Why is nobody here?

426
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,208
Is this a trap?

427
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,375
Huh?

428
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,708
[RAGNA] Where's this
cold air comin' from?

429
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,500
[RAGNA grunts]

430
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:29,250
[JIN] It's time for
a rematch. Brother.

431
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,000
Son of a bitch!
Not this again!

432
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:37,125
Now, we're going to fight
until there's nothing left!

433
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,250
[KOKONOE] How 'bout
you take a seat, Tager.

434
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,708
[TAGER]
Promise not to modify me?

435
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:11,833
[KOKONOE] Oh, sure.

436
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,458
Episode 10,
"The God-Killer's Cocoon."

437
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,541
[TAGER] I know
you're lying, Kokonoe!
