in that case, Lieutenant.

323
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:41,583
I've summoned you here
for a top-secret mission.

324
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,375
This job came down from

325
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,750
the top echelons
of N.O.L. command.

326
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,041
[HAZAMA] I guess
it's time to tell you

327
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,166
what all you'll be doing.

328
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,625
Sir!

329
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:55,166
Without further ado,
here it is.

330
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,875
Jin Kisaragi and
Noel Vermillion need

331
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,541
to be found, and,
well, assassinated.

332
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,791
[RACHEL] A meeting
with your master

333
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,916
might serve you well, Ragna.

334
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,541
Episode Four, "The
One-Eyed Lotus Appears."

335
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,000
[RAGNA] Why do
you call him that?
