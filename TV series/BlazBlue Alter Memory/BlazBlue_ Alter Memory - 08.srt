00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,666
I've been sniffing around.

163
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,333
And you know what I dug up?

164
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,166
Hazama's past is blank.

165
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,000
No place of birth,
no age, absolutely nothing.

166
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,291
How come? What's he
got to hide, huh?

167
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,916
I don't trust that guy at all.

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,333
Something's snaky about him.

169
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,833
Mhm.

170
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,125
Yeah. You're right.

171
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,875
Anyway, Sector Seven's
Professor Kokonoe

172
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,125
is all set to take us in.

173
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,375
[NOEL] Wait, we're going
to Sector Seven? How come?

174
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,125
Because I'm...

175
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,500
Don't you fret!

176
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,458
I am gonna get this
all figured out.

177
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,500
For you and Tsubaki, both!

178
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,333
Noellers, you just
gotta trust me!

179
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:41,791
Uh.

180
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,958
I couldn't just
leave her there.

181
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,541
Right now, she's a damn
easy target. All the same.

182
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,750
I didn't sign on for
babysitting duty today.

183
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,000
She's one of
those things that...

184
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,958
[RAGNA]
I've been destroying.

185
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,291
[RAGNA] Hey!

186
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,166
Hm?

187
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,583
[RAGNA]
The hell are you doin'?

188
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,083
Vital signs failing.

189
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,541
Huh?

190
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,500
[TARTAR squeaking]

191
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,916
[RAGNA] You see that cut
there? It's killing him.

192
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,583
Usually they'd be able
to live through

193
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,625
getting dinged up.

194
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,916
But he can't bounce back
because he lost his host.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,041
[RAGNA] Whether it's
fluids or nutrition,

196
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,666
he got something
from that bastard

197
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,000
that he's missing now.

198
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,125
Wait, did he just--?

199
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,375
[TARTAR squeaking]

200
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,041
If nothing else,
he's a fighter.

201
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,416
Here, you hold him.

202
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,291
[LAMBDA] Mmm.

203
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,041
Hm? Hey, wait up.

204
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,125
Don't just pick up
random plants.

205
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,458
I'm looking for aqualeaf.

206
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,958
Aqualeaf.

207
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,291
Referencing.
Referencing. Referencing.

208
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,416
[LAMBDA] Subject found.

209
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,458
Family, Aster-A-C.
Genus, Aquafolia.

210
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,833
Its rhizomes secrete
an analgesic substance.

211
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,208
[RAGNA] That's why we're
lookin' around for it.

212
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,625
When I trained with
my master back in the day,

213
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,833
we didn't have
medicine with us.

214
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:53,375
If we got sick,
the forest was our pharmacy.

215
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,041
Aqualeaf is delicate,

216
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,750
but the seithr's
pretty light around here,

217
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,583
so there should be
some in good condition.

218
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,541
Guess ya hit the jackpot.

219
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,291
[clears throat]

220
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:15,333
[TAGER] Tager here.
Go ahead, Kokonoe.

221
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:19,750
[KOKONOE] So, I kinda
sorta lost Lambda.

222
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,916
Bring her back,
would ya, Tager?

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,958
You know how important
that Idea Engine is to me.

224
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,625
Without it,
that bastard will never

225
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,166
get what's comin' to him.

226
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,166
[TAGER] Don't worry, Kokonoe.
I'll retrieve her for you.

227
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,041
[radio clicks]

228
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,541
[KOKONOE sighs]

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,291
Ew! I touched it.

230
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,416
Theory.

231
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,416
[RAGNA] Huh?

232
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,375
Subject is male.
Males are rare.

233
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,791
Therefore, he's worth saving.

234
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,666
You're asking why I helped?

235
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,333
[RAGNA] It's not like I had
some big reason to do it.

236
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,083
The way I look at it,
I just let something

237
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,208
that was alive keep on living.

238
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,000
All of us die someday.
End of story.

239
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
But that doesn't mean
you have to let it happen

240
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,166
like you don't
give a damn either way.

241
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,083
You fight it.
Tooth and nail. Y'know?

242
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,833
An' if you can't win
that fight by yourself,

243
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,583
it's all right if somebody
tags in an' lends a hand.

244
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,291
[RAGNA sighs]

245
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,083
Ragna, did someone help you?

246
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,708
[groans]

247
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,791
[RAGNA sighs]

248
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,208
[RAGNA] Yeah.
A couple of someones.

249
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,458
Wouldn't be here
today if they hadn't.

250
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,083
[groans]

251
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,041
Aqualeaf ain't gonna fix this.

252
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,166
[leaves rustle]

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:08,000
[RAGNA plays song]

254
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,791
[chuckles]

255
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,625
Wanna try?

256
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,916
[LAMBDA blowing air]
[leaf squeals]

257

[laughs]

258
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,416
[TARTAR squeaks]

259
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,166
You're blowin'
it too hard.

260
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,833
You gotta be more
gentle to play a song.

261
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,625
What is "gentle"?

262
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,916
Not in your
database, huh?

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,791
Okay then.

264
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,250
How do I make it
make sense to ya?

265
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,041
[LAMBDA] Huh?

266
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,875
You're a piece of work.

267
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,333
Negative.

268
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,833
I'm Lambda.

269
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,666
Hm? So Lambda's
your name, then?

270
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
[LAMBDA] Mhm.

271
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,833
[LAMBDA] Hm?

272
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,791
[gasps]

273
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,458
Huh?

274
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,708
I was cold.

275
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,750
[chuckles softly]

276
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:33,583
Tartar heart-rate,
dropping, dropping, dropping.

277
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,333
Zero pulse. Subject,
male tartar has ceased to

278
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:45,250
[LAMBDA] function as
a viable organism.

279
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,833
He is dead.
What do I do?

280
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:52,166
You don't gotta
do anything.

281
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,333
Mm-mmm.

282
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,666
[RAGNA] Then keep him
in your thoughts.

283
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,916
Until the day he ain't.

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,208
Let his memory live
in a corner of your soul.

285
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,791
If it fades away
over time, let it.

286
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,708
You'll have done right by him.

287
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,125
[LAMBDA] What is "soul"?

288
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,708
I don't know. It's this
thing you keep in your head.

289
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,291
Or maybe deep
inside your heart.

290
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,833
No one knows
where it lives,

291
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:22,166
but it's that spot that gets
all warm whenever you're happy

292
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,375
and gets chilly whenever
you're feelin' sad.

293
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,791
You were real gentle
with that little guy, Lambda.

294
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,833
[TAGER] Kokonoe I have
Lambda in my sights.

295
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,791
But she's not alone.

296
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,083
[KOKONOE]
Ragna the Bloodedge again?

297
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,291
[TAGER] Mm.

298
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,208
[KOKONOE] Like attracts
like, I guess.

299
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,791
Heya, Ragna. Guess who?

300
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,250
[gasps]

301
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,416
[RAGNA] Red Devil!

302
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,000
[KOKONOE] Thanks for keeping
an eye on Lambda for me.

303
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,416
[grunts]

304
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,625
What is she, Kokonoe?
I need you to tell me!

305
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,333
[KOKONOE] I took the body of
the 11th Prime Field Device

306
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:12,958
and stuck the soul
from the 13th in it.

307
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:16,291
Long story short,
she's a living weapon.

308
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:19,208
I'm gonna kick Terumi's
slimy ass with her.

309
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,958
Terumi is mine!

310
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:21,875
[KOKONOE] You're never
gonna beat him

311
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,583
with that dinky Azure.

312
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,250
Tager, you go back to
look for Noel Vermillion.

313
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,166
Hold on. Why the hell are
you guys looking for Noel?

314
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,708
[KOKONOE] We're not the one
you should be worried about.

315
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,541
Terumi's on the hunt, too.

316
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,958
If he finds her,
he's gonna smelt her.

317
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,791
We need to bring her in
for her own safety.

318
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,291
You're saying
he's gonna smelt her?

319
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,375
I talked a big talk
about mercy to that girl.

320
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:02,125
[RAGNA] "Let something that was
alive keep on living," I said.

321
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,666
Does she count, too?

322
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,083
Tch. Man, what a hypocrite.

323
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,750
This from the guy they
call the Grim Reaper.

324
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:15,541
[RAGNA] But, maybe it's not
too late to change my spots.

325
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,916
I'm gonna protect her.

326
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,208
[RAGNA] Do your worst, Terumi!

327
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,291
Time to wake up, milady.

328
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,791
There's so much for us to do.

329
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,500
[HAZAMA chuckles]

330
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,541
[ARAKUNE] Heya, folks!
It's me, the "before" version

331
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:12,625
of Arakune! I sound
relatively normal, right?

332
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,583
Episode 9 is "The Power
of Order." See ya!
