1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,791
[NOEL] "Mr. Kitten,
Mr. Kitten.

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,750
Napping in the sun.
When the nap is over.

3
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,708
Time for fun!"

4
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:16,791
Mmm.

5
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,833
That last line's
a little short.

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:25,083
[NOEL] Oh, no!
My poem! Come back!

7
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,625
[JIN] Huh?

8
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,916
Jin Kisaragi!
I didn't see you there!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,958
This paper. Is it yours?

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,000
[NOEL] Y-Yes.
Thanks for grabbing it.

11
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,166
My name's Noel. It's such
a pleasure to meet you.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,750
Noel? Ah!
The girl with the

13
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,916
unmatched ars
magus scores.

14
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,208
[NOEL] Mind if I
take that back now?

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,500
Sorry.

16
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:53,958
[NOEL]
"Mr. Kitten, Mr. Kitten,

17
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,208
napping in the sun,
when the nap is over,

18
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,208
time for fun?"

19
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,000
[NOEL] He didn't
read it, right?

20
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,541
I've never
been so embarrassed!

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,041
[NOEL] No!

22
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,291
[KOKONOE] You're a real
pain in the ass, Hakumen.

23
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,875
You know that?

24
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,708
I told you not
to get in my way,

25
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,083
but you didn't listen.

26
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,083
And for that,
you get the penalty box.

27
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,833
[HAKUMEN]
And I told you

28
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:58,625
that I am not
yours to command!

29
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,416
Wow. You shouldn't
be able to do that.

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,458
Maybe your Power of Order
is bending the rules for you.

31
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,875
Not that I give a crap.

32
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,000
That barrier I used is
self-repairing, buddy.

33
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,791
[HAKUMEN] You have
gone to great pains

34
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,208
to contain me, Grimalkin.

35
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,166
Tch. Much as I'd
love to toss your

36
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,583
self-righteous ass
back into the Boundary,

37
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,125
I still need your armor.

38
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,583
It is a Susanoo
Unit, after all.

39
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,041
[HAKUMEN] Huh.
There's no question

40
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,916
of your lineage, Beastkin.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,583
You share your
mother's crude tongue.

42
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,083
Shut your hole.

43
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,583
[TA] It is good
of you to come.

44
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,166
[RACHEL] It has
been a long time.

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,458
Wouldn't you agree?

46
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,500
[TC] By your understanding
of time, it has been

47
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:46,166
19,792 hours, 41 minutes,
and 52 seconds.

48
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,916
[TB] For us, it's
been 283,875 hours,

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,875
18 minutes, and 24 seconds.

50
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:58,083
[TA] Why did you employ
the Tsukuyomi Unit?

51
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,291
[TB] Takemikazuchi would
have burned the city

52
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,375
and the irregularity
to ash, had you not acted.

53
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,250
[TC] By what logic
did you choose this?

54
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,583
It is enough
that I know.

55
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,666
[TB] Your refusal to
answer the query has been

56
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,958
duly acknowledged and logged.

57
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,041
You set Terumi free
from his prison

58
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,583
in the Boundary, did you not?

59
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:20,750
[TC] Yes.

60
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,000
[TA] The process
leading to the Day of Ruin

61
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,458
has already begun.

62
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,458
[RACHEL] If that is true,
you must long for

63
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,958
the world's destruction.

64
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,041
[TC] No.

65
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,083
[TA] We of the
Takamagahara only care

66
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,375
that the world
be in balance.

67
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,875
With the appearance
of the Azure Successor,

68
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,166
this reality veers
dangerously close

69
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,541
to a Continuum Shift event.

70
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,708
[TC] We will control
the event distortions

71
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,041
that are likely to
occur in the future

72
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,958
and target irregularities
for elimination.

73
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,125
Hm.

74
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,458
Fancy yourself
a god, then?

75
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,666
[TC] No.

76
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,500
[TA] The Takamagahara
was created by man.

77
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:59,166
As such, we cannot
ascend to divine status.

78
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,291
[TC] The Master Unit is subject
to the same limitations.

79
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,500
[TB] Both it, and the
distortions it ushers

80
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,333
into the world,
are unnecessary.

81
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,000
And you believe
Terumi will solve this?

82
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,958
Is he a cudgel you
can wield, I wonder?

83
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,000
[TB] The situation
is well in hand.

84
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,375
[TC] He poses
no discernable risk.

85
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,125
[TA] Should he chafe
against his leash,

86
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,000
we will reinitialize him.

87
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,125
[TB] You are a singular
being, Rachel Alucard.

88
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,041
Have you any interest
in returning to us?

89
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,333
My answer isn't
obvious to you?

90
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,375
[TA] We have delved past
the rhetorical nature

91
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,458
of your reply,
and discern that you

92
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,625
have no intention of returning.

93
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,833
[TB] That choice is illogical.

94
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,208
You observe the
grand sum of existence,

95
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,833
but you see nothing at all.

96
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,458
Ah! Son of a--!

97
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,708
[FLUFFY-KAKA]
We should play with him!

98
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,916
[CALI-KAKA] But Big
Sis Tao will scold us.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,333
Good Guy! Time to eat!

100
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,291
[RAGNA] You don't
really think I'm gonna

101
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,208
eat this swill, do ya?

102
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,416
[TAOKAKA] Kaka cooking
is filled with the finest

103
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,875
ingredients we were
able to pounce on!

104
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,625
You're gonna
love it, Good Guy!

105
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:13,958
It's meow-tta sight!

106
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,125
Don't put that
in my mouth!

107
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,375
What the hell's
wrong with you?

108
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,666
Hey, y'know, that's
pretty damn good!

109
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,458
[NOEL sighs]

110
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,333
[MAKOTO] Shoulders
back, Lieutenant!

111
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:31,000
Ah! Ma'am! My apologies!

112
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,666
I was thinking
about something!

113
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,125
I didn't mean to
slouch on the bar!

114
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:38,875
Man. I got you
good, huh! Ta-da!

115
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,541
[MAKOTO] Great friend,
killer curves.

116
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,500
C'mon, Noellers! It's me!

117
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,000
M-Makoto?

118
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,250
[NOEL] Makoto!
I've missed you so much!

119
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Look at this tail!

120
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,916
I should have known it
was you from the start!

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,833
[MAKOTO] I am more than
a big, fluffy backside!

122
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,000
[MAKOTO] Sounds like
you got yourself into

123
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,916
quite a pickle, Noellers.

124
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,583
Mhm. And I have no idea

125
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,416
what I'm supposed
to do next.

126
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,666
I'm really glad
you found me, Makoto.

127
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,083
I meant to ask you.

128
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,250
Where were you when
that stuff was happening?

129
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,416
Huh?

130
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,791
Y'know today!
When everything shook,

131
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,458
and the sky was all bright!

132
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,166
Oh. I didn't know...
the sky part.

133
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,541
[MAKOTO] So you missed it?

134
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,750
Oh, yeah. I was
down on a lower level.

135
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,125
Everybody in town's
freaked out about it.

136
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,958
Especially on
the top level,

137
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,666
where you could
actually see it happen.

138
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,625
They're saying that it
might've been Takemikazuchi!

139
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,375
Takemikazuchi?

140
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,083
It's a Nox Nyctores
they used back

141
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,083
in the Dark War.
But it was too strong,

142
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,041
so they locked
it away somewhere.

143
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,000
Wait, weren't you
the one who told me

144
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,666
all this back in the day?

145
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,375
It was probably Tsubaki
who told you about it.

146
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,916
I think we were
studying for our

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,083
first test of
the school year.

148
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,875
[MAKOTO] Okay, self.
"In order for mankind to

149
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,625
fight the Black Beast,
it fused magic with science,

150
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,500
creating what we now
know as 'ars magus.'"

151
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,333
[NOEL] You wrote a
paper on ars magus,

152
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,625
right, Tsubaki?

153
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,000
Uh-huh. I did it
in my spare time.

154
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,708
Help me, Noellers.

155
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,666
What's this Takemika-blah-blah
they're talking about?

156
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,791
[NOEL] Well, it's...

157
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,041
It's the most
famous Nox Nyctores.

158

I mean it, Noel.

317
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,041
Don't do anything foolish!

318
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,333
[NOEL] Makoto?

319
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,500
[MAKOTO] We'll talk
this out, the three of us,

320
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:56,833
and it'll be okay.

321
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,291
[NOEL] Yeah.

322
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,458
[LITCHI] Hm?

323
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,500
[NOEL breathing heavily]

324
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,666
[LITCHI] That uniform.

325
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,375
Ars magus! I feel it!

326
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,166
It's that way!

327
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,708
[LITCHI] You there! Stop!

328
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,333
[NOEL] Wait, what?
Who are you?

329
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,666
[LITCHI] Litchi Faye
Ling. I'm a doctor.

330
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,625
But, if you're a doctor,
why do you have a weapon?

331
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,500
What business does
the Praetorian Guard

332
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,833
have around here?

333
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,458
I'm just--I mean--

334
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,083
I'm looking for
someone, that's all!

335
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,750
He's got spiky white
hair and a red jacket!

336
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,791
I see.
I thought as much.

337
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,375
[NOEL] So you've
seen him then?

338
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,916
[LITCHI] Yes. And I'm
well-aware of the bounty

339
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,458
the N.O.L. has
placed on his head.

340
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,666
Ragna's under my care,
which means

341
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,875
I'll defend him to the end!

342
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,416
I don't wanna fight you!

343
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,708
I am a Praetorian Guard,
that is true,

344
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,000
but the reason
I'm looking for him

345
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,791
has nothing
to do with that!

346
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,375
[LITCHI] Tell me
about this reason.

347
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:56,750
It's because he saved
my life earlier today.

348
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:00,166
I just want to talk
to him for a bit.

349
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,625
But you're enemies.

350
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,000
Are we, though?

351
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,708
Officially, I guess
that's true, but it's like,

352
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,833
I know him from somewhere.

353
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,625
Trust me! It all
sounds crazy to me, too!

354
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,833
But if I don't see
Ragna the Bloodedge

355
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,583
my friends are gonna die!

356
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,125
[NOEL] I beg of you!

357
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,166
[RAGNA] No more food, dammit!

358
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,791
Good Guy's not
gonna get better if

359
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,500
he doesn't clean his bowl!

360
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,416
I'm full! What part
of that don't you get?

361
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,416
I ain't your
friggin' trashcan!

362
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,291
Tao? What are
you doing in here?

363
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,791
[TAOKAKA] Hey, Boobie Lady!

364
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,833
Tao thought you went
home for the night!

365
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,000
I fully intended to,
but then...

366
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:40,916
[RAGNA] The hell?

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,416
[NOEL] Hi again.

368
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,000
[NOEL] I was just
gonna leave you alone,

369
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,500
but then something came up!

370
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,958
Oh, goody.

371
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,166
Hold on!
Why's that uncovered?

372
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,458
[RAGNA] Uh.

373
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:52,625
Tao! Didn't I tell you
to keep an eye on him?

374
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,125
It's not Tao's fault!

375
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,583
Tao told him
not to do it,

376
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,750
but Good Guy took
the bandages off!

377
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,083
Your wounds are deep!

378
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:02,166
[LITCHI] It's going
to take time for them...

379
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,291
What the--?

380
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,875
[RAGNA] Uh. You were saying?

381
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,500
What the hell?
Quit staring.

382
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,625
It's creepin' me out.

383
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,458
[NOEL] Huh? No!
I wasn't staring!

384
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,291
Yeah! Sure you weren't!

385
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:19,125
[RACHEL] Hmm. I had
come to aid you, but...

386
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,000
it seems you are
doing quite well.

387
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,041
Who're you?

388
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,083
[TAOKAKA]
Me-ow! You smell good!

389
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,666
Oh, now you wanna help?

390
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,708
Wait, you're the...
girl from before.

391
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:32,458
Piling new scars
upon old. So pathetic.

392
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,625
And whose fault is
it that I got 'em, huh?

393
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,333
Ya left me in some
pint-sized vigilante's lap!

394
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,125
Tao likes it when her
house is super-exciting!

395
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,791
[FLUFFY-KAKA]
No fair, Big Sis Tao!

396
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,791
[CALI-KAKA] Yeah we
wanna play with him, too!

397
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:44,750
[FEISTY-KAKA] Playtime!

398
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,625
[SPOTTY-KAKA] Get him!

399
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,541
[RAGNA] What? Aw, son-of-a!

400
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,166
Ow! That hurts,
you little brats!

401
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,833
That's enough playtime
for tonight, kittens!

402
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,625
You seem to know a lot
about Ragna, little miss.

403
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,750
Why is that?

404
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,458
That's "Lady
Rachel" to you!

405
00:18:58,541 --> 00:18:59,958
Yeah! She's a princess!

406
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,708
The object of your
searching all these

407
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,833
many years, has landed
in your very lap,

408
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,500
Litchi Faye Ling.

409
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,000
How'd you know that?

410
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,041
Who in the world
are you anyway?

411
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:14,000
I am merely an old
acquaintance of Kokonoe's.

412
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,125
I will leave the rest unsaid.

413
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,000
The Professor, huh?

414
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,583
Dammit. How'm I
supposed to heal

415
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,916
with everyone barging in?

416
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,041
C'mon! I can
see you staring!

417
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,041
Don't be mean.
I can't bandage you up

418
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,416
if I'm not even looking!

419
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,750
Whatever.
Just get it done!

420
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,000
[RAGNA groans]

421
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:40,208
Okay, okay. So, why'd you
have to see me again?

422
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:45,208
Major Jin Kisaragi.
What does he mean to you?

423
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,250
Aren't you nosy?

424
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,166
We're enemies.
That good enough for ya?

425
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,833
I know you
hate each other!

426
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,583
But there's more to it
than that. I can tell!

427
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,250
So you tell
me what's up.

428
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,708
Huh? How
would I know?

429
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,458
That's why
I'm asking you.

430
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,208
In case you forgot,

431
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,416
we ain't exactly on
the same team here.

432
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,250
[NOEL]
I just want to help.

433
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,208
You saw it, Noel.

434
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,291
[RAGNA] That Cauldron.

435
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,416
I'm gonna smash that
thing to pieces.

436
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,875
And, every last
branch of the N.O.L.

437
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,333
But most of all.
That bastard, Terumi.

438
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,166
That man. Terumi.

439
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,041
I know him as
Captain Hazama.

440
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,208
What has he done?

441
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,541
[RAGNA] What has he done?
Goddamn plenty!

442
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,291
An' none of it is
your friggin' business!

443
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,875
I don't get it.
You ain't running away?

444
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,708
No. Not this time.

445
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,083
[NOEL] I have a question
about Major Kisaragi, too.

446
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,041
And if I don't ask
while I have the chance,

447
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,250
I'm gonna regret it later.

448
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,250
[MALE NOL 4A] This dock is
off-limits to civilians!

452
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,625
[HAZAMA] Indeed.

453
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,541
And now,
we wait for the rest

454
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,541
of the players
to stumble in.

455
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,833
[RAGNA] Hey! I'm not
a friggin' mummy!

456
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,333
[JIN] Wait for me, Brother.

457
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,041
'Cause I'll be there
to kill you soon enough!

458
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,750
[HAZAMA chuckles]

459
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,666
Despair, disappointment,

460
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,541
hatred, sorrow, heartbreak.

461
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,750
It's going to be an

462
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:29,833
of suffering,
and I'm going in hungry!

463
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:35,708
[laughs intensely]

464
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,875

didn't know it was me

00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,416
without my tail, Noellers?
