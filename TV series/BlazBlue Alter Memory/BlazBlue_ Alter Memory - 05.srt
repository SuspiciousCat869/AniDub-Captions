1
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,166
Greetings, Valkenhayn.

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,291
[VALKENHAYN] A pleasure
to have you home again.

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,541
Your tea is at the ready.

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,041
Very well, then.

5
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,958
Something troubles
you, milady.

6
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,083
The blindness
of spectators.

7
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:41,583
You speak of
Takamagahara?

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,291
I do. Terumi's running amok.

9
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,208
[VALKENHAYN] If that trickster
has been let off of his leash,

10
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,541
why, there's no telling
the trouble he'll stir up.

11
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,500
[RACHEL] It vexes me.

12
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,750
Forgive my impertinence,
Madam Rachel,

13
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,666
but does it really?

14
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,708
Forgiven. Explain.

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,041
I could have sworn
there was a smile

16
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,333
tugging at your lips.

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,833
It seems your
eyes deceive you.

18
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:11,541
I did no such thing.

19
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,375
The perils
of age, milady.

20
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,458
[RACHEL] Drunk on
time's heady brew,

21
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,916
the world lay on
the edge of slumber.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It was poised to
slip into a dream

23
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,125
from which there is no waking.

24
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:31,875
But now, there comes a
knock at the chamber door.

25
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:35,250
Then time no longer
repeats as it did prior.

26
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,666
And the event we anticipated
is already at hand.

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,958
Correct?

28
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,541
Indeed.

29
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:47,541
Well, then. What is
your course of action?

30
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:51,458
I am but a spectator.
While others act,

31
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,666
I merely watch their
deeds for eternity.

32
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,666
It is a thankless task.

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,583
So I, Valkenhayn, shall
dedicate whatever's left

34
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,833
of my meager existence
to bringing you

35
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,333
[VALKENHAYN]
comfort 'midst your vigil.

36
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,458
[KOKONOE] This is Kokonoe.
Hey, talk to me, Tager.

37
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,500
[TAGER] Roger that, Kokonoe.
I'm currently airborne,

38
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:54,000
about 2,000 meters
from Kagutsuchi airspace.

39
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,875
[KOKONOE]
Wow, that was fast.

40
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,416
You don't waste
any time, do ya?

41
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,708
[TAGER] How does
it look down there?

42
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,250
[KOKONOE] Hazama and
Relius just got into town.

43
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,041
[TAGER] Damn it. Those
bastards mean trouble.

44
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,375
What do they want?

45
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,416
[KOKONOE] They're probably
after Noel Vermillion

46
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
'cause she's
the Azure Successor.

47
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,000
Your mission is to find her and
bring her back to me A-SAP.

48
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,458
[TAGER] Bring her back?
For what reason?

49
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,208
[KOKONOE] Rant alert.
Hold onto your ass.

50
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,625
[KOKONOE] The "brain trust"
over at Sector Seven

51
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,500
are bitching at each
other non-stop about

52
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,333
how best to deal
with Noel and Ragna.

53
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,500
[TAGER] "Bitching"?

54
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,958
Man, it's like they
can't find their ass

55
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,500
with both hands, Tager.

56
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,500
They say they wanna
overthrow the N.O.L.

57
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,958
and stamp out ars magus,

58
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,916
but they're
nothing but hot air.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,750
They say they're
gonna change the world

60
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,125
through science,
but they haven't done

61
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,541
any research worth a damn--

62
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,083
and now they're all
losing their crap over

63
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,208
the Azure Grimoire
when they should focus

64
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,791
on the friggin' Eye!

65
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,166
Idiots, Tager! All of 'em!

66
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,500
[grunts]

67
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,458
[KOKONOE] That's why we're
gonna find Noel first!

68
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,916
And when we do,
there's gonna be some

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,666
honest-to-goodness
science going on, dammit!

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,916
[TAGER] Roger that.

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,791
So, what do we do
about the Azure Grimoire?

72
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,875
[KOKONOE] Huh?
Oh, Ragna the Bloodedge?

73
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,208
He's got the weakest
Grimoire of 'em all.

74
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,416
Don't bother.

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,375
[TAGER] Why do you
say his is the weakest?

76
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,666
It seems pretty
powerful to me.

77
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,000
He can do some damage
with it, don't get me wrong,

78
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,833
but the Azure Grimoire's
got a fatal flaw.

79
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,083
Ain't no point in peeing
yourself over a weapon

80
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,833
that's got a blind
side, am I right?

81
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,666
[TAGER] That's one way
to put it, I suppose.

82
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,166
Just to confirm
mission parameters.

83
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,583
I am to take Noel
Vermillion into custody

84
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:31,833
and return with...

85
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,458
Dammit. Guess
the radio signal's

86
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,208
crapping out on us.

87
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:37,625
[TAGER] Kokonoe?

88
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,083
[beep]

89
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,666
[SECTOR SEVEN SOLDIER 5A]
Approaching drop-point, sir.

90
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,208
[TAGER] Acknowledged. TR-0009
Tager, commencing mission!

91
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,833
[TAOKAKA]
Thanks for the om-noms!

92
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,250
[laughing]

93
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,833
I wonder. Ragna the
Bloodedge is the N.O.L.'s

94
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,083
most wanted fugitive,
and here you are,

95
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,416
both under
the same roof.

96
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,416
How do you feel?

97
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,583
Honestly. I dunno.

98
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:19,791
[NOEL] But, there's still
so much I need to ask him.

99
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,625
Hey, Boobie Lady!
Can Tao have some more?

100
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,750
You may.

101
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,958
Faster!
Tao is fading away!

102
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,291
--[LITCHI] Here!
--[TAOKAKA] Thanks a lot!

103
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,833
 But it isn't for Tao!
It was all a clever ruse!

104
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,458
[TAOKAKA]
It's for Good Guy!

105
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,791
Ah!

106
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,916
[RAGNA] Hot! What the
hell is wrong with you?

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,791
[TAOKAKA] Wee! Ta-da!

108
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,250
Idiot.

109
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,833
[TAOKAKA] Is Good Guy
better yet or what? Meow!

110
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,583
[LITCHI sighs]
He's getting better,

111
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,708
but it's going
to take some time.

112
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,750
Tao's got an idea!

113
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,458
[TAOKAKA] The Kaka Clan has
a secret meow-racle cure

114
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,583
that's been hidden
away for generations!

115
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,916
Body, heart, brain, whatever's
dinged up, this'll fix it!

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,875
Huh?

117
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,333
Tao, is this real--?

118
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,125
[TAOKAKA] If we use it,
Good Guy'll be full of vim

119
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,875
and vermin in no time!

120
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,291
Maybe she's right.

121
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,291
I wouldn't get too excited
about this, Lieutenant.

122
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,416
I've been helping the
Kaka Clan for years,

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,291
but nobody's ever
mentioned this secret

124
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,875
miracle cure to me.

125
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,416
[TAOKAKA] Well,
if we told folks about it,

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,833
it wouldn't be much of
a secret, Boobie Lady.

127
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:19,416
Duh!

128
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,458
[TAOKAKA] And this is one of the
most secretest secrets of all!

129
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,125
Like, top-secretest!

130
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,083
How come you're babbling
about it so much?

131
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,291
'Cause later, Tao's gonna
hit Good Guy in the head

132
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,500
a bunch until the
secret falls back out!

133
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,750
[RAGNA] What the hell, Tao!

134
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,041
Are you trying to patch
me up or hurt me worse?

135
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,333
Let's do it!

136
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:35,541
Huh?

137
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:36,916
Easy for you to say.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,875
[NOEL] But don't you
want to get better, Ragna?

139
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,833
If they have something
that powerful,

140
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,250
we should check it out!

141
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,000
Our Tao has a very
"active" imagination, Noel.

142
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,916
[NOEL] Tao, are you
sure this is real?

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,041
Meow-t's honor!

144
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,666
[NOEL] There. You see?

145
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,000
Right. It's just
as simple as that.

146
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,291
There's not an injury
out there that can stand up

147
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,750
to the Kaka Clan's
meow-racle cure!

148
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,708
It's gonna kick
your butt, Good Guy!

149
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,916
Now get!

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,833
[RAGNA] Not interested!

151
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,541
[NOEL] It sounds powerful!

152
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,958
--[LITCHI] Listen, Noel.
--[NOEL] What?

153
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,000
[LITCHI] I wouldn't
get your hopes up--

154
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,125
All right.

155
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,541
Rabbit Lady!
You're finally back!

156
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,333
Tao hopes you
had a good walk.

157
