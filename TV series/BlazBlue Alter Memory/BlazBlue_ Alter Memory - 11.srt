1
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,333
[RAGNA yells]

2
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,958
[HAZAMA chuckles]

3
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,083
[RAGNA] Whaddya think
you're laughing at, huh?

4
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:53,333
[RAGNA] That felt
like a heartbeat.

5
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,375
That was the Black
Beast's heartbeat.

6
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,083
Is that it? You're
doing all this 'cause

7
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:00,125
you're trying to make
another Black Beast?

8
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,500
Huh? Why would I do that?

9
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,875
C'mon, the original Black
Beast was nothing more

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,583
than an overhyped
pile of fail!

11
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,541
Pile of fail...?

12
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,916
A Cauldron
that went haywire.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,041
[HAZAMA] At the end of the day,
that's all it really was.

14
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,541
Hmm.

15
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,375
The smelting process
isn't quite finished yet.

16
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,833
Guess I'll drop some knowledge
on ya while we wait.

17
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,333
Y'know, somebody really
should've told ya this stuff.

18
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:28,500
[RAGNA]
What does that mean?

19
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,541
[HAZAMA]
Just listen, dumb-ass.

20
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,916
Once upon a time,
man discovered a gateway

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,375
that led to the plane of
existence we call the Boundary.

22
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:41,250
They named those gateways
Cauldrons. Why? Don't care.

23
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,250
The Boundary was full
of stuff we call seithr.

24
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,000
It's an energy source.
People use it around the world

25
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,416
for just about
everything nowadays.

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,250
Guess what, Rags? Time for the
quiz portion of our program!

27
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,541
What is seithr?

28
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:55,541
Huh?

29
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,791
[HAZAMA]
Ahhh! Time's up!

30
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,083
"It's an artificially created
particulate program!"

31
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,833
That's what we
wanted to hear!

32
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,791
[HAZAMA] The world's
actually made of seithr,

33
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,041
so it's a big deal.
But wait, there's more!

34
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,791
That's when mankind
stumbled upon

35
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,291
the existence of
the Master Unit.

36
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:16,291
An all-seeing entity
who shapes seithr.

37
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,041
We wanted that power,
naturally, and so man created

38
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,916
something that could
interact with the Master Unit.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,791
A Dimensional Boundary
Interface Prime Field Device.

40
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,458
But here's the pisser!

41
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,416
The first one they sent
interfaced with the Master Unit,

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,875
got the Power of the Eye,
and became a spectator.

43
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,458
That is some
top-drawer hoodoo, man.

44
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,500
Think of it. Having the
power to replay any event,

45
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,708
again and again, until you
get the outcome you want.

46
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,708
Deeming it too big of a
risk to take a chance on,

47
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:52,791
they dumped the Prime Field
Device into the Boundary.

48
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,166
Don't throw 'em a parade
for doing the smart thing

49
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,125
just yet, though. The data
left behind by the first

50
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:03,875
Prime Field Device started
giving 'em all kinds of ideas.

51
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,416
"What if we could write our
own destiny?" mankind thought.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,916
"Screw you, Master Unit!
You're not the boss of us!"

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,625
So they hauled off and made
the Takamagahara System.

54
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,333
You gettin' all this?

55
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:21,416
Man made a god to keep
things chugging along.

56
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,041
So then, why keep
that second god around?

57
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,875
The Takamagahara
System's no fool.

58
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,708
It comes to the same conclusion.
It gives the Dimensional

59
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,250
Boundary Interface Prime
Field Device a new job.

60
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,250
Come up with a way to
annihilate the Master Unit!

61
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,708
[gasps]

62
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,291
Based on the Izayoi,
the sealed weapon that had

63
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,625
defeated the First
Prime Field Device,

64
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:47,333
it brought into
being the Murakumo.

65
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:51,041
But you can't destroy the
Master Unit using only that.

66
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,708
Not without the
power of the Azure.

67
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,291
Azure?

68
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,250
[HAZAMA] Yup, the power at the
root of it all, existing deep

69
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:03,541
within the Boundary. Creation
and destruction intertwined.

70
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,125
It was just a sliver, but I was
able to steal some of the Power

71
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:11,750
of the Azure. And you'll never
guess what I made with it!

72
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,958
Your Azure Grimoire.
The ol' BlazBlue.

73
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,666
[RAGNA gasps]

74
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,125
Neither of us has
the real BlazBlue.

75
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:23,375
We've got a pair of knock-off
Grimoires. Oh, well, right?

76
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,041
Fake or not, though, it looks
like you can still kick

77
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,500
a lot of ass with it. And by
"you," of course, I mean me.

78
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,166
And then the BlazBlue and
the Murakumo didn't fuse

79
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,916
the way I had wanted.
What we got instead

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,541
was a little somethin'
called the Black Beast.

81
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,416
It tore through everything!
Devoured souls

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,416
like they were going
out of style!

83
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,958
Oh, well.
Back to the drawing board.

84
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,916
What are you saying?

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,833
[HAZAMA] See, though, that
girl's a different story.

86
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:56,083
She doesn't need the Azure
Grimoire to get the job done.

87
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,708
She's the perfect
Prime Field Device,

88
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,083
with the Azure in her already!

89
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,583
[HAZAMA laughs]

90
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,083
[HAZAMA] It's friggin'
hilarious, isn't it?

91
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,416
That simpering waste
of space turns out to be

92
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,375
the Prime Field jackpot
I've been waiting for!

93
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,791
[HAZAMA laughs]

94
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,291
[RAGNA] Noel!

[KOKONOE] Lambda's
prepped for transfer.

97
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,250
[HAZAMA] Now, Murakumo!
Time to awaken!

98
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,708
[HAZAMA] This world
is made... of lies!

99
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,250
Lies! Lies!
Lies! Lies! Lies!

100
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,708
All of it!

101
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,416
I'm gonna give this place
a dose of the truth!

102
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,541
We're gonna burn down this
crappy world, starting now!

103
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,458
In the name of Susano'o,
I command you!

104
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,416
You are Murakumo
no longer.

105
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,750
No, you are Kusanagi,
the God-Killer Sword!

106
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:13,416
Summon your righteous blade
and lay waste to everything!

[HAZAMA laughs]

111
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:33,416
Hey, Master Unit Amaterasu!

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,125
You'd better watch your ass,
'cause I'm coming for ya!

113
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,958
Noel! Dammit! Wake up!

I hate... I hate the world!

Aw, atta girl.
That's what I like to hear!

116
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,250
No matter how many
times I take this face

117

away from you, Ragna,
it never gets old!

118

[HAZAMA laughs]

119
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,916
I'm gonna cut you in half!

Oh, my. That must hurt.
You showed me.

124
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,458
As for you, Kusanagi,
you head down

125
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,083
to that underground
Cauldron. Got it?

126
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,625
And kill Amaterasu A-SAP!

you could change her mind?

[KOKONOE]
Listen up, Lambda.

When that bastard attacks
Ragna the Bloodedge,

132

there's going to be a

where all of his focus
is on that one act.

00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,333
I'm sorry, Master Jubei.
I guess I'm just a sore loser.

Where do you
think you're going?

00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,375
Heh. Running while
you still can?

160
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,208
Maybe you're scared you
can't finish the job.

161
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:05,333
Killing you isn't worth
the time I'd waste on it.

00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:08,916
But if you're gonna

Noel as a weapon, you bastard!

She's not Noel
anymore, you dope!

Hell, she never was!
She isn't human!

She's something we
whipped up in a lab!

It doesn't matter.

What the--?

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,833
I decided I'm gonna

gonna help, but whatever!

Yeah, talking tough
didn't really work out!

Rachel? What've you
done to her?

177

It's been a while.

There's no way she
could remember you!

because she was alone

in the Boundary
for a long time.

said so many things to Nu.

It's because Ragna
is gentle with Nu.

Dark War relics
aren't welcome here!

315
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,458
You have become an evil
that must be destroyed.

316
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,458
Yukianesa, activate!

317
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,791
Target identified
as an SS-level threat.

318
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,458
Updating battle configuration.

319
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,625
This the place?

320
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,083
[GII] Why else would
I have brought you here?

321
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,458
Save her already! Wha--!

322
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,833
Bastard. That's the thanks
I get for helping you out?

323
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,000
[GII] Yeah...?

324
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,958
Great. Remind me to
never do this again.

325
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:50,958
[GII yells]

326
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,000
[RAGNA]
Come on, ya damn Rabbit!

327
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,583
[RAGNA yells]

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So I'm a "damn Rabbit"
to you, huh?

329
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,625
[NAGO]
The nerve of that man!

330
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,500
I should scratch that sassy
mouth right off his face!

331
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,541
I missed you both so much!

332
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,166
Honestly, Gii. Going to such
an inferior creature for aid...

333
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,625
[GII] He followed me here,
Princess. Bat's honor!

334
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,791
Something within you
has changed.

335
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,875
[RAGNA] What?
Gimme a break!

336
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,416
You're not gonna thank
me for saving you, huh?

337
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,916
But I did thank you.

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,541
[RAGNA] When?

339
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,583
Never mind.

340
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,750
[RAGNA groans]

341
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:39,875
C'mon, let's help Noel.

342
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,333
[JIN pants]

343
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,666
[MU] Threat level
declining rapidly.

344
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,000
Target tiring.
Defeat imminent.

345
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,625
[JIN]
Stay out of this!

346
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,833
[HAKUMEN]
Lo, the Dark One.

347
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,041
You're late... Brother.

348
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,791
Yeah. I figured a beat-down

349
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,916
might make you less
of a pain in the ass.

350
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,958
[JIN chuckles]

351
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,625
Brother. How could you?

352
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,333
[RAGNA] What do you
say we finish this up?

353
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,708
[JIN]
Splendid idea.

354
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,166
New target in possession
of the Azure Grimoire.

355
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,083
[RAGNA] Dammit, Noel.
How could you have

356
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,458
let Terumi pour his poison
straight into your head?

357
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,125
Get ready,
'cause here we come!

358
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:08,791
--[NU] Ragna!
--[LAMBDA] Ragna!

359
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,125
--[MU] Ragna!
--[RAGNA] Which of you's which?

360
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,208
--[NU] Nu is Nu.
--[LAMBDA] I'm Lambda.

361
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,250
--[MU] Mu here.
--[NOEL] Episode 12...

362
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,750
"The Price for the Future."

363
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:15,041
[RAGNA]
So who just read the title?

364
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,583
[NOEL]
Noel, silly!
