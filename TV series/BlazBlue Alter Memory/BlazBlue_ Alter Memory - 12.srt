1
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:13,916
So that's it?
That's the plan?

2
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,375
[RAGNA] We sit back and let
that masked freak kill Noel.

3
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,083
That's what you said, right?

4
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:22,500
[KOKONOE]
Face the facts.

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,375
What Noel's turned into--

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,583
there's no bringing
her back from it.

7
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:29,416
Listening in.
Of course you are.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,875
Everything that made
that girl Noel Vermillion

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,416
has been written over.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,083
I don't care! There's gotta be
something we can do for her!

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,875
C'mon!

12
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:42,333
There is a limit
to even my power.

13
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,500
Dammit! Both of you.
Always talking like you have

14
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:48,875
all the answers. But when
the chips are down,

15
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,750
you can't even save
one stinkin' girl!

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,125
[RAGNA hisses]

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,250
[RAGNA]
At least tell me this.

18
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,125
What happens if Noel
goes into the Cauldron?

19
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,000
This world will end.

20
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,041
What?

21
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,666
That is her purpose.
To annihilate.

22
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,500
Nothing will remain
once she is finished.

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,500
[JIN] Huh?

24
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,208
[HAKUMEN]
Lo, the Dark One.

25
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,458
You're late... Brother.

26
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,333
Yeah. I figured a beat-down

27
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,500
might make you less
of a pain in the ass.

28
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,333
[JIN chuckles]

29
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,958
Brother. How could you?

30
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,750
[RAGNA] What do you
say we finish this up?

31
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,166
[JIN] Splendid idea.

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,625
New target in possession
of the Azure Grimoire.

33
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,500
[RAGNA] Dammit, Noel.
How could you have

34
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,833
let Terumi pour his poison
straight into your head?

35
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,375
Get ready,
'cause here we come!

36
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,416
[MU] I hate...
I hate the world.

37
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,791
[JIN yells]

38
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,958
[RAGNA]
Are you okay?

39
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,416
[JIN groans]

40
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,583
[RAGNA] Kusanagi?
The God-Killer Sword?

41
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,458
Don't make me laugh!

42
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,875
You're just Noel,
so cut this crap out!

43
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:52,000
Emotional state of target.
Scanning, scanning, unknown.

44
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,958
[RAGNA] I'm gonna get you
back into your right mind,

45
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,291
you little dummy!

46
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,291
Even if I have to drag
you back every damn inch!

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,333
[RAGNA yells]

48

[grunts]

49
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,041
Now die.

50
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,500
[JIN groans]

51
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,958
Jin!

52
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,916
[RAGNA yells]

53
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,625
Brother, no!

54
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,500
[RAGNA] Annihilate the world?

55
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,041
Noel Vermillion?

56
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,333
[scoffs] That'll be the day.

57
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,041
[RACHEL] Noel was
forced to confront

58
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,083
the world's malice until,
devoid of any hope,

59
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,416
hatred poisoned her soul.

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,125
You can end this
before it blossoms

61
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,875
into something worse.

62
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,041
The Azure Grimoire
I bestowed you with

63
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,875
could grant us succor.

64
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,708
Its original form
was that of a Cauldron.

65
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:19,000
Meaning it should still
be able to shatter her soul.

66
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,916
If you can't, Hakumen
is ready to dispatch her--

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,333
[RAGNA] Just keep that
masked freak away from her.

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,458
You'll see.

69
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,708
I can handle this myself.

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,041
[HAKUMEN]
You know they cannot win.

71
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,916
If they do not
survive this, end her.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,375
[HAKUMEN] Gladly.

73

You idiot!

79
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,875
Listen to me
for once, Jin!

80
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,166
You're too injured
to keep on fighting her!

81
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,583
What are you
talking about?

82
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,541
I'm holding my own out here!

83
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,541
This world is
nothing but a cesspool

84
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,166
of suffering,
sorrow, and rage.

85
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,000
Hope is a cheap illusion.

86
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,791
It's time someone
tore it all down.

87

Everything is a lie.

The world deserves this!

Jin, we got trouble!

00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:27,250
[MU] I hate the world,
and the world hates me!

Damn it all! Get back!

[RAGNA] Aah!

104
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,375
[RAGNA] I've given you
a lot of grief about

105
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,291
being an idiot, Noel,
but at the end of the day,

106
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,708
it's you being gullible
and kind and honest

107
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,458
that I really like.
They're rare, y'know?

108
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,666
How can you say...

109
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,416
you've lost hope
when you are

110

that hope to the
people around you?

111
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,500
[RAGNA] If you looked
at the world that close,

112
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,083
you must've seen the
good things about it, too.

113
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,041
The last couple
days since I met you,

114
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,541
I figured out some
stuff about myself.

115
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:01,708
No use.

116
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,333
All that made her
Noel has been cast out.

117
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,541
[RAGNA] So, what?
That's it? You're giving up?

118
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,916
What about the folks
who care about you, huh?

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,708
They all die
'cause life ain't perfect?

120
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,166
[MU] I am not a human.
I am a doll.

121
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,875
One that will
destroy everything.

122
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,625
[MU] I hate the world.

I can tell!

No one chooses
your destiny but you!

When Terumi took you,

148
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,541
you called out to me.

I know it's not too late.

defeated the Eye, it would seem.

152
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,083
[TB] Interesting,
especially on the heels of

153
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,708
him having bested the serpent.

154
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,166
[TA] However, this is
not our ideal future.

155
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,708
This will impede the events
leading to the Day of Ruin.

156
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,958
[TB] But if Noel Vermillion
loses her powers,

157

we can inherit the

[TC] Yes.

159

Noel Vermillion is
an uncertain factor.

160
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,750
[TA] Let us excise
this one event

161
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,250
and inherit the
Azure for ourselves.

162
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,375
[TB] Agreed. We've failed
to destroy the Master Unit,

163
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,125
but with the Azure
in our possession,

164
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,458

a miracle was wrought

325
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,625
by two beings beneath
the clockwork god's notice.

326
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:35,416
[HAKUMEN] The Dark One,
Ragna the Bloodedge,

327
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,208
and the Eye, Noel Vermillion.

328
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,625
[RACHEL] Indeed. They changed
the course of fate,

329
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:45,125
and ushered time
onto an unknown path.

330
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:49,583
[JUBEI] Looks like you
got the Power of Order, Jin.

331
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,375
I fail to see how that's
any concern of yours.

332
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,958
Well, you ever wanna
figure out how it works,

333
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:58,291
just holler.
The door's always open.

334
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,416
Don't make me laugh.

335
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,750
[RACHEL] The biggest
difference is unseen.

336
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,000
Ragna himself has changed.

337
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,083
As has Noel's heart.

338
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,833
[RACHEL] We saw it happen.
The moment Ragna's BlazBlue

339
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:16,500
touched Noel, the two
Azures forged a new bond,

340
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,833
and now it's time for them to
carve out their own destiny.

341
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,875
[HAKUMEN] That's
something he would say.

342
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,000
[RACHEL] Ragna throws his
words like so many stones,

343
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:30,375
but they are possessed of
weight, and his aim is true.

344
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:33,791
It would seem you traveled
here in vain, Mr. Hero.

345
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,666
My apologies.

346
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,833
[HAKUMEN]
This is far from over.

347
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,875
Yuuki Terumi yet lives,

348
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,291
and the Imperator
reigns unchecked.

349
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,833
[RACHEL] This is true.

350
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,958
[HAKUMEN] Possessed
of this dire knowledge,

351
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,500
how can you not
issue a call to arms?

352
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,250
[RACHEL] The future is
theirs to change, Hakumen.

353
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,208
When they're ready, they shall.

354
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:58,333
[HAKUMEN] Heed me, for I shall
change it in my own way.

355
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,083
I have not forgotten my vow.

356
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,625
[RAGNA]
She's my, my sister, Saya.

357
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,291
[door opens, closes]

358
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,125
[HAZAMA] Well, you can
color me surprised!

359
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,000
My compliments to the chef!

360
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,333
To think your device willed
itself back into one piece.

361
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:21,208
The Thirteenth
Prime Field Device

362
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,416
[RELIUS] was the closest
I've come to perfection.

363
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,041
Listen to that
heart chugging away.

364
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,333
Makes ya look forward
to the future.

365
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,500
[RELIUS] It's hard to
tell where coincidence ends

366
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:33,291
and your machinations
begin, Hazama.

367
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,916
[HAZAMA] Hey, it's the dawn
of a new age, remember?

368
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,791
The Imperator said so herself.

369
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,916
In that case,
do as you will.

370
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,416
[HAZAMA chuckles]

371
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,750
I think you'd make
a great Sword of Izanami.

372
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,291
[RACHEL] The curtain falls,
as it has so many times before.

373
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:56,791
But this time, it rises again
to reveal a new tableau.

374
00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:00,375
No one can say what
awaits us in this new world.

375
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:02,375
Not even one such as I.

376
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,083
But I know you will be
at the heart of it, Ragna.

377
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,458
[TAOKAKA] Special
delivery for Good Guy!

378
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,750
Coming in hot!

379
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:14,458
Tao's tagging along,
Good Guy! Lucky you!

380
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,666
Huh?

381
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,958
What the hell?

382
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,750
Cat Person told Tao
to go where Good Guy goes,

383
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:20,083
so here she is!

384
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,875
Tao bets we'll have all
sorts of adventures, meow!

385
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,375
We're gonna munch on om-noms
Tao's never even seen before!

386
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,333
Stay home!

387
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,291
Hell, you're gonna come anyway.

388
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,833
Uh-huh!

389
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,291
[sighs]

390
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:39,333
Tch. Mewvin' out, Taokaka.

391
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:40,250
[chuckles]

392
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,458
Where are we heading, Good Guy?

393
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,291
To Ikaruga.

394
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,250
[RACHEL]
The path will be rocky.

395
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:52,000
You will struggle and suffer,
and grasp as though blind.

396
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:56,833
But throughout all your trials,
one certainty will ring true.

397
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,833
At the moment that this
new world came into being,

398
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,958
you won us a measure of hope.

399
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:07,208
Whatever may happen next,
be brave, Ragna the Bloodedge

400
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:11,750
[RACHEL] and protect that
fledgling hope. For all of us.
