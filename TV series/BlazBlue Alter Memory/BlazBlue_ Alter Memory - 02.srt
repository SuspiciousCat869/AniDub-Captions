[RAGNA] Gauntlet!

00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,333
[RAGNA] Hades!

168
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:17,083
[giggles]

169
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,333
What are you
waiting for, Ragna?

170
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,791
[RAGNA] What the hell?

171
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:25,916
Why do you look
at me with her face?

172
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Damn you. Damn you!

173
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,583
[laughs]

174
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,833
[squelch]
[RAGNA groans]

175
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,458
You're insane.

176
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,958
[NU laughs]

177
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,666
Oh, Ragna!

178
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,416
Now we'll be
together. Always.

179
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,541
Thus, the bloody
denouement.

180
00:14:56,625 --> 00:15:00,291
I practically know
it word-for-word now.

181
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:04,333
The actors are bound to
a plot that's e'er the same.

182
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,583
[NU] Oh, Ragna...

183
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:11,833
This feels really good, huh?
We're so connected right now.

184
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,083
Deeper.

185
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,125
Nu wants it deeper!

186
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:18,750
[chuckles]

187
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,958
Like hell are
we connected!

188
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,625
[NU] Hey...

189
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,666
Nu has a special
trick in mind, Ragna.

190
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,166
Check it out.

191
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,458
[NU] Watch!

192
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,333
Restriction 666 released!

193
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,500
And then I say,

194
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,041
"Dimensional Interference
Field Deployed!"

195
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,208
Murakumo Unit, activate.

196
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,458
Oh, yeah? Fine!

197
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,875
If this is how you
wanna play it,

198
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,583
the gloves
are coming off!

199
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,375
[RAGNA] Restriction
666 released!

200
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:04,000
Dimensional Interference
Field Deployed!

00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,708
Blazblue!

202
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,916
[NU] We should
take it slow for now.

203
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,541
But later, you can
be as rough as you want.

204
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,750
You can destroy everything.

205
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,750
Nu likes it when
you're like that.

206
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,208
[NU] Come on. It's time.

207
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,750
[RACHEL] The two
of you will meld.

208
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,916
Into a beast that
will devour the world.

209
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,791
[RAGNA] Y'know what?

210
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,375
I hate the world anyway.

211
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,041
[RAGNA] I'm in.

212
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:43,208
Whatever catastrophic
bullshit you're planning,

213
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,416
mankind deserves it all.

214
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,750
Ragna!

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,208
Don't give up, Ragna! No!

216
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,541
Guess I dozed off, Saya.

217
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,166
Are you having a good day?

218
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,125
[YOUNG RAGNA]
What's with that face?

219
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,125
You get in a fight
with Jin again?

220
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,791
[inaudible dialogue]

221
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,458
Huh? What'd'ya say?

222
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,500
I can't, really
hear you right now.

223
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:36,666
I'm so sleepy I can't
keep my eyes open.

224
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,041
You can't give up.

225
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:42,791
[YOUNG RAGNA] Huh?

226
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,541
[NOEL] You can't
give up! Ragna!

227
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,333
[shrieks]

228
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,875
[NOEL grunts]

229
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,125
Huh?

230
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,208
Impossible.

231
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,583
'Bout effin' time!

232
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,375
[NOEL struggling]

233
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,791
How come... you gave up?

234
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,291
[NOEL] Dummy. Dummy, dummy,
dummy, dummy, dummy!

235
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,166
Dummy, dummy!

236
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,791
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy...

237
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,500
Shut up already--I get it!

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,833
What I meant to
say was, y'know...

239
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,375
Thank you.
For the save.

240
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,250
I really owe you one.

241
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:17,666
[NOEL begins sobbing]

242
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,500
Huh? Ow!
What the hell!

243
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,083
I just got stabbed!

244
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,708
Oh! I--! You're--!
I'm so sorry!

245
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,166
What do I do?

246
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,333
I'll go find a doctor
and bring them to you!

247
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,291
[NOEL] Just be patient!

248
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:34,041
I'll be right back!

249
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,916
Man, what is
the deal with her?

250
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,916
[RACHEL] It moves again.

251
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,125
[RACHEL] Thank
you for this respite

252
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,791
from my infernal
boredom, Ragna.

253
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,750
[RAGNA] Who the
hell is that girl?

254
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,208
Talk, Rabbit!

255
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,125
She is the new Eye.

256
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,000
[RAGNA] Wait...

257
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,000
She's what now?

258
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,125
The Azure Successor.
The Calamity Trigger.

259
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,333
[RACHEL] Unlike the copy
you so clumsily wield,

260
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,416
she will inherit
the true Azure.

261
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,125
The stagnant pool of time

262
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,833
has been undammed.

263
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,250
Even I do not
know where this new

264
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,791
current may take us,
but take us it shall.

265
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,000
In truth, I can
hardly wait.

266
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,666
I dunno what you're
going on about, Rabbit.

267
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,333
Cut the fluff-talk
and try it again.

268
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,500
[RAGNA] Huh?

269
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,166
[RACHEL] It awakens.

270
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,208
[RAGNA] Hey!

271
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,000
I wasn't done with
you yet, you know!

272
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,625
You're so powerful.
How could you be a copy?

273
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,000
[NOEL] Ragna! I'm back!

274
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,791
Damn if that girl don't
look exactly like you...

275
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,833
[RAGNA] Saya.

276
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:57,875
[giggles]

277
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,000
[RACHEL] The world has
begun to move forward.

278
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,250
[RACHEL] He concerns me,
and rightfully so.

279
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,916
But now, for the moment,

280
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,333
[RACHEL] you are the sole
possessor of my attention.

281
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,458
[RACHEL]
Nox Nyctores Gigant.

282
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,750
Take mikazuchi!

283
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,416
[JIN] Congratulations, Brother!
Your greatest wish came true!

284
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,833
Our story is an
anime, which means...

285
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:14,083
[RAGNA] Episode Three,
"The Observi--"

286
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:15,541
Jin, you bastard!
Shut up!

287
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:17,000
[JIN] Brother!
