00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,916
[TSUBAKI yells]

160
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,333
[gasps] A Nox Nyctores?

161
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,041
Where did you get those from?

162
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,916
[NOEL grunts]

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,541
[TSUBAKI grunts]

164
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:41,166
[TSUBAKI] But then,
Noel always gets...

165
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,208
things she doesn't deserve!

166
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,500
[TSUBAKI] Damn you!

167
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,958
[gasps]

168
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,416
What's the matter?
Can't pull the trigger?

169
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,291
[NOEL grunts]

170
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:10,916
Bolverk doesn't exist...

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,666
to shoot at precious friends.

172
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,750
Like you!

173
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,041
[gasps]

174
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,791
[NOEL] You're one of
my best friends, Tsubaki!

175
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,416
I want some answers,
Rabbit, and I want 'em now!

176
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,375
[RELIUS] The girl below
endangers my creation.

177
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,458
Your what?

178
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:31,125
That thing you
insist on calling Noel.

179
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,833
It's just a Boundary
Interface Prime Field Device

180
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,375
I constructed.

181
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,500
[RELIUS] It's the twelfth of
its kind, truth be known.

182
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,208
You're saying...
Noel's not human?

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,750
[HAZAMA] Lemme guess.

184
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,625
She says you're one of
her best friends, right?

185
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:55,166
What sort of fool
does she take you for?

186
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,625
Captain Hazama?

187
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,250
[HAZAMA]
Oh, she talks a good game,

188
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,833
but every word out of
her mouth is a lie.

189
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:02,750
She steals everything
she can get her

190
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,666
crafty little hands on!

191
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,208
You, a child of the Duodecim.

192
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,833
You graduated at
the top of your class.

193
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,291
Why do you play second-fiddle
to this non-entity?

194
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,916
She's living the good life,
while you piss away

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,791
your ambition on
glorified trash duty!

196
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,291
I take pride in the
work I do, Captain Hazama.

197
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,583
All is in service
of the Imperator.

198
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,375
I'm satisfied with
my role within the N.O.L.!

199
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,666
[HAZAMA] Lieutenant,
stop lying to yourself.

200
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,625
Your heart is full of hatred.

201
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,833
Hatred?

202
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:37,750
Look in your soul.
You despise that girl.

203
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,416
[TSUBAKI] No! Noel is my...

204
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,000
[NOEL] Tsubaki?

205
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,583
[HAZAMA] Crap grades,
no personality.

206
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,833
Have you ever
met a girl who was

207
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,208
less cut out to be
a Praetorian Guard?

208
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,833
And when it was
all said and done,

209
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,791
this simpering
dishrag beat you out

210
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,875
[HAZAMA] for the role
of Jin's attaché!

211
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,166
Face it! You wanna kill her!

212
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,083
I'm carrying out
orders, that's all!

213
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,333
If it weren't an Imperial
Command, I would never--!

214
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,000
I know what you saw
when you picked up

215
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,041
Izuhyoi for the first time!

216
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,958
[HAZAMA] If there were
any justice in the world,

217
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,375
you'd be the one
standing by his side!

218
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,458
But something went wrong!

219
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,833
[TSUBAKI gasps]

220
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,916
[HAZAMA] Behold! The source
of all your problems,

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,458
Noel Vermillion!

222
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,500
She shouldn't even be here!

223
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,291
[TSUBAKI]
Shouldn't even be here?

224
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,458
[HAZAMA] She shouldn't exist.
No, mustn't exist.

225
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,166
Give her half a chance
and she'll take

226
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,500
everything worth
stealing from you!

227
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,000
I hate you!

228
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,083
[HAZAMA]
Yeah, that's the ticket.

229
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,750
Now we're getting somewhere.

230
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:40,041
Y'know you wanna
kill that bitch.

231
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,875
But you're gonna die!
You're just a tool!

232
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,083
I'm using your ass
to set up Number Twelve

233
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,250
for some truly epic shit!

234
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,291
[laughs intensely]

235
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,541
Well, then. Cauldron
prep is taken care of.

236
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,250
I guess we should
be on our merry way.

237
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,625
[HAZAMA] Let's call it
a night, Phantom.

238
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,416
[TSUBAKI grunts]

239
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,333
[TSUBAKI] Aurora Impact!

240
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,083
[TSUBAKI] Aah!

241
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,375
[NOEL] Type Five!

242
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,958
[coughs]

243
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,083
Huh?

244
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,291
[coughing]

245
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,791
Tsubaki!

246
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,750
[TSYBAKI coughs]

247
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:46,750
So, even now
I'm no match for you.

248
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,791
I'm so sorry.

249
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,208
Really? You're gonna
tell me how sorry you are?

250
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:57,250
You, who took everything...
that I ever wanted... from me,

251
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,875
I didn't know.

252
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,625
[TSUBAKI] I don't need...
your damn pity!

253
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:08,666
[TSUBAKI] Charging ars magus!
Disengaging Restraint System!

254
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm not gonna fight you!

255
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,791
Then you're gonna die,
Noel Vermillion!

256
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,625
You're my friend!

257
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,291
[TSUBAKI gasps]

258
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,666
[NOEL] Ragna!

259
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,541
Wait! Ragna,
as in Ragna the Bloodedge?

260
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,250
[RAGNA grunts]

261
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,750
Why are you here?

262
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,750
[RAGNA] You two're
getting on my nerves!

263
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,541
If you're gonna fight,
then fight, dammit!

264
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,666
[RAGNA sighs]

265
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,000
All of this chatter
is pissing me off.

266
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,625
Shut up, Grim Reaper!
It's your fault!

267
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,166
If you didn't exist,
Jin would still be here!

268
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,708
I'm not his babysitter.

269
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,333
Don't talk about
my Jin that way!

270
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,750
[RAGNA] Hmph.

271
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,875
I'll say what
I damn well want.

272
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,625
If this chick
doesn't calm down soon,

273
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,208
I may have to tag in.

274
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,583
But, you don't
have a reason to do that!

275
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,500
What's going on here
has nothing to do with--

276
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,875
[RELIUS] Expressing emotion
as though human. Interesting.

277
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,333
[gasps]

278
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:13,000
[NOEL whimpering]

279
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,875
[TSUBAKI] Colonel Relius?

280
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,333
Back off!

281
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,041
Azure Successor or not,
you still turned out

282
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,333
to be a defective unit.

283
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,500
[NOEL gasps]

284
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:39,125
Dammit! What the hell
is wrong with that guy?

285
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,875
Aah!

286
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,291
[TSUBAKI'S footsteps]

287
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,000
[NOEL whimpers]

288
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,083
[RAGNA] Hey. And where
do you think you're going?

289
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,000
You should be grateful that
she ran off when she did.

290
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,250
Yeah. I know.

291
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,375
But still. Tsubaki is
important to me!

292
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,375
[NOEL] I can't
give up on her!

293
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:20,541
[sighs]

294
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,041
[RACHEL] Go to her, then.

295
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,208
Clearly, your heart yearns
to repair this breach.

296
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,500
Miss Rachel. Thank you.

297
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,000
Do whatever you want.

298
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,416
Thank you both!

299
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,000
[RAGNA] Guess what? I'm not
as stupid as you think.

300
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,208
You brought me here so
I'd see all this, didn't ya?

301
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:49,333
[RACHEL] It begins
to dawn upon you.

302
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,250
The reality of her existence.

303
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,583
But her eyes are
a different color.

304
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,000
[RACHEL] True enough.

305
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,458
The smelting has
not yet taken place.

306
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,833
Now that you are
privy to the truth,

307
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,708
there is a decision
that you must make.

308
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,041
Much depends on
your answer, Ragna.

309
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,416
[RAGNA] Damn it all!

310
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,750
Ah! Now that Izayoi's
barrier has come down again,

311
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,666
I'm gonna take a quick
look at the body count!

312
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,291
[HAZAMA gasps]

313
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,416
The hell? You've gotta
be frigging kidding me!

314
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,708
One of those
bitches should be

315
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,458
dead as disco right now,
but they're both okay!

316
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,833
I even gave the Zero Squadron
flunky a god-tier weapon,

317
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,791
and she still couldn't
get the job done!

318
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,625
What the actual eff?

319
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,500
Honestly.

320
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,458
And, Kisaragi got
ret-conned back to

321
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,833
the land of the living.
Tsubaki's kill-ratio is crap.

322
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,250
If you want
something done right,

323
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,958
I guess you gotta
do it yourself.

324
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,625
[footsteps]

325
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,791
[NOEL] Please, wait!

326
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,875
I just... I just
want to talk to you!

327
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,666
Why're you staring?

328
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,000
[gasps]

329
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,666
[NOEL] Tsubaki! Your eyes!
What happened to them?

330
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,958
[TSUBAKI] Wielding the
Izayoi comes at a price.

331
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,333
It steals all light
from its surroundings,

332
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,291
even from the person
who's using it.

333
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,208
[NOEL] Why use
something like that?

334
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,666
[TSUBAKI] You and Jin are
too strong for me, Noel.

335
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,750
Without the Izayoi,
I have no chance

336
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,416
of completing my mission.

337
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,708
You're willing
to lose your sight?

338
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,375
[TSUBAKI] You're the one
who can't see things.

339
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,166
I've been jealous of you
for as long as I've known you.

340
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,500
[NOEL] Huh?

341
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,083
[TSUBAKI] Even now,
I couldn't keep up with you

342
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,750
when you gave
the fight your all,

343
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,291
and I had the advantage.

344
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,125
You're way more amazing than
you give yourself credit for.

345
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,916
What're you talking about?

346
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,166
I always wanted
to be more like you.

347
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,916
More like Tsubaki,
who's such a good person.

348
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,458
It's true.
Because you're so kind,

349
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,083
and dependable, and caring.

350
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,375
Makoto and I
love that about you.

351
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,000
If I'd been better
about saying it,

352
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,625
maybe all this
wouldn't have happened!

353
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,166
Thank you, Noel. Really.

354
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,166
But I'm not the good person
that you think I am.

355
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,958
When the job of Jin's
secretary was given to you,

356
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,625
[TSUBAKI] I thought of you

357
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,583
and wished you
would just vanish.

358
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,291
You see? On the
inside, I'm horrible.

359
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,583
Uh-uh. I don't believe it.

360
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:41,208
Even now, knowing all that,

361
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,958
I still love you
as much as ever!

362
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,583
[TSUBAKI] Even though I tried
to kill you tonight?

363
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,083
[NOEL]
You didn't want to do it!

364
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,291
You were just following orders!

365
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,750
[TSUBAKI] I still am.

366
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:59,125
So, it's a good thing I didn't
find you here, isn't it.

367
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,500
[NOEL] Thank you.

368
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:03,666
[TSUBAKI] But, next time
we finish this.

369
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,166
[NOEL gasps]

370
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,375
[KOKONOE] Tager, you there?

371
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,625
[TAGER] Hey, Kokonoe.

372
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm barely picking up
your comm signal here.

373
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,291
Is this interference
because of the recent blast?

374
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,458
[KOKONOE]
This ain't Takemikazuchi.

375
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,375
It's something current.

376
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,875
Kokonoe?

377
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,916
[KOKONOE] Forget it.
How goes the Azure hunt?

378
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,333
[TAGER] I've confirmed
it's somewhere near

379
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,958
the top of the city.

380
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,958
Good. Just keep your nose
to the grindstone, Tager.

381
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,041
If things go well,
maybe you'll get to rendezvous

382
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,166
[KOKONOE] with one of
our moles out there.

383
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,375
[TAGER] Roger that.

384
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,083
[KOKONOE] I think we've
got the Izayoi to thank

385
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,958
for our craptacular
comm signal.

386
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:51,125
Whatever. If it ain't
one damn thing, it's another.

387
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,000
[MAKOTO panting]

388
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,541
[MAKOTO] Noellers!

389
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,083
Mm.

390
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,791
Thank goodness!
I was afraid she'd attack.

391
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,291
Ah. Where is Tsubaki?

392
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,916
[NOEL] Makoto!

393
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,791
[NOEL sobbing]

394
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,375
[RACHEL] And thus, we reach
the end of our long first act.

395
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,166
What awaits us,
I wonder, in the second?

396
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,333
[NOEL sobbing]

397
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,875
[RELIUS] So that is the
Sealed Armagus Izayoi?

398
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,666
What a superlative device.

399
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,916
[RAGNA] Episode 8,
"The Mechanical Soul."

400
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,083
[TSUBAKI] Izayoi can talk?

401
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,666
[RAGNA] That was me, guys.
