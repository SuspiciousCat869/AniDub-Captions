There's quite a lot to be said
for the talent of this group.

How about that?

5
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,620
I suppose it's time for
the fun to begin in earnest.

6
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,973
Random question. D'you think
Makino has a girlfriend?

7
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,307

Uh?

Ooh, what makes you
ask that question?

Well, this could be nothing,

but when Himiko and I went in
to wake him up this morning.

Your breakfast is
waiting for you, kay?

Thank you so much, Sumire.

Oh, man.

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,336
It was way too
adorable for words.

20
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,923
Is that why Himi's been as red
as a lobster all morning long?

21
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,051
Sumire, huh? That could
be his pet's name.

22
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,305
Nah. He has a cat, but I
think its name is Moshika.

23
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,307
He's the irresistible MakiMaki.

24
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,684
I bet he has five or
six lovers at least!

[HIMIKO] You don't think
he's a player, do you?

00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,040
A food, maybe?

Can you purchase
one at the store?

And will they
microwave it for you?

stop some people.

indulging in carnal desires

before taking the sacred
blood oath of marriage?

That's disgusting!

Did you say "blood oath"?

00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,939
Buncha morons.

Huh?

63
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,947
I wonder what kind of person
Makimaki's girlfriend could be?

64
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:21,076
If he confused her with Himiko,
I guess she must be younger.

Doubt it.

The expression on his

Well, I suggest that we settle
this debate with a vote!

You do know that voting
on someone's age

00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,050
doesn't actually change it,
right, Yuzu?

But first, I have prepared a
special treat for you to enjoy.

A special treat?

It's a simple game where you're
dealt a card face‐down

and you have to guess
if it's higher or lower

00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:44,047
Leaving everything up to chance
is what makes it so much fun.

159
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,341
[ZAKURO] We're too young
to admire gambling.

160
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,009
My brother said different.

161
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:48,969
[ZAKURO]
He was wrong!

162
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,096
What's that? You wanna go?

163
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,099
[ZAKURO] Bring it! We'll settle
this before time's up!

164
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,642
[ANYA growls]

165
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,985
[YUZU] I do get where Anboy's
coming from, though.

166
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,445
I'm not interested in
paltry victories, either.

167
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,948
If you ask me, we'd
better go big or go home.

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,949
[exhales]

169
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,701
[roars]

170
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,252
[ANYA] You should bet
on your gut instinct.

171
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,753
All in on A!

172
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,880
[YUZU]
I'm all in on Punitsuki.

173
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,465
You, MakiMaki?

174
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,843
It's always smart
to bet on black.

175
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,970
All right, let's get to it!

176
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,940
[ANYA] What the hell? Wait
a sec, I wanna change my bet!

177
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,192
[yells]

178
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,318
Ohh!

179
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,447
[groaning]

180
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,907
[groans, screams]

181
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,076
Why are they all
ganging up on me?

182
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,788
Come on! Go, Mimicry Man‐Eater
B! Fight! Knock 'em dead!

183
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,708
[YUZU] That's odd. I could've
sworn you just bet everything

184
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,668
you had on Mimicry
Man‐Eater A.

185
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,295
[grunting]

186
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,504
[wails]

187
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,048
[PUNITSUKI groaning]

188
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,215
That's my boy!

189
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,052
[YUZU] Anboy. You know
the rules, right?

190
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,721
[ANYA laughs] See that?
I was like "ha!" And "hi‐yah!"

191
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,347
[ZAKURO]
Yeah, I saw.

192
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,767
Saw you throw away
all your coins, that is.

193
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,769
Let him enjoy his
victory cheer, Zak.

194
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,813
We both know he lost in the end.

195
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,859
You're right, Anboy, gambling's
about big wins and big losses.

196
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,861
There's only one option left.

197
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,030
I'll give that furball
a shakedown!

198
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,949
[ANYA] Cough up the coins or
I'll knock your lights out!

199
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,659
[PAKA]
Neigh.

200
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,494
That works.

201
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,537
We shouldn't resort to violence.

202
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,665
Yeah, says the girl with
the flash bomb.

203
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,294
Uh? You've got a hefty sum
of coins there, Himi.

204
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:48,922
What game have you been playing?

205
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:49,839
None of them.

206
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,633
These are the coins I
started the game with.

207
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,717
I'm not good at gambling,

208
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,719
so I've just been
watching you guys.

209
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,678
[ANYA]
Ah...

210
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,056
Here! They're all yours
if you want them!

211
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,558
Otherwise, they'll probably
just go to waste.

212
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,644
Whoa! Awesome!

213
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,396
[YUZU]
Oh cool. Himi's an enabler.

214
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,152
[ZAKURO] Most of these
minigames are standard fare

215
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,696
for an RPG, but...

216
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,824
[BOTH grunt, exhale]

217
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,618
[KAIKOKU]
Pipes?

218
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,286
[ZAKURO]
That's from a different game.

219
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,163
‐‐[KAIKOKU] Up and over.
‐‐[ZAKURO] Wait, don't!

220
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,208
You can't dive in without
knowing how the game works!

221
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,002
Oshigiri. Are you one
of those people?

222
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,172
The ones who read the whole
manual before playing?

223
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,341
[ZAKURO]
Yeah, I study it on the toilet.

224
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,845
Well, I'm the type who learns
things through experience.

225
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,263
[ZAKURO]
Onigasaki!

226
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,523
Where am I?

227
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:52,569
It's been a long time since
Kai vanished, hasn't it?

228
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,612
[ZAKURO]
This is why I said to wait.

229
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,908
[YUZU] Knowing him,
he'll pop up again soon.

230
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,243
Uh?!

231
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,911
[AKATSUKI gasping]

232
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,329
[ZAKURO, HIMIKO gasp]

233
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,457
[YUZU]
That was quick!

234
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,500
[AKATSUKI]
You came back huge!

235
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,669
And you have a sweet moustache
for some reason!

236
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,671
You're like, Super Kai!

237
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:13,131
[KAIKOKU]
It's‐a me!

238
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,174
[roars]

239
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,216
[growling]

240
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,343
[PUNITSUKI grunting]

241
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,555
[inaudible]

242
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,454
[gasps]

243
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,086
[gasps] It's a board game.

244
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,465
[HIMIKO] I wonder how many
people can play it at once?

245
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,301
Sweet! I think I'll
give it a shot.

246
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,974
[AKATSUKI]
One, two, three,

247
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,768
four, five, six.

248
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,311
[PANDA grunts]

249
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,398
It's my old buddy Pandarou!
Long time, no see!

250
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,735
[AKATSUKI]
What a great start for me!

251
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,863
One, two, three.

252
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,907
What's it mean "battlefield"?

253
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,499
[ANYA] Those three steps threw
him right into a battle.

254
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,001
[KARIN]
Is that good or bad?

255
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,421
[ANYA] Must be weird
fighting yourself, huh?

256
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,173
[PUNITSUKI]
Puni!

257
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,633
[PUNITSUKI B]
Puni!

258
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,176
[PUNITSUKI C]
Puni!

259
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,636
[PUNITSUKI D]
Puni!

260
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,096
‐‐[PUNITSUKI E] Puni!
‐‐[PUNITSUKI F] Puni!

261
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,555
[KARIN]
Looks like it called for backup!

262
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,558
[PUNITSUKI G]
Puni!

263
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,018
Uh, Puni!

264
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,646
[ANYA]
He can do the same thing?

265
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,480
[PUNITSUKI H]
Puni!

266
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,190
[ANYA] T
hat one's bad too?

267
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:57,068
What is this, a friggin'
family reunion?

268
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,117
[KING PUNITSUKI]
Puni!

269
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,702
[PLAYERS]
Uhh...

270
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,809
[ANYA, KARIN]
Don't make friends with it!

271
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,189
Holy crap.
What's with this game?

272
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,985
Can't crack a joke.
I'm too tired.

273
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,945
[ANYA]
There's a drink machine, right?

274
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,281
[YUZU] Yeah, but all
it has is Paka Juice.

275
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,491
[ANYA]
Of course.

276
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,203
King Punitsuki was
such a sweet baby.

277
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,124
[AKATSUKI] 'Kay, let's
keep up the good work!

278
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,794
[AKATSUKI]
One, two, three... Four!

279
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,382
[gasps]

280
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,885
[AKATSUKI screams]

281
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,146
[YUZU]
How about you, Zak?

282
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,439
[ZAKURO]
Fresh out.

283
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,359
Onigasaki was on a
winning streak, though.

284
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,277
I can't wait to see
what he's got!

285
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,113
[KAIKOKU]
Feast your eyes, everyone.

286
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,865
[KARIN]
He cashed them in?

287
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,492
[ANYA]
Canned seafood?

288
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,702
I knew he liked sushi, but damn.

289
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,871
[ZAKURO]
What kind of fish is in there?

290
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,040
[PAKA]
Neigh.

291
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,379
[HIMIKO]
Big trouble!

292
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,254
[PLAYERS grunt]

293
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,964
[panting]

294
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,509
Help! It's Iride!

295
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,556
Oh gosh, that hurt. Did I
land on a trap space or...?

296
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,768
[gasps]

297
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,232
Akki?

298
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,609
[ANYA]
Where the hell did he go?

299
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,529
[PAKA] If you mean Mr. Iride,
he's quite safe.

300
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,532
Oh, that's a relief.
He'll be back, won't he?

301
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,787
[PAKA]
Yes, naturally. Although...

302
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,163
As I mentioned before,

303
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:17,250
this bonus stage
has a set time limit.

304
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,378
And the pitfall trap that
has just claimed our dear

305
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,133
Mr. Iride was designed to be
extremely difficult to escape.

306
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,136
[AKATSUKI]
Uhh...

307
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,471
[PAKA] But as long
as he's able to return

308
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:35,143
before the clock runs out,
he'll be perfectly fine.

309
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,271
Okay, so what happens if
he doesn't get back in time?

310
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,856
[PAKA]
Don't be alarmed.

311
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:44,026
I didn't mean to insinuate that
his life would be in danger.

312
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,987
All I'm saying is that
he won't get a chance

313
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,157
to play with
you ever again.

314
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,200
[ZAKURO]
So, he'll be a dropout?

315
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:52,660
[ANYA growls]
Bastard!

316
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:56,914
Stop it, Anboy. Every second we
stand here asking questions,

317
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,875
the clock continues to tick.

318
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,752
We should be thinking
about how to save Akki.

319
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,630
[ANYA grunts]

320
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,799
I wonder what would
happen if somebody else

321
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,261
played the dice game and fell
into the same trap that he did?

322
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,097
Or we win the request
ticket and wish him back.

323
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:16,601
[ZAKURO]
Which of us has the most coins?

324
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,978
[gasps]

325
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,063
I do?

326
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,566
[KARIN groans]

327
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,779
Sorry. I'm just
not good at RPGs.

328
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,698
Or fighting pandas.

329
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,576

[MAKINO]
I won.

332
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,667
[gasps] It seems even
Lady Luck can be seduced

333
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,836
by our sweet MakiMaki!

334
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,213
Amazing!

335
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,839
This guy's got the magic touch!

336
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,008
That's gotta be enough coins.

337
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,051
[MAKINO]
I'm drowning.

338
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:54,180
[ZAKURO]
Uh, we should probably help him!

339
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,181
[KAIKOKU]
After all that,

340
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,768
we still only collected half
of the cost of the ticket.

341
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,021
Hey, I know! If we go
double‐or‐nothing one time,

342
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,689
then we'll have just enough!

343
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,149
That's true.

344
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,068
And getting our hands
on that request ticket

345
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,446
is a sure‐fire way
to rescue Akki.

346
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,031
But that's not our call.

347
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,407
Is that okay?

348
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,701
They're your coins, after all.

349
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,788
Yeah, use them to help Akatsuki.

350
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:23,543
[sighs] If he's good with it,
then what are we waiting for?

351
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,503
There's not much
of a choice left.

352
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,838
[ZAKURO]
Yeah. No complaints here.

353
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,715
Let's save our friend!

354
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,677
All yeses. What now, Roro?

355
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,763
Doubling our total coins
may sound easy enough,

356
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,099
but it's kind of a massive risk.

357
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,934
I know it's a bit dicey,

358
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,770
but the convenient thing
about going all in

359
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,523
is that you only have
to gamble one time.

360
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,817
Of course, we should
pick the game

361
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,278
that gives us the best odds.

362
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,029
That would be High‐Low.

363
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,114
[YUZU]
Mm‐hm.

364
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,742
Two is the lowest,
and ace is the highest.

365
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,912
If it's one of those two,
then we win on the spot.

366
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,122
Outside of those cards,

367
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,249
the odds get worse as
you approach the middle,

368
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,751
but it's still 50/50.

369
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,380
So I think it's the
perfect game for us.

I least wanted to see.

Which one? Higher?

375
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,154
Or lower?

Higher? Or lower?

That's it, then.

much better these days.

Take care, Ichiya.

we're well past halfway there.

easy lately.

We're bound to run into our fair
share of traps up ahead too.
