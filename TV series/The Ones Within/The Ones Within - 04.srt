00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,706
‐‐[AKATSUKI] Himiko!
‐‐[HIMIKO] Huh?

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,333
I finally found you.

6
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,584
Iride.

7
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,544
[AKATSUKI]
Here.

8
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,047
I got a kid's lunch yesterday
and I found this prize inside.

9
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,757
Thought you might like it.

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,010
Wow, thanks a lot!

11
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,721
[HIMIKO]
Can I ask you something?

12
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,597
[AKATSUKI]
Hm?

13
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,391
[HIMIKO]
There's a bruise on your face.

14
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,225
What happened?

15
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,229
Oh, this is no big deal.
I just tripped.

16
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,690
It didn't involve
Kudou somehow?

17
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,774
[AKATSUKI]
Mm...

18
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,109
[HIMIKO]
Did you guys fight?

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,278
Fight? I'm not sure.

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,405
Maybe, kinda.

21
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,283
Seems like he wants
to cut ties with me.

22
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,933
[KARIN]
What the heck?

23
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,601
[AKATSUKI]
Uh, Anya.

24
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,020
Hey. Can I sit with you?

25
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:07,938
[ANYA]
Nope.

26
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,023
But I'll eat all
your peppers for you!

27
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,400
[ANYA]
Nah, I'll just leave 'em.

28
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,444
[HIMIKO]
Don't even joke about that.

29
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,947
You'd better not leave
them, you hear me?

30
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,824
[ANYA] Whoa, what the
hell are you doing?

31
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,284
Don't tap me on the shoulder
with a deadly weapon!

32
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,745
Those bell peppers were raised
with love and care by farmers

33
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,706
and shipped here
for us to enjoy!

34
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,083
In other words, those people
were kind enough to entrust us

35
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,459
with their precious
little children!

36
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,670
Think of the babies!

37
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,090
[ANYA] Peppers ain't babies,
you damn freak!

38
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,883
[AKATSUKI]
Anya.

39
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,637
What happened
between you two?

40
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:45,058
Well, see... I, uh...

41
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,810
Doesn't matter.

42
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,145
[AKATSUKI]
Uh.

43
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,231
[YUZU] Have you seen
Kai or Zak yet today?

44
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,693
Actually, I can't
say that I have.

45
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,278
I see.

46
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,031
[footsteps]

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,873
[KAIKOKU] Just like I thought,
no one's around.

48
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,208
It's not like
they're hiding, either.

49
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,632
What are you,
some kind of ghost?

50
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,427
I wish you would stop
concealing your presence.

51
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,387
[ZAKURO]
I didn't do it on purpose.

52
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,722
But if you're reckless again,

53
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,682
you'll cause trouble
for the others.

54
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,643
[KAIKOKU sighs]
So, what?

55
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,854
Did you come here to lecture me?

56
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,941
[ZAKURO]
Hey!

57
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,283
[KAIKOKU]
I knew I couldn't sense anyone.

58
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,536
These are covered in dust,
but they're brand‐new.

59
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,832
[ZAKURO] An empty city
made just for the game?

60
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,918
Well, at least we know that
there are probably people

61
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,545
on the outside looking for us.

62
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,755
[KAIKOKU]
Yeah, and?

63
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,090
Do you miss your
family that much?

64
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,136
[ZAKURO] I'm here to
take care of something,

65
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,013
and I'm not leaving
till it's done.

66
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,264
[KAIKOKU grunts]

67
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,606
[ZAKURO]
I'm looking for my twin sister.

68
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:19,653
[CROWD chattering]

69
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,465
[HIMIKO] You know,
the atmosphere here's

70
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,009
really different than
anywhere else we've been.

71
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,636
[KARIN]
Um, Himiko?

72
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,930
Are you okay?
'Cause you seem freaked out!

73
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,056
[HIMIKO]
Mm, no?

74
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,517
Don't worry, I can hold onto
your hand every step of the way

75
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,602
so you don't have to be nervous!

76
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,063
[HIMIKO]
Sweaty.

77
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,857
[YUZU]
No fair, I want in!

78
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,483
Yeah, me too!

79
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,614
[ANYA] Hey, quit blockin' the
walkway, it's a fire hazard.

80
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,868
[PAKA] Stage Five is entitled
"Demon Extermination."

81
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,745
Tonight, this village will
hold the Kakuriyo festival,

82
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,707
a celebration for
the repose of souls.

83
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,293
Demons are likely to take
advantage of the commotion

84
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,670
and kidnap a pure maiden or two.

85
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,422
In order to clear
this challenge,

86
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,299
you must put a stop
to these abductions

87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,219
and bring any captured girls
back to the village unharmed.

88
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,388
This festival will
only occur one time,

89
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,390
and failure is not an option.

90
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:34,060
As such, I would encourage you
all to proceed with great care.

91
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,729
It's just a rescue?

92
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,314
What about the monsters?

93
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,400
[PAKA] Naturally, the only way
you can achieve the best ending

94
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,820
is by decimating the demon
citadel in its entirety.

95
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:48,116
However, the enemies on this
stage are quite overpowered.

96
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,410
Expecting such
a task of you lot,

97
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:54,164
well, that would make me
something of a demon myself.

98
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,798
[PAKA]
Ah, yes.

99
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,843
Now that we've arrived,
I'll be taking my leave of you.

100
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,970
You can hear the rest of
the lore from the elder

101
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,555
waiting inside this room.

102
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,100
He knows more of the
details than I do, anyway.

103
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,562
This stage will require
at least four Let's Players.

104
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,190
There's no upper limit this
time, but since your assignment

105
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,026
will incorporate stealth,
I recommend sticking to

106
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,029
a smaller group,
if at all possible.

107
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,573
I wish you the best of luck.

108
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,410
[YUZU]
Guess we might as well head over

109
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,371
and hear what he has to say.

110
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,128
[KARIN]
Uh, who's gonna go first?

111
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,380
Why don't I go inside?

112
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,006
[ANYA]
Not so fast, genius!

113
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,258
You need to be more
careful, all right?

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,718
[HIMIKO]
Huh?

115
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,930
Weren't they having
a fight before?

116
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,473
Everything's fine.

117
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,226
In RPGs, an elder's house
or a king's castle

118
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,979
are pretty traditional places
to start your quest!

119
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,522
It's not like I'm
gonna get a knife

120
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,440
pulled on me right off the‐‐

121
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,820
[yells]

122
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,573
Would you mind
dropping that weapon

123
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,660
before someone gets hurt, miss?

124
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,913
[KIKKA whimpers]

125
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,957
A demon?

126
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,384
[KIHACHI]
I'm the village elder, Kihachi.

127
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,928
And this is my
granddaughter, Kikka.

128
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,473
I'm sorry she jumped to
the wrong conclusion.

129
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,725
[AKATSUKI]
Don't worry about it!

130
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,560
[KIHACHI] It's just that
our village is on guard

131
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,479
against a possible demon
attack this evening.

132
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,440
My Kikka's a beautiful girl,

133
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,526
so I never know when
she might be abducted.

134
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,696
And this senile old man would
do anything to save her,

135
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,282
even lay down my own life.

136
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,993
[KIHACHI]
You see, my friends,

137
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,619
there's a saying in
our village that

138
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,997
"visitors who come on the
festival night will be greeted

139
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,459
with deathly intent."
In fact, it's become the law.

140
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,086
What the hell kind
of law is that?

141
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,380
[KIHACHI] It's come to my
attention that you kids plan

142
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,759
to put an end to the demons'
brutality against our people.

143
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,887
I don't know if this will be
of any assistance to you, but

144
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,890
please accept the contents
of this wicker basket.

145
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,600
[ALL gasp]

146
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,435
[AKATSUKI] Wow, now it's
really starting to feel like

147
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,936
we're playing an RPG!

148
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,688
[YUZU]
What's inside? Treasure?

149
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,148
[ANYA]
Don't get your hopes up!

150
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,776
It's probably gonna
be something stupid.

151
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,949
[ANYA]
Sacrificial robes?

152
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,826
You're sending us out
there to die, old man?

153
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,119
[KIKKA]
Grandpa!

154
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,622
That's enough!

155
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,957
Give me back my knife!

156
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:47,003
Stop running away!
Hurry up, I need it!

157
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,297
Hey, you're making me dizzy!

158
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,425
[YUZU] Well, I think it's
clear what we need to do.

159
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,969
If we locate the demon base,
then we can rescue

160
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,847
all the captured maidens
in one fell swoop.

161
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,225
If they haven't been
killed yet, that is.

162
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,768
They're alive!

163
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,312
You don't know that.

164
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,772
I do, too!

165
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,856
For your information,

166
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,192
not every demon devours
people on the spot!

167
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,068
[KIHACHI]
Enough, Kikka.

168
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,152
[gasps]

169
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,991
This is gonna be tough.

170
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,745
Maybe, but you better not even
think about backing out of it.

171
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,621
Huh?

172
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,624
You already didn't help us
with the nurturing game.

173
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,709
I think I'd prefer
to sit this one out.

174
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,087
Maybe I'll play the next one.

175
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,630
[KAIKOKU]
Oh, you remember that?

176
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,340
[ANYA]
Sure do.

177
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,385
[YUZU] I guess that means our
players will be Kai and...

178
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,469
How about Zak?

179
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,096
[ZAKURO]
Huh? Why me?

180
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,973
You two have been
best buddies lately.

181
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,475
Always sneaking around together.

182
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,895
[ZAKURO] I don't have
a problem with it.

183
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,356
Yeah, it doesn't
matter to me, either.

184
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,358
Good. Just two more, then.

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,361
Who wants to volunteer?

186
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,863
I saw that coming.

187
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,699
But that means our whole
team is made up of guys.

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,495
The demons only go after girls,
so how does that work?

189
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,707
On the other hand, that
<i>is</i> pretty convincing.

190
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,959
[KIHACHI]
I cannot allow this.

191
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,711
According to the ancient scrolls

192
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,963
that have passed down
for generations,

193
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,757
what they want is a
beautiful, innocent maiden

194
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,052
with bouncy boobs and
a firm, perky butt!

195
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,936
[ANYA] No way in hell that's
what your "ancient scrolls" say!

196
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,813
[KIKKA]
Leave Grandpa alone!

197
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,106
Good grief!

198
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,858
Occult girl! Go!

199
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,525
Screw that.

200
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,902
I'm not gonna play
this messed‐up game,

201
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,321
let alone be the bait for
a terrifying monster!

202
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,238
Huh?!

203
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,699
Don't you think it's about time
you participate in something?

204
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,409
[KARIN] Just stick some
meat buns on your chest

205
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,827
and do it yourself!

206
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,370
[ANYA]
Are you kidding me?!

207
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,205
Hey, um.

208
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,916
Make sure you wrap them first
or you might burn yourself.

209
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,459
[ANYA]
Well, it ain't happenin'

210
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,044
so I don't need your
helpful pointers!

211
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,671
[ZAKURO]
Wait. Kudou has a mean face.

212
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,673
I don't think the demons'll
be attracted to it.

213
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,135
You wanna talk faces, mask boy?!
Let's take this outside!

214
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,971
[YUZU] Actually, Zak, I think
you'd look adorable in a dress!

215
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,848
[ZAKURO]
That's the one thing I won't do.

216
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,807
Come on!

217
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,059
[ZAKURO]
I won't.

218
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,602
And if you try to force me,

219
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,854
I'll cut my tongue out
right here and now.

220
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,980
[YUZU]
Uh, yikes.

221
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,565
[AKATSUKI]
I've never seen Oshigiri

222
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,442
put his foot down like that.

223
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,735
If that's the case, Kai,

224
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,946
then you're going to have to
take one for the team this time.

225
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,155
No thanks.

226
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,740
I don't think a man
of my stature

227
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,325
would pass as a woman, anyway.

228
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,202
[ANYA] Just tell 'em
you got stretched out

229
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,829
'cause you were hanging off
a pole like wet laundry.

230
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,164
[KAIKOKU]
I said no.

231
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,250
[ANYA] Man, you are
such a selfish prick.

232
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,835
[KAIKOKU] You're the last person
I want to hear that from.

233
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,962
And why's that?

234
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,715
Hold on. Can we
please not argue?

235
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,927
[ANYA] Wanna go kill the demons
yourself, tough guy?

236
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,096
Oh wait, you can't,
'cuz you're a wuss!

237
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,807
Everybody just calm down!

238
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,142
[ANYA groans]

239
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,024
Ready to get along now?

240
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,150
[GROUP]
Yes.

241
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,237
Look. We're about to fight
cheat‐level monsters.

242
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,240
Let's overcome our differences
and work as a team!

243
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,493
Actually, I think I have
the perfect plan!

244
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,164
[chuckles]

245
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,307
[ZAKURO]
So, why Aikawa?

246
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,475
[YUZU] Oh, did you
not get the memo?

247
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,394
Looking into his eyes
for five seconds

248
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,564
makes anyone of any
gender fall for him.

249
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,691
We'll overpower these
cheat‐level demons

250
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,526
with a cheat of our own!

251
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,069
Are you serious?

252
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,821
Care to try it?

253
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,380
[gasping]

254
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,717
[KAIKOKU]
Okay. I can't take this anymore.

255
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,553
[BOTH]
Awesome! But scary!

256
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,097
What are they doing over there?

257
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:10,850
Akki.

258
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,770
You can't utter a single word,
no matter what happens.

259
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,855
If you do, you'll
blow your cover.

260
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:16,731
Right!

261
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,649
And if you're ever forced
to say something,

262
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,777
remember to do it
like we practiced.

263
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,944
Try it.

264
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,322
Hi! My name's Akki!

265
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,242
[ANYA, YUZU]
Pfft!

266
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,118
[ANYA]
Dude.

267
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,329
Can't you tell when someone's
screwing with you?

268
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,413
Listen.

269
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,289
[BOTH]
Hm?

270
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,917
I've been meaning to
say this for a while now.

271
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,753
It looks like you two finally
made up after your fight.

272
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,588
I'm so glad!

273
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,715
We weren't fighting
to start with.

274
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:43,674
Huh?

275
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,220
Nothing! There was no fight!

276
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,390
You see, Anya ran out
of medicine recently,

277
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,142
so he was having
trouble sleeping.

278
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:57,772
But he didn't want to ask Paka
to give him some more, so I did.

279
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,902
[growls]

280
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,906
I told you not to get involved,
mind your own damn business!

281
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,542
So that's what it was.

282
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,877
Not much of a reason
to hit someone, though.

283
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,254
Just shut up!

284
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,256
[KARIN] He was obviously
worried about you!

285
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,132
[ANYA]
Ugh.

286
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,301
I don't need to hear that from
you, Madam Punch‐A‐Lot!

287
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,690
[AKATSUKI]
My poor feet.

288
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,567
They've gone totally numb!

289
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,069
Are you sure they're
gonna come tonight?

290
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,614
[KIKKA]
Oh, they'll come.

291
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,325
They're already here.

292
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,291
[KIKKA] You foolish humans have
fallen head‐first into our trap.

293
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,752
You've stepped into Kakuriyo,
the village of demons.

294
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,047
Which means your fate is sealed.

295
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,175
Especially this man.

296
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,969
You had a lot of nerve to disarm
me earlier,

297
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,137
but I'll make sure you regret

298
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,681
ever standing up to
the great Kikka.

299
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,351
[gasps]

300
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,188
What's the matter?
You see something?

301
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,273
[KIKKA]
Oh! Um.

302
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,441
Huh?

303
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,694
I just noticed, there's a bug
crawling on your back!

304
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,488
[KAIKOKU]
A bug?

305
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,448
Would you take a look?

306
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,366
[ZAKURO] There's a
two‐centimeter‐long caterpillar

307
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,619
located on your right
shoulder blade.

308
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,246
It's on its way to your neck.

309
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,749
[KAIKOKU] I meant, would
you please get rid of it?

310
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,709
[ZAKURO]
I don't like squishy bugs.

311
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,921
Aw, it's so cute!

312
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,465
And small! And chubby!

313
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,592
[ANYA]
He's afraid of bugs? Really?

314
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:53,346
Anboy. There's a Hercules beetle
crawling on your back, just FYI.

315
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,223
Oh, hell no! Get it off!

316
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,308
And it's the biggest
one in the world!

317
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,477
Would you two shut up
and focus, already?

318
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,728
[YUZU, ANYA gasp]

319
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,909
[KIHACHI] These must be
tonight's sacrifices.

320
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,419
[KIHACHI]
Change them!

321
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,338
[ZAKURO]
What...

322
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,923
...is that?

323
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:29,840
[AKATSUKI]
Huh?

324
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,094
You two aren't bouncy
or busty in the slightest!

325
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,556
You're nothing but a
couple of toothpicks!

326
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,724
Maybe not with
my clothes on,

327
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,895
but naked, well, take a look.

328
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,647
Don't push your luck,
you meathead!

329
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,774
Wait, we've still got
the MakiMaki stare!

330
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,484
[MAKINO snoring]

331
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,737
[YUZU]
He's asleep! We're doomed!

332
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,074
[KIHACHI] Enough nonsense.
Bring the maidens!

333
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,956
The fun's over for you, big guy!

334
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,874
[KIHACHI]
Ah, so there you are.

335
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,419
Now, which one
do you prefer, Kikka?

336
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,255
I think this is the one
I like best, Grandpa!

337
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,549
She's the softest
of the whole bunch.

338
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,467
Wait, "Grandpa"?

339
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,387
That's him!
It's the bearded guy!

340
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,141
[KIHACHI]
Very well. It's decided, then.

341
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,478
Hold on. Can we take
more than one?

342
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,815
That tiny girl over there
looks pretty good!

343
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,692
[KIHACHI] But you know your
old grandpa likes 'em

344
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,819
a little more on the curvy s‐‐

345
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:35,031
[KIHACHI coughs]
Er, we should take her.

346
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,783
[KIKKA]
No way. She's too scary.

347
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,618
[KIHACHI]
Ah.

348
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,202
Well, if you want
another maiden,

349
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,455
then you'll just have
to leave one behind.

350
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,248
I'm sorry, my dear,
but the dungeons

351
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,084
are packed to the brim
as it is, you know.

352
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,961
[KIKKA]
Hmph. Fine.

353
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,925
[AKATSUKI] Um. Is it okay
if I come with you?

354
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,054
No, dummy! He just said
I couldn't take any more.

355
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,388
I don't need you.

356
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,642
Aw, don't say that.
We'll think of it as a trial!

357
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,727
If you don't need me,
then get rid of me.

358
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,104
Akatsuki! What are you thinking?

359
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,022
[AKATSUKI]
It's Karin.

360
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,065
Uh.

361
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,693
I don't want her
to be by herself.

362
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,537
Well, Elder, ready to go?

363
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,373
[KIHACHI]
Hm?

364
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,501
Hmm. Let us proceed.

365
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,800
[ANYA]
Ugh! Damn it all!

366
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
[YUZU]
Calm down, Anboy.

367
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,553
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

368
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,639
He doesn't get it at all!

369
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,866
[exhales]

370
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,785
Just go away.

371
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:10,751
[AKATSUKI]
Anya. I suck at PE.

372
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,755
[AKATSUKI]
Look.

373
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,674
If you collapse again,

374
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,177
I might not have enough strength
to carry you to safety.

375
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,682
You see?

376
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,643
I want everyone to
finish this thing,

377
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,146
and I'd hate it if you
weren't there.

378
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,230
[gasps]

379
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:48,539
[AKATSUKI] I'm leaving your
medicine if you want it.

380
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,458
I'll be outside, okay?

381
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,348
[AKATSUKI]
Um, on second thought,

382
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,683
it's raining really
hard out here,

383
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,101
so can I wait inside with you?

384
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,896
Ugh! I've had it!

385
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,773
You really are a‐‐

386
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,193
Come on.

387
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,809
When you say everyone,
that includes you too.

388
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,688
[YUZU]
It's okay.

389
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,023
Our players may have changed,

390
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,150
but it's still going
according to plan.

391
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,485
Oh, yeah? Which part of it?

392
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:00,903
We don't even know
where their base is!

393
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,112
We do.

394
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,740
You know that card that Akki
wears around his neck?

395
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,951
I put a transmitter on it.

396
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,035
Uh.

397
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,037
Now we just follow them there.

398
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,041
[YUZU]
They won't get away.

399
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,793
No chance.
