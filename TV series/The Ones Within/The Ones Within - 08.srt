1
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,394
[PAKA]
Good evening, Let's Players.

2
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,064
Allow me to applaud
you on your success

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,316
against the
Curse‐Stealing Sisters.

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,528
You have no further engagements
scheduled for the day,

5
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:32,407
so please relax and enjoy
a bit of recreational time.

6
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:36,328
As you're all aware by now,
there's a luxurious outdoor bath

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,747
located on the 30th floor.

8
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:43,418
It will remain operational for
the rest of the night, so...

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,714
I encourage you to take
full advantage of it.

10
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,822
[KAIKOKU]
I knew it.

11
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,368
There are files for everyone
except Roro and Iride.

12
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,461
These are so thorough.

13
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,838
They really did
their research on us.

14
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,590
[knocking]

15
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,549
[KAIKOKU grunts]

16
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,899
[AKATSUKI]
Hey, Anya?

17
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,067
[ANYA]
Hm?

18
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,779
[AKATSUKI] What do you
think about checking out

19
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,740
that outdoor bath?

20
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,367
Shower's fine.

21
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,374
Aw. I kinda wanted to
go take a dip in it.

22
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,625
See? Look!

23
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,086
My hands are still super sweaty!

24
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,091
What's your problem?

25
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,342
Come on!
I want to try the bath!

26
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,469
Yeah, I know.
I heard you the first time!

27
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,264
Trust me on this, Anya, you're
gonna be so glad you went.

28
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,808
It's perfect for back pain,
stiff shoulders, fatigue,

29
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,351
or whatever else ails ya!

30
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,811
I don't have that stuff.

31
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,688
[AKATSUKI]
No way, how is that possible?

32
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,774
The last challenge
was really stressful!

33
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,570
Cramped in small spaces,
afraid for our lives.

34
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,907
What? But all we did
was sit around and wait.

35
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,161
Yeah, still.

36
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,497
I just know my muscles are
gonna be really achy tomorrow,

37
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,458
and the next day, too.

38
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,585
You should work out more.

39
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,213
Would you say that to everyone,

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,924
or are you just singling me
out because I'm bad at PE?

41
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,009
Huh?

42
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,096
[ZAKURO]
Bath?

43
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,056
It's a great way
to bond with people!

44
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,184
Just letting it all hang out!

45
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,769
[ZAKURO]
Hard pass.

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,189
You don't want to?
But why not, it'll be fun!

47
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,941
[ZAKURO]
'Cause I said so.

48
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,610
Forget about this guy.

49
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,154
He has a secret he doesn't
want people to know.

50
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,698
Really, what's the secret?

51
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,326
[ANYA] It's that his [bleep]
is super [bleep]

52
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,161
and [bleep] sideways!

53
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,996
[ZAKURO]
Hey, I can hear you!

54
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,456
And you're wrong, by the way.

55
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,583
You wanna go? Out to the bath?

56
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,337
I don't mind tagging along.
Not sure about Yuzu, though.

57
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,463
[HIMIKO]
Huh?

58
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,344
[inaudible]

59
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,471
Hey! Kaikoku!

60
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,392
[ZAKURO]
Strange. I've never seen him

61
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,645
look this serious before.

62
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,278
Understood. So this
is your theory, then?

63
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,781
[KAIKOKU]
Yes.

64
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,742
Well, I must say it's
a bit questionable.

65
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,452
I would argue pink.

66
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,038
I can't really get
behind that idea.

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,208
Akki's light blue, for sure.
Himi is yellow.

68
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,628
Then I'd say purple for
MakiMaki and red for Anboy.

69
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,714
That seems reasonable.

70
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,550
Zak is the tricky one, though.

71
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,927
[KAIKOKU] His demeanor
makes me think white.

72
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,220
[YUZU]
I see.

73
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,638
[ZAKURO]
What's this about?

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,016
[ANYA] Are they picking colors
for us like we're Rangers?

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,644
[ZAKURO]
It sounds like life or death.

76
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,479
As for you.

77
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,356
Black.

78
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,066
That right?

79
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,110
Yes, that's correct.

80
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,653
Now for you.

81
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,905
Wait, is that rude of me to ask?

82
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,615
I don't mind at all.

83
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,367
The answer is black.

84
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,743
Double black?

85
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,247
That's stupid. It's bad balance!

86
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
[ZAKURO] Well, those two
would be the bad guys.

87
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,918
[BOTH laughing]

88
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,630
[AKATSUKI] Uh? Hey!
What are you two talkin' about?

89
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,673
[PLAYERS gasp]

90
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,925
Just the colors
of our underwear!

91
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,427
[ZAKURO groans]

92
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,970
Who wears red ones?!

93
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,638
[ZAKURO]
And mine aren't white!

94
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,556
Red and white.

95
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,100
Is something wrong with
Christmas colors?

96
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,227
[ZAKURO]
That's not the point here!

97
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,395
Tell them, Aikawa!

98
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,023
You'd never have something
as gaudy as purple underwear,

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,274
would you?

100
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,617
I do.

101
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,993
[ZAKURO]
Sorry.

102
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,455
[AKATSUKI] Light blue, huh?
Maybe I should try some!

103
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,289
[YUZU gasps]

104
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,791
Uh, I'm sure if you took
it up with Mr. Alpaca,

105
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,377
he would come up with a way for
you to get your hands on a pair!

106
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,046
And if that doesn't work,
then I'll figure out

107
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,507
how to order them for you!
Karirin, too!

108
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,344
Would you like an adorable
pair of pink underwe‐‐?

109
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:10,931
[YUZU]
Sorry.

110
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,687
[AKATSUKI] Huh? So we're
not going together?

111
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,357
Us girls need to change and
grab our makeup and stuff,

112
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,442
so we'll catch up
with you later on, okay?

113
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,777
Sure, yeah.

114
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,030
We'll see you around, boys.

115
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,074
Guess we'll go ahead.

116
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,083
[ALL exhale]

117
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,214
[PAKA]
Well, well.

118
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,009
What a pleasant surprise.
The gang's all here.

119
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,970
[ANYA] What the hell
are you doing here?!

120
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,138
Ditch the suit and tie,
would ya?!

121
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,348
[PAKA]
Why, Mr. Kudou,

122
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,892
I didn't realize you
desired to see me naked.

123
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,310
Ah, uh! This is so sudden.

124
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,229
[ANYA] That's not what
I meant and you know it!

125
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,438
Just get out!

126
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,526
No way in hell I'm gonna use the
same bathwater as his nasty ass!

127
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,611
[KAIKOKU]
It is a little gross, isn't it?

128
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,240
[PAKA] Then think of it as
a hearty alpaca broth.

129
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,866
[ANYA]
That's not better!

130
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,577
Shut up and drown
in your own filth!

131
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,414
Ugh, I feel like I might vomit.

132
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,421
[AKATSUKI] Is it all right
if I sit next to you?

133
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,923
[PAKA]
Of course, by all means.

134
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:30,677
An Iride‐Paka broth would
be even more delectable.

135
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,553
[AKATSUKI]
Yeah!

136
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,179
[ANYA]
I said knock it off!

137
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,056
[AKATSUKI]
Don't mind if I do.

138
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,851
[ANYA] How come nothing
ever gets to that guy?

139
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,062
[AKATSUKI]
Mm! This feels so good!

140
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,983
You sure you're okay in there?

141
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,152
Do you feel like you're getting
any diseases yet?

142
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,362
Wow, it's so warm
and refreshing!

143
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,280
[PAKA]
You know,

144
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:55,076
you really are astonishingly
rude sometimes, Mr. Kudou.

145
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:55,994
What?!

146
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,956
[PAKA] But since you're
always so polite, Mr. Iride,

147
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,626
I would like to share a piece of
privileged information with you.

148
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,422
[AKATSUKI]
Really? Oh, boy! What is it?

149
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,593
[PAKA] It's sensitive, so please
lean in as close as you can.

150
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,261
[ZAKURO]
It's probably a valuable secret

151
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,221
about the city we're trapped in!

152
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,307
[KAIKOKU]
No. I bet it's a helpful hint

153
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,560
on how to get past
the next stage.

154
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,604
[ANYA] Better yet, tell us
what your weakness is,

155
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,647
you big fuzzy sicko!

156
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,945
[PAKA]
At this very moment...

157
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:35,241
[PAKA panting]

158
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,452
[PAKA] ...we're right next
to the girls' bath!

159
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,996
[ANYA] That's enough
outta you, pervert!

160
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,753
[PAKA] I'm starting
to feel a bit unwanted.

161
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,964
[PAKA] Don't they appreciate
the alluring mystique

162
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,008
of the women's bath?

163
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,983
Seriously. So what if
they're next door to us?

164
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,362
Nobody wants to go
over there, right?

165
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,656
Actually, yeah, I'd be
on board with that.

166
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,615
So would I.

167
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,742
[ZAKURO]
Uh... I... Uh...

168
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,660
For real?

169
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,662
I mean, it's not that
surprising that some of us

170
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,080
would be interested.

171
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,414
It's for research.

172
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,708
How can I resist the unknown?

173
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,168
Research?

174
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,591
Who knew you guys
were such animals?

175
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,468
[AKATSUKI]
You have a romantic side too.

176
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,555
You were reading that girls'
manga. <i>Je T'aime Apple.</i>

177
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,306
Uh, what? That was only because

178
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,475
you don't have anything else
to read in your room!

179
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,353
Besides, it's more of
a comedy than anything.

180
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,355
Now, this I have to hear.

181
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,440
[train whistle blows]

182
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,067
[AKATSUKI]
It's the story of a young girl

183
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,819
named Apple from Aomori.

184
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,905
She's chasing after Durian,
the love interest.

185
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,782
She almost gets
turned into a tart,

186
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,243
but she's saved by
a famous designer.

187
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,246
[CROWD cheers]

188
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,500
[AKATSUKI] Then she becomes
a Parisian fashion model!

189
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,085
Okay then.

190
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,338
[ZAKURO muffled laughter]

191
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,717
Hey, quit laughin' and take
your freakin' mask off! Jerk!

192
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,051
[ZAKURO]
Not happening!

193
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,596
Gross! Don't you know you're not
supposed to wear your clothes

194
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,973
into the bath?
It just ain't sanitary!

195
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,975
[ZAKURO]
It's not touching the water!

196
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,435
[BOTH growling]

197
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,730
Ugh. Stop playing
around in the bath.

198
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,273
[ANYA, ZAKURO]
We are not playing!

199
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,941
[ZAKURO]
It's war!

200
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,486
[ANYA]
Heh, heh...

201
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,822
[ZAKURO, ANYA shouting]

202
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,368
[HIMIKO] Don't you think washing
your hair can be kind of scary?

203
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,578
Your eyes are closed,

204
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,206
so you can't see if there's
somebody behind you.

205
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,209
[YUZU] A person is one thing,
but how about a ghost?

206
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,461
Yuzu! Don't say that!

207
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,798
[YUZU laughs] Aw, you're
so easy to scare, Karirin!

208
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,092
[HIMIKO]
Wait, where'd Punitsuki go?

209
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,346
[KARIN] Uh? You're putting
that blob in the bath?

210
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,972
[HIMIKO]
He needs to be clean, too.

211
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,390
I'll go find him.

212
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,018
[YUZU] Okay, do you
want me to go with you?

213
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,273
[YUZU laughs]

214
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:19,405
[YUZU] Well, when it
comes to helping Karirin.

215
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,866
I'm afraid I can't refuse.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,504
[YUZU]
See? There's nobody else around.

217
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,174
We've got the entire
tower to ourselves.

218
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,718
Maybe, but if I've learned
anything from horror games,

219
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,138
it's that you never know when
something might pop out at you.

220
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,101
[YUZU laughs]

221
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,436
Uh‐huh. I agree.

222
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,107
What if there's a ghost or a
serial killer hiding in there?

223
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:57,110
Whoa! What are you
trying to do?

224
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,237
[YUZU]
Are you scared, Karirin?

225
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,572
[KARIN laughs]
Stop it, that tickles!

226
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,200
[gasps] Yuzu!

227
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,704
Don't run your hands
all over me like that!

228
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:10,623
[KARIN]
Uh. Cut it out!

229
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,167
[YUZU] How else am I
supposed to make sure?

230
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,836
[KARIN]
Make sure of what, exactly?

231
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,046
I need to make sure
that you're living.

232
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,090
You might turn out
to be a ghost, too.

233
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,967
I'm not, all right?

234
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,762
For the last time,
you're way too close!

235
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,389
But being up close and personal

236
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,725
is the best way to get
to know a person.

237
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,312
And I want to learn every last
detail about you, Karirin.

238
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,230
[KARIN]
Like, everything‐everything?

239
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,816
Um! Hold it, don't
touch me there!

240
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,859
[PAKAMERA whispering]

241
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,237
[gasps]

242
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,074
[KARIN grunts]

243
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,078
[PAKAMERA gasping]

244
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,375
[BOYS gasping]

245
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,628
[growls]

246
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,593
What's Karin doing
in here with us?

247
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,137
I'm pretty sure
this is men‐only.

248
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,724
But... perhaps I was mistaken.

249
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,187
[AKATSUKI]
We're dead.

250
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,901
[AKATSUKI] She's gonna turn
this bath into a blood‐bath.

251
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,119
[AKATSUKI whimpers]
Oh god.

252
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,330
My face is hurting
just thinking about it!

253
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,833
[ZAKURO] You're fine, Iride,
it's only a phantom pain!

254
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,543
He's traumatized.

255
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,297
I got it. Here.

256
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,967
Maybe if we leave with our hands
up and our backs turned...

257
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,514
...they'll settle for
half‐killing us.

258
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,765
Get a grip.

259
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,768
Do you think we're dealin' with
bank robbers or something?

260
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,561
[AKATSUKI]
Well, it's just as serious.

261
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,399
No. I'd say it's
even more serious.

262
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,150
And then, after our
blood spills out

263
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,403
and increases the iron
content of the water,

264
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,240
I'm guessing that'll make her
more powerful than ever before.

265
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,284
She'll wreak her havoc
upon the entire world.

266
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,287
It's hopeless. We need
another escape route stat.

267
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,748
But where?
The Pakameras'll spot us!

268
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,668
Oh man, if she somehow
finds out about this later,

269
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,753
she will definitely
want revenge!

270
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,089
Every single path leads
straight to despair!

271
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:23,965
Our lives are over!

272
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,718
[ZAKURO] Hey, what are
you doing over there?

273
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,887
[KAIKOKU]
Figured I might as well peek.

274
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,972
Ow!

275
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,391
[ZAKURO]
Really? You're such a disgrace!

276
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,477
Says the guy whose face is
as red as a lobster right now.

277
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,687
[ZAKURO]
That's nothing!

278
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,189
I'm just flushed because
I'm wearing a mask!

279
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,900
Take it off!
Chill out, ya sober shroom!

280
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,943
[ZAKURO]
What's that mean?

281
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,862
What do you think
it means, V‐neck boy?

282
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,488
[ZAKURO]
Don't call me names!

283
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,240
I do what I want!

284
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,575
[ZAKURO, ANYA]
Uh?

285
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,951
The point is...

286
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,995
Sneaking a peek would be fun,

287
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,664
but we have to decide whether
that single moment of joy

288
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,292
is worth a whole lifetime
of fear and pain.

289
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,836
It's all about making
a balanced decision.

290
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,629
That one moment.

291
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,965
[ZAKURO]
Versus a lifetime.

292
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,341
[ZAKURO]
No, we can't!

293
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,178
It's rude, and I'm pretty
sure it's a crime, too!

294
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,847
We can't stoop to doing
something so obscene.

295
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,765
Why would we even consider it?

296
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,018
But in this case,
it would be an accident.

297
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,478
Also true.

298
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,814
[KAIKOKU] We were already here
when those two came in.

299
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,901
Technically, the girls are
encroaching on our space.

300
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,903
Which means, if anyone's
being peeped on

301
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,321
in this situation, it's...

302
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,447
Yeah, it's us!

303
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,241
Okay, correct me if
I'm wrong, but, well,

304
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,953
if we do run into a problem
with Karin and Yuzu...

305
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,914
...it makes more sense
for <i>us</i> to get upset

306
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,707
and call <i>them</i> perverts!

307
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,959
Bingo.

308
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,002
[ANYA]
Huh?

309
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,171
[MAKINO snoring]

310
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,547
I know what to do.

311
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,217
We should all march over
like we own the place.

312
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,594
Then they won't have
a chance to get angry.

313
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,262
We'll beat them to the punch.

314
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,389
The first to strike wins!

315
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,688
[KAIKOKU]
It's about time we get out.

316
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,774
[ZAKURO]
Let's do it.

317
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,447
[ANYA]
Ouch!

318
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,949
Hey, who's in here?

319
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,243
[ZAKURO, KAIKOKU, ANYA, MAKINO]
Eek! Perverts!

320
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:20,122
[AKATSUKI] Okay, guys.
Let's get one thing clear.

321
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,501
No matter what we might see over
there, we're not responsible.

322
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,086
It was just an accident!

323
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:25,920
[BOYS grunt]

324
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,172
Good, time to make
our move, then.

325
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,382
[BOYS grunt]

326
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,928
[MAKINO snoring]

327
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,639
Here we go.

328
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,474
After you, buddy.

329
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,350
[ZAKURO]
I'll follow.

330
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,227
Right, you should take the lead.

331
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,604
Huh? I thought you'd want to.

332
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,815
[ANYA]
No way, man. I believe in you.

333
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,900
[ZAKURO]
And I'll volunteer for last.

334
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,486
[KAIKOKU] Second in line
is the most valuable spot.

335
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,862
[ANYA]
Valuable how?!

336
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,364
[AKATSUKI]
Can we stop this?

337
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,449
[ZAKURO]
Go ahead, the front's all yours.

338
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,410
[ANYA] Me? I should
be takin' up the rear!

339
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,412
[KAIKOKU]
Oh, no, I must insist <i>you</i> go.

340
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,538
[ANYA growls]

341
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,832
[KARIN]
Hey.

342
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,375
[ALL]
Uh!

343
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,964
What are you creeps
doing in here?

344
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,258
[AKATSUKI gasping]

345
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,510
[ANYA]
Gigantic.

346
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,053
Uh.

347
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,054
What's gigantic?!

348
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,097
[ANYA groaning]

349
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,141
[AKATSUKI]
Every man for himself!

350
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,976
[KARIN] I'll teach you to
never say such a thing

351
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,686
in my presence again!

352
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,645
[ANYA screaming]

353
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,523
Really? That's the thing
that set her off?

354
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,442
[screams]

355
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,654
Don't run from me!

356
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,658
[BOYS gasping]

357
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,038
[ALL gasping]

358
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,712
[AKATSUKI, KAIKOKU,
ZAKURO, ANYA screaming]

359
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,218
Sorry to keep you waiti‐‐

360
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,601
[HIMIKO]
Huh?

361
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,065
[HIMIKO gasping]

362
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,900
[screams]

363
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,784
[PAKA]
Well, would you look at that?

364
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,205
For some reason, the view
count is going ballistic.

365
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,665
Hmm...

366
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,376
Huh?

367
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,008
Afro.

368
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,718
Uh, it's me.

369
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,227
[ZAKURO] It sounded like
something he just blurted out,

370
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:49,897
but I wonder if it actually
means anything.

371
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,526
[PAKA]
Neigh...

372
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,153
[ZAKURO]
So it's nothing?

373
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,199
[ZAKURO sighs]
Okay, I know what a V‐neck is.

374
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,703
But maybe there's some
rude meaning I don't know.

375
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
[PAKA]
Neigh.

376
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,708
[ZAKURO]
Why would he call me that?!

377
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,793
[ZAKURO grunting]

378
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,760
What intel do they
have on me?

379
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,313

Oh, Oshigiri!

How's your morning go‐‐

388
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,082
[ZAKURO]
Where's Onigasaki?

389
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,002
I haven't seen him.

390

[panting]

391
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,466
[AKATSUKI]
Did something bad happen?

392
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,301
[ZAKURO]
I can't find him.

393
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,220
He's... gone.
