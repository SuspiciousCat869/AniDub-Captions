retrieve a new pelt

pass the time at night.

Well, that explains the bags.

Pretty much.

00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,704
Is that why you always act
like such an irritable jerk?

Yeah, pretty much!

Must've forgotten your makeup.

to infest the tower.

I considered setting them on
fire, but we're inside, so...

Instead we'll wait for sunset
and begin the eradication then.

It'll be the quickest, easiest
way to handle things.

give it a full syringe of this.

It can be dangerous
walking alone at night.

The best way to keep perverts
at bay is for a girl

to carry some of her
own personal poison.

You can't be too
prepared, right?

Absolutely, you've gotta
be able to defend yourself.

00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,765
I was just thinking,

313
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,017
that medication you said
you need to sleep?

314
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,893
[ANYA growls]

315
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,270
[AKATSUKI]
If you asked Paka about it,

316
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,064
I bet he could get some for you.

317
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,483
[ANYA]
Hell no! Ain't gonna happen.

318
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,027
Why would I ask the creep
who kidnapped us for a favor?

319
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,697
Fine, then let me
ask him for you.

320
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,615
[ANYA]
Mind your own damn business!

321
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,533
But‐‐

322
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,703
I don't want you asking
a favor from him either!

323
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,461
[AKATSUKI]
Hey, Paka.

324
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,174
You're watching this, right?
Can we talk in private later?

325
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,135
[PAKA]
As you wish, Mr. Iride.

326
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,806
[ZAKURO]
C'mon, man, don't do it.

327
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:18,019
Why not? It'd be a lot easier
if I take 'em both out.

328
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,314
[ZAKURO] Knock it off.
Aikawa's done nothing wrong.

329
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,732
If it were Kudou,
on the other hand...

330
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,484
I heard that!

331
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,778
[ZAKURO]
Doin' okay, Iride?

332
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,116
[ANYA] Bastard. I'm gonna beat
the hell out of you later.

333
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,785
Anyway, why is it even
active at night?

334
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,953
[ZAKURO]
Who knows?

335
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,540
Maybe it somehow saved up
enough energy during the day?

336
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,710
Makino. Karin!
I say Karin, you say‐‐

337
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,379
[ZAKURO] Don't even bother.
That's pointless.

338
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,255
[AKATSUKI]
Huh?

339
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,590
[ZAKURO]
Think about it.

340
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,927
Aikawa was fast asleep
when we picked the password!

341
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,847
[ANYA] Why didn't you
wake him up if you noticed?

342
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,184
[AKATSUKI] Wait. Do you think
it's actually sleeping?

343
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,187
Aww! I see that happen
on the train sometimes!

344
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,271
It's kinda sweet, huh?

345
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,272
It is not!

346
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,399
Can we just cut 'em
both down, already?

347
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,484
[ZAKURO]
Calm down!

348
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,194
Why is violence always
your first option?

349
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,779
[KAIKOKU]
Because I'm impatient!

350
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,782
[ANYA] What the hell?
They're both freakin' impostors!

351
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,910
[ANYA, KAIKOKU, ZAKURO
grunting, yelling]

352
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,704
[YUZU] Being restricted to
only the main facilities

353
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,207
turned out to be a
blessing in disguise.

354
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,625
It could only grow
in the hallways

355
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,960
since all the doors
were locked down.

356
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,586
Did you have enough
vials for them?

357
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,630
Yeah, and we've
still got five left.

358
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,675
Well, I've got plenty of
other plans for us to try.

359
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,302
We'll just have to see
what tomorrow brings.

360
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,279
[KARIN]
Hey, wake up. Hello?

361
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,742
[AKATSUKI gasping]
What is it? You okay?

362
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,744
[KARIN]
I've really gotta pee.

363
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,954
Uh.

364
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:05,418
Just come on! You have to!
We're supposed to stay in pairs!

365
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,254
[door creaks]

366
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:11,591
[KARIN] You really, really,
really, really better not leave!

367
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,759
Don't worry, I'm right here.

368
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,648
[AKATSUKI]
Great. Now I need to go.

369
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,368
Uh.

370
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,963
Y‐You really startled me.

371
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,841
But, Yuzu, you know this
is the men's room, right?

372
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,301
[laughs]

373
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,055
You okay? Huh?

374
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,348
[YUZU grunts]

375
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:05,895
[AKATSUKI gasps]

376
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,813
[YUZU]
Yep, right hand again.

377
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,814
Uh?

378
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,858
You clearly don't know this,

379
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,778
but Akki is functionally
ambidextrous.

380
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,238
Although exclusively left‐handed
throughout kindergarten,

381
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,450
he began to use his right
before elementary school.

382
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,202
Now, he writes with his left.

383
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,203
Chopsticks, left.

384
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,079
Handshakes, right.

385
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,497
Catching balls, right again.

386
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
Bats with either.

387
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,416
Turns faucets with left.

388
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,379
And when he raises a
defensive hand, it's his left.

389
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,215
But you just protected your
face with your right hand.

390
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,258
Oh. Did I now?

391
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,344
[YUZU] And you turned off
the faucet with it.

392
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,305
Communication, self‐defense,
the ability to lie.

393
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,933
You're a lot more advanced
than the other Maneaters.

394
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,229
Perhaps, could you be their
leader, the big boss of Stage 4?

395
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,855
[AKATSUKI]
Um. Yuzu?

396
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,775
It's really me. Akatsuki Iride.

397
00:19:52,817 --> 00:20:01,117
[YUZU laughs]

398
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,577
Hey. Don't even try.

399
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,621
Since I've dedicated
my entire life

400
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,665
to the tireless
observation of Akki.

401
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:13,379
Driven by love,
resentment, and curiosity.

402
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,922
If you want the truth,

403
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,592
I couldn't care less if you
turned out to be the real Akki.

404
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,220
I've always dreamed
of dissecting you.

405
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:25,349
Because that is how
much I love you.

406
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,394
Your outside, your inside.

407
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,729
Everything.

408
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,231
I want to study
every part of you.

409
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,275
Ah... I just...

410
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,362
I want to be the missing
component that completes you!

411
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,992
I only want to understand you,
so... what are you, anyway?

412
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,410
[AKATSUKI chuckles]

413
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:08,350
Thanks to you, my research
had a practical application.

414
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,895
That smile wasn't fair, though.

415
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,481
You almost made me hesitate.

416
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,706
[ZAKURO] Looks like they've
all withered to dust.

417
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,584
Guess that means
the poison did its job.

418
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,543
Yeah, forget that,

419
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,962
I wanna know what's
up with those two?

420
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,800
[YUZU whines]
I know it's dumb,

421
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,302
but I can't help but feel
a little guilty, you know?

422
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:46,388
Uh. No, what are you saying?

423
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,809
[YUZU]
It's fine.

424
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,437
The only thing that matters
is that you're okay.

425
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,523
Well, thank you for saying so.

426
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,069
[YUZU]
Oh, I should've just kissed

427
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,029
that dumb thing
before I stabbed it!

428
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,239
[KARIN]
Hmm?

429
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,708
Anya?

430
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,751
[ANYA]
Huh?

431
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,211
[ANYA gasps]

432
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:18,796
[gasps]
