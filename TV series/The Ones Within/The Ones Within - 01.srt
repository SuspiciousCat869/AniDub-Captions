1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,324
[YUZU]
Hmph.

2
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,373
[AKATSUKI]
Whoa.

3
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,542
What's that 'sposed to mean?

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,962
[grunting, sneezing]

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,724
What?

6
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,980
Uh?

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,987
Okay?

8
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,780
[AKATSUKI] Should you
find a collapsed person

9
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,283
first, call out to them.

10
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,202
Uh, miss? Hello?
Can you hear me?

11
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,078
[AKATSUKI]
Second,

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,123
check for a pulse and to
see if they're breathing.

13
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,127
[AKATSUKI] I'm gonna check
your neck for a pulse now.

14
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,545
Oh! Thank goodness, you're‐‐

15
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,840
[AKATSUKI groans]

16
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,384
[KARIN]
What are you doing? Pervert!

17
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,720
[AKATSUKI]
What? Hey, no, no, calm down.

18
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,806
Let's start over.
My name's Akatsuki Iride.

19
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,309
I swear I'm just a
harmless, regular guy.

20
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,935
[KARIN]
Oh, sure, <i>that's</i> convincing!

21
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,984
Boy, it sure would be nice
to know where we are.

22
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,030
[AKATSUKI] Yeah, I've definitely
been wondering that, too.

23
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,657
There's only one possibility
that makes much sense.

24
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,992
You <i>are</i> a pervert.

25
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,328
One who knocked me out
and brought me here.

26
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,079
Can you stop with
the speculation?

27
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,122
We're in the same boat.

28
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:05,334
The thing is, I've heard
your voice before.

29
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,336
I'm sure of it.

30
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,172
I have total and absolute
confidence in my memory.

31
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,551
Once I take something in,
I never forget it.

32
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,138
Well, still, let's find
a phone to call the police.

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,140
We don't wanna be here
when it gets dark.

34
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,433
There could be bears nearby‐‐

35
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,018
[thud]

36
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,144
[AKATSUKI gasps]

37
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,563
[KARIN gasps]

38
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,409
[KARIN]
Uh. Wha‐‐ Is that real?

39
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,371
Shh! I don't think
it's noticed us yet.

40
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,498
Let's just wait for it to pass.

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,462
[KARIN] We don't stand a chance
if that thing finds us.

42
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,214
[AKATSUKI]
Achoo!

43
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,469
[AKATSUKI, KARIN groan]

44
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,559
You idiot! Could you
seriously not hold that in?

45
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,145
I'm sorry, okay?
It's a little embarrassing,

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,272
but I'm pretty much allergic
to every type of pollen

47
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,315
there is in Japan.

48
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,318
Yeah, you're right! You should
be embarrassed by that!

49
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,782
[KARIN]
What the...?

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,790
[KAIKOKU grunts]

51
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,291
[KARIN, AKATSUKI]
Uh!

52
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,129
[KARIN]
That's... a huge rat.

53
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,880
[KAIKOKU]
Greetings, travelers.

54
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,007
Feel free to provide
a helping hand.

55
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,218
All you need to do
is smash its eyes.

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,511
[KARIN]
Huh?

57
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,513
[KAIKOKU]
Go for the eyes.

58
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,306
Stab or gouge them out.

59
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,809
It's a surprisingly obvious
fatal weakness.

60
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,519
Here, you're welcome
to use this.

61
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,812
[KARIN grunts]
What?

62
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,564
Why're you asking me to do this?

63
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,984
Because the boy should be able
to do it without a weapon.

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,989
[KARIN grunts] Why the hell are
you running off on your own

65
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,449
and leaving me behind?

66
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,618
[AKATSUKI] No! This is all
just a misunderstanding!

67
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,423
Hi there, big guy.

68
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,510
[sniffing]

69
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,513
[AKATSUKI]
Wow. Your face is enormous.

70
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,892
[KAIKOKU]
Hey! What are you doing?!

71
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,730
Oh! I can't help it,
I've gotta hug your paw!

72
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,274
Seriously, can you please
explain what you're doing?

73
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:35,442
[AKATSUKI]
It's a panda!

74
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,861
C'mon, haven't you always
wanted to pet one?

75
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,362
His fur is so soft!

76
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,656
It's just like a
comforting blanket!

77
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,741
That's comforting?!

78
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,659
[PANDA roars]

79
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,788
‐‐[KARIN] Uh?
‐‐[KAIKOKU gasps]

80
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,748
[PANDA roars]

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,460
See?! Idiot!

82
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:58,131
[PANDA roaring]

83
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,469
[KARIN, KAIKOKU gasping]

84
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,929
[PANDA]
Hm, hm, hm.

85
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,932
[AKATSUKI] Aw, buddy,
do you have allergies, too?

86
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,894
There's honestly nothin'
to be afraid of!

87
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,729
Did you notice his eyes earlier?

88
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,189
That whole time we were running?

89
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,526
He didn't look down
at us, not even once.

90
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,821
He's probably just out on an
afternoon stroll or something.

91
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,115
He was never actually chasing
after the two of us.

92
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:29,496
Isn't that right, Pantarou?

93
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:36,253
Well, I'm impressed.

94
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,588
That was highly observant
for such a frantic moment.

95
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,842
[PAKA]
How excellent. Truly splendid.

96
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,929
I wasn't expecting you to clear
the first stage so quickly.

97
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,931
It's a pleasure to meet you.

98
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,559
I officially supervise
the 13th Avenue

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,644
of "The Ones Within ‐‐ Genome."

100
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,896
I'm known by the name Paka.

101
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,107
Stage One was "Animal Battle."

102
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,485
Although, the traditional
method of clearing the level

103
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,489
and moving on is to defeat the
gigantic creatures pursuing you.

104
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,285
Mr. Iride, the escape game
Let's Player, surprised us.

105
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,955
I've never seen anyone attempt
to befriend the panda.

106
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,083
It's intriguing,
to say the least.

107
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,211
[PAKA] Untested methods
and new styles of play

108
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,881
have proven to draw in
and fascinate the hearts

109
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,801
of our audience, resulting in
a large surge of total views.

110
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,971
I'm expecting great
things from you.

111
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,139
Now then, everyone.

112
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,809
Please take a moment to
look at your left wrist.

113
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,440
[KARIN]
Huh?

114
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,900
Ew, what is this?

115
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,192
It won't rub off.

116
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,446
[PAKA] Those are epidermal
counter implants. We embedded

117
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,449
all of you with nanochips while
you were still unconscious.

118
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,452
They're directly linked with
the main server in the tower.

119
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,039
So the view count you're seeing
is displayed in real time.

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,666
[AKATSUKI] Wait, view count?
What do you mean?

121
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,500
[PAKA]
Come now.

122
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,420
Let's not pretend you're
unfamiliar with the term.

123
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,172
That goes for you two as well.

124
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,008
Sengoku Let's Player,
Mr. Onigasaki.

125
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,303
And horror Let's Player,
Ms. Sarayashiki.

126
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,222
Hey. I never told
any of you my name.

127
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,474
Who the hell are you?

128
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,517
Take off that mask
and show your face.

129
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:18,063
[PAKA] Oh, no thank you!
It's far too embarrassing!

130
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,861
[PAKA] I swear, you 13th Avenue
people are always so impatient.

131
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,614
Why don't I go ahead and
get straight to the point.

132
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,116
You're only required to
accomplish a single goal

133
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,869
while you're here: Make that
counter on your wrist

134
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,664
tick all the way
up to 100 million.

135
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,040
To be perfectly clear,

136
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,626
it's imperative that you
reach 100‐million views

137
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,629
during this live stream of
"The Ones Within ‐‐ Genome."

138
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,215
Furthermore, you have
an infinite amount of time

139
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,884
to reach this goal.
I urge each one of you

140
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,513
to play as if your very
life depends on it.

141
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,195
[PAKA]
Now that we're all comfy,

142
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,447
you might wanna go ahead
and introduce yourselves

143
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,158
to your fellow colleagues
in forced game play.

144
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,243
Starting at the first
desk by the window,

145
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:41,289
say your name and game specialty
in a nice, lively voice.

146
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,916
Okay! Hey, everyone!

147
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,544
I'm Akatsuki Iride!
I specialize in escape games!

148
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,256
I like nature, vacations, and
find animal paws adorable!

149
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,674
You're too happy!

150
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,219
[AKATSUKI] But the teacher
told us to be lively.

151
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,805
[KARIN] Yeah, he's also
the guy who abducted us!

152
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,057
Did you forget that we're
all in mortal danger, here?

153
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,892
[PAKA]
All right, next seat please.

154
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,478
Um. I'm Himiko Inaba.

155
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,730
I like farming and
nurturing games.

156
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,065
[PAKA]
I'm trying not to geek out,

157
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,901
but I'm actually a very loyal
follower of your entrancing,

158
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,362
soft‐spoken streams
and videos. As a fan,

159
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,365
it's a true honor and delight
to hear your voice in person.

160
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,868
Do you think you could possibly
whisper breathily into my ear?

161
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,873
Maybe something like "I love Mr.
Paka," y'know, nothing weird.

162
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:31,506
[PAKA] Sorry, but it's not
your turn yet, Mr. Kudou.

163
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,466
Screw your stupid introductions.

164
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,301
Just let us go free already.

165
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,012
[PAKA] I've already informed
you that any willful acts of

166
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,516
violence toward me are against
the official rules, Mr. Kudou.

167
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,852
If you keep this up,
you will be punished.

168
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,356
Go on and do your worst.
I wanna see you try it.

169
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,233
[PAKA] Starting tonight,
I would advise you

170
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,403
to be very cautious when
eating your meals.

171
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,114
I'm gonna load 'em up with
a ton of bell peppers.

172
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,199
[ANYA]
Is that all you got?

173
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,745
[PAKA] Right, and that utterly
charming fellow is Anya Kudou.

174
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,748
He's a Let's Player specializing
in fighting games.

175
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,792
I guess that makes me
the next one up.

176
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,460
Name's Yuzu Roromori.

177
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,881
I'm big into puzzle games.
Same with mazes and speed runs.

178
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,176
I like to spend my free time
researching tropical plants.

179
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,219
[AKATSUKI]
Yuzu? This is crazy.

180
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,264
You're the Yuzu from Rororo's
Speedrun Stream, aren't you?

181
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,765
It's me! Akki!

182
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,350
From the Hay Fever Stream.

183
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,561
[YUZU]
Whoa, hey, Akki!

184
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,772
Ha, ha! Oh, man, so you
got abducted too, huh?

185
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,274
Hang on, you know her?

186
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,234
Yeah! We hit it off last year

187
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,696
during a "Bury myself in leaves
at a park stream" I conducted.

188
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,865
[KARIN]
Okay, I've heard enough.

189
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,450
[sighs]

190
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,284
My turn.

191
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,911
Karin Sarayashiki.

192
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,954
My specialty is
horror Let's Plays.

193
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,915
If you don't like
that, get bent.

194
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,168
[PAKA laughs] You can't get much
cooler than Ms. Sarayashiki.

195
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,045
Thus, it should
come as no surprise

196
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,172
that a ton of people
want her to step on them.

197
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,340
I mean, you have such‐‐

198
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,800
[KARIN] Shut your snout or
I'll turn you into a fur coat.

199
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,761
[PAKA]
Next row, please.

200
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,304
[ZAKURO]
Zakuro Oshigiri.

201
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,847
I play stealth games.

202
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,434
Can we hurry and get this
dumb stunt over with?

203
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,519
[PAKA] Well, now, that
depends on how hard

204
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,230
you're each willing to work.

205
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,315
[ZAKURO] I've already figured
out that we're all streamers

206
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,651
who happened to Let's Play
"The Ones Within."

207
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,736
But I don't get
why you chose us.

208
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,280
And what comes after
a hundred million views?

209
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,990
What's your true objective?

210
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,326
[PAKA]
Uhh...

211
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,953
[ZAKURO]
Huh?

212
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,789
[PAKA]
Uhh...

213
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,584
[ZAKURO] So you're not gonna
spill your secrets so easily.

214
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,794
Uh, y'know, Zak.

215
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,463
I've got a feeling he's
just screwing with you.

216
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,423
I'm Kaikoku Onigasaki.

217
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,635
I tend to mostly play Sengoku
and Japanese history games.

218
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,345
Nice to meet you.

219
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,598
[PAKA] Thank you,
Mr. Onigasaki. Very lively.

220
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,474
[YUZU]
Hmph.

221
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,311
[PAKA] And last but not least,
we have Mr. Aikawa.

222
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,900
[AKATSUKI, HIMIKO, YUZU]
Hmm?

223
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,405
[MAKINO snoring]

224
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,157
[PAKA]
Wake up, Mr. Aikawa!

225
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,743
Fine. I guess
I'll introduce you.

226
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,037
His name is Makino Aikawa.

227
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,414
He's a dating‐sim player

228
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,251
who relies on his eyes to
conquer rather than his words.

229
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,962
However, as he is known
for his rather reserved

230
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,048
and tight‐lipped streams,
it's exceedingly rare for him

231
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,049
to speak at length.

232
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,135
[ANYA]
I wouldn't call that a stream!

233
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,720
[PAKA]
All right, well done.

234
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,555
You have all been
formally introduced.

235
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,433
Which means we can begin
the election for Stage 2.

236
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,060
Huh? Hold on.
You haven't explained.

237
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:35,940
[PAKA] Oh, Paka, Paka.
Stage 2. "Ouija Exchange."

238
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,567
Four players are needed.

239
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,235
You'll be drawing
from a set of straws

240
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,738
I stayed up rather
late making for you.

241
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,489
The people who happen
to draw the Paka straws‐‐

242
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,783
Screw your straws! Why don't
you shove 'em up your‐‐

243
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,412
[PAKA] What's that? Are you
saying that you wish to retire?

244
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,749
In that case,
you'd be disqualified.

245
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,168
Which means I'd have no
choice but to imprison you

246
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,255
in the "White Room" on the
lowest floor of Genome Tower.

247
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,216
You would remain alone until
the others finally reach

248
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,720
100 million views.
So you might spend eternity

249
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,223
waiting in that hidden,
silent, cramped room.

250
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,976
This is a young man from a
previous group of players who,

251
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,437
just like you,
complained too much.

252
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:17,357
The poor fool doesn't even
know that his friends failed,

253
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,733
and so he sits there.

254
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,277
Awaiting a rescue
that will never come.

255
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:25,281
Waiting and waiting and waiting.

256
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:29,952
[KAIKOKU grunts]

257
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,998
Too far. That was in
excessively poor taste.

258
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,416
Wouldn't you agree?

259
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,210
[PAKA]
One word of advice.

260
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,295
You would all do
well to comprehend

261
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,923
and respect the reality
of the situation

262
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,092
in which you're
currently involved.

263
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,636
Injury and death are
actual possibilities

264
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,014
because you're taking part
in a real‐life Let's Play.

265
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,558
You're familiar with how
the offline world works.

266
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,479
You know there aren't any
resets or save points.

267
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,441
[PAKA] Now then, let's get back
to the imperative process

268
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,652
of deciding the
players for Stage 2.

269
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,113
[AKATSUKI]
Paka?

270
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,408
Before you start, are we
allowed to volunteer to play?

271
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:19,127
Y'know. You're an
absolute idiot.

272
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,587
[ANYA] Really? I think
he's more of a dumb ass.

273
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,965
[AKATSUKI]
I just can't help my curiosity.

274
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,550
[KARIN]
Akatsuki Iridiot.

275
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,385
[ANYA]
Ya white‐haired whack job.

276
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,929
[AKATSUKI] Looks like we're
teamed up together again, Karin.

277
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,433
[KARIN] We were never on a team.
Gah, I've got the worst luck.

278
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,977
[ZAKURO] In any case,
we've got no choice now.

279
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,062
Yeah, let's get to it!

280
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,155
[ZAKURO]
Hey, what are you doing?

281
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,867
[ANYA sighs]
You think I'm gonna play along?

282
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,912
You're all idiots. I'm not doing
what that jerk tells me to do.

283
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,165
And who the hell plays
with Ouija boards?

284
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,459
Do I look like a
grade‐school brat?

285
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,378
[ZAKURO] No, but you
certainly act like one.

286
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,005
Huh?

287
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,383
Is it really that big of a deal?

288
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,217
‐‐[ANYA] Mmm?
‐‐[ZAKURO] Hm?

289
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:09,427
How about this?

290
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,888
You don't have to play with us,
just put your fingertip on it.

291
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,097
Please, we'd owe you big.

292
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,098
Hell no, dude.

293
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,852
Okay, what if I promise to eat
all of your peppers in exchange?

294
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,645
[ANYA gasping]

295
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,693
It's actually moving
on its own! So cool!

296
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,904
[ZAKURO] Do‐‐ Do any of
you know how this works?

297
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,740
Fess up. Come on, which
one of you's pushing it?

298
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,908
[KARIN]
Will you all shut up?

299
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,161
The spirit's trying
to tell us their wish.

300
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,579
[AKATSUKI, ANYA, KARIN, ZAKURO]
Wa...

301
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
...ter... Please.

302
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,500
Water?

303
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,877
[ZAKURO] Pretty sure I saw a
fountain in the hallway earlier.

304
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,045
[KARIN]
No, don't!

305
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,630
You can't just
remove your finger!

306
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,715
We have to do everything
in the proper order

307
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,842
or the spirit won't leave
and it'll possess you!

308
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,929
[ZAKURO gasping]
Oh.

309
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,057
Um, that vase is
within arm's reach.

310
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,272
[AKATSUKI] Yes. Heh!
Cool, I think that worked.

311
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,234
[KARIN] Huh. Wow. This is
easier than I expected.

312
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,027
[ZAKURO]
It's moving again.

313
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,074
[ALL]
It wants a friend?

314
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,035
[KARIN] Did this just suddenly
turn into life counseling?

315
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,204
[AKATSUKI] So it doesn't have
any friends?

316
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,248
[ZAKURO] Friends aren't
something you can just get.

317
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,666
You have to make them.

318
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,793
Spoken like someone
who doesn't have any.

319
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,670
[BOTH growling]

320
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,924
[KARIN growls] Enough already,
cut it out, you two.

321
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,050
[ANYA]
Shuddap, get off my case.

322
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,635
[KARIN]
Can you just chill? Seriously...

323
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,845
Well, I'll be your friend.
How's that sound?

324
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,222
My name's Akatsuki Iride.

325
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:37,139
[ZAKURO]
Leave her alone.

326
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,934
Whoa! What the hell
are you doing?

327
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,563
[AKATSUKI]
Cool, it said okay!

328
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,441
[KARIN growls]
Idiot! Dumb‐dumb!

329
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,319
Moron! Dumoron!

330
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,491
[ZAKURO]
One wish to go.

331
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,121
[ZAKURO]
A...

332
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,872
[ANYA]
...ka...

333
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,084
[KARIN]
...tsu...

334
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,294
[AKATSUKI]
...ki...

335
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,881
[KARIN]
What does it want us to do?

336
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,427
[AKATSUKI]
Uh.

337
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,638
[KARIN]
Hey. What's going on now?

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,140
Um. I'm, uh...

339
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,183
I feel like I'm being
pulled by something.

340
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,395
Uh! U‐Uh! I'm not doing this!

341
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,357
Okay, what do we do now?
Hey! Spooky occult girl!

342
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,067
[whimpers]

343
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,404
[growls] You're useless.

344
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,739
[groaning]

345
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,158
You listen! Just 'cause a
person likes horror games

346
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,659
doesn't mean they're
good with ghosts!

347
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,286
Some people enjoy
horror as a genre

348
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:41,621
but not when it happens to them!

349
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,623
But don't get me wrong,
I'm totally not scared!

350
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,249
[ANYA]
Uh. Right.

351
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,043
[AKATSUKI gasps]

352
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,297
[ANYA] Hey. Anybody know
what floor we're on?

353
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,007
Akatsuki!

354
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,187
[AKATSUKI] Behind you.
There's somebody there.

355
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,065
[ALL gasping]

356
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,984
[ALL whimper]

357
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,326
[KARIN screams]

358
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,411
[ZAKURO]
Wait. What? What's happening?

359
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,373
His ghost! He's already come
back from the dead to haunt us!

360
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,043
[AKATSUKI]
Oh, no, sorry. I'm still alive.

361
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,423
[ALL gasping]

362
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:38,052
[AKATSUKI sighs] Wow, that was
pretty intense, wasn't it?

363
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,388
I don't think my stomach's
ever dropped like that before!

364
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,848
[KARIN, ANYA]
Fall again!

365
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,141
[AKATSUKI gasps]

366
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,063
[ZAKURO]
Hm? What's up?

367
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,565
[AKATSUKI] Um, there's still
someone behind you.

368
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,775
[ALL gasp]

369
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,655
[ANYA] What the hell?
How'd you get in here?

370
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,964
Hello there.

371
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,635
[AKATSUKI]
You must be the spirit.

372
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,433
Well then,
it's nice to meet you.

373
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,186
What's your name? I hope you
don't mind me asking that.

374
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,321
Thank you for the water.

375
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,074
Of course, it was no problem.

376
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,538
Did you mean it?
You'll be my friend?

377
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,415
[AKATSUKI]
Sure I will.

378
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,625
[FEMALE SPIRIT]
I'm so glad.

379
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,004
Now, you have to come with me.

380
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,214
We can burn up together.

381
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,341
Won't you come with me?

382
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,178
All you have to do is die.

383
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,225
[FEMALE SPIRIT]
See?

384
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,729
You'll forget me
before too long.

385
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,360
[FEMALE SPIRIT]
You liar.

386
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,448
She's gonna burn
this place down!

387
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,285
[ZAKURO] Get away from her!
Iride! Snap out of it!

388
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,121
[FEMALE SPIRIT cries]

389
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,664
[AKATSUKI]
Mm?

390
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,666
[crying continues]

391
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,136
[crying continues]

392
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,472
[AKATSUKI]
We really can be friends.

393
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,098
[FEMALE SPIRIT gasps]

394
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,938
[AKATSUKI]
I mean it.

395
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,774
But I just can't go
with you right now.

396
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,070
[AKATSUKI] I've never
broken a single promise

397
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,447
that I've made in
my life, though.

398
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:10,454
As soon as everything's over,

399
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,456
I promise you.

400
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,270
Hey, good morning, Kudou.
Ya sleep well?

401
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,147
Look, don't be weird.
Just call me Anya, all right?

402
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,859
Uh. Himiko!

403
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,026
Uh?

404
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,030
[AKATSUKI] So the rest
of you were on standby

405
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,532
in the theater while we played?

406
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah. I'm really glad
you all made it out okay.

407
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,083
[HIMIKO]
Uhh...

408
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,378
Quit staring,
or you can eat them.

409
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,505
[HIMIKO]
Uh...

410
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,549
Doesn't this seem
kinda strange to you?

411
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,968
Clearing it was so simple.

412
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,680
I swear, you better
not lose that.

413
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,725
I am not going
through that again.

414
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,979
And also, I guess
I should apologize.

415
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,064
Really? For what?

416
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,817
Y'know, for punching you
when we first met.

417
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,527
[AKATSUKI]
Oh. Don't worry about it.

418
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:24,987
You mean you're not mad?

419
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,196
[AKATSUKI]
Not the slightest bit.

420
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,907
I would be.

421
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,830
Honestly. It's pretty rare

422
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,416
that I let anything
actually upset me.

423
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,254
[KARIN]
Are you serious? I knew it.

424
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,673
You're a freakin'
weirdo after all.
