1
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,604
[HIMIKO]
No way! I refuse to do it!

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:22,606
I can't abandon
this precious baby.

3
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,566
I promise I can
take care of him myself!

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,859
Ohh!

5
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,737
No way in hell! Say what you
want, but I know the rest of us

6
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,073
are gonna end up being
responsible for him, too!

7
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,115
[PUNITSUKI chirps]

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,702
That creepy little blob won't
stop hiding in my bike helmet!

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,162
[coos]

10
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,706
[ANYA] I wake up to that
thing every morning!

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,416
It's enough to traumatize ya!

12
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,335
[HIMIKO] Don't worry,
I've been training him!

13
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:45,170
See, he can already
hold out his hand!

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,548
Come here, Punitsuki,
show him your trick‐‐

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,757
[ANYA yelps]

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,051
[ANYA]
That's it, now I'm angry!

17
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,302
[HIMIKO]
Sorry, that time was a fluke!

18
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,470
[ANYA]
I'll teach that slug a lesson!

19
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,223
Wow. What an exciting morning.

20
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,349
[ANYA, HIMIKO shouting]

21
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,850
[AKATSUKI]
Definitely!

22
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,158
[HIMIKO] Kudou doesn't
want to let me keep him.

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,159
It's not fair!

24
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,118
[YUZU]
Why not?

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,496
[ANYA]
Say something to her, would ya?

26
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,830
[AKATSUKI]
Hm? To who?

27
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,415
You know, the tiny one.

28
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,668
I can't get her to listen
to a word I say.

29
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,795
[AKATSUKI] I'm happy you two
have been getting along.

30
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,006
Like hell we have!
Things are worse now!

31
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,299
[ANYA exhales]

32
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,385
[GIRLS chattering]

33
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,513
I'm not sure how I
feel about this idea.

34
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,434
[HIMIKO] You see.
I killed my big brother.

35
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,031
[ANYA] What do you
mean you "killed" him?

36
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,411
[HIMIKO]
I apparently had a sibling.

37
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,121
[ANYA]
Hm?

38
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,330
[HIMIKO]
I was just a baby,

39
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,750
so I don't even remember
his face or his voice.

40
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,794
Then how could you have?

41
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:36,717
[HIMIKO] They said he was put
up for adoption because of me.

42
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,138
My parents told me that it had
to be done for my protection.

43
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,807
A few years later, I checked
the family registry

44
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,519
and found out my brother went
missing after being adopted.

45
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,313
Whenever a person's been
missing for seven years,

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,317
the government sends out a
death certificate for them.

47
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,738
Which means my brother
is officially dead.

48
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,243
Why did they only protect me?

49
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,457
[HIMIKO] It's my fault.
I killed my brother.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,378
Freakin' ridiculous.
That stupid bean sprout.

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,922
Huh? Do you not like <i>natto</i>?

52
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,970
[PAKA]
For your seventh challenge,

53
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:24,598
you will be playing
hide‐and‐seek.

54
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,391
[PLAYERS]
Uhh...

55
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,768
[ANYA]
That's kid stuff!

56
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,853
[ZAKURO] Kind of odd,
at this point in the game.

57
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,521
[PAKA]
Oh dear, it sounds like you have

58
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,356
no idea what you're in for.

59
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,233
All right, then tell us.

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,986
[PAKA] Well, it's
basically hide‐and‐seek.

61
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,616
But it's not the innocent
childhood game you remember.

62
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,909
[ALL gasp]

63
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,705
[ALL laughing nervously]

64
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,291
[PAKA]
Meet the Curse‐Stealing Sisters.

65
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,753
Right to left:
Misery, Isabella, and Carrie.

66
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,923
Your objective is to keep
from being detected.

67
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,301
You may only hide here
on the sixth floor.

68
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:04,471
However, the hallway and any
of your personal quarters

69
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,097
are fair game.

70
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,390
[whimpering]

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,351
[PAKA]
Now, as you can see.

72
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,812
These three young ladies
are quite well‐mannered,

73
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,439
so they will generally
wander the area quietly

74
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,441
and keep to themselves.

75
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:22,030
But when I produce a sound
above a certain frequency...

76
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,741
...they've been known to
become awfully rambunctious.

77
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,117
[laughs]

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,369
[ALL gasp]

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,787
[PAKA]
No need to be alarmed,

80
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,206
they'll only give you
a silly little curse.

81
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,040
[ALL gasping]

82
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,459
[PAKA] The first time,
they'll take away your sight.

83
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,628
Get caught a second time,
and your eyeballs

84
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,756
will be ripped clean
out of their sockets.

85
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,175
I'm sure you won't die, though.

86
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,680
[PAKA] As of this moment,
floor six is sealed off.

87
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,431
And, naturally,
the locks on all eight

88
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,518
of your bedroom doors are
no longer functional.

89
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,522
[PAKA] After the game begins,
it will be up to you

90
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,859
to choose a room for your hiding
place and successfully evade

91
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,610
the three weird sisters
and their curse

92
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,863
for an entire 60 minutes.

93
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,198
Every quarter hour,
I'll ring the bell,

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,200
which will cue the girls
to begin their search

95
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,912
of whatever room is in closest
proximity at that moment.

96
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,664
It's almost like we're
playing Russian roulette

97
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,292
with a three‐in‐eight
chance of losing,

98
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,669
and we have to survive
four rounds in total.

99
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,798
[PAKA] Yes, you're exactly
right. Additionally...

100
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,092
In order to be victorious
in this challenge,

101
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,635
there mustn't be a
single one of you

102
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,513
marked by the curse
when the clock runs out.

103
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,347
That is to say,

104
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,392
all players must be
perfectly healthy.

105
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,394
Now then, I hope you're
ready to begin

106
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,688
this game of cat‐and‐mouse.

107
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,657
[YUZU] This is a problem.
What should I do?

108
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,827
My panties are drying
in my room!

109
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,330
What a humiliating predicament!

110
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,707
How can you even worry
about that right now?

111
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,626
In seven minutes,
the Trio of Psychos

112
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,377
is gonna come in
and murder us all!

113
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,463
You sure that's what
they were called?

114
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,632
Look, if you're really that
terrified, you should

115
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,677
hide better. The first part is
a game of luck anyway, so.

116
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,930
[HIMIKO]
Luck? What do you mean?

117
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,058
[YUZU] Hm? Well, as soon as one
of them walks into the room,

118
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,893
we'll be one level of cursed.

119
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,062
What makes this difficult is
that we can't get cursed

120
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,105
a second time,
no matter what happens.

121
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,440
[KARIN whimpers]

122
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,361
And in order to achieve
such a thing...

123
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,196
[PAKA]
I know what you're thinking.

124
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,198
It's a tall order
for all eight of you

125
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,575
to make it through
this trial unscathed.

126
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,411
So, allow me to explain
the rescue rule.

127
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,038
[ALL]
Huh?

128
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,123
[ZAKURO] If you find a player
who's managed to avoid

129
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,002
being cursed, touching them
will remove your curse.

130
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,508
[ZAKURO] But will I be able
to touch those three girls?

131
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,095
Of course. If it comes
down to it, I can!

132
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,304
Still, though!

133
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,806
Practicing your grope?

134
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:57,352
[ZAKURO gasps] No! I'm mentally
preparing myself for this game!

135
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,938
[sighs] Yeah,
that's totally normal.

136
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,232
Any reason you're in my room?

137
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,400
[ZAKURO]
Why not?

138
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,152
We're allowed to hide in any
room we want, aren't we?

139
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,779
Yeah, but statistically
speaking,

140
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,615
our chances will be better
if we all separate.

141
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,910
[PAKA] The top contender
for the White Room

142
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,038
is currently Mr. Onigasaki.

143
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,000
[ZAKURO gasps]

144
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,921
[ZAKURO]
Onigasaki.

145
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:25,964
[KAIKOKU]
Hm?

146
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,425
[ZAKURO] Try not to be alone
if you can help it.

147
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,676
Why not?

148
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,052
[ZAKURO]
Just because.

149
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,513
Ah. Scared to be
by yourself, huh?

150
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,473
[ZAKURO]
It's not about me!

151
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,492
[MAKINO]
What a pain.

152
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,956
[ANYA] So we're s'posed
to meet in your room

153
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,916
for the last 15 minutes, right?

154
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,544
Yup. If we have a designated
place that's safe,

155
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,464
then we can fix everyone's
curses at once.

156
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,216
[YUZU] The bell should
ring every 15 minutes.

157
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,011
We can pass two,
but round three is key.

158
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,013
We'll be fine as long
as at least one of us is

159
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,182
curse‐free going
into the final bit.

160
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,017
When the bell rings for
the fourth time‐‐

161
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,605
that's the biggest gamble,
'cause we'll all be together.

162
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,692
So it's a three‐in‐eight chance,
three times. Can we do it?

163
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,486
[AKATSUKI]
I dunno.

164
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,362
I'm just glad you
took your medicine.

165
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,157
It'd be bad if you passed
out during this one.

166
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,575
[ANYA]
True.

167
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,331
Wow, this takes me back.

168
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,625
I haven't played hide‐and‐seek
in like two months!

169
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,794
What are you, six years old?

170
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,964
[AKATSUKI]
Just 30 more seconds.

171
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:02,268

[snoring]

176
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,656
[PAKA]
How unfortunate.

177
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,617
Talk about a rocky start.

178
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,662

[ZAKURO]
That's Sarayashiki!

182
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,014
That means all the
girls have been cursed.

183
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,057
Things are looking bleak now.

184
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,229
[ZAKURO gasps]

185
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,230
Oh, no!

186
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,400
Peekaboo, I found you!

[KAIKOKU grunts]

That won't help you at all.

[ISABELLA laughs]

192
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,961
[HIMIKO]
It's so dark.

193
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,672
Karin? Yuzu?

194
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,592
Are you guys in here?
I can't see a thing!

195
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,761
[YUZU] Don't worry.
I'm right next to you.

196
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,264
[HIMIKO]
Hm? Yuzu! Thank goodness!

197
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,267
[YUZU] It appears you and I
were cursed right off the bat.

198
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,435
[HIMIKO]
Huh?

199
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,979
[YUZU] Plunged into
an endless darkness.

200
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,358
I guess this is the fate of
those who are discovered.

201
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,360
You know, it might
be my imagination,

202
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,987
but my head kinda feels
heavier than normal.

203
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,156
What a coincidence. Mine too.

204
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,367
It must be a side
effect of the curse.

205
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,451
Side effect?

206
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:26,704
[gasps] Okay, we should
find Karirin!

207
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,956
Oh, yeah, you're right!

208
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,125
She's been so quiet,
it worries me! Come on!

209
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,046
[YUZU]
Uh?

210
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,298
Hm...?

211
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,760
Oh my god.
What is this softness?

212
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,930
Karirin, is that you?
Dammit, what happened to you?

213
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,181
Answer me!

214
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:49,352
Ooh, you're so irresistibly
squishy! Karirin!

00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,021
[ANYA laughing]

216
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:56,109
Aw man, I wish you could see
how goofy you look right now!

217
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,860
‐‐Two masks!
‐‐[ZAKURO] Shut your mouth.

218
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,070
Talk about a relief.

219
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,239
I was hoping you'd be
able to help us out.

220
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,407
Take the curse off.

221
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,243
[AKATSUKI]
Uh, that's just a Pakamera.

222
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,538
Let's see. All I do
is touch it, right?

223
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:17,088
Oh, hey, I'm as good as new.
That rescue rule's a lifesaver.

224
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,882
Heh! Anya, did you see
that? He talked to a‐‐

225

[ANYA laughing]
Dude, how do you even breathe

226
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:26,014
with all that crap on your face?

227
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,558
Ahh. Whoo, I'm about
to die laughin'.

228
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,935
[ZAKURO] Oh, you'll die,
but you won't be laughing.

[ZAKURO]
Onigasaki!

231
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,566
[ZAKURO]
I'm concerned.

232
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,652
That three‐in‐eight chance
is worse than we thought.

233
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,738
If we don't keep
everyone's curses lifted,

234
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,906
then we'll be wiped
out in no time.

235
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,159
So it is better if we split up.

236
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,411
You two should go find
somewhere to hide.

237
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,996
[ZAKURO]
Wait a second.

238
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,918
Somebody's overprotective.

239
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,545
I'm fine.

240
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,549
Huh?

241
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,592

[KAIKOKU]
All clear.

245
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,791
[KAIKOKU]
Roro sure is disorganized.

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,010
[KAIKOKU]
Judging by the angles,

247
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,763
these photos were
taken by Pakameras.

248
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,231
[KAIKOKU] This is a picture
of Roro and Iride.

249
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,066
But why?

250
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,653
Uh! Whoops.

251
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,745
[ANYA grunts]
Dammit!

252
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,249
Shit, it won't come off!

253
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,251
I knew we shouldn't
have switched rooms!

254
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,877
[AKATSUKI]
I know, right?

255
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,046
Now we need to find
somebody who can lift the‐‐

256
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:25,466
Uh. Ahh! Ow...

257
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,594
Bet that hurt.

258
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,556
Anyway. If I'm not mistaken.

259
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,474
I'm pretty sure I heard
that occult chick scream

260
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,269
the first time, so that must
mean all the girls are out.

261
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,522
If Onigasaki found a way to get
Oshigiri to go lift the curse,

262
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,692
it should be all right.
I wonder, though.

263
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,860
[ANYA]
I ain't goin'.

264
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,819
Huh?!

265
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,239
Whatever happens, I can't let
mask‐boy see me like this.

266
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,450
[AKATSUKI] That's kinda what
you get for making fun of him

267
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,994
before though. Guess that means

268
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,497
I'll have to be the one
to go call for help then.

00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,552
Now what's up?

[AKATSUKI]
Anya, she's here.

00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,180
Huh?

00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,140
[AKATSUKI whispers] She's right
in front of the door.

We're in trouble.

00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,775
If she figures out
where we are this time,

278
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,986
she's gonna gouge
out our eyeballs.

00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,029
We're screwed!

Come out.

00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,978
Come out.

[MISERY grunts]

289
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,186
I think she's leaving now.

290
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,188
Don't you move a muscle.

Ah... Ah... Achoo!

Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

Akatsuki.

[AKATSUKI]
Yeah?

297
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,654
[ANYA]
You couldn't'a held that in?

298
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,656
[AKATSUKI]
I'm sorry

[bell rings]

300
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,453
[YUZU]
Everyone all right?

301
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,872
We ran into some trouble,
so if you could un‐curse us,

302
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,165
that'd be great.

303
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,335
Wish I could, but they
discovered me and Anya too.

304
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,421
Same here. I apologize for
letting you guys down.

305
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,422
[ZAKURO]
Me, too.

306
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,923
[ANYA]
They caught you again?

307
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,758
[ZAKURO]
Excuse me?

308
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,010
How many times are you
gonna let 'em curse ya?

309
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,595
[ZAKURO]
You're one to talk, idiot!

00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,721
What, me?!

311
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,474
They found us once, we
dodged 'em in two rounds!

312
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,517
[ZAKURO] Once, twice,
there's no difference!

313
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,645
[ANYA] Are you kidding me?
You're crazy!

314
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,812
[ZAKURO]
No way, you're crazy!

315
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,941
Wait. So is there nobody left
who can lift the curse, then?

316
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,986
[ALL]
Uhh...

317
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,907
There's no way
they got all of us!

318
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,950
[ZAKURO]
Hang on. What about Aikawa?

319
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,785
Right, of course.

320
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,120
I can't believe we almost
forgot sweet MakiMaki!

321
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,122
[screams] Okay, who touched me?

322
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,625
Ahh! Hey, let go of my hair!

323
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,919
Whoever's hand that was,
you are freakin' dead!

324
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,713
[ZAKURO]
Ouch! That's my, uh, stop!

325
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:40,054
[PLAYERS shouting]

326
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,808
Um. Please stop fighting
before somebody gets hurt, okay?

327
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,184
[whimpering]

328
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,688
Ah! Oh my gosh, who
is that, leave me alone!

329
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,231
Himiko.

330
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,357
[HIMIKO gasps]

331
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,025
Aikawa!

332
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,402
[MAKINO]
Are you okay?

333
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,319
Uh‐huh!

334
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,904
[AKATSUKI]
Gosh. I hope that piece of hair

335
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,198
doesn't stop sticking up now.

336
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,117
At least it didn't get
pulled out, though.

337
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,493
Uh?!

338
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,957
Aw, thanks, but can you
tell me who you are?

339
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,753
Hey there, Makino!
So you didn't get cursed!

340
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,171
MakiMaki's here?

341
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,048
[AKATSUKI]
Where did you end up hiding?

342
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,050
In my room.

343
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,928
Sleeping, but I got stuck.

344
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,304
[AKATSUKI]
What does that mean?!

345
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,265
You're our hero, MakiMaki!

346
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,351
Hurry up! Gimme a big
hug so I can see ya!

347
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,396
[KAIKOKU] Ugh, don't scare
the poor guy off.

348
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,981
[ZAKURO]
Glad you're safe, Aikawa.

349
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,150
Yeah, it sure took ya
long enough, Makino.

350
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,735
[ANYA, ZAKURO grunt]

351
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,989
[ZAKURO]
Not you!

352
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,116
The feeling's mutual, pal!

353
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,911
[AKATSUKI] This next round
is the last one, right?

354
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,206
[KARIN] No matter what we do,
the whole thing's based on luck.

355
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,708
[ANYA] Feels like
it's the riskiest game

356
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,793
we've played so far.

357
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,837
[AKATSUKI]
I'm sure we'll be okay.

358
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,505
[PLAYERS]
Hm?

359
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:00,217
Don't worry.
They won't find us here.

360
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,928
Huh? And how do you know that?

361
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,431
I just kind of... know.

362
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,891
Huh?!

363
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,602
The final round of hide‐and‐seek
begins in one minute.

364
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,728
Uh?!

365
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,401
[YUZU]
Thirty seconds to go.

366
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,115
Ten more seconds.

367
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,201
Nine, eight,

368
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:29,121
seven, six, five, four,

369
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:32,500
three, two, one.

[PAKA]
♪ Ding, dong, ding, neigh! ♪

371
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,310
You've reached the end of the
game with zero cursed players,

372
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,938
which means Stage
Seven is cleared.

373
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,481
Please send a representative

374
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,191
to the first floor
so that you may

375
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:00,027
receive Chromosome Zero‐Six.

376
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,323
[PAKA]
Both their view count

377
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,701
and their progress through
challenges are commendable.

378
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,703
What's most impressive
is that, so far,

379
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,415
no player on the team
has been left behind.

380
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,211
In which case...
I believe it's about time.
