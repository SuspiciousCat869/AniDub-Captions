1
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,186
[PAKA]
A hearty breakfast.

2
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,563
For after the
medicine wears off.

3
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:23,857
[KAIKOKU]
Medicine...?

4
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,068
[PAKA]
Anesthetic. Just a precaution,

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,029
as I'd rather not suffer
any further attacks from you.

6
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,157
[PAKA]
Anyway, I'll be keeping you

7
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,451
here in the White Room
until your team reaches

8
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:36,495
a hundred million views.

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,959
[PAKA] That's the ID bracelet
we use for you dropouts.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,504
Makes it easier to
identify your corpse.

11
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,131
Any questions for me?

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,883
[inaudible]

13
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,344
[PAKA] Sorry, my boy,
you'll have to speak up.

14
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,266
[PAKA]
What are you, a junkyard mutt?!

15
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,810
[KAIKOKU] What'dya do
to my damn grandpa...?

16
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,271
[PAKA] I believe you're
overestimating me.

17
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,023
I can do a great many things,
but controlling life and death

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,608
is not one of them.

19
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:13,115
[PAKA] I'll leave you to get
settled now, Mr. Onigasaki.

20
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,033
Pleasant nightmares.

21
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,887
[PAKA]
Ah.

22
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,724
[PAKA]
It seems like everywhere I turn,

23
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,976
there's another
confrontation waiting.

24
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,562
[ANYA] Shut up!
What did you do with Oni?!

25
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,856
[PAKA] Unfortunately,
Mr. Onigasaki violated

26
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,359
yet another taboo last night.

27
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,946
He invaded Floor 51 and
attempted to assault me.

28
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,531
The ruffian nearly
slit my throat

29
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,491
with that frightful
blade of his.

30
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,536
Such behavior is a hindrance
to our fun gaming atmo‐‐

31
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,039
[ZAKURO ] That's bullshit!
You probably pushed him to!

32
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,375
[PAKA]
I did nothing of the sort.

33
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,002
But I do wonder what could
have possibly inspired him

34
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,547
to take such drastic actions.

35
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,134
[PAKA] In any case, you'll
be completing the games

36
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,302
with seven players from
this point forward, so‐‐

37
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,429
I'm out.

38
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,056
‐‐[gasps]
‐‐[GROUP gasping]

39
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,017
[PAKA] Out? What do
you mean, Mr. Iride?

40
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,021
This is a protest.
You need to bring Kaikoku back.

41
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,150
'Cause until he's here,
I'm not playing anything.

42
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,568
[PAKA stammering]

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,070
Th‐This is so
unlike you, Mr. Iride!

44
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,656
You've always been such
an enthusiastic participant‐‐

45
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,700
so devoted to every game!

46
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,618
Don't tell me I'll be
forced to banish you to

47
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,704
the dreaded White Room as well!

48
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,872
I'm fine with it.

49
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,623
Besides, if you do,
then at least I'll be able

50
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,917
to keep him company.

51
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,127
[ZAKURO]
Iride...

52
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,963
I never liked listenin'
to you, anyway.

53
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,299
If Akatsuki's out, so am I.

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,011
Same goes for me.
This is too one‐sided.

55
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,138
[YUZU]
Here's an idea, Mr. Alpaca.

56
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,183
Why don't you postpone the
next challenge for a while?

57
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,186
We're all distraught over
what happened to Kai.

58
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,729
Even if you did make us play,

59
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,690
it wouldn't produce the
results you're looking for.

60
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,903
To be quite honest, even I'm
displeased with your decision.

61
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,780
[PAKA]
Hmm...

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,456
[KAIKOKU]
What do you think about Iride?

63
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:53,877
I'm asking you because
I'm suspicious of him.

64
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,837
[AKATSUKI]
Oshigiri.

65
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,005
[ZAKURO]
Oh, hey.

66
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,257
You should probably
eat something soon.

67
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,844
Take this! Himiko and the
others whipped up some lunches.

68
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,095
Karin made these mushrooms

69
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,722
with the meat
wrapped around them,

70
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,266
and that cute pink stuff
was Yuzu's creation!

71
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,103
[AKATSUKI] Oh, and I put the
seaweed on the panda rice balls.

72
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,272
Aren't they the greatest?

73
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,275
[ZAKURO] Sorry. I didn't
mean to worry everyone.

74
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,573
[ZAKURO]
Look.

75
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:24,783
[AKATSUKI]
Yeah?

76
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,201
[ZAKURO]
I hate to ask you this,

77
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,329
but you guys are on
our side, aren't you?

78
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,539
Ah?

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,209
[ZAKURO] Uh, never mind.
Just forget I said that.

80
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,007
You know what?
I really like you, Oshigiri.

81
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,717
I want to be on
your side forever.

82
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,179
Don't you worry.

83
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,557
We'll be back to
eight players real soon.

84
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,558
[ZAKURO grunts]

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,851
[PAKA]
Emergency notice!

86
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,229
Everyone, gather on
the first floor immediately.

87
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,733
[PAKA] For the next 72 hours, I
will afford you an opportunity

88
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,611
to rescue your
missing team member.

89
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,655
You can unlock the path
to the White Room

90
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,366
by deciphering a six‐digit code.

91
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,786
Without even a hint?
That'd take a million guesses.

92
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,621
[PAKA chuckles]
Behold.

93
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,084
[PAKA] Stage Eight is aptly
entitled "White Puzzle."

94
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,212
The hint is on one of
these 30,000 pieces.

95
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,631
Your job is to find the lonely
piece that doesn't fit in

96
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,216
with its friends.

97
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,512
[PAKA] Do you know why
I decided to give you a puzzle

98
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,265
for today's challenge,
Ms. Roromori?

99
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,018
[PAKA]
So that, for once in your life,

100
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,228
you will understand your place.

101
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,148
Hey! Lay off!
What's your beef with Yuzu?

102
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,233
It's fine, Anboy.

103
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,569
Let's get started,
the clock's ticking.

104
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,087
[ZAKURO]
It's her name.

105
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,300
What if Sakura's still here?
In the dungeons?

106
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,554
[KAIKOKU]
I can't let Oshigiri see this.

107
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,226
[KAIKOKU]
Hmm?

108
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,156
[gasps]
Where's this go?

109
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,498
[KAIKOKU]
A breeze..?

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,921
[KAIKOKU]
Is anyone down here?

111
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,848
Look. They've all got
numbers on the back.

112
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,518
[AKATSUKI] And they're six
digits, just like the passcode!

113
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,687
[KARIN] So the correct answer
must be on whatever piece

114
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,022
doesn't belong in the puzzle.

115
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,775
[ANYA] We're really gonna
put this whole thing together?

116
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,611
Wouldn't it be faster to
try each code one by one?

117
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,238
You'd think so, but no.

118
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,073
It'd be less efficient
since only one of us

119
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,574
could do it at a time.

120
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,410
Plus, it's always
possible we might input

121
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,078
a number incorrectly.

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,413
That's true,
and for all we know,

123
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,707
this puzzle could be
missing a few pieces.

124
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,668
I mean seriously, all of them
look practically identical.

125
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,420
[YUZU]
Oh, don't worry about that.

126
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,673
Look what happens with these
corner and border pieces.

127
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,467
[AKATSUKI]
Whoa! They stuck together!

128
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,387
The seam and the numbers
on the back disappear, too.

129
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,597
So it's impossible
to make a mistake.

130
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,392
Guess we should roll up
our sleeves and solve it, then.

131
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,352
That's what I recommend.

132
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:43,064
But, there's no need to
complete the entire thing.

133
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,109
Assuming it's a
200 by 150 piece‐puzzle,

134
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,071
the outer border and corner
pieces should total 696.

135
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,614
If they add up to that
when we count them,

136
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,617
we know we're looking
for an inside piece.

137
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,996
That leaves 29,305.

138
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,041
So we'll have to narrow
those down little by little.

139
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,627
Let's start by sorting corners,
borders, and insides.

140
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,967
[KAIKOKU grunts softly]

141
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,099
Whew. Took long enough.

142
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,688
I can't get over how quickly
Yuzu figured that out.

143
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,107
What is she,
some kind of genius?

144
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,110
I only know a little about
her from our online chats,

145
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,862
but I think she skipped
a grade or two and finished

146
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,406
her master's in another country.

147
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,742
She has a job at a lab
doing plant research,

148
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,119
both as a hobby and
as a source of income.

149
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,330
Weird that she's here with us.

150
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:43,374
[KARIN] Hmm. Forget what
kind of person she is,

151
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,794
now I want to know
how old she must be!

152
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,630
[AKATSUKI] It's my policy
to never ask a lady's age.

153
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,969
[YUZU huffs]

154
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,058
[KAIKOKU sighs]

155
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,943
[KAIKOKU] There's people
living here, no doubt about it.

157
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,033
What's that for?

158
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,079
[KAIKOKU]
Aren't you an ugly bunch?

159
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,622
[CHIHIRO]
Who the hell are you?!

160
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,041
And you better
tell us the truth!

161
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,334
[KAIKOKU]
When asking someone's name,

162
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,878
it's polite to give them
your own name first.

163
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,255
[CHIHIRO]
Huh? Where do you get off,

164
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,714
tellin' me what to do?

165
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,841
[NANAMI]
Hiro.

166
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,259
[KAIKOKU]
Huh.

167
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,556
And I'd like you
to take off that mask

168
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,977
while you're at it. Hiro.

169
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,938
[CHIHIRO grunts] Listen,
I wasn't wearing that thing

170
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,731
'cause I wanted to!

171
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,108
[NANAMI]
Oh, dear.

172
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,278
Here we go. Just ignore him.

173
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,281
Hiro here may be an idiot,
but he's harmless.

174
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,991
You can call me Nanami.

[NANAMI]
Pardon me.

178
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,920
I don't mean you
any harm, either.

179
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,978
[ZAKURO]
I'm here for a reason,

180
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,314
and I'm not gonna
let my search end.

181
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,566
I have to find my sister.

182
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:32,984
[KAIKOKU]
Who's there...?

183
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,903
Oshigiri...?

184
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,198
[KAIKOKU gasps]

185
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,699
You're Sakura!

186
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:43,077
Yeah, that's my name.
But who are you?

187
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,247
Heh! No way!

188
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,333
Ah! Get away from her!

189
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,794
Are you okay, Sakura?!
This creep is not to be trusted!

190
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,379
[SAKURA]
Relax, Hiro.

191
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,797
Don't go near him.

192
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,133
He'll do something inappropriate
if you get too close.

193
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,302
I can tell that by his face.

194
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,511
[CHIHIRO screams]

195
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,555
Check out this ugly bug
stuck to my back.

196
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,058
[CHIHIRO] You're gonna
snap my spine in half!

197
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,851
Oh, my! So you're awake!

198
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,811
Sorry about earlier.

199
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,355
But I had to determine
whether you were

200
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,273
friend or foe, of course.

201
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,443
I checked you out...
very thoroughly.

202
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,322
[CHIHIRO rasps] Quit, Nanami,
you're makin' him angry!

203
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:23,660
[NANAMI] And, judging by the
bracelet you're wearing... Hmph.

204
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,954
[KAIKOKU]
Tell me who you guys are.

205
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,665
[NANAMI]
Yes, of course. Introductions.

206
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,959
My name's Nanami Omejima.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,086
[NANAMI]
That's Chihiro Akafuda.

208
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,881
And the young lady
is Sakura Oshigiri.

209
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,299
We're comrades now.

210
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,135
Let me welcome you...
to the underground.

211
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,393
I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't think

212
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,853
I've ever put together
a jigsaw puzzle.

213
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,481
How long does it usually
take people to finish?

214
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,608
Depends on the person, really.

215
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,528
It's taken me half a day
to do a 1,000 piece puzzle.

216
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,238
Half a day?

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,907
[ZAKURO]
So, 15 days for 30,000.

218
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,285
Divide by seven people,
and it's two days.

219
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,787
Oh! That means we can make it!

220
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,539
I dunno, that was
for a regular puzzle

221
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,416
with a picture printed on it.

222
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,501
These pieces are all blank,
so I imagine it'll take us

223
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,337
a lot longer to
complete this one.

224
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,547
[HIMIKO whimpers]

225
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,549
[YUZU]
Don't sweat it, Akki.

226
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,467
After all, puzzles
are my specialty!

227
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,928
Thirty‐thousand pieces
is child's play!

228
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,306
But I'll need everyone's
cooperation for this to work,

229
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,683
so we should dispense
with the chit‐chat.

230
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,977
Let's buckle down and get to it!

231
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,729
[ZAKURO]
Yeah, good point.

232
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,772
[HIMIKO]
We'll give it our best!

233

[growls]

235
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,078
[NANAMI] Here you go.
Hopefully, they'll fit you.

236
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,496
Thanks for this.

237
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,374
[NANAMI] No trouble, everything
in here is stolen anyway.

238
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,043
Let's find you a new outfit.

239
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,670
Sneakers with
a kimono is so tacky.

240
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,175
[NANAMI] My, young people
these days are brazen!

241
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:05,053
Casually changing your clothes
in front of a stranger!

242
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,096
Have you no shame?!

243
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,641
[KAIKOKU] It's only awkward
if you make it awkward.

244
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,852
[NANAMI]
Anyway, it's quite a shock.

245
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,230
I never dreamed Sakura's
brother would end up here, too.

246
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,860
We should exchange information.

247
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,154
At the moment, it's just
the three of us residing

248
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,864
in this underground base.

249
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,657
I come from Ninth Avenue,
so I've been here

250
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,077
for about four years now.

251
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,245
Hiro and Sakura
are from Eleventh Avenue‐‐

252
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,663
Wait, slow down.

253
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,875
What do you mean when you say
"Ninth" and "Eleventh" Avenue?

254
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,336
So there are other
places like this one?

255
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,588
Wow, you really are in the dark.

256
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,173
No matter which
Avenue we mention,

257
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,550
we're actually referring
to the same place.

258
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,095
Ninth Avenue. Eleventh Avenue.

259
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,388
There's no difference.

260
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,558
The name is updated every time
a new crop of players comes in.

261
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,644
The truth is, we're on
a secluded island

262
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,229
far off in the sea.

263
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,023
People occasionally come
and go to restock supplies,

264
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,735
but the alpaca makes sure
those activities go unnoticed.

265
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,863
I knew there had to be
others involved besides him.

266
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,491
Yes. Helicopters
even fly in sometimes,

267
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,245
but you won't know it because
you're playing the games.

268
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,663
It's ironic.

269
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,375
Only those who have dropped out
can see the big picture here.

270
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,544
Hey! There's trouble!

271
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,213
It's Sakura.
I think she's missing!

[gasps]

273
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,765
[ANYA growls]
Wake up.

[gasps]

275
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,018
If you're that tired, go nap.

276
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,395
Uh, no, I'm okay!

277
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,648
Let's see, which part were
we working on right now?

278
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,400
[ANYA]
Hmm...

279
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,609
[HIMIKO sighs]

280
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,027
Hey!

281
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,405
Huh? I'm still awake!

282
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,782
I thought I told you
to go take a break!

283
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,367
I'm helping!

284
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,827
[ANYA]
Yeah, right! If you screw up

285
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,705
'cause you're tired,
you'll kill the whole operation!

286
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,081
What he means is:

287
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,542
"I want you to sleep because
I'm concerned for you.

288
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,919
Sweet dreams." Nice, huh?

289
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,131
[AKATSUKI rasps]

290
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,133
There's a nap room next door.

291
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,135
I'm so sorry.

292
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,803
[ZAKURO]
Good grief.

293
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,347
You've been working
pretty hard, too, though.

294
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,433
Aren't you sleepy?

295
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,895
Kaikoku needs us.

296
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,439
[ZAKURO]
Whoa, Aikawa...

297
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,526
[YUZU growls softly]

298
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,615
[KAIKOKU]
Hello there.

299
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,243
Ah! Oh, it's you.
Did you get a makeover?

300
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,370
No, not exactly.

301
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,247
Also, it isn't good to
wander off by yourself

302
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,291
without leaving
a note or something.

303
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,835
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.

304
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,338
Those two are kind
of overprotective.

305
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,839
Heh!

306
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,299
[KAIKOKU]
Hmm.

307
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,594
[KAIKOKU]
Hold on, girl‐Oshigiri,

308
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,054
we're not done here.

309

[SAKURA]
Sakura.

310
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,601
Sakura. You do know this
isn't the way back, right?

00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,603
I know. I just
wanted to check out

312
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,314
some radio parts up ahead
that might still work.

313
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,233
One of my tools broke
last time I came,

314
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,861
but now I'll get everything.
It shouldn't take long.

315
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,238
[KAIKOKU]
Hmm..

316
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,659
So, um...

317
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,997
[SAKURA]
Is Zakuro okay?

318
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,546
Couldn't say. But the last
time I saw the guy,

319
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,382
he was stuffing his face
with some mushroom pasta.

320
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,259
So I'd say he's just fine.

321
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,222
[SAKURA]
Hmm. He never changes.

322
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,808
[ZAKURO]
You awake?

323
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,394
You crashed about an hour
after Inaba laid down.

324
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,562
Remember that?

325
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,188
[ANYA gasps]

326
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,065
[ZAKURO]
Swap with me, since you're up.

327
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,316
I need to rest.

328
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,448
[ANYA]
What was that about earlier?!

329
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,409
[ZAKURO sighs]
What do you mean?

330
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,743
[ANYA]
In the lounge.

331
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,705
You said somethin' weird
to Akatsuki, didn't you?

332
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,458
Yuzu was actin' funny, too.
What are you hiding, huh?

333
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,590
[ANYA] Would you stop
secretly doubting people?

334
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,137
You sure know what you're doing.

335
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,597
[SAKURA]
I just copy Nanami.

336
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,432
He's amazingly talented!

337
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,435
He can build radios and
stun guns like it's nothing!

338
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,771
Ah. So that was his creation.

339
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,316
[SAKURA] He's been wanting
to get a hold of these parts.

340
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,902
And, uh... I'm surprising him!

341
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,784
[KAIKOKU] Yikes, poor Hiro. I'll
be nicer to him from now on.

342
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,582
[SAKURA] By the way, apparently
there are mermaids in here.

343
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,583
[KAIKOKU]
Mermaids?

344
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,794
[SAKURA] Nanami said he and a
friend saw one a long time ago,

345
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,589
and it had wispy
long hair like a ghost.

346
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,215
[KAIKOKU]
That's bizarre.

347
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,551
I know! A mermaid and a ghost.

348
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,761
A Mermost!

349
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,137
Wish I'd seen it!

350
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,514
I wonder how it
walks and breathes!

351
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,141
If I had to guess.

352
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,226
‐‐[KAIKOKU grunts]
‐‐[SAKURA] What's the matter?

353
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,812
Uh, something touched my leg.

354
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,522
[SAKURA gasps]
What's that?

355
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,774
Stay back!

356
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:23,871
[YUZU]
Impossible.

357
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,624
Impossible. Impossible!
Impossible! Impossible!

358
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,293
Impossible! Impossible!
Impossible!

359
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,379
Impossible!

360
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,381
Puzzles are
the thing I'm best at!

361
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,174
I've solved thousands
upon thousands,

362
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,134
ever since I was a child!

363
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,639
So I can say, without a doubt,
we won't make it in time!

364
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,517
[KARIN]
Yuzu?

365
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,726
[YUZU gasps]

366
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,692
You doing okay?

367
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,113
Sure I am.

368
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,240
[KARIN]
But, your finger's bleeding.

369
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,450
[YUZU]
Oh, that's a bad habit of mine.

370
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,536
It's my way of staying focused.

371
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,247
You worry‐wort! So sweet!

372
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,332
[KARIN sighs softl]

373
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,334
Hey. Listen.

374
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,048
If we succeed in this,

375
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,635
then I'll do any one thing
you want. Don't give up.

376
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,303
Keep at it, all right?

377
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,188
That's it!

378
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,565
[GROUP]
Huh...?

379
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,393
[YUZU growls] What were the
numbers on the first two?

380
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,853
I can't remember!

381
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:16,776
Easy, "001453" and "017491."

382
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:20,988
[YUZU gasps]
Are you messing with me?

383
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,741
[KARIN]
What would be the point of that?

384
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,201
Trust me, I'm sure.

385
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,286
My mind's a steel trap‐‐
I remember everything

386
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,454
I see or hear.

387
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,748
Who knew Karin was so eccentric?

388
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,541
Don't call me that!

389
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,252
And you did know. I told you
when we first met in the forest.

390
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,837
I guess I forgot.

391
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,756
[gasps]
I get it now.

392
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,177
[YUZU]
I know what to do.

393
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,932
Everyone...

394
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,561
Lend me your strength.

395
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,987
[YUZU]
We can do this!

396
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,782
Let's save Kai so we
can smack him in the face!

397
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,075
[GROUP]
Yeah!

398
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,871
[KAIKOKU gasps]

399
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,581
[SAKURA gasps]

400
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,418
[KAIKOKU]
Is that... a mermaid?
