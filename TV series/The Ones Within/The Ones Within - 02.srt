1
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,305
[PAKA]
Uhh...

2
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:17,100
Stage Three is a dating‐slash‐
nurturing simulation game

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,145
called <i>Throbbing Egg</i>
<i>~ Lady Murasaki</i>.

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,397
Oh, dear. It's such a lovely day

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,358
and yet everyone
looks so glum.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,401
[ANYA grunts]
Hey, don't move!

7
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,529
[PAKAMERA A gasping]

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,655
[PAKA]
Ah, yes.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,949
This contraption is a Pakamera.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,991
[ANYA]
"Pakamera"?

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,326
[PAKA]
Surveillance robots

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,411
that travel around
13th Avenue filming

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,040
you all, of course. Notice
they have lenses for eyes.

14
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,458
They act as a kind of supplement

15
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,418
to the city's
stationery cameras.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,255
Not only can they record
outdoors, but their ability

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,507
to follow their subject
allows for your audience

18
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,010
to have more complete and
immersive viewing experience.

19
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,887
And in case I forgot
to mention this,

20
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,765
you are completely free to use
any and all of the facilities

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,434
in Genome Tower and
the surrounding city.

22
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,852
Except...

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:01,478
[PLAYERS]
Hm?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,605
[PAKA] The tower's
51st floor and above

25
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,191
are strictly forbidden.
Violators will be

26
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:10,028
severely punished,
so please do take care.

27
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,585
[PAKA] Allow me to explain
the rules of the game.

28
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,379
Your objective is
to care for the girl

29
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,546
who hatches from this egg

30
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,840
and help her build a
successful relationship

31
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,427
with the most popular man
in school, Hikaru Genji.

32
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,388
[ZAKURO] So it's basically
a nurturing game

33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,306
and a dating sim put together?

34
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,558
[BOTH gasping]

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,520
[AKATSUKI] It's huge!
Almost like a dinosaur egg!

36
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,730
[YUZU] Hey, you wouldn't happen
to have a power drill, would ya?

37
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,774
I need to crack this baby open!

38
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,317
[PAKA] Please refrain,
we wouldn't want

39
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,820
the girl ingredients
to spill out everywhere.

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,238
[YUZU, AKATSUKI]
"Girl ingredients"?

41
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,323
[PAKA] By the way, this
stage requires a minimum

42
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,951
of four Let's Players.
There's no maximum,

43
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,078
so nominate whomever
you feel is best,

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,330
but I do suggest giving
yourselves ample time

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,957
to consider your decision.

46
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,667
Aren't these games
your specialty?

47
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,793
I pick Tiny.

48
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,754
[HIMIKO]
Uh...

49
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,005
[HIMIKO whimpers]

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,882
I'm guessing by "Tiny"
you mean me?

51
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,676
[ANYA]
Uh, no.

52
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,304
[AKATSUKI] And since it's
part dating sim... Aikawa!

53
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,848
[AIKAWA snores]

54
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,558
[KARIN]
Is he awake?

55
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,394
[YUZU] Aw, don't sleep with
your eyes open, Makimaki.

56
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,062
They're going to dry out.

57
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,772
If no one else wants
to participate,

58
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,607
then can I volunteer
myself again?

59
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,860
What, did you not learn
your lesson last time?

60
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,611
You should play
with us too, Anya.

61
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,238
Oh, that ain't happenin'!

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,489
I'll pass, too.

63
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,491
I don't want to put myself
through that again.

64
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:02,409
Aw, come on.

65
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,619
Based on the genre,
I don't think it'll be scary.

66
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,912
What are you trying to say?!

67
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,248
It's not like the first
one was scary either!

68
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,708
You should go, Oshigiri.

69
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,960
You seem like you'd be good
at dealing with girls.

70
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,713
[ZAKURO]
Huh? Uh, no, I don't think I...

71
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,214
Believe it or not,

72
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,800
Zak's embarrassingly
terrible with the ladies.

73
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,428
[ZAKURO] I mean. I wouldn't
say I'm terrible, but...

74
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,055
[ZAKURO yelps]

75
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,641
[laughing] Oh, I get it now,

76
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,185
you're just scared
of 'em, aren't ya?

77
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,895
Aw, that's precious!

78
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,481
[ZAKURO] How dare you insult me,
you angsty bastard?

79
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,357
You got a bone to pick
with me or something?!

80
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,233
Huh?!

81
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
What's this about bones,
I wanna smash your face!

82
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,528
[ZAKURO]
Wow, you <i>are</i> stupid!

83
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,946
Talkin' to yourself, punk?!

84
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,115
[YUZU laughs]

85
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,621
Hey. I think I'd prefer
to sit this one out.

86
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,080
Maybe I'll play the next one.

87
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,416
What are you gonna do then?

88
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,793
Go exploring.

89
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,464
[YUZU sighs] Kai really marches
to his own drum, doesn't he?

90
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,966
[ZAKURO]
Paka left that way, too.

91
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,636
[HIMIKO]
It says in here,

92
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,846
"the girl's looks and
personality will be determined

93
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,723
according to the
breeder's preferences.

94
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:09,684
The egg should hatch about
an hour after it's warmed up.

95
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,562
[AKATSUKI] It needs warming?
I think I can do that!

96
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,397
[AKATSUKI grunting]

97
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,734
[HIMIKO] Um. That kind of heat
probably won't be enough.

98
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,569
Think about how small
chicken eggs are.

99
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,405
Even those need to be
at 38 degrees celsius!

100
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,158
What kinda girl hatches
out of a freakin' egg?

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,828
That Paka's got
some weird hobbies.

102
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,290
[AKATSUKI] Okay! I found
a heater, will this work?

103
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,459
[HIMIKO] Yeah, we'll use
that and the fireplace.

104
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,585
Humidity is important,

105
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,421
so we'll put the boiling
water around it, too.

106
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,007
Oh, and don't forget to roll
it once in a while, guys.

107
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,968
[ANYA]
Man, what a pain in the ass.

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,970
Let's just toss it in the bath.

109
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,846
Soft.

110
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,097
Eh?

111
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,473
Huh?

112
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,852
A soft‐boiled egg.

113
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,982
Hang on. <i>That's</i> the first
thing you're saying?

114
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:57,858
Ding, ding.

115
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,818
Does that mean it's ready?!

116
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,028
[MAKINO]
Microwave it.

117
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,822
[AKATSUKI] I don't know,
what if it's too much heat

118
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,115
and she explodes?

119
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,158
[ANYA] Yeah, what if
her head blows off?

120
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,993
An afro.

121
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:08,910
[HIMIKO]
Stop it!

122
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,744
[ALL]
Uh?

123
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,997
You can't take the character
creation lightly.

124
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,166
If you make foolish choices at
the beginning just for a laugh,

125
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,334
then you're sure to regret it

126
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,461
whenever a serious scene
comes up later on.

127
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,713
[ANYA]
Oh, sorry.

128
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,882
Doing things like naming
your character A‐A‐A‐A

129
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,008
or making them run around naked

130
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,634
is an insult to
the nurturing genre.

131
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,177
If you don't give them
your time, money,

132
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,262
and love every single day,

133
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,264
there'll be a world of
difference in your final score.

134
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,641
In fact, the massive amount of
effort it requires to succeed is

135
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,560
what makes this kind of game so
fulfilling in the first place!

136
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,020
So whether it's girls,
cows, or vegetables,

137
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,730
each one of them is
my perfect baby!

138
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,732
And we have to give the
babies everything we've got!

139
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,400
To the death!

140
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,945
[ANYA]
Wow...

141
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,946
[HIMIKO]
All right, everyone.

142
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,781
Now let us pray.

143
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,993
Oh, sweet egg baby,
please hatch very soon.

144
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,537
Though if we mess up, we'll just
cook you with crab and ham.

145
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,330
[ANYA]
Huh?

146
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,373
We could make an egg custard
or a mayonnaise omelet,

147
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,083
or maybe an <i>oyakodon carbonara.</i>

148
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,377
Then again, eggs and
crab do sound good.

149
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,420
[ANYA]
Huh?!

150
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,131
[AKATSUKI, HIMIKO] Eggs and
crab. What a tasty meal.

151
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,634
I thought we wanted it to hatch!

152
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,805
Hurry, Kudou, we
need you to tell us

153
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,515
what kind of girl
you like, right now!

154
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,767
What, why me?

155
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,352
[HIMIKO] The manual says
the attributes are defined

156
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,145
by the breeder's preferences!

157
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,147
If all of you shout out
what your ideal type is,

158
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,858
then I'm sure she'll turn out
to be a lovely young lady!

159
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,444
It's like talking about our
crushes at a sleepover!

160
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,364
The egg is about to hatch any
second, so it's now or never!

161
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,282
[ANYA] Who gives a damn
about preference?!

162
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,160
Uh. I guess I'll say a girl
in a school uniform!

163
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,621
[HIMIKO] I'll pray for the baby
to be born as a kind, honest,

164
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,081
and healthy young lady!

165
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,040
[AKATSUKI]
You know...

166
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,668
I miss Pandarou.

167
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,503
[MAKINO]
Afro.

168
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,518
So, this is her.

169
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,107
[YUZU]
Karirin!

170
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,943
Uh? I get a lame
nickname too, huh?

171
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,528
I wish you would cut that out.

172
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,072
[YUZU] Be nice. I'm here to
share a wonderful discovery

173
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,448
with you. You see,

174
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,159
I've just found a sprawling
outdoor bath on Floor 30.

175
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,370
Outdoor bath? That's bizarre.

176
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,288
Very. Anyway, it must be fate

177
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,793
that I ran into you, as I
wanted to get to know you.

178
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,420
Oh.

179
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,297
[YUZU]
And besides...

180
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,717
I'd like to talk
to you about Akki.

181
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,554
[AKATSUKI] The egg has finally
hatched, and with that,

182
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,307
all of our best ideas have
converged into one being.

183
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,316
[AKATSUKI, HIMIKO]
What... have we done?

184
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,361
You must be Mama,
Papa, Papa, and Papa!

185
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,239
Hewwo dere, my name's Murasaki.

186
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,866
[AKATSUKI, HIMIKO]
Why does she talk like that?

187
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,618
Akatsuki. Are you
why she's a panda?

188
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,079
Sorry, when I thought about
someone I liked, I guess that's

189
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,622
the first thought that
popped into my head.

190
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,083
Do you have any idea
how bad you screwed up?

191
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,877
How are we supposed to win
over the school heartthrob

192
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:04,878
with a giant teddy bear?

193
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,838
Don't talk about
my baby like that.

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,215
She's a perfect cinnamon roll,
too good for this world!

195
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,426
You're looking at her like
a mom looks at her child!

196
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,469
Stop being biased!

197
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,971
It's true!
In a girl‐raising game,

198
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,183
the uglier the character starts
out, the cuter they get!

199
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,517
By slowly raising their stats

200
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,478
or even spending all
your real‐world money,

201
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,064
you can make a face
that anyone would love!

202
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,274
I know in my heart

203
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,443
Murasaki has what it
takes to be a knockout!

204
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,196
It's okay, Mama,
don't be sad for me.

205
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,572
Huh?

206
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,158
[MURASAKI] You don't have
to lie, I know I'm ugly,

207
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,787
and too fluffy.
Nobody would love me.

208
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,163
That's nice of you to say,

209
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,499
but the world's not
so black and white.

210
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,001
Damn, what a downer!
And you're making a mess!

211
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,503
You're wrong, Murasaki!

212
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,047
I'm your mom, and I love
you with all my heart!

213
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,966
[AKATSUKI] Papa loves you
too, Pandar‐‐ Uh, ahem!

214
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,593
The world may not
be black and white,

215
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,762
but you are, and
you're gorgeous!

216
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,848
Do you weally think I can
be pwetty, if I twy hawd?

217
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,518
[AKATSUKI] I know you can.
I believe in you!

218
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,603
This is givin' me a headache.

219
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,730
Aren't you gonna say something?

220
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,733
Huh?

221
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,987
[gasping]

222
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,114
Huh?

223
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:15,824
Huh?!

224
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,910
Oh. So you and Akki

225
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,496
weren't acquainted before you
ended up in this place together.

226
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,707
You seemed so close, I assumed
there must be more between you.

227
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,252
No way. I'm not
into that weirdo.

228
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,047
I should have mentioned.

229
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,133
I'm what they call
a "completionist."

230
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,469
If I like someone, then I
want to know everything.

231
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,388
And I'm quite taken with you.

232
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,140
Hey. I don't know
if I'm comfortable

233
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,058
being this close
to you in the bath.

234
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,810
I mean, we're girls, but...

235
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,148
Heh. I'm sorry, but I don't
recall specifying I was a girl.

236
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,232
[KARIN gasps]

237
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,245
[KARIN]
Wait, what?

238
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,498
I mean, you have those things...

239
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,960
Uh. And I don't... see a...

240
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,087
[laughing] Oh my god, relax.

241
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,297
I'm joking!

242
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,965
[YUZU laughs]

243
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,966
[YUZU]
Check it out.

244
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,385
The views started rolling
in when I did that!

245
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:21,764
[gasps] You mean they can
see us in here, too?

246
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,852
Well, I'm not positive, but I
think that's a Pakamera there.

247
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,228
[PAKAMERA yelp]

248
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,897
That was a pretty good shot.

249
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,608
Uh. If that stupid alpaca
doesn't leave me alone,

250
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,234
I'm gonna skin him alive!

251
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,278
Well, we did just get
a little bit closer

252
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,696
to a hundred million views.

253
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,282
So now we know that the counter
keeps climbing for all of us,

254
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,075
even when we're not playing.

255
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,161
No matter where we are
or what we're doing,

256
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,413
the eight of us are
always in a Let's Play.

257
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,081
[KARIN gasping]

258
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,875
We're in this together, Karin.

259
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,712
That's all the more reason
to get acquainted, right?

260
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,215
[MURASAKI]
He woves me, he woves me not,

261
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:59,010
he woves me, he woves me not.

262
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,429
[MURASAKI sighs]
Papa Bear.

263
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,473
I'm not feewing vewy good.

264
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,432
Huh?

265
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,435
My heart hurts so bad,
I think I'm gonna be sick!

266
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,519
[AKATSUKI]
Mama Bear!

267
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,646
Yes?

268
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,023
Sounds like Murasaki's
got an illness!

269
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,317
A cold, maybe?

270
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,070
[gasps] Ow, my chest!

271
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,821
My heart's breakin'
into little pieces!

272
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,325
[AKATSUKI] Murasaki!
Quick, somebody call a doctor!

273
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,202
[ANYA]
I'm staying outta this.

274
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,039
[MURASAKI snores]

275
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,749
Oh, I understand.

276
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,584
She has a crush on Makino, huh?

277
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,211
Just when I thought
this situation

278
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,713
couldn't get any dumber.

279
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,715
Anyways, I say we head
out to the school

280
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,883
first thing in the morning.

281
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,094
I'm ready to get this
shitty game over with.

282
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,721
[gasps] What did you say?

283
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,473
Every nurturing game
is a treasure,

284
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,058
and I'll prove it to you.

285
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,893
Whoa, put that away, would ya?!

286
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,895
Not till you take that back.

287
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,106
That horrible thing you just
said is a slap in the face

288
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,483
to all the pure and beautiful
babies in the universe!

289
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,110
So then. I should die?

290
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,528
Whether you enjoy
this game or not,

291
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,738
you're still one of
Murasaki's Papa Bears!

292
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,739
I am not!

293
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,866
I am not responsible
for that abomination!

294
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,661
If you don't support your child,
you're an absentee father!

295
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,538
Not to mention your
temper is too short,

296
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,747
just like your eyebrows!

297

My eyebrows ain't got a
damn thing to do with this!

00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,251
Hey! Wait!

299
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,670
If Anya is Murasaki's father,
what does that make me?

300
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,839
Can I be her stepdad,
or favorite uncle?

301
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,090
You're just a moron!

No, please don't
touch the hair!

Ugh, my eyes are puffy.

sleeping in here tonight.

You should get some rest, too.

in a place like this!

312
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,156
Besides, I'm outta medicine.

313
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,115
[AKATSUKI]
Medicine?

314
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,117
[ANYA] Forget it, it's
none of your business.

315
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,618
[MAKINO snores]

316
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,287
[ANYA]
Makino, shut up!

317
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,374
[bell chimes]

318
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,585
Wow, check out the new
hottie on campus!

319
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,588
I'm very happy to meet you,
my name is Murasaki!

320
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,465
[YUZU]
Mm‐hm! What a good girl!

321
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,716
What brings you here?

322
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,134
We're moral support.

323
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,179
You could use more girl power if
you're gonna play a dating sim.

324
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,265
Good grief. Let's go.

325
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,270
[GUARD A] This is
St. Shikibu Girl's Academy!

326
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,314
[GUARD B] Suspicious people
will be banished!

327
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,317
[ANYA] Huh? And what's
so suspicious about her?

328
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,068
Back off!

329
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,070
[GUARD A]
This is a school for girls.

330
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,031
[GUARD B] As such, men are
not permitted to enter!

331
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:28,368
Gah! Get your hands offa me,
or you're both dead!

332
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,994
Anya, no!

333
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,372
Um, please give him back!

334
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,332
Put him down, right now!

335
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,708
Oh, this is bad.

336
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,669
Anya!

337
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,215
[bell tolls]

338
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,216
[GIRL A]
Mr. Genji!

339
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,092
[GIRL B]
Eat my lunch!

340
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:44,967
[HIKARU]
My pleasure.

341
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,135
[GIRL C]
Please eat mine too!

342
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,011
[HIKARU]
Of course.

343
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:47,887
[GIRLS chattering]

344
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,181
Heh. You're just too kind to me!

345
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,809
As if this wasn't complicated
enough already,

346
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,185
the school idol is a teacher.

347
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,062
At least she'll be
with an educated man

348
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,605
who has a steady job.

349
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,691
[YUZU] So, Muramura, how do you
feel about Mr. Genji there?

350
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,320
He seems like a pretty wonderful
guy, and all da girls around him

351
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,905
are really cute too.

352
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,492
Unlike me, cuz I'm just
a big, ugly, stupid loser.

353
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,368
Uh!

354
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,371
No! Don't be mean to yourself,
Murasaki, you're cute!

355
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,372
If you like somebody,

356
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,791
you're supposed to be
honest about your feelings!

357
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,168
We'll work together to figure
out what you need to do.

358
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,920
I know you can win his heart!

359
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,880
Mama Bear.

360
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,383
Would you stop?

361
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:30,471
[MURASAKI "Somebody I like."
I'll make him very happy!

362
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,557
[HIMIKO] You should sift
the flour a few times.

363
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,519
It'll get the clumps out
so it bakes nice and evenly.

364
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,938
[sneezes]

365
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,482
[MAKINO snores]

366
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,153
You guys aren't helping at all.

367
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,696
Get out!

368
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,868
[AKATSUKI] Maybe we should
see what Mr. Genji's up to.

369
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,244
[MAKINO]
Mm‐hm.

370
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:59,000
[HIKARU sighs] It's such a pain
being the hottest guy in school.

371
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,377
Those girls are clueless.

372
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,755
Can't they get me something
I really want?

373
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm beautiful.

374
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,885
I deserve a present
that reflects that!

375
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,012
Like, for example...

376
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,056
...Dom Perignon!

377
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,850
Yeah, nice shot, me!

378
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,312
I'm gorgeous <i>and</i> a great
athlete! I'm the best ever!

379
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,230
Woohoo! [laughs]

380
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,317
[AKATSUKI] Well, this was
definitely informative.

381
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,653
We need to hurry up
and tell the others.

382
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,739
[MURASAKI]
Sorry to bother you, sir.

383
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,157
[HIKARU]
Mm?

384
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,159
[coughing]

385
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,244
[MURASAKI]
Um, are you okay?

386
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,080
Of course, never better!
What can I do for you?

387
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,957
Well, uh... I'm here to give you

388
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,753
a homemade present from
the bottom of my heart!

389
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,923
[HIKARU]
Uh. Oh, that's so thoughtful!

390
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:47,924
Heh, heh, heh...

391
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,635
Looks pretty good!
Thanks so much.

392
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,348
Okay then, I guess I
better be on my way.

393
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,146
[HIKARU]
What was that?!

394
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,648
How dare that monstrosity

395
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,108
make a bigger impression
than yours truly!

396
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,903
I simply won't have it!

397
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,031
My name means that I'm
destined to shine brighter

398
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,200
than anyone else!

399
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,161
If I don't stop this, they'll
say I don't live up to it.

400
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,872
I'll be damned if
I let that happen!

401
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,837
I thought I heard someone
crying, Mr. Genji.

402
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,758
I wanted to make sure
everything was okay‐‐

403
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,552
[HIKARU]
You saw it.

404
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,472
The embarrassing side of me
that no one should ever know.

405
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:40,768
We can't have that. After all,

406
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,188
I'm supposed to sparkle at
all times, no matter what!

407
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,733
I am the illustrious Mr. Genji!

408
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,361
No!

409
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,245
Ma‐Makino!

410
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,831
[HIKARU]
You can't assault a teacher!

411
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,917
How dare you?
What's wrong with you?

412
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,294
Why would y‐‐

413
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,432
Oh, do forgive me, please!
You must be a transfer student.

414
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,892
I would've remembered seeing
you around here before. Wou‐‐

415
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,603
Uh!

416
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,438
[AKATSUKI]
Makino is awesome!

417
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,981
[YUZU]
Yeah, who knew Makimaki could

418
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,941
seduce a person in five seconds?

419
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,694
[AKATSUKI]
Awesome and creepy!

420
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,531
Wait, don't eat that,
it's been on the floor

421
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,909
and it's probably
got dirt all over it!

422
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,872
[AKATSUKI]
Makino is awesome!

423
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,541
[YUZU]
Perfect execution, Makimaki!

424
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,922
[MURASAKI] Dese are for you.
I wanted everybody to have one.

425
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,550
That's why I made
this batch secretwly.

426
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,011
Could you please give one
to my other Papa Bear,

427
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,221
the one that looks
so mean and scawy?

428
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,514
[AKATSUKI]
Right, Anya.

429
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,016
I wonder if he's doing okay.

430
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,936
Outta the way, slowpoke!
Where the hell am I?

431
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,230
[KARIN] Why don't you forget
about this jerk teacher?

432
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,774
Because I can't.

433
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,276
I know he wasn't
very nice to me,

434
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,196
but there's something
I wanna say to him.

435
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,406
I'll tell him that in
spite of everything,

436
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,824
he's a great teacher,

437
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,994
and he lives up to
his name just fine.

438
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,540
That's really sweet.

439
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,377
[KARIN] I'll punch him a few
times on your behalf, then.

440
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,252
[HIKARU sneezes]

441
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,505
[AKATSUKI] I don't know why,
but I feel like Mr. Genji

442
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,757
isn't gonna wake up
for a while.

443
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:52,566
[inaudible]

444
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,579
[MURASAKI]
You know,

445
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,498
I feel really happy.

446
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,459
What is this?

447
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,919
[MURASAKI]
I think it's time.

448
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,421
[gasping]

449
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,799
Listen...

450
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,512
Mama Bear.

451
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:25,599
And Papa Bear.
Um, if you don't mind...

452
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,772
...would you please
give me one last hug?

453
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,903
What is this?

454
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,906
Murasaki wanted you
to have that treat.

455
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,044
[door slides]

456
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,171
[YUZU]
Hey. Where'd you two go?

457
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,841
As you guys can see,
we cleared the third stage.

458
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,846
[ZAKURO]
Did something happen?

459
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,098
Yeah, you could say that.

460
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,059
It's a long story.

461
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,772
[YUZU]
Good night.
