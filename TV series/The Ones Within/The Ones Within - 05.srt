1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,849
[KAIKOKU'S GRANDPA]
Get out of my sight!

2
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:20,020
Do not set foot within the
Onigasaki estate ever again!

3
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,943
If those are your wishes.
Damn geezer.

4
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,278
[MAID A]
I'm afraid that Master

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,405
doesn't seem to have
much time left.

6
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,032
[MAID B] I suppose that
would explain why

7
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,827
he's been so frantic to
train young Master Kai.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,621
[KAIKOKU]
Like I care.

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,624
I'm not that geezer's
prize show dog.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,925
[KAIKOKU] I refuse to become
some ornament for the family.

11
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,024
[ZAKURO] Looks like the target's
finally stopped moving.

12
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,485
About time. Let's hurry up
and finish this.

13
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,321
Kudou will smack us
if we take too long.

14
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm going with them! Let go!

15
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,075
Get your hands off me, dammit!

16
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,660
You have to stay with us!

17
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,162
[YUZU] And that's all it takes
to use the transmitter.

18
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,498
Please bring them back safely.

19
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,249
We're counting on you.

20
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,378
We can't fail.

21
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,797
Roro will probably
drug us if we do.

22
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,424
[ZAKURO] We made the right move
leaving Kudou behind.

23
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,135
He lets his emotions
control him.

24
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,221
You should be careful
of that, as well.

25
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,139
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,976
[ZAKURO] In stealth games,
the most important objective

27
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,270
is to complete the mission
and return safely.

28
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,898
They're not about
dispatching enemies.

29
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,692
As soon as we free the captives,

30
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,485
we go straight back
to the village.

31
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,278
Don't even think
about the demons.

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,197
That's what Paka
said was our goal.

33
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,657
The bad guys don't matter.

34
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,992
You want me to run
from the enemy, huh?

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,704
Well that should
properly shame my family.

36
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,039
[ZAKURO]
Living is the top priority.

37
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,710
If your family name gets
in the way, abandon it.

38
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,049
Good lord, you're extreme.

39
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,260
[ZAKURO]
I'm here for a reason,

40
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,430
and I'm not gonna
let my search end.

41
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,016
I'm gonna guess you mean the
thing with your twin sister?

42
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,396
By the way, what drove you to
talk to me about that stuff?

43
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,022
[ZAKURO] All the others
are playing the game

44
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,025
like mindless sheep.
But not you.

45
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,028
You're the only one looking
for the quickest escape.

46
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,407
Basically, you're the most
determined about getting home,

47
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,325
and that's what I need.

48
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,037
[AKATSUKI]
Ooh!

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,499
This room's pretty dang swanky
compared to all the others.

50
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,294
Do you think this
could be Kikka's room?

51
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,422
[KARIN]
What's with you?

52
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,632
How can you stay calm
no matter what happens?

53
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,551
It's freakin' bizarre.

54
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,263
To you, sure,
but it's normal for me.

55
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,307
Uh? Karin, look!

56
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,851
Is that a dollhouse
outside the window?

57
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,730
Except it's so big, it might
as well be a real house.

58
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,106
You're so carefree.

59
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,860
Especially considering we
might end up being murdered.

60
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,153
They'll eat us.

61
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,321
It could happen.

62
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,490
We could be their
main ingredients.

63
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,117
Akatsuki guts mashed
up into terrine!

64
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,162
Slowly‐simmered Akatsuki stew
with tasteful garnish!

65
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,081
Baked and roasted Akatsuki
served as the main dish!

66
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,334
And for dessert,
a bowl of Akatsuki Iride

67
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
topped with loads
of whipped cream!

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,216
No! Anything but dessert!

69
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,968
[AKATSUKI] Good to see Karin
hasn't lost her cool.

70
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,596
Uh?

71
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,809
Huh? Check it out! Looks like
this bar's a little bent.

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,101
[KARIN]
Yeah, you're right.

73
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,063
Although, it's still too
tight to fit through.

74
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,524
[AKATSUKI]
Maybe. I'll give it a shot.

75
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,943
[grunting]

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,072
See, I slipped right out!

77
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,782
C'mon, let's beat it!

78
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,908
Uh?

79
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,048
Go ahead. Laugh all ya want!

80
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,550
[AKATSUKI]
What? I'm not laughing.

81
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,218
[lock clicks]

82
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,303
[KARIN]
Hide somewhere, hurry!

83
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,724
Huh? Where's the other guy?

84
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,060
Don't tell me he
slipped through the bars.

85
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,437
Uh, listen, you have no
right to treat us this‐‐

86
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,149
Well, you're the one I wanted,
so it makes no difference.

87
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,068
Who cares where he went?

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,154
Ooh, so soft. Just angelic.

89
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,907
Now what am I gonna
do with you...

90
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,745
[footsteps]

91
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,664
[ZAKURO]
It's a big place.

92
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,500
Lucky for us,
there aren't any guards.

93
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,794
[KAIKOKU]
Oshigiri, take a look.

94
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,968
Isn't that idyllic?

95
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,386
[AKATSUKI]
Achoo!

96
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,971
Aw, crap!

97
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,180
Was that...?

98
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,849
[ZAKURO]
Iride? That you?

99
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,810
You guys made it!
You found us!

100
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,937
[AKATSUKI coughs]

101
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,606
[AKATSUKI]
I had to climb through the attic

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,190
to get out of that place.

103
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,651
[ZAKURO]
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

104
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,611
What about her?

105
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,071
[AKATSUKI] Oh, yeah!
She's still back there.

106
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,158
If we're not quick enough,
something might happen to her.

107
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:55,707
[AKATSUKI] Hurry, c'mon!
This way! Right through here!

108
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,711
[ZAKURO]
Huh?

109
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,755
[KAIKOKU]
The hell are we looking at?

110
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:02,923
Long story short,

111
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,550
it's the dreaded
Onibania family.

112
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,513
[ZAKURO]
Sorry, come again?

113
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,641
The Onibania family.

114
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,227
It's crazy, but all the girls
she abducts, she treats them

115
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,688
like life‐size dolls
to play house with.

116
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,066
She stripped Karin down
in the blink of an eye,

117
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,362
and transformed her into
her new maid, Veronica.

118
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,698
And you just sat there and
watched all this happen?

119
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,700
[AKATSUKI]
Yes, reluctantly.

120
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,620
Meaning you saw her
without any clothes on?

121
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,622
[AKATSUKI]
Yes, reluctantly.

122
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,166
[ZAKURO] Really? Couldn't you
have closed your eyes?

123
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,502
Well. All right, Veronica.

124
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,462
Why don't you pour me some tea?

125
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,673
You know what I'm
in the mood for?

126
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,967
I could go for some
nice Earl Grey.

127
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,218
[KARIN exhales]

128
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,389
Are you listening
to me, Veronica,

129
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,765
do you want me to fire you?!

130
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,892
[KARIN] Do it!
I wish you would fire me!

131
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,311
[MAID C] Hey, whoa!
I'm guessing you're a newbie?

132
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,563
[MAID D] You really don't
want to defy her.

133
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,232
As long as you do what she says,

134
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,150
they won't have any
reason to hurt you.

135
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,069
Just because of some stupid tea?

136
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,737
[MAID C]
Worse, they'll dispose of you!

137
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,281
Yeah! You better play along
and do what I want,

138
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,493
or I'll have my grandpa
smush you into goo.

139
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,913
[PAKA] The enemies on this stage
are quite overpowered.

140
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,415
[KIKKA]
I only need to call for him

141
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,917
and my grandpa will
come wherever I am.

142
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,794
Unlike your supposed
friends who ditched you

143
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,212
and ran away on their own.

144
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,922
[KARIN grumbles]

145
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,009
So go and make me a delicious
four‐course meal.

146
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,719
Veronica.

147
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,637
[AKATSUKI]
It's awful, right?

148
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,180
[KAIKOKU]
So very awful.

149
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,640
[ZAKURO]
Uh...

150
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,811
At least her life doesn't seem
to be in immediate danger.

151
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,688
Iride, were they holding you

152
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,606
in the dungeon with
the other captives?

153
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,525
Can you show us how
to get down there?

154
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,444
Well, um...

155
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,364
The first place they had us
locked up is located over there.

156
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,659
The turtle‐shell‐bondage‐tied
Momotaro tower.

157
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,453
[KAIKOKU]
That's freakin' creepy.

158
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,163
I haven't had the
chance to search any

159
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,291
of the pheasant, dog, or
monkey bondage towers.

160
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,959
Could be any of 'em.

161
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,671
So this whole place is basically
a fortress of perversion.

162
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,506
Who even designed this place?

163
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,592
[KIKKA]
Achoo!

164
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,385
[KAIKOKU]
Shall we split up?

165
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,429
[ZAKURO] If you find the
dungeon, confirm they're

166
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,223
all safe and then come
straight back here.

167
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,767
We'll rescue her first,

168
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,436
and then we'll release
everyone else.

169
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,146
Meet back here in 30.

170
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,647
Got it!

171
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,817
[ZAKURO]
Iride, your foot.

172
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,861
[AKATSUKI]
Huh? What the‐‐?

173
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,529
When did that happen?

174
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,907
Whatever, I'm still
totally fine‐‐

175
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,076
[groaning]

176
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,998
[KAIKOKU]
Here, wrap up both your feet.

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,542
Oh, cool, thanks!

178
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,879
All right! I'm off for real now!

179
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,215
[KAIKOKU]
Yeah, just be careful.

180
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,595
I almost let his stupid
face get the best of me.

181
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,222
That was close.

182
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,144
[ZAKURO]
Pheasant tower was a bust.

183
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:10,318
[ZAKURO]
So he left. That's not good.

184
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,070
A bracelet?

185
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,531
[ZAKURO gasps]

186
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,409
[thuds]

187
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,078
[MAIDS]
Huh?!

188
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,665
‐‐Hey, there you are!
‐‐[MAIDS screaming]

189
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,917
You know where they keep
the key to get in here?

190
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,418
[MAID E]
Uh, yeah, the demon girl

191
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,130
with four long braids
always holds onto it.

192
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,965
[AKATSUKI]
Right, that's gotta be Kikka.

193
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,258
Huh, y'know.

194
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,927
I wonder if she left
it in that first room.

195
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,725
I don't want your food.

196
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,561
But there aren't
any peppers in it.

197
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,479
It's just got some fish flakes.

198
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,314
That's not the problem.

199
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,816
Ohh...

200
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,408
You know what?

201
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,993
Um, what's that?

202
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,120
[ANYA]
I noticed it a while back now.

203
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,664
But ya kinda remind me of him.

204
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,790
Dimwitsuki.

205
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,710
[HIMIKO]
Huh? Do you mean that?

206
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,462
[ANYA]
Yeah. I don't know, it's...

207
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,965
It's like your aura
or something.

208
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,594
Forget I said that.

209
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,804
[HIMIKO sighs]

210
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,889
[ANYA]
Where's Yuzu?

211
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,017
[HIMIKO] Oh, she went
back to Genome Tower.

212
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,562
She wanted to watch their
progress with a Pakamera.

213
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,481
[ZAKURO grunts]
Iride, your foot.

214
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,276
[AKATSUKI] What the...?
When did that happen?

215
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,750
[AKATSUKI] Found it! The key
to the dollhouse dungeon!

216
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,753
I don't know what
else this could be.

217
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:56,257
All I gotta do now
is stay outta sight.

218
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,634
[AKATSUKI grunts]

219
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,969
[coughs]

220
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,892
You brought this upon
yourself by refusing

221
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,436
to be my granddaughter's
plaything.

222
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,234
[PAKA] I believe you're
going a little too far,

223
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,110
Lord Kihachi.

224
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,820
So you're here.

225
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,656
What do you want?

226
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,368
Kakuriyo's well outside
your area of supervision.

227
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,663
[PAKA] You're welcome to indulge
in that delusion if you like,

228
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,666
but we both know the
entirety of 13th Avenue

229
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,626
is under my jurisdiction.

230
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,629
Now hand over Mr. Iride.

231
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,548
[KIHACHI] Do you really think
I'll give him to you?

232
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,176
You remember the lad's own
words on the matter?

233
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:43,054
To dispose of him if necessary.

234
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,431
[PAKA] You need to understand
that I consider him

235
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,351
someone indispensable
to my needs.

236
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,479
You sure you want to play
this out, Lord Kihachi?

237
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,649
Humans are such extremely
fragile and delicate creatures.

238
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,235
You can break them
without even trying to.

239
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,988
If you risk that by treating
him any more harshly,

240
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,032
I will employ a full reset.

241
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,828
[PAKA] I am the supervisor
of this realm.

242
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,082
The balance of 13th Avenue
is entirely under my control.

243
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,793
I'm happy to look the other
way if you wish to behave

244
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,337
like you're the king
of the mountain.

245
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,007
However, don't forget
for a single second

246
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,719
that you're nothing more
than a character in a game.

247
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,180
And this act you're currently
so bent on committing.

248
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,474
If you follow through,
it would be equivalent to

249
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,561
breaking the game system itself.

250
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,813
A rather troubling notion,

251
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:37,108
and I'm afraid that
it just won't do.

252
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,031
[PAKA] I do hope you're
capable of making

253
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:46,034
a wise decision, Lord Kihachi.

254
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,828
[PAKA] Don't you wish to
spend as much time

255
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,415
with your granddaughter
as you possibly can?

256
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:00,089
[KIHACHI] You're a buffoon.
Hurry up and get lost.

257
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,598
[AKATSUKI]
Thank you, Paka. Sincerely.

258
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,934
[PAKA] Oh. I didn't realize
you were awake.

259
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,021
Mr. Onigasaki will be
arriving here shortly.

260
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,358
I genuinely wish you
the very best of luck.

261
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,947
Hey, Paka.

262
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:30,912
Do you think the two
of us could be friends?

263
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,455
I mean, you‐‐

264
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,917
Have you always been
entirely on your own here?

265
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,836
Doesn't it get lonely for you?

266
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,547
You know, my specialty,

267
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,468
well, I'm really good
at escape games.

268
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,597
So can't we escape
this place together?

269
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,517
[PAKA]
I cannot leave.

270
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,103
But why?

271
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,440
[PAKA] I can't leave,
because a promise was made.

272
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,948
[AKATSUKI]
But why?

273
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,870
Hey. Have any luck?

274
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,165
Huh?

275
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,252
[ZAKURO]
My sister...

276
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,379
She was here.

277
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,589
They kept her here.

278
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,682
[ZAKURO]
Two years ago, a beta version

279
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,643
of <i>The Ones Within</i> made
the rounds on the net.

280
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,937
My little sister
really took to it,

281
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,565
but she disappeared
right before she beat it.

282
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,527
Into thin air. I spent
the next two years

283
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,071
following every
single potential lead,

284
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,073
but I couldn't find her.

285
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,367
The police were ready
to give up the search,

286
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,370
and even my parents
agreed with them.

287
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,707
Which led me to make
one last desperate gamble.

288
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,750
I intentionally
got myself abducted

289
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,919
in the hopes of
finding my sister.

290
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,300
[ZAKURO]
And this. It's my sister's.

291
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,135
Her name's engraved on it.

292
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,595
[KAIKOKU]
She was here?

293
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,890
[ZAKURO]
I can't be sure, but that's her.

294
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,100
It's her name.

295
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,396
What if Sakura's still here?
In the dungeons?

296
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,941
Try to stay calm.
Where'd you even find that?

297
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,818
[ZAKURO]
In the pheasant tower.

298
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,738
It was lying in the
corner of the hall.

299
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,909
[KAIKOKU] Where's Iride?
It's been over 30 minutes now.

300
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,328
Oshigiri.

301
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,454
[ZAKURO]
Huh?

302
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,917
[KAIKOKU] You stay put. Just try
to clear your head for a minute.

303
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,627
I'll take a look around.

304
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,425
[KAIKOKU] Why's the signal
coming from the Momotaro tower?

305
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,093
Is that where he went?

306
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,889
Iride!

307
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,558
[AKATSUKI grunts]
I'm really sorry.

308
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,728
I kind of had a run‐in
with Elder Kihachi.

309
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,733
[KAIKOKU]
Come on, we better keep moving.

310
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,822
[AKATSUKI] I know where it is.
I found the dungeon.

311
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,032
It's in the dog tower.

312
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,576
In the very back,
at the bottom of the stairs.

313
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,246
And I've got the key‐‐ Uh.

314
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,997
What's wrong?

315
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,417
[AKATSUKI]
Um, I uh... It's my right arm.

316
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,211
I can't move it.

317
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,840
[PAKA] I can't leave,
because a promise was made.

318
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:34,720
[YUZU] Well, now that's strange.
What could Akki be crying about?

319
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,515
[door slams]

320
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,724
[MAIDS gasp]

321
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,476
Hey, sorry for the wait.

322
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,687
[KARIN gasps]
You came to save me!

323
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,604
[KAIKOKU]
I'll get this open.

324
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,064
Please!

325
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,358
[MAIDS sigh]

326
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,571
Don't put any strain on it.
It looks broken.

327
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,323
Let's get to the other side
of the pheasant tower.

328
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,075
We should be able to
see the smoke signal

329
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,827
from the village from there.

330
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,995
Smoke signal?

331
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,913
Yeah, to guide us back.

332
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,249
Roro's keepin' it lit for us.

333
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,379
[KAIKOKU]
Everyone get out? Let's go.

334
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,884
[ZAKURO]
Sorry, but go on without me.

335
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,179
I need to confirm
something first.

336
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,140
You two, go on ahead of us.

337
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,933
If you say so.

338
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,938
[KIKKA] Hey! Don't you
people have manners?

339
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,732
You can't just invite
yourselves in!

340
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,276
Ah! Where did all
of my dolls go?

341
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,569
This is appalling!

342
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,821
You thieves are gonna
pay dearly for this!

343
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,323
Afraid you're just
gonna have to play

344
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,699
with this from now on.

345
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,533
[KIKKA gasps]

346
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,952
[chirps]

347
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,621
[KIKKA] I don't want
that little monster!

348
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,790
I only like pretty things and
cute things and elegant things!

349
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,168
For example... Huh?

350
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,630
Hang on. Why do you...?

351
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,466
Your face looks really
familiar for some reason.

352
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,010
[ZAKURO gasps]
Answer me.

353
00:18:56,052 --> 00:19:00,139
Two years back, did you abduct
a girl with a face like mine?

354
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,933
Huh? Two years ago?

355
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,562
Jeez, I forget.

356
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,022
[ZAKURO]
Well remember!

357
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,483
[KIKKA gasps, growls]

358
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,945
Who knows? I probably did.

359
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,281
But she isn't here now, is she?

360
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,283
I'm sure I got bored
and tossed her out.

361
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,910
[ZAKURO gasping]

362
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,042
[ZAKURO]
What the hell?!

363
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,503
[KAIKOKU]
Oshigiri. Listen.

364
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,338
You need to go catch up
with the others.

365
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,298
[ZAKURO]
But!

366
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,717
People who let their
emotions control them

367
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,428
only get in the way.

368
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,850
[ZAKURO]
All right.

369
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,897
[KIKKA] Has he got some
kind of death wish?

370
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,108
That was hilarious! Ha, ha, ha!

371
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,528
Did little Mr. Vengeance think
his fury made him invincible?

372
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,030
[laughing]

373
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,491
Yeah, well, he's
serious to a fault.

374
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,327
So I'd appreciate it if
you stopped teasing him.

375
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,163
Oh! So you knew I was
lying about that stuff?

376
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,124
I mean, I was just
giving him grief

377
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,084
because he was acting
like such a dummy.

378
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,169
And with as many
dolls as I've had,

379
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,463
I can't remember
all their faces.

380
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,881
[KAIKOKU]
You don't say.

381
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,176
Sounds to me like you're
just begging to punished.

382
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,388
[KIKKA]
You're really irritating.

383
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,640
I didn't like you from
the moment I saw you.

384
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,977
A garbage doll like you
deserves to be crushed.

385
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,064
[KIKKA]
Grandpa! Can you hear me?!

386
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:37,570
I've got one I don't want! Hurry
down! He needs you to stomp him!

387
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,160
Where is he?

388
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,580
Why isn't he coming
down to help me?

389
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,623
[whimpers] Grandpa!

390
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,709
Grandpa!

391
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,839
I'm sorry, my dear Kikka.

392
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,718
The only thing I want
is to be with you.

393
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,181
[KAIKOKU] You really ought to
stop relying on him, y'know.

394
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,850
If you don't learn how
to curb your selfishness,

395
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,685
he'll grow disgusted with you.

396
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,228
That'd never happen!

397
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,522
My grandpa loves me
more than anything!

398
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,107
Are you stupid or something?

399
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,611
There's no grandpa in the world
who resents their grandkids!

400
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,489
[KAIKOKU]
That's where you're wrong.

401
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,533
Not all families get
along with each other.

402
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,578
You choose your own path,
you get cast out.

403
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,622
It's only natural.

404
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,749
[KIKKA gasping]

405
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,043
[KAIKOKU]
Tell me the truth.

406
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,545
Do you really not
remember her face?

407
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,131
[whimpers]

408
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,189
Heh.

409
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,192
Now I get it;
your family hates you.

410
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,779
[KIKKA]
You're just jealous, I bet.

411
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,990
Of how much me and my
grandpa love each other.

412
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,328
[laughs]

413
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,664
You poor thing.

414
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,253
[KIKKA] Oh, you poor,
little, broken doll.

415
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,348
[KAIKOKU]
Hmph.

416
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,268
Man, you really don't
trust me, do you?

417
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,936
[ZAKURO]
Onigasaki.

418
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,653
[ZAKURO]
Let's go home.
