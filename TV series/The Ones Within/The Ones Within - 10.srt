1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,561
What's that?

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,063
[KAIKOKU]
Stay back!

3
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,654
[KAIKOKU]
Is that... a mermaid?

4
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,702
[KAIKOKU]
Nope.

5
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,454
[SAKURA]
It's a goldfish.

6
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,554
[SAKURA] It's huge!
Wonder if it's a mutant.

7
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,183
Huh? Check out that mark
next to the dorsal fin!

8
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,935
It almost looks like
a person's face!

9
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,396
All right, let's head back.

10
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,523
[SAKURA]
Hey, you should watch your step.

11
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,901
That part gets pretty deep!

12
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,653
Let me lead.

13
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,822
You know the way?

14
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,659
I come here all
the time in secret.

15
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,996
[KAIKOKU] Now I know why her
brother worries about her.

16
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,752
[KAIKOKU grunts]

Uh...?

19
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,344
[SAKURA]
Mister? Where'd you go?

20
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,146
Welcome back, Hiro.
Did you find Sakura?

21
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,107
[CHIHIRO whimpers]

22
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,109
She's really gone.

23
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,363
I checked her room, the shower,
and even the mushroom spot!

24
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,156
She's not anywhere!

25
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,702
Well, I'm sure she's out
on one of her excursions.

26
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,121
Huh? Where's the guy?

27
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,666
[NANAMI] If you mean Onigasaki,
I sent him to the waterway.

28
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,084
[CHIHIRO]
You're so stupid!

29
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,711
Hey, don't knock me over!

30
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,131
What if he ends up being
alone with poor Sakura?

31
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,173
[NANAMI]
It'd be for the best.

32
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,592
That way they could
walk home together.

33
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,219
[CHIHIRO]
Walk home together?!

34
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,764
Don't say stuff like that,
Nanami! I gotta go find her!

35
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,558
[NANAMI]
Not so fast!

36
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,022
I'm coming with you.

37
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,998
[ANYA] So, what's this
about a lasagna rhythm?

38
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,000
It's the "Luhn algorithm."

39
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,543
Huh?

40
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,670
[YUZU] A common example
is the sequence of numbers

41
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:17,299
on a credit card. At first
glance, they may seem random,

42
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,385
but they actually adhere
to a strict set of rules.

43
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,846
In fact, I'll use a
five‐by‐ten puzzle

44
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,931
to help you understand it.

45
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,975
The only numbers that
conform to the algorithm

46
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,894
are found in the
very first row‐‐

47
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,230
10, 20, 30, and so forth.

48
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,357
After the first row,
the numbers are random,

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,776
but they're never
greater than the number

50
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,652
in the next column over.

51
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,739
In other words, whether a piece
conforms to the algorithm

52
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,284
or not indicates whether
it's horizontal or vertical.

53
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,536
The important takeaway
here is that five‐by‐ten

54
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,831
is the number of row
and column pieces.

55
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,876
Therefore, if we split up the
puzzle into vertical sections,

56
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,170
we can suss out the piece
that doesn't belong.

57
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,423
Only one of the columns
will have an extra piece.

58
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,634
And once we assemble
the ones in that column,

59
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,011
then, whatever piece remains...

60
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,680
Should have the right
passcode on it!

61
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,236
[KAIKOKU]
Can't breathe!

How nostalgic.

You're still alive, huh?

70

[SAKURA]
You know this fish?

71
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,869
[NANAMI] Yes. One of
the tests four years ago

72
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,997
was something called
"goldfish scooping."

73
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,792
And this resilient fellow
here was the target.

74
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:16,668
But I have to say,

75
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,671
he was much more adorable
back in the day.

Now then, let's return.

Uh‐oh, it's still following us.

81
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,359
Ah yes, it's probably
thinking about

82
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,528
what a delicious little
snack you'd make.

83
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,988
[SAKURA]
Uh...

84
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,699
Please don't say
stuff like that!

85
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,999
Are you sure you'll
be okay by yourself?

86
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,794
Positive. We're done splitting
the puzzle into sections,

87
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,130
all that's left is to solve it.

88
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,590
It's nothing personal,

I just work better solo.

Then again, if you're
that worried,

91

you can leave Karirin
behind as my body pillow.

In the unlikely case I fail,

Anboy's idea can be
our last‐ditch effort.

00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,770
[CHIHIRO]
I want milk in mine.

162
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,397
[NANAMI]
Coming up.

163
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,942
That's true, nothing happened

164
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,236
when Hiro and I escaped
the White Room, either.

165
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,281
Guess maybe the surveillance
cameras didn't see us.

166
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,287
[KAIKOKU] But what if this
is what he wants?

167
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,998
It's possible he already knows
about the escape route,

168
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,333
and he's using me as
bait so he can catch

169
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,336
all of the dropouts at once.

170
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,297
[NANAMI]
That could be it.

171
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,216
In which case, we'll be
forced to put up a fight.

172
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,969
And if that happens,
we'll need your strength.

173
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,890
Onigasaki. What do you say
to joining our cause?

174
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,018
[KAIKOKU]
No thanks.

175
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,894
[NANAMI gasps]

[grunts]

177
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,691
Hate to say it, but sneaking
around isn't really my style.

178
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:36,112
I'd rather fly solo
and do my own thing.

179
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,530
I understand.

180
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,781
Either way, though,

181
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,952
we should still meet up
and trade intel sometimes.

182
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,871
[sneezes]

183
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:48,625
[NANAMI] Goodness, your
face is looking flushed.

184
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,922
[YUZU coughing]

185
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,217
Crap, I fell asleep.

186
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,552
[YUZU coughing]

187
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,512
[KARIN]
Yuzu!

188
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,892
Sorry. I threw up.
I'm just anemic.

189
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,853
[KARIN] Hang on‐‐
I'll go get somebody!

190
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,104
[YUZU]
No.

191
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,815
[KARIN] Don't argue
with me, you need help!

192
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,867
Karirin was crying.

193
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,536
I have to get back to work soon.

194
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,206
I need... touch.

195
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,541
I'm so lonely.

196
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,648
Oh, Sis, it's you.

197
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,756
[PAKA]
I'll help you this once.

198
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,967
You owe me.

199
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:30,768
[PAKA] Next time, don't forget
who your master is... Recorder.

200
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,528
[SAKURA]
Your temperature's high.

201
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,406
Wow, all this just because
of a little water?

202
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,449
You're so delicate.

203
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,951
[KAIKOKU grumbles]

204
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,996
Uh! Well, to be fair,
I'm sure you're exhausted

205
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,081
from being in an
unfamiliar place!

206
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,374
Uh?

207
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,543
Hey, what're those?

208
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,670
Oh, yeah.

209
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,423
Omejima gave these
to me earlier.

210
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,346
[KAIKOKU] Man. Four whole
years and he still has them.

211
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,182
Nanami refuses to give
up on his partner.

212
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,267
No matter what.

213
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,062
I guess he believes he'll
come back and save him,

214
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,938
but who knows?

215
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,275
So what do you plan to do?

216
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,109
Huh?

217
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,363
If you come with me,
you can see your brother.

218
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,281
[SAKURA gasping]

219
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,582
[DOOR 10A]
Correct passcode confirmed.

220
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:38,836
Access to special section
B‐13 is now available.

221
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,217
[SAKURA]
I don't think Hiro

222
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,469
would want to leave
Nanami behind.

223
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,470
[KAIKOKU]
Hmm...

224
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,598
[SAKURA] He was the same
way when I dropped out.

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,683
He got himself
banished on purpose

226
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,479
because he thought I would
be scared to go by myself.

227
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:02,151
Zakuro's my family, so of course
I want to see him, but...

228
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:04,737
The three of us are
a family now, too.

229
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,073
I can't abandon them.

230
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,623
Listen, we've got a situation!

231
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,251
Dunno how, but people
are calling for you!

232
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,044
They're outside the White Room!

233
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,212
[gasps]

234
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,509
[ZAKURO]
Onigasaki! Open up!

235
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,513
Kaikoku, are you okay in there?

236
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,764
[ZAKURO]
Answer us!

237
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,099
I don't hear him.

238
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,184
[HIMIKO]
Oh no, what if he fainted?

239
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,979
[ANYA] What a pain in the ass.
Kick the door in!

240
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,065
[ZAKURO] All right.
We'll give it ten more seconds.

241
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:44,068
[NANAMI] Oh, dear. Who knew
these kids were so direct?

242
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,571
Hurry and bring him back, Hiro!

243
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,908
I have to think of a
way to buy some time.

244
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,410
Wait, I know!

245
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,830
Look! There's a piece of
paper under the door!

246
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:56,914
[ZAKURO]
"Occupied"?

247
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,748
[AKATSUKI]
What?

248
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,083
How do we know
that's really him?

249
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,210
The writing's all
cute and bubbly!

250
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,546
[ZAKURO] Hold on, there's
another one coming.

251
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:04,964
It is fake!

[AKATSUKI]

made things worse!

00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,138
Shh!

255
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:18,269
[AKATSUKI] Kaikoku. I have
something important to tell you.

256
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:22,315
After you left, we played
a game to bring you back.

Please don't worry. You'll
be out of there soon, so‐‐!

Listen.

[ZAKURO] Roromori's resting
in the infirmary right now.

260

Roro?

261
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,668
[ZAKURO] She worked so
hard to solve the puzzle

262
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,504
that she collapsed.

263
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,095
[ZAKURO]
So, come out!

264

[ZAKURO]
Hey, Onigasaki!

00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,497
Don't let Zakuro find out.

272
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,625
He can be emotional.

273
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,677
We'll see you.

274
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,352
There you are!

275
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,395
[KAIKOKU]
Yeah, sorry.

I didn't mean to make you wait‐‐

Uh!

278
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,232
What was that for?

279
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,193
It's punishment
for being stupid.

280
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,030
Not sure what you're
getting at, but okay.

281
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,534
Ah! Sorry, sorry, don't mind me!

282

[MAKINO exhales]

283
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,246
Why are you breathing on me?

284
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,123
It's a welcome‐back ritual!

285

[AKATSUKI, HIMIKO humming]

286
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,594
[ZAKURO]
You learned your lesson, right?

287
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,221
Don't pull a stunt
like that again.

288
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,902
Hey, give me your
hand for a sec.

289
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,279
[ZAKURO]
Why?

290
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,530
[KAIKOKU]
Just do it.

291

[ZAKURO]
Uh!

00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,036
Onigasaki?

293
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm happy you're safe.

[ZAKURO]
Huh? Oh, uh, thanks.

[KAIKOKU]
Sorry, Sakura.

I don't think your
message got through.

[door slides]

00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,899
So, you're back. Good.

Yeah, sure am.

[KAIKOKU]
How do you feel?

302
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,407
As you can see,
I'm right as rain!

303
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:24,121
Although, my diligent nurse
is refusing to discharge me.

304
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,459
I should be back
in the game tomorrow.

305
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,462
[KAIKOKU]
I talked to Iride and Oshigiri.

306
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,964
You pushed yourself
way too hard.

307
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,007
It's all right.

308
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,427
What happened to you
was partly my fault.

309
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,767
You have questions
for me, don't you?

310
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,477
I'm all ears.

311
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,981
[KAIKOKU] I found some
questionable documents

312
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,566
in your room.

313
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,611
They were full of information
about the rest of us.

314
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,784
So, someone did disturb them.

315
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,704
I noticed my photos of Akki
were tilted differently,

316
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,457
and I had a suspicion
that you were responsible.

317
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,341
Those reports. They're recent.

318
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,551
Does that mean my grandpa‐‐?

319
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,386
Yes, it's true.

320
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,807
Sorry I stayed quiet.

321
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,270
You see, I am this
game's record keeper.

322
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,731
I work for Mr. Alpaca.

323
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:38,237
My job is to monitor
the game from the inside.

324
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,158
I give him information, though
he doesn't tell me much at all.

325
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,702
Facts about everyone's
participation,

326
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,289
the thoughts and feelings I
observe, progress, results,

327
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,210
things I learned through my own
involvement with the game.

328
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,298
I took this role on out
of pure curiosity.

329
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,968
As you already know, I've got
quite an obsession with Akki.

330
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,387
I was eager to do anything
that would give me a chance

331
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,098
to learn more about him.

332
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,768
I was happy, but...

333
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,480
Should I have been, really?

334
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,484
I didn't want the game to
continue without you or anyone.

335
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,403
It's understandable that
you don't trust me.

336
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,575
[YUZU] I'm aware that my
behavior is suspect, but...

337
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:28,579
...I'm not sure how long
I can play the clown.

338
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:37,046
[YUZU] You choose what to do,
with me and the files.

339
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,007
[exhales]

340
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,259
[KAIKOKU] I'm not good at
dealing with this stuff.

341
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,469
[YUZU]
Uh?

342
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,971
My only question

343
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,099
is whether I should consider
you a friend or a foe.

344
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,893
Nothing more.

345
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,979
If it's the former, we can
get back to gossiping.

346
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,731
If it's the latter,
I'll make you pay

347
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,692
for what you did and
then we can gossip.

348
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,362
[YUZU]
Heh.

349
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,240
You sure love chit‐chat,
don't you, Kai?

350
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,201
Yeah. You're the only
one I can talk with,

351
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,829
and I can't lose that.

352
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,622
Which is why...

353
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm requesting a truce.

354
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,794
If you decide you agree,
let me know.

355
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,221
[YUZU]
Right.

356
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:24,570
[ZAKURO]
Onigasaki! There you are!

357
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,363
I thought I told you
not to wander off

358
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,073
by yourself without telling me!

359
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:31,327
Wow, you're not very
emotionally stable, are you?

360
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,579
[ZAKURO] I'll show you
emotionally stable!

361
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,748
My mistake.

362
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,583
Bye, Roro. Feel better.

363
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,503
[ZAKURO] Hey, don't push me!
I'll fight you if I have to!

364
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,173
[YUZU]
Thanks. I will.

365
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,925
Tomorrow, then.
