1
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,680
[YUZU]
Oh, gosh.

2
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,390
[ZAKURO]
I could go for some mushrooms.

3
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,184
[ANYA]
Yeah, what else is new?

4
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,101
[AKATSUKI laughing]

5
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,853
[ALL chattering]

6
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,272
[PAKA]
Oh, good, everyone's present.

7
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,816
Thank you all for
joining me today.

8
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,320
[PAKA] Uh... I‐I'd like to
begin Game Number Nine,

9
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,614
if it isn't too much trouble.

10
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,326
Um, but if you'd rather wait
till tomorrow, that's fine, too.

11
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,869
[KARIN]
We can't hear you.

12
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,871
Oh, no. Is something wrong?

13
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,082
Why won't you come
into the room with us?

14
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,333
[PAKA]
Well, it seems I'm still

15
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,086
unanimously despised
after last time.

16
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,339
So I wasn't sure of the wisest
way to approach you all.

17
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,882
[ANYA]
Boo‐hoo.

18
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,134
[PAKA]
Ms. Sarayashiki and Mr. Kudou

19
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,720
are casting such
hateful glares at me.

20
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,013
What's the big deal?

21
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:00,889
I always do.

22
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,265
[PAKA]
And Mr. Onigasaki

23
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,726
has his hand poised
on his katana.

24
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,144
[KAIKOKU]
I always do.

25
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,938
[PAKA]
I‐Is that a fact?

26
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,858
[AKATSUKI] Relax, Mr. Paka.
I'm over it already.

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,903
[PAKA]
Oh. Mr. Iride!

28
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,154
[clears throat]

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,199
Then, let's try
this again, shall we?

30
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,747
[PAKA] I am thrilled to
congratulate all of you on your

31
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,501
impressive accomplishment of
reaching 50 million views!

32
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,961
At this point, a hundred million

33
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,171
doesn't seem like
such a pipe dream!

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,175
So, without further ado, let's
shoot for the stars again today!

35
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,095
Time for Game Number Nine!

36
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,513
[PLAYERS grumble]

37
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,265
Yeah!

38
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,853
[PAKA] In celebration
of your milestone,

39
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,731
I have prepared an
exciting virtual simulation

40
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,233
for your exploration
and enjoyment!

41
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:55,277
The first step is to
synchronize your avatars,

42
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,070
so please enter your capsules!

43
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:58,780
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

44
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:02,367
Whoa! It's just like
a cryogenic chamber!

45
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,952
[ANYA]
Huh? What's that?

46
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,829
Where you sleep
for a long time!

47
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,124
They're pretty common
in sci‐fi movies.

48
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,250
Close me in!

49
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,419
Machines like these are
designed to preserve life

50
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:15,130
at low temperatures.
If someone has an illness

51
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,926
that's incurable today, it might
be curable in the future.

52
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,928
Incurable, huh?

53
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,346
Uh, Anya...

54
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,306
[PAKA]
Once you're inside,

55
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,350
we'll begin synchronizing
your personality data.

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,520
Lie down with the lid closed
and hold tight for a moment,

57
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,272
if you'd be so kind.

58
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,247
[AKATSUKI groaning]
Ow!

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,999
Hey, that hurts!

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,752
Stop it before you
pull my hair out!

61
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,961
[YUZU squeaks]

62
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:05,222
[PAKA] Welcome all to "The
Ones Within Kindergarten!"

63
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,474
For those of you playing
the "parent" roles,

64
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,476
your objective is
to foster a positive

65
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,020
relationship with
these precious rugrats.

66
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,480
[AKATSUKI]
So cute!

67
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,482
[PAKA] The children,
or "Instant Avatars,"

68
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,984
have fledgling plants growing
out of the tops of their

69
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,446
little noggins to signify
their affection levels.

70
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,949
The plants are of various types,
but as long as at least

71
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,868
three of them blossom,
the game will be cleared.

72
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,496
[ZAKURO sighs] This is so
many kinds of messed‐up.

73
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,539
[PAKA]
Eh?

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,124
So, did they turn into kids?

75
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,418
[PAKA]
Oh no, that'd be ridiculous!

76
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,255
These are an advanced breed
of Mimicry Man‐Eaters.

77
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,090
They can imitate
one's personality

78
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,883
through the use of an AI chip.

79
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,553
But since the real people
are synchronized,

80
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,346
they won't be able to
exit the capsules

81
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,557
until the game has
been completed.

82
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,976
[ZAKURO] Are you saying
if we don't win the game‐‐?

83
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,561
[PAKA]
Precisely.

84
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,022
Your teammates will remain in
a deep sleep for all eternity.

85
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,692
[PLAYERS gasp]

86
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,444
[PAKA] Coincidentally, this
exact same configuration

87
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,407
of players has already done
one challenge together.

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,285
I'm looking forward
to the results.

89
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,621
Now that the games are back in
full swing, we can observe how

90
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,291
strong your bonds
have really become.

91
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,294
Anyway, you must excuse me.

92
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,006
‐‐[grunts]
‐‐[PAKA] Ow!

93
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,257
Screw you, asshole!

94
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,218
[wails]

95
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,512
Aw, don't cry. It's okay.

96
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,306
Come here, Himiko.

97
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,225
[KARIN]
Poor baby.

98
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,604
I'm sowwy the bad man
made a scawy face at you.

99
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,939
[ANYA]
Why am I a bad man?!

100
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,904
[AKATSUKI] Huh? You want
attention too, Yuzu?

101
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,530
[coos]

102
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:50,577
My back is gonna be feeling
this tomorrow, for sure.

103
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,579
[ZAKURO]
All right, fine.

104
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,290
Come on, Onigasaki.

105
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,252
[ZAKURO]
Huh?

106
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,051
[ZAKURO]
Oh, great, real classy!

107
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,556
[ZAKURO]
Aikawa. Do you want a hug?

108
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,520
Shoulda known. This guy's
the same as always!

109
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,439
[KARIN] What are we
supposed to do now?

110
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,609
[AKATSUKI] It's around noon, so
maybe we should feed them lunch!

111
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,527
[KAIKOKU]
Sushi! Sushi!

112
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,612
[ZAKURO]
Then they can take a nap.

113
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,238
[ANYA] Did all of you just
flip on your mom‐switch

114
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,782
at the same time?

115
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,533
[HIMIKO wails]

116
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,119
[AKATSUKI] Anya, I think
it would be best if you...

117
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,287
[ANYA]
I'm that scary?!

118
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,331
[AKATSUKI] Well,
I didn't want to say, but...

119
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,166
[ANYA] Come on, tell me
the truth, I can take it!

120
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,043
[AKATSUKI] Oh, I know,
let's make silly faces!

121
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,295
‐‐that'll be a lot more fun!
‐‐[ANYA] What? Answer me!

122
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,639
All right, boys and girls.

123
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,099
Let's put our hands together!

124
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,892
It's time to say
thanks for the food.

125
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,895
To us, and, of course,
to Mr. Paka, too!

126
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,146
‐‐[YUZU] Thanks for the food!
‐‐[PLAYERS] Thank you.

127
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,064
[KAIKOKU]
Sushi!

128
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,941
Good! Now let's dig in!

129
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,819
‐‐[KAIKOKU] Sushi!
‐‐[ANYA] Eh, might as well.

130
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,280
[KARIN] Uh, why do the so‐called
parents have kids' meals, too?

131
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,408
If we eat the same
thing as they do,

132
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,827
then maybe we can
understand them better.

133
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,953
[KARIN]
Yeah, right.

134
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,871
You wanted to eat this,
didn't you?

135
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,331
It comes with a toy.

136
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,709
And I'm such a sucker
for collecting things!

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,586
I've almost got the complete
Mr. Paka series!

138
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,797
[KARIN] Ugh, you're
just feeding his ego.

139
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,799
[AKATSUKI] Oh, and I ended up
with two of these headbands,

140
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,884
so I'll give Anya the extra.

141
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,052
Get that thing away from me

142
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:33,638
or I'll make your ears
into a headband.

143
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,724
Please don't yell at me.

144
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,100
[ANYA]
Ugh.

145
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,520
[HIMIKO whimpering]

146
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,605
Huh?

147
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,440
Now what?!

148
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,108
[HIMIKO wails]

149
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,568
Oh, perfect.

150
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,861
Punitsuki, crate now!

151
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,906
Hey, get outta my helmet! That's
not your crate, you hear me?

152
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,201
[ZAKURO]
Stop yelling.

153
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,287
You're upsetting the children.

154
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,789
[KARIN, AKATSUKI, ANYA]
Uh...

155
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,374
[ZAKURO]
Uh, what's wrong?

156

[ANYA]
Are you that tired?

167
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,658
Anyway, how do we
get the plants to grow?

168

[AKATSUKI] Hm... We're supposed
to make them happy, right?

169
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,830
Normally, this is
the kind of thing

170
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,833
Makino and Himiko
would be good at, but...

[ANYA] Yeah, they're
not much help now.

like rolled omelets, huh?

Food helps.

You know. I think smiling

179
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,697
might be the first step to
making these kids like us.

[ANYA]
Smiling?

And Anya only smiles when
he's insulting somebody.

You'd be surprised
how much attention

186
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,132

facial expressions.

187

So, understand?

00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,512
It's the smile!

Hey, Akki! I, um...

that happened, but great!

potty before your nap?

Huh?

[AKATSUKI]
Makino's acting weird, huh?

205
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,315
[ZAKURO]
I wouldn't say "weird,"

206
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,650
but he's extremely
quiet and mellow.

207
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,485
He won't even look at me.

Uh, isn't that how he
normally acts, though?

[KARIN] Oh, right,
now that you mention it,

210

Makino's plant is the only one
that hasn't started to grow yet.

[ZAKURO] I know he's never
been the outgoing type,

I'm worried about him.

Oh, thank goodness!

That must've been
a bad nightmare.

gave her an omelet,

and sure enough,
the flower popped right up!

Well, that's the power
of omelets, I guess.

Awesome!

[YUZU] Now for Anboy's
bubble‐blowing course!

312
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,663
One‐minute shoulder‐ride!

313
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,374
Playing house! Hide‐and‐seek...

314
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,708
Therapeutic massage...!

315
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,168
Uh, egg gymnastics!

316
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,962
Afro!

317
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,756
[GROUP sighs]

318
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,092
[ZAKURO]
Has it gotten bigger?

319
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,635
[KARIN]
Maybe?

320
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:36,055
[YUZU]
Hard to tell.

321
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,517
You think there's anything
you can do for him, Zak?

322
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,519
[ZAKURO]
Not that I know of.

323
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,105
[KAIKOKU] The two of you
are the same age, right?

324
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,108
Why not try using his
first name for a change?

325
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,609
[ZAKURO]
Uh. What? No.

326
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,319
Oh, yeah. I like that idea!

327
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,404
[ZAKURO]
You don't really think that'll

328
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,697
make a difference, do you?

329
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,742
I mean, it's not that I'm
against it or anything.

330
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,077
Ugh.

331
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,036
[ZAKURO]
What's your problem?!

332
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,329
[ANYA]
Just suck it up and say it!

333
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,789
[KARIN]
What should we do now?

334
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,250
[YUZU] Oh, I've been doing
something the whole time.

335
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,627
Just good old‐fashioned
snuggles!

336
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,922
Right, little guy?
Feels nice, huh?

337
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,724
[footsteps]

338
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,310
[door opens, closes]

339
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,316
The moon is pretty, huh?

340
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,528
Anyway, can we talk about love?

341
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,781
The truth is,
I don't remember my past.

342
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,284
My mom isn't my
biological mother.

343
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,746
She's warm and cheerful
and always smiling.

344
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,164
I love her.

345
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:48,210
Sometimes she doesn't really
see me, but I don't mind.

346
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,298
'Cause I love her,

347
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,758
you know?

348
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:59,388
[AKATSUKI] Do you have someone
you love too, Makino?

349
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,515
It's good to feel that way,

350
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:05,436
and it's fine if the person
doesn't return your feelings.

351
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,480
They might not
notice you at all,

352
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,773
or there might be someone else

353
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,943
who means more to
them than you do.

354
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,740
Do you think you can
accept that, Makino?

355
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:23,162
'Cause if you can,
it won't hurt anymore.

356
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:29,001
[AKATSUKI] So accept it,
and keep moving forward.

357
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,882
[MAKINO]
Accept it?

358
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,434
[MAKINO] The people who gave
birth to me won't look at me.

359
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:49,438
The person Sumire
loves isn't me.

360
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,522
[MAKINO]
Accept it.

361
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,579
[MAKINO]
Accept it.

362
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,754
[MAKINO]
My heart. It's been broken.

363
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,382
[BOTH gasp]

364
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,301
How did we do that?

365
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,260
Who knows?

366
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,512
Whatever it was,
we're short on time!

367
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,014
Say it, Zak!

368
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,724
[ZAKURO]
Uh. Uh...

369
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,313
[ZAKURO]
Ma... Ma...

370
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,566
M‐Ma... Ma...

371
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,193
M‐Ma...

372
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,694
Uh. I'm sorry.

373
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,529
I've always had a hard
time referring to people

374
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,532
by their first names.

375
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:28,621
But... I really do want to get
to know you better, Aikawa.

376
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,373
So, here goes!

377
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,336
[ZAKURO]
Do you think, starting today,

378
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,089
I could call you Makino instead?

379
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,514
[ZAKURO]
Aika‐‐ Uh, Makino!

380
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,015
This is painful to watch.

381
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,266
Hey, he's trying!

382
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,477
You guys, it worked!

383
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,028
[ALL laughing]

384
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,908
[laughs]

385
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,670
[PAKA]
How about that?

386
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,507
I suppose it's time for
the fun to begin in earnest.
