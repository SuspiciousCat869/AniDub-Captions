1
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:17,935
[PAKA grunting]

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,356
[PAKA] The next game
will be exceedingly simple.

3
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,691
[PAKA sighs]

4
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,819
[PAKA] The challenge will take
place here, in the remote ruins

5
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,073
of Thirteenth Avenue's
Dry Dry Desert.

6
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,284
You are to venture into the
deepest depths of this structure

7
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,539
and obtain Chromosome Zero‐Five
from the guard waiting inside.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,540
That is all.

9
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,750
Um. Seriously?

10
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,920
[PAKA] However, only two
Let's Players may participate

11
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,340
this time. One male
and one female.

12
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,550
[ZAKURO gasps]

13
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,093
[KAIKOKU]
Heh.

14
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,720
[PAKA] Now, get ready
for a heart‐throbbing,

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,765
couple‐making adventure!
Heh, heh, heh!

16
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,158
[HIMIKO whimpers]

17
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
[ANYA]
Dang, don't cry about it!

18
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,290
And why are you only
afraid of me, huh?

19
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,251
Quit teasing poor Himiko,
you big jerk!

20
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,004
"Teasing her"?! I should
be the one crying here!

21
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,383
[PAKA] I am a reasonable man,
Mr. Kudou. And as such,

22
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,052
I wouldn't dream of flying
into a fit of jealousy

23
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,804
and killing you over this.

24
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,556
But tomorrow, you will get
an extra helping of peppers!

25
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,933
[ANYA]
Don't you dare!

26
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,017
[AKATSUKI]
Uh, guys?

27
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,686
If you want me to, I could‐‐

28
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,853
[YUZU]
Forget it.

29
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,980
You've still got a
broken bone, remember?

30
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,023
Heh...

31
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:11,650
[YUZU]
You need to take it easy.

32
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,361
[AKATSUKI] Oh, it's fine.
I'm ambidextrous, so‐‐

33
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,987
Nope, take it easy.

34
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,614
[AKATSUKI]
But I had perfect attendance.

35
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,574
Take it easy.

36
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,575
[HIMIKO]
Hmm...

37
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,411
[AKATSUKI]
It'll be okay, Himiko.

38
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,413
Anya can be a little
hotheaded sometimes,

39
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,248
but he's actually pretty kind.

40
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,249
[gasps]

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,208
This one time,

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,919
he spent like an hour helping
a beetle find its way outside.

43
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,795
I was watching him!

44
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,965
[growls] Did you really waste a
whole hour watching that crap?!

45
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,634
[ZAKURO] We already drew for it,
so let's just move on.

46
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,677
[ANYA]
Shut up!

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,387
We all know that if you
were in my shoes,

48
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,556
you'd be squealing and
crying like a baby!

49
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,642
[ZAKURO] Trust me, I do not
squeal, and I don't cry.

50
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,770
Yeah? You want me to
make you cry right now?

51
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,980
[PAKA]
Gentlemen!

52
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,899
Please, hold your excitement
until I've explained.

53
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,110
This next stage may appear easy,

54
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,363
but there's one rule you
absolutely can't break.

55
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,573
What's that?

56
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,742
[PAKA]
Under no circumstances

57
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,077
will you be permitted
to tell a lie.

58
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,288
[HIMIKO, ANYA grunt, exhale]

59
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,667
[footsteps]

60
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,673
I‐Is it me, or is the
hallway getting narrower?

61
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,508
Ugh. Just hurry.

62
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,802
Stop falling behind. Tch.

63
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,013
[HIMIKO]
He clicked his tongue at me!

64
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,433
What do I do?
I don't want to make him mad!

65
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,069
[ANYA] Whoa! I know I
said not to fall behind,

66
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,906
but now she's walking
way too close!

67
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,116
Come on, me, say something!

68
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,244
Uh?

69
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,917
[ANYA]
Hey, you gonna talk, or what?

70
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,045
Kudou, have you been
sleeping properly?

71
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,214
Are you taking your medicine?

72
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,673
Huh? What the‐‐?

73
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,008
[HIMIKO]
When we passed by the light,

74
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,428
I noticed the bags under your
eyes are darker than usual.

75
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,305
[ANYA grunts]

76
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,432
[ANYA]
I'm fine.

77
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,309
[HIMIKO]
I'm sorry, but I can't tell

78
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,102
if you're being
honest with me.

79
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,897
[ANYA] I sleep like a log,
now drop it, already!

80
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,527
[HIMIKO gasps]

81
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,154
[MUMMIES moaning]

82
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,740
What was that? Sounds bad!

83
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,993
Yeah. Stand back. Let's see.

84
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,831
[MUMMIES moaning]

85
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,169
[ANYA gasping]

86
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,295
[HIMIKO gasps]

87
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,549
[MUMMIES moaning]

88
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:49,933
[KARIN] Is it really okay for us
to lounge around like this?

89
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,852
[sighs] Well, what
else can we do?

90
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,062
It's so dark down there,
even the Pakameras

91
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,939
didn't want to
follow them inside.

92
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,276
[PAKA] Indeed, even I'm worried
about Ms. Inaba's well‐being.

93
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,779
All alone with a young man
in a place like that.

94
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,282
The brute had better
not get any saucy ideas.

95
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,741
[PAKA growls]

96
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,452
[KARIN] Hold on, why are you
here kicking back with us?!

97
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,163
Get out of here!
And bring me another pudding!

98
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,624
Aren't you burning up
in that suit, Paka?

99
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,626
I hope you aren't
getting dehydrated.

100
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,919
[PAKA]
It's quite all right.

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,839
In the past, I suffered
burns to my entire body.

102
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:24,301
So, unfortunately, I can no
longer expose my skin.

103
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,177
[AKATSUKI]
Oh, I didn't know.

104
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,271
[ZAKURO]
Need a drink?

105
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,524
[KAIKOKU]
Thanks.

106
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,490
[ZAKURO]
I'm sorry about the other day.

107
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,451
What for?

108
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,536
[ZAKURO]
Back at the demon hideout.

109
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,959
[ZAKURO] I lost my cool
because of my sister.

110
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,254
I couldn't stay calm.

111
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,340
I'm not sure what you mean.

112
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,224
[KAIKOKU] So, are you any
closer to finding her?

113
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,394
[ZAKURO] No. I asked Paka
about it later on,

114
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,980
but he insisted he
didn't know anything.

115
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,274
[KAIKOKU]
That sounds about right.

116
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:23,401
Oshigiri.

117
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,321
What do you think about Iride?

118
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:27,781
[ZAKURO]
I dunno.

119
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,784
I guess he's what a little
brother would be like.

120
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,619
[KAIKOKU]
No, not like that.

121
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,495
[ZAKURO]
Huh?

122
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,998
I'm saying that I'm
suspicious of him.

123
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,624
[MUMMIES moaning]

124
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,960
[ANYA]
Whoa, what the hell are these?

125
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,546
I get it. Maybe one
of us told a lie,

126
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,090
and now we're getting
our punishment

127
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,759
for not following the rules.

128
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,427
Wait! That must mean

129
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,097
that you haven't been getting
enough sleep after all!

130
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,391
Is that what you're
worried about right now?!

131
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,977
[MUMMIES moan]

132
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:02,190
[ANYA] Okay. Do we go back,
or try to break through?

133
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,984
[HIMIKO]
We should break through.

134
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,068
[ANYA gasps]

135
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,197
[HIMIKO] We can wait for an
opening and slip right past.

136
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,323
Smart.

137
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,701
You're tiny enough that you
can squeeze through 'em!

138
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,869
Yeah. Here goes!

139
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,207
[ANYA yells]

140
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,711
[MUMMIES groaning]

141
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,049
[HIMIKO gasps]
The path!

142
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,260
Let's just run for it!

143
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,346
[gasps] Kudou!

144
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,149
That's it! You're dead!

145
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,571
[ANYA]
Hey!

146
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,905
[HIMIKO gasps]

147
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,451
[screams]

148
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,702
[ANYA]
Moron!

149
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,538
[ANYA grunting]

150
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,958
You're so frikkin' heavy!

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,835
Heavy...?

152
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,337
[BOTH scream]

153
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,885
[KENYA]
Quit following me!

154
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,220
Cheapskate! Go ahead
and leave already then!

155
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,181
I hope your dad gets
sick with hypothermia,

156
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,849
you big dumb stupidhead!

157
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,100
He's your dad, too.

158
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,560
[ANYA grunts, cries]

159

discussed the other day,

319
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,941
I'm afraid I still don't know a
thing about your dear sister.

320
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,067
[ZAKURO]
Not that.

321
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,196
What did you do to Roromori
and the others?

322
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,948
[PAKA] Why, I merely treated
them to some desserts.

323
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,742
[ZAKURO]
Don't play dumb. You were‐‐

324
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,620
[PAKA] Oh, I forgot
to mention something.

325
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,123
The cleaning of the White
Room is finally complete.

326
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:43,169
So perhaps one of you can
experience it soon.

327
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,713
[ZAKURO]
What is that, a threat?

328
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,883
[PAKA] No, you can
think of it as a warning.

329
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,553
The White Room isn't only for
players who are disqualified.

330
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,597
It's also a depository
for anyone

331
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,976
who severely disturbs
the harmony of the game.

332
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,895
But you shouldn't
be too worried.

333
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,813
The top contender
for the White Room

334
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,816
is currently Mr. Onigasaki.

335
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,360
[ZAKURO]
That's it!

336
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,989
[ZAKURO]
Aikawa.

337
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,824
They're calling you.

338
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,953
[ZAKURO]
Huh? Hey, stop!

339
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,750
[PAKA] Well, that was
certainly unexpected.

340
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:27,588
[ZAKURO] Aikawa,
tell me what's going on.

341
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,423
Who was calling for me?

342
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,718
I lied.

343
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,844
[ZAKURO gasps]

344
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,393
[SLIME hums]

345
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,186
[HIMIKO]
That's weird.

346
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,730
This thing looks
a lot like Iride.

347
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,023
[ANYA]
Why is it him?

348
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,235
[RUINS GUARD] Ah, so you both
see the same person then?

349
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,528
[ANYA, HIMIKO]
Huh?

350
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,655
[RUINS GUARD]
Question Two, Personal.

351
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,991
The two of you are being
confronted by the entity

352
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,119
who is closest to your heart
at this moment in time.

353
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,161
Wait a second!

354
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,455
[RUINS GUARD] You are to list
five of their admirable traits.

355
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,040
[SLIME hums]

356
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,420
Um, hello,
it's nice to meet you.

357
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,963
[ANYA]
Why would you pick it up?!

358
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,799
[HIMIKO]
Let's see...

359
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,510
Iride is kind, interesting,
attentive, sincere, and

360
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,346
being around him is just like
having a lovable big brother!

361
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,932
[RUINS GUARD] Oh my.
All that in five seconds!

362
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,892
I've got more, too.

363
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,185
[RUINS GUARD]
What about you?

364
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,523
[ANYA] Hm?! Yeah,
everything she just said.

365
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,985
Would you please stop
the ceiling thing?!

366
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,820
Ugh.

367
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,989
You only have to name
five things, Kudou.

368
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:35,948
I know you can do it!

369
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,868
Of course I can. Here goes.

370
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,456
[SLIME hums]

371
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,004
Argh, fine!

372
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,547
Uh...

373
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,967
I mean, I think he's kinda
interesting, I guess.

374
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,345
[ANYA]
What's wrong with that?!

375
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,680
[RUINS GUARD] I dislike
wishy‐washy people.

376
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,349
I prefer decisiveness.

377
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,518
Lemme think! Blockhead.

378
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,229
Don't cheer me up‐‐
it's distracting!

379
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,112
[SLIME cooing]

380
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,492
[ANYA]
Ah, shit. Four more.

381
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,785
Uh.

382
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,218
Well...

383
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,720
[gasps]

384
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,514
[ANYA]
He wakes me up every day.

385
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,226
He always eats all of my bell
peppers, and when I can't sleep,

386
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,229
he hangs out and plays
games with me.

387
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,234
[ANYA]
And, um...

388
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,737
He...

389
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,909
He doesn't treat me differently
because I'm sick.

390
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,289
[RUINS GUARD]
Very well.

391
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,041
That was pleasantly decisive.

392
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,171
[RUINS GUARD]
One final question.

393
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,509
[AKATSUKI]
It's beautiful.

394
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,804
I hope I can collect
the rest of them soon.

395
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,306
[YUZU]
Akki.

396
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,432
[AKATSUKI]
Uh?

397
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,311
Hey, Yuzu!

398
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,816
So, I was talking with Paka.

399
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,276
He said that if
nothing went wrong,

400
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,320
they'd be back in about an hour.

401
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,362
[YUZU]
Yeah.

402
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,989
[AKATSUKI] Do you think
if I went in there, too,

403
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,699
he would be angry at me?

404
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,452
[YUZU]
Probably. I sure would be.

405
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,411
Uh?

406
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,456
Today's mission.
It isn't for you.

407
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,542
[KARIN] Sheesh. They're
both holding their knees.

408
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,337
[KAIKOKU] So much for
Roro cheering him up.

409
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,255
[AKATSUKI]
Hey, everybody's here.

410
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,632
[ZAKURO]
Don't worry.

411
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,258
Even if something
were to happen,

412
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,803
Paka would make sure
they didn't die.

413
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,806
Besides, Kudou's hard
to kill, like a cockroach.

414
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,141
Hey, who are you callin'
a cockroach?!

415
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,185
I'll teach ya to talk
smack, punk ass!

416
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,436
We made it, guys!

417
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,938
[laughs]

418
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,231
Himiko's back!

419
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,565
And Anya!

420
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,651
Anya! [laughs]

421
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,037
[RUINS GUARD]
Final Question: Confessional.

422
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,414
Speak your sin aloud.

423
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,128
[HIMIKO]
Well...

424
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,922
...you see.

425
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,216
I killed my big brother.
