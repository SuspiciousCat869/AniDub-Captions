Is it all right, Mr. Ainosuke?

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
Isn't your equestrian test tomorrow?

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.528 position:50% align:center
It's the horse that runs, not me!

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
Indeed.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.408 position:50% align:center
Mr. Ainosuke?

00:00:33.408 --> 00:00:35.785 position:50% align:center
Wha... Please stop that!

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:37.912 position:50% align:center
Watch me, Tadashi!

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.258 position:50% align:center
Mr. Ainosuke! Are you all right?

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.976 position:50% align:center
Skating is really fun!

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.901 position:50% align:center
Tadashi...

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:12.238 position:50% align:center
Thank you for teaching me how to skate!

Thanks for the meal!

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.557 position:50% align:center

What about the parrotfish course?

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:25.789 position:50% align:center
All right! First one there
gets a bottle of juice!

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.498 position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
Not fair!

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:33.672 position:50% align:center
You must go visit all of your benefactors.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:35.632 position:50% align:center
It is important to solidify your organization.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
We have talked to the head of the family
about your marriage arrangements.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
We are all telling you this
for your sake, Ainosuke.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:46.101 position:50% align:center
That's right. This is all for your sake.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
Go hand this to that little redhead.

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.696 position:50% align:center
It's an invitation.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
Well then, I'll try it out.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.119 position:50% align:center
Go, Sketchy!

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:07.455 position:50% align:center
Whoa!

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
See? See?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.044 position:50% align:center
--Ouch!
--Ouch!

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.671 position:50% align:center
You done cleaning up?

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.715 position:50% align:center
We just have to toss the water out!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.341 position:50% align:center
I'll go toss it out.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.843 position:50% align:center
There!

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.262 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're good again.

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
Sorry about suddenly taking some time off!

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.935 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, too. Maybe I said
something I shouldn't have.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.353 position:50% align:center
No.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.772 position:50% align:center
It's just like what you said.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:37.402 position:50% align:center
It's not just about Langa. I'm different
from JOE, MIYA and the others, too.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:42.032 position:50% align:center
But I love skating as much as they do.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.825 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.786 position:50% align:center
--Welcome!
--Welcome!

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:48.329 position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.956 position:50% align:center

--"Love hotel"?
--"Love hotel"?

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.542 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's not what I--

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.710 position:50% align:center
What kinda place is it?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.087 position:50% align:center
Are you that innocent?

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.714 position:50% align:center
Take this.

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
What is this?

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.677 position:50% align:center
"Third Wheel"?

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
"Third wheel" means...

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.348 position:50% align:center
..."someone getting in the way."

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
What the... I mean, you don't have
enough if you've only got three.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:13.688 position:50% align:center
I don't think that's
the right way to look at it.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.816 position:50% align:center
ADAM has nominated you
to be SHADOW's substitute.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.361 position:50% align:center
But you should decline.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:21.946 position:50% align:center
Huh? After getting nominated? Why?

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
The previous beef with you
was just him playing around.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
But this time, ADAM is serious.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.037 position:50% align:center
Couldn't ask for more!

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:33.375 position:50% align:center
That's enough! Are you going to ruin
your entire life over a skateboard?

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.335 position:50% align:center
It won't give you fortune nor fame!

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.837 position:50% align:center
If you get into an accident,
it'll be in the papers!

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:42.342 position:50% align:center
And if that happens, everything that has
been built up will come crashing down!

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:50.141 position:50% align:center
I don't know who you're talking about,
but you really don't get it, do you?

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.645 position:50% align:center
I told you, there's only one reason to skate.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
It's 'cause it's fun!

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.109 position:50% align:center
That again?

00:05:59.109 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
You'll understand when you are an adult...

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
...that having fun can't be everything.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.825 position:50% align:center
A reserve race?

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:09.744 position:50% align:center
Naturally, it would be JOE or MIYA, huh?

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
It's Reki.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.288 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.416 position:50% align:center
ADAM nominated him.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.584 position:50% align:center
He's got something up his sleeve.

00:06:16.584 --> 00:06:19.087 position:50% align:center
That kid surely didn't accept, did he?

00:06:19.087 --> 00:06:21.131 position:50% align:center
He's not smart enough to decline.

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
Is he a moron?

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'm sorry. Did he forget
that he got his ass handed to him?

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
He probably forgot.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.099 position:50% align:center
That idiot...

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:32.642 position:50% align:center
Is he an idiot?

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:36.813 position:50% align:center
He knows too little about himself.
He's sure to be injured badly!

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.482 position:50% align:center
He really is an idiot.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
Why do you look so amused?

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
Why?

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
Because of the fact
that Reki came back, of course.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:55.790 position:50% align:center
No good.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.834 position:50% align:center
Huh? It can't be fixed?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:06:59.836 position:50% align:center
It's already snapped, so...

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:03.173 position:50% align:center
--No way.
--What's up?

00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:06.885 position:50% align:center
I always realize things after I lose them.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.636 position:50% align:center
Like I did with you, Reki.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
About how much I cherished...

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.728 position:50% align:center
If it's broken, you just gotta fix it.

00:07:16.728 --> 00:07:18.938 position:50% align:center
Just like us.

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Yep.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
Then, first off...

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
Rad! They're all wheels?

00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.113 position:50% align:center
I made this one!

00:07:27.113 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
Huh? You can skate on something like this?

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:30.825 position:50% align:center
It was no good.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:32.243 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.495 position:50% align:center
Then, what about this?

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
That one is for rainy weather.
It has grooves like car tires.

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:38.875 position:50% align:center
I saw it in a magazine.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.043 position:50% align:center
I think it was in there!

00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:42.962 position:50% align:center
Skate Fun, August issue.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.006 position:50% align:center
It's pronounced "FAN."

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:47.092 position:50% align:center
I said "FUN," didn't I?

00:07:47.092 --> 00:07:49.969 position:50% align:center
The magazine is "FAN"
like you're a big fan of something.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.680 position:50% align:center
Wait, there's a difference?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.809 position:50% align:center
Reki, "FUN" with a U is when
you're enjoying something.

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:59.062 position:50% align:center
But both involve enjoyment, right?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.273 position:50% align:center
You're right.

00:08:03.775 --> 00:08:08.238 position:50% align:center
Let's salvage any parts that we can use.
That way, it's basically being reborn.

00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.699 position:50% align:center
Good idea.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.992 position:50% align:center
Any other parts we can use?

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:17.038 position:50% align:center
The foot clips seem okay.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
Hey, Langa... Wanna try taking them off?

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
This has been something similar
to training wheels for you until now.

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.093 position:50% align:center
You still need them?

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.140 position:50% align:center
No. I'm fine now.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.683 position:50% align:center
Okay!

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
What about you, Reki? Are you okay?

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:44.107 position:50% align:center
That beef with ADAM...
What are you gonna do about it?

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
That said, I can't skate in this rain.

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:53.283 position:50% align:center

But someone young like me being the leader

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.003 position:50% align:center
We need someone to pipe us to the core!

However, if he keeps taking out
one skater after another,

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.066 position:50% align:center
there will be an incident someday.

We'll be stepping foot into Diet Member
Shindo's mansion and settle the score there.

It's not guaranteed that I'm gonna lose.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.724 position:50% align:center

00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
That's a promise.

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.727 position:50% align:center
Make sure to properly start off this time.

00:10:43.727 --> 00:10:45.520 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Oh, this gets my heart pumping!

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
When you turn into a messy
heap because of me,

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
what kind of face will Little Langa have?

00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:58.158 position:50% align:center
What kind of gaze will he look at me with?

00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:03.079 position:50% align:center
Huh! You won't be able to take me down
like you're planning to.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:15.383 position:50% align:center
It's ADAM, as expected!

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.718 position:50% align:center
So boring!

00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.261 position:50% align:center
This follows predictions too much!

00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:21.556 position:50% align:center
See, he can't put up a fight whatsoever.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.308 position:50% align:center
Even then...

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.352 position:50% align:center
...Reki is going slower than usual.

00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
Is he hesitating?

00:11:29.898 --> 00:11:31.900 position:50% align:center
You're so slow!

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.445 position:50% align:center
How long are you planning
on making me wait?

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
He's starting off with it!

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
Crush him with that hug, ADAM!

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.160 position:50% align:center
He's doing it!

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.162 position:50% align:center
Love Hug?

00:11:44.162 --> 00:11:45.622 position:50% align:center
Don't freak out.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.165 position:50% align:center
Plunge in!

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.128 position:50% align:center
Just kidding.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
You thought I wouldn't take
any measures since last time?

00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:57.801 position:50% align:center
He read into it!

00:11:57.801 --> 00:11:59.344 position:50% align:center
Get away, Reki!

00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:02.389 position:50% align:center
An exciting red...

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:06.142 position:50% align:center
Reki!

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:10.021 position:50% align:center
--A flash victory?
--Hold out for a bit longer, will ya?

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.648 position:50% align:center
Stand up!

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:15.110 position:50% align:center
I took the luxury of letting you
roll around in the grass.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:21.408 position:50% align:center
Don't get the wrong idea
that you've won already!

00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.201 position:50% align:center
Don't stand up, idiot!

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
Just take that loss!

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.180 position:50% align:center
Isn't this way too one-sided?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.349 position:50% align:center
That guy's gonna get murdered.

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.019 position:50% align:center
This was a real disappointment.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:54.357 position:50% align:center
An obstacle this small
just doesn't light my heart on fire!

00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.779 position:50% align:center
Let's make him stop, JOE!

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
That's useless.

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:05.160 position:50% align:center
ADAM won't stop tonight
until that boy is taken out.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
Reki isn't gonna simply go down, either.

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:10.290 position:50% align:center
And your grounds are...

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:13.460 position:50% align:center
We promised.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.090 position:50% align:center
Let's use that corner, shall we?

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:23.094 position:50% align:center
I figured out your true nature...

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.472 position:50% align:center
...so why don't we end it soon?

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
Dammit! What should I...

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
In times like this, what would he...

00:13:32.437 --> 00:13:34.731 position:50% align:center
What would Langa be doing?

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.113 position:50% align:center
Can I...

00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
...do it?

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.160 position:50% align:center
No.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
It's not about whether or not I can do it.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.915 position:50% align:center
Besides...

00:13:51.915 --> 00:13:54.584 position:50% align:center
...this looks like it's more fun!

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.963 position:50% align:center
Is he planning on jumping off the cliff?

00:13:58.963 --> 00:14:00.507 position:50% align:center
That's reckless!

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.271 position:50% align:center
Go, Reki!

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.113 position:50% align:center
Amazing.

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:27.701 position:50% align:center
Langa was always looking at views like this?

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
Impossible!

00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.457 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:37.669 position:50% align:center
What was that? Far from satisfying.

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
Skating's super fun, after all!

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:46.428 position:50% align:center
"Fun" that I don't know about yet
still exists infinitely!

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:51.224 position:50% align:center
Just because you nail one fluke,
don't think you've won it all!

00:14:51.224 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting...

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:55.478 position:50% align:center
...for you to pull ahead of me!

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:59.149 position:50% align:center
What's the meaning of this?

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:03.111 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to kill me
before committing suicide?

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
I love entertaining others...

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
...but being entertained
is something I hate to death!

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:18.376 position:50% align:center
Reki, get away! That's more than enough!

00:15:18.376 --> 00:15:19.252 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:15:19.252 --> 00:15:20.712 position:50% align:center
What are you saying--

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:24.174 position:50% align:center
Reki hasn't given up yet.

00:15:24.174 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
I will admit that you've got some guts.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:31.806 position:50% align:center
But... what about this?

00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
I'm going to go all in...

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:37.020 position:50% align:center
...so much that you stop breathing!

00:15:41.024 --> 00:15:43.360 position:50% align:center
You finally peeled away.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.323 position:50% align:center
Someone like you embracing me
is nothing more than an annoyance.

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:51.242 position:50% align:center
I'll be getting even further away from you now.

00:15:51.242 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna leave you behind
and cross the finish line first!

00:15:56.831 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
Huh! And I was wondering what you'd say.

00:16:01.044 --> 00:16:02.837 position:50% align:center
Rain!

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:08.259 position:50% align:center
The worse the condition gets, the true
potential of the skaters come into light.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:12.222 position:50% align:center
He has even less of a chance
to win in this condition!

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:16.142 position:50% align:center
Oh...

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.603 position:50% align:center
I hate the rain.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:23.692 position:50% align:center
Decks are ruined when they're wet,
and you lose your grip.

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:27.487 position:50% align:center
It really is the nemesis of skateboarding.

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:31.991 position:50% align:center
I should quickly end such a boring beef.

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:37.539 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:39.124 position:50% align:center
Reki's pulling ahead!

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
This can't be!

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:44.295 position:50% align:center
This is a fluke!

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.047 position:50% align:center
Something like this!

00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:51.761 position:50% align:center
Those wheels!

00:16:51.761 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
They're wheels for rainy weather.

00:16:54.139 --> 00:16:57.058 position:50% align:center
There are special grooves on them
so he won't slip even in the rain.

00:16:57.058 --> 00:17:00.812 position:50% align:center
On the other hand, he'll be slower
than usual in clear weather.

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
So, that's why he was slow
in the first half!

00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.276 position:50% align:center
Then, he was predicting
that rain would start falling?

00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
Reki was betting on this.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.113 position:50% align:center
How's it going, ADAM?

00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:14.200 position:50% align:center
Not even you can keep a good grip
with normal wheels, right?

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.078 position:50% align:center
Don't get cocky.

00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
Mere rain won't change anything!

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.297 position:50% align:center
I'll finish it all in a flash!

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:30.342 position:50% align:center
That's...

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
The technique that defeated Cherry!

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
I named it "Full Swing Kiss."

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.724 position:50% align:center
You shouldn't take that hit!

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center
Don't flee!

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:44.356 position:50% align:center
Full Swing Kiss!

00:17:48.443 --> 00:17:49.694 position:50% align:center
What?

00:17:49.694 --> 00:17:51.529 position:50% align:center
Saucy brat!

00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:56.326 position:50% align:center
ADAM...

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
...tripped up?

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:58.953 position:50% align:center
You're joking.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.998 position:50% align:center
Our ADAM?

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:03.583 position:50% align:center
Kaoru?

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:12.300 position:50% align:center
ADAM! ADAM of all people!

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:19.182 position:50% align:center
Serves ADAM right!

00:18:19.182 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
All right! The slime defeated the evil overlord!

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.938 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:18:24.938 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
Mr. Higa? Is something the matter, Mr. Higa?

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.026 position:50% align:center
You're awesome, redhead!

00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.486 position:50% align:center
Show us a miracle!

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.906 position:50% align:center
Keep at it, redhead dude!

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:37.659 position:50% align:center
I'm not "redhead"! I'm Reki!

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.536 position:50% align:center
And you'd better remember that!

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.455 position:50% align:center
Impossible.

00:18:42.455 --> 00:18:45.375 position:50% align:center
Me? Trip up?

00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:46.876 position:50% align:center
Where is it?

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:50.213 position:50% align:center
Where is my board?

00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.635 position:50% align:center
ADAM is so pathetic!

00:18:55.635 --> 00:18:58.138 position:50% align:center
Hey now, are you serious?

00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
This is...

00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:04.477 position:50% align:center
...me?

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
This...

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
...is...

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
...eternally...

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:19.159 position:50% align:center
...unforgivable!

00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:20.368 position:50% align:center
It's the redhead!

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
It's not ADAM?

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:27.584 position:50% align:center
I will skate together with Langa!
Not to support him, not to cheer him on!

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:29.294 position:50% align:center
Just a bit more, Reki!

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:30.920 position:50% align:center
You can win this!

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
Mr. Ainosuke is going to lose?

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:35.383 position:50% align:center
ADAM is coming!

00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
But if he's that far behind...

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center
Unforgivable... Unforgivable... Unforgivable...

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.268 position:50% align:center
Unforgivable!

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
My wheels!

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.321 position:50% align:center
You...

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.574 position:50% align:center
...worthless nobody!

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
What a guy!

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:05.121 position:50% align:center
Hurry, Reki! He's coming in!

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:08.041 position:50% align:center
The damage from when I crashed...

00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.752 position:50% align:center
Please last long enough for me!

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:12.545 position:50% align:center
Just a little bit more!

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:31.189 position:50% align:center
ADAM won?

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:32.565 position:50% align:center
You did good, redhead!

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:35.360 position:50% align:center
--"Reki"! His name's Reki!
--That was moving, Reki!

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
--Reki! Reki! Reki!
--I was the winner...

00:20:38.738 --> 00:20:40.156 position:50% align:center
Me!

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
He's not moving!

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.659 position:50% align:center
Reki!

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Are you okay? Reki!

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:53.336 position:50% align:center
Skating really is super fun, after all!

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:58.675 position:50% align:center
Skating is really fun!

00:20:58.675 --> 00:21:00.719 position:50% align:center
You had us getting nervous.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:02.846 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll alter my assessment of you.

00:21:02.846 --> 00:21:06.057 position:50% align:center
Not bad for a slime!

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:07.767 position:50% align:center
I...

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.145 position:50% align:center
...was mistaken.

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:13.565 position:50% align:center
Attempting to take skateboarding
away from Mr. Ainosuke...

00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
What I really needed to do was make
Mr. Ainosuke love skateboarding once more.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.493 position:50% align:center
This ain't good.

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:31.166 position:50% align:center
Stop it. The beef is already over.

00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:35.795 position:50% align:center
JOE said to me before...
"Don't ever end up by yourself."

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
You really think that a nobody like you
successfully fought back like that?

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
Step aside! I will deal with you next!

00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:50.769 position:50% align:center
About the beef with SNOW...
I'm going to forfeit.

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:52.395 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:52.395 --> 00:21:55.231 position:50% align:center
He is the most suited for you...

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
...to regain your love.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.364 position:50% align:center
You said that I was all by myself?

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:04.908 position:50% align:center
That's correct.

00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
I am the only one who exists in my world.

00:22:08.745 --> 00:22:12.415 position:50% align:center
However, there will be a second one soon.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:15.502 position:50% align:center
We shall fall together...

00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:17.462 position:50% align:center
...because...

00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:20.715 position:50% align:center
...we are going to become ADAM and EVE!

OUR INFINITY!"
