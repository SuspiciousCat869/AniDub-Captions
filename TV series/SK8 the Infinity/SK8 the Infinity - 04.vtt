Adam, huh?

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.196 position:50% align:center
Look who's here. Finally.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
This is what I need.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.993 position:50% align:center
To end my seven-year
grudge at last.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
If I win this match,

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.413 position:50% align:center
you apologize to Miya!

[MIYA]
I don't need your pity, slime!

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.751 position:50% align:center
I'm not afraid of starting over.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.212 position:50% align:center
It's fine. Rules are rules
and I can handle it.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.341 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
It's not about pity.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
It's about being done
with jerks like him

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.511 position:50% align:center
treating others like total crap.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.307 position:50% align:center
Hey! I know you hear me!

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.310 position:50% align:center
I can see your ears
sticking out from that mask!

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.564 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] I wonder. If we
could see our emotions,

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.025 position:50% align:center
what shape would they take
for the moods we're in?

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.818 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:12.781 position:50% align:center
I imagine mine would be
a spring. Picture it.

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:15.700 position:50% align:center
The amount of flowing water
would reflect what I'm feeling.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:19.079 position:50% align:center
I'm not here for
a poetry reading. I wa--

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:22.457 position:50% align:center
If we were to look right now,
my spring would be a a desert.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.125 position:50% align:center
Because that's the level
of interest I have

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.252 position:50% align:center
in humoring mediocrity.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
However...

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.424 position:50% align:center
You. Your talent.

It drips from you.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.177 position:50% align:center
I've become a river.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50% align:center
You've created
a deluge of intrigue. Oh.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.308 position:50% align:center
A flow of information
has burst open my dam,

00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:42.268 position:50% align:center
so I've chosen my prize.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:44.771 position:50% align:center
I want to skate with you next.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.564 position:50% align:center
How's that sound?

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.400 position:50% align:center
I can't wait.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:50.443 position:50% align:center
What?! Langa!

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:53.655 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Excellent. We've got a deal.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:27.207 position:50% align:center
[REKI] I don't get it.
Why are you like that?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
[REKI] You say yes to everyone
who challenges you!

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
Really? Why do you challenge
anyone who upsets you?

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.799 position:50% align:center
Because they piss me off!

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.425 position:50% align:center
Right, well, I enjoy skating.

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.552 position:50% align:center
Huh? Are you saying
when you looked at Adam,

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:41.429 position:50% align:center
he sparked frikkin joy?

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:42.639 position:50% align:center
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.683 position:50% align:center
The mask is dope,
though, I guess.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
But man, the stuff he
says to people. He sucks!

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:53.233 position:50% align:center
[LANGA] So, Adam.
What kind of skater is he?

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
[REKI] He started "S."
Rumor is he's still undefeated.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.029 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Fascinating.

00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.782 position:50% align:center
That wasn't supposed to

[LANGA]
What else you got?

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.326 position:50% align:center
[REKI] That's actually
all I have on him,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
but you could probably ask
the founders for more.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.580 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Who are they?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.082 position:50% align:center
Cherry, Joe.

Man, I bet they'd love to
go off about that guy.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.794 position:50% align:center

[REKI]
Joe?!

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
I was skating with
Adam before "S."

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.177 position:50% align:center
There's more to him
than his performances.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.178 position:50% align:center
Who's that?

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.389 position:50% align:center
Joe, one of the
founding members!

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.599 position:50% align:center
He's known as
the six-pack skater!

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:30.103 position:50% align:center
Also the fastest and strongest
if you're looking at raw power!

Come on, you know I'm
more than just power!

[REKI coughing]

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:44.284 position:50% align:center
Well his nickname says a lot.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:47.787 position:50% align:center
He is "the Matador of Love."

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Love?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
[JOE] It has to do with
his view on skating.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.171 position:50% align:center
He calls it a ritual of love.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:59.632 position:50% align:center
Yeah, What's up with that?
Feels like a stretch.

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
His entire game's a stretch.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.888 position:50% align:center
I don't get him now. S'Lame.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.060 position:50% align:center

skater, make no mistake.

Everyone who beefs against Adam
winds up severely injured.

Don't wanna be the bogeyman,

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center

Yes, but be modest.

You don't want to
stir envy in others

No coach ever told me that.

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:30.552 position:50% align:center
From then on, he'd show up
every so often.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.721 position:50% align:center
That's also how I
got started with "S."

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:35.056 position:50% align:center
Is that why he wanted
to race against me?

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.852 position:50% align:center
Yeah. He said it would be
a learning opportunity.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.021 position:50% align:center
Not sure if he means
for us or for him.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.523 position:50% align:center
He's got a move.
I've never seen it.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
But it's a trick
he calls his Love Hug.

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
He does it by going uphill.

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center

So I met Snow this afternoon.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.832 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Snow who?

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.917 position:50% align:center
That's what they're calling the
rookie who used the duct tape.

00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.087 position:50% align:center
I guess because
he's a snowboarder.

00:09:06.171 --> 00:09:08.506 position:50% align:center
I bet he's the reason
Adam's making a comeback.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:13.053 position:50% align:center
It's probably been a while since
he's felt inspired by anyone.

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.098 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] All the more reason
to challenge him to a match.

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.308 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I will, too.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
Copycat!

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
I'm not copying!

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.603 position:50% align:center

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.897 position:50% align:center
You're cute.
But I'm not budging!

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.523 position:50% align:center
You'll have to
fight me for my spot!

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.026 position:50% align:center
I have no problem with that.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.236 position:50% align:center
I've got our
challenge right here.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.489 position:50% align:center
You can't use your side hustle
that I know nothing about

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.990 position:50% align:center
to pose a challenge!

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:36.534 position:50% align:center
The one accepting the challenge
gets to choose its nature.

00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:37.911 position:50% align:center
That's how it works.

00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.121 position:50% align:center
[JOE] And no robot lover
is gonna tell me what to do!

00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.998 position:50% align:center
This is like school

school, you dopey gorilla!

Why's he not dropping speed?

00:09:49.464 --> 00:09:51.549 position:50% align:center
He's not gonna make that turn!

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.935 position:50% align:center
If you don't want to get
crushed at the corner,

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:03.311 position:50% align:center
you have to learn this trick.

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:04.437 position:50% align:center
That was cool.

00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.981 position:50% align:center
I saw you do that in the race.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:11.820 position:50% align:center

a railslide! Watch this.

Your upper body's too far in.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.850 position:50% align:center
It's throwing your

Shut up, kid! One more time!

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.979 position:50% align:center
Where's my board? What the?

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.689 position:50% align:center
I'll go and get it.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.155 position:50% align:center
He does it by going uphill.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:56.531 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
How would he do that?

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:58.450 position:50% align:center
Sounds impossible.

Adam's trick, huh?

Yeah.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:19.679 position:50% align:center
He doesn't really
do stunts uphill!

00:11:19.763 --> 00:11:21.931 position:50% align:center
Ugh! It's just gossip.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.400 position:50% align:center
He's a lot more dangerous

I haven't seen him
turn up in ages to race.

But when "S"
first became a thing,

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
it was like an obsession of his
to crush his favorite skaters.

I'm talkin about bones,

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Would you like to know
what we'll be betting on?

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:14.224 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
That's a silly question.

00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:16.851 position:50% align:center
Aww. You want to
skate together against me

00:16:16.935 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
and the Little Red Rocket?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.104 position:50% align:center
Don't you dare!

00:16:19.187 --> 00:16:21.439 position:50% align:center
This race is between
me and you alone!

00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.774 position:50% align:center
Quit tryna run!

00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:25.694 position:50% align:center
You said run? To me?

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:30.198 position:50% align:center
We have a bet.
Or have you forgotten that?

00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:33.493 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Of course not.
Looking forward to my prize.

00:16:33.576 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
I get to skate with you.

00:16:46.631 --> 00:16:48.091 position:50% align:center
We'll see!

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:50.593 position:50% align:center
[ADAM chuckles]

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.472 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
He's doing it to mock him.

00:16:55.765 --> 00:16:57.600 position:50% align:center
Ha. You stay up
there being cocky

00:16:57.684 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
and see how far it gets ya!

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:04.482 position:50% align:center
I've got footage on
monitor number three.

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:06.234 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
That's the thing about tobacco.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:08.111 position:50% align:center
It despises humidity.

00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:09.571 position:50% align:center
So I always try to be thoughtful

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:12.198 position:50% align:center
and carry it in
an airtight case.

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
If you expect great taste,

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.870 position:50% align:center
you have to put in
the proper effort.

00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:19.497 position:50% align:center
Joe knows what I'm
talking about. Don't ya?

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:22.250 position:50% align:center
Sure, presentation is key
in plating a dish

00:17:22.334 --> 00:17:24.461 position:50% align:center
and when planning the courses.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:26.713 position:50% align:center
You know, I've always
found that fascinating.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:30.633 position:50% align:center
If a plate looks good, your mind
will decide it tastes good, too.

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.552 position:50% align:center
Is this about Reki?

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
Perhaps.

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.269 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Oh, so yummy.

00:17:41.353 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
I don't get to
smoke during work.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.814 position:50% align:center
But here.

00:17:44.898 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
Here I'm free!
I can do anything!

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:03.667 position:50% align:center
So fast!

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4L]
Awesome!

00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:06.044 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4M]
That's Adam, ladies and gents!

00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4N]
Is he going too fast?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.799 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4O] Hey! Looks like
Adam finally took off!

00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:11.800 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4P]
For real?

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.051 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
There's no way.

00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.719 position:50% align:center
He's not gonna catch me now.

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:16.888 position:50% align:center
I've already outrun him.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:17.847 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4Q]
Look, he's coming!

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.057 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4B]
Huh? What? Where?

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.141 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4R]
That was quick!

00:18:20.225 --> 00:18:21.726 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
He just started!

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.187 position:50% align:center
You've gotta be frikkin
kidding me right now?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
I found you!

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.778 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Aww. Thought you
might like to see

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.280 position:50% align:center
what "S" is really about.

00:18:35.573 --> 00:18:37.075 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:39.327 position:50% align:center
Look! It's a corner!

00:18:39.411 --> 00:18:42.080 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
Let go of me! I'm gonna crash!

00:18:42.163 --> 00:18:44.124 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Next, we have a straightaway.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:47.085 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Dammit! I gotta
get away from this psycho!

00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:49.671 position:50% align:center
Ready? You're gonna
take a quick right.

00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:50.880 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
[REKI screams]

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
Don't close your eyes,
you'll miss it!

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.807 position:50% align:center
Terror is such a thrilling ride!

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
You should savor every second.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:08.273 position:50% align:center
That's him. That's Adam.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] I knew it.
He hasn't changed at all.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:14.070 position:50% align:center
He's gone too far!

00:19:14.154 --> 00:19:15.739 position:50% align:center
No, don't!

00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
I'll bring it right back!

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4T]
Hey! That's my motorcycle!

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS]
Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam! Adam!

00:19:26.958 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.587 position:50% align:center
Ready for the big bang, baby?

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
[REKI] This is like...
on another level.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
I can't match him. I'm done.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.599 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
It's not about winning.

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:46.019 position:50% align:center
This is an adventure.
Isn't that right?

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's exactly right.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.653 position:50% align:center
I wanna destroy him. So I will!

00:20:04.996 --> 00:20:06.456 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4U]
That guy just passed Adam!

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.124 position:50% align:center
He better start slowing down!

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:10.543 position:50% align:center
He's not gonna make it
past that corner!

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
How 'bout this?

00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:25.058 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS cheer]

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
[JOE whistles]

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:29.854 position:50% align:center
All right!

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] Come on, Reki!
That corner's coming up.

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
But he's not even
preparing to slow down!

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:47.205 position:50% align:center
Maybe Adam's worried, too?

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:49.582 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.963 position:50% align:center
[REKI] He took the inside
with a Casper Slide?

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:57.507 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 4V]
So sick!

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS]
Go Adam! Go Adam! Go Adam!

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.934 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Is he going to do it?

00:21:08.018 --> 00:21:09.811 position:50% align:center
Here comes Love Hug!

00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:13.982 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Moment of truth.
Can he really skate uphill?

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:30.040 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
No way! Impossible!

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:34.085 position:50% align:center
[REKI screams]

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.676 position:50% align:center
Reki!

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.680 position:50% align:center
Much better than expected,

00:21:45.764 --> 00:21:49.059 position:50% align:center
but still just a taste of
the hors d'oeuvre tray.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.562 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Reki! Can you hear me?

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:56.024 position:50% align:center
Sorry. I didn't win.

00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:57.776 position:50% align:center
That doesn't matter!

00:21:57.859 --> 00:22:01.279 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Oh my! The main
course has arrived!

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.200 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Hello, Little Langa.
We meet again.

00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:09.371 position:50% align:center
What a sweet reward.
I'm overjoyed.

00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:45.091 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Little Langa,
I feel it's destiny

00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:46.634 position:50% align:center
we were able to meet like this.

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.553 position:50% align:center
We should try to get to
know each other better.

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.263 position:50% align:center
--[ADAM] What do you think?
--[LANGA] Okay.

00:23:50.347 --> 00:23:52.849 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] I am the type that would
rather love than be loved.

00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:54.434 position:50% align:center
--[ADAM] What about you?
--[LANGA] I like sweetness.

00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:57.312 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] I will be as sweet to you
as I can possibly be, baby.

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.439 position:50% align:center
But there may be times when I
have to put restraints on you,

00:23:59.522 --> 00:24:00.940 position:50% align:center
--[ADAM] is that okay?
--[LANGA] Love it.

00:24:01.024 --> 00:24:03.401 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] I know we'll be perfect
partners for each other!

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:04.903 position:50% align:center
[ADAM laughs]
I'm so excited!

00:24:04.986 --> 00:24:07.113 position:50% align:center
[LANGA] Reki, thanks for
doing my errands.
