I've got two weeks
for a full recovery.

[REKI]
I'm so sorry, Miya.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.625 align:middle
I didn't mean to let you down.

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle
Oh, I'm not surprised at all.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:43.292 align:middle
I told you, no slime
can beat the final boss.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.167 align:middle
But whatever.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.167 align:middle
At least it's not my fault you
looked like a fool out there.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.167 align:middle
[REKI]
What'd you say?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle
He said you looked
cool out there.

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle
I didn't say
anything like that!

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.917 align:middle
Are you sure that's
not what you said?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle
I hate to break up a cat fight,

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.208 align:middle
but your boy here is
next up against Adam.

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:02.875 align:middle
You've got work to do.

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:04.042 align:middle
I'm the worst.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.458 align:middle
I should've never
pulled you into this.

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:07.833 align:middle
I'm sorry.

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:11.333 align:middle

Reki. It's not your fault.

Whoa, what was that?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.458 align:middle

You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

You want me to pull out
of racing Adam, right?

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle
Well, you saw
what happened to me.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.542 align:middle
I saw you ignore Joe
after he told you to split.

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:51.292 align:middle
I didn't think that level
of insanity existed.

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:53.958 align:middle
Everything Joe said was real.

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:56.833 align:middle
Don't do it, Langa.
It's not worth it.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.625 align:middle
That's enough!

Dude, why're you getting
bent outta shape?

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.875 align:middle
I'm not.

If you're thinking you're
gonna get him back

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.208 align:middle
for hurting me, please don't.
That's not the--

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:09.542 align:middle
I'm going to race him, Reki.

[REKI] Come on, Oka,
play your "manager" card.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.458 align:middle
Threaten his job if he
doesn't listen to me.

00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:19.458 align:middle
From the guy who never
listens to anyone.

[REKI]
Give me a break, okay?

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.292 align:middle
Langa can't skate against Adam.

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.042 align:middle
He'll be slaughtered.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.958 align:middle
Trust me, I understand
why you're worried.

00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:33.542 align:middle
If he gets hurt, the only
person to blame is me.

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:39.000 align:middle
Okay.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:41.375 align:middle
I guess I'll go and
try to talk to him.

Hello, Mr. Takano.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.833 align:middle
Must have been
a large contribution?

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle
[ADAM chuckles] Can't say
it's anything of the sort.

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:58.042 align:middle

[LANGA]
Wow. Reki's late.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:04.667 align:middle
Yeah. I sent him on an errand

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.833 align:middle
that's a little
further out today.

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:13.375 align:middle
[OKA] Unrelated. I heard you'll
be skating against Adam?

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle
Guess we know who told you that.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:19.083 align:middle
[OKA] No one told me,
personally. It's hot "S" gossip.

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:21.417 align:middle
These will keep you
out of the hospital.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.917 align:middle
Not that I really expect
you to listen to me.

I don't need them.

[OKA] You don't
have to be embarrassed.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.417 align:middle
A lot of great skaters wear
this kinda stuff for protection.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.417 align:middle
It looks hard to move in.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.792 align:middle
I'll be much faster on my own.

Yeah. Shouldn't I be?

committed to torture.

I chose the phrase,

It's important to make
peace with those we've hurt

[REKI "Don't talk about S
off the mountain."

here to fight with me?

00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:04.125 align:middle
No!

00:07:04.208 --> 00:07:05.917 align:middle
I just need to know
more about Adam!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.333 align:middle
For what purpose?

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:10.208 align:middle
You two are on completely
different levels.

Not for me. For Langa.

Do you have to use me?

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:16.208 align:middle
[CHERRY]
Start with maximum acceleration

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:17.625 align:middle
toward the finish line.

00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:21.542 align:middle
Using a spin, do a 180
with a minimal turning radius.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:23.875 align:middle
And this is the important part.

00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:27.083 align:middle
Right after the 180,
bring the nose down hard.

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle
That gives you the momentum
to continue uphill.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:32.167 align:middle
The sudden change in
relative speed is key.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle
That what makes it
seem as though

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.042 align:middle

of you out of nowhere.

Insane.

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:42.375 align:middle
It's pretty easy
once you know the trick.

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.708 align:middle
[CHERRY] That said,
the live race changes things.

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.292 align:middle
For the illusion to work,
your opponent has to be

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:50.292 align:middle
right in front of you
at all times.

You can't hesitate.

in that one instant.

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.708 align:middle
[COP 5A]
Get back here!

00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:46.917 align:middle
[TADASHI]
That's so strange.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.375 align:middle
We took this location
off the patrol route.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.417 align:middle
Contact the chief of
police immediately.

00:20:56.917 --> 00:20:58.625 align:middle
[BOTH sigh]

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:01.625 align:middle
[LANGA]
You are a mess.

00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:03.875 align:middle
Then you're a frikkin junkyard!

00:21:06.542 --> 00:21:08.083 align:middle
[REKI]
What were you thinking?

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:11.083 align:middle
Jumping over Adam like that?

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:13.208 align:middle
[LANGA] It came to me
when we were spinning.

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:16.375 align:middle
My gut said get closer
instead of pulling away.

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:18.708 align:middle
[REKI]
So, you just did it?

00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:19.958 align:middle
[LANGA]
Yeah.

00:21:20.042 --> 00:21:24.167 align:middle
Man. You promised you
wouldn't be so reckless.

00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:26.750 align:middle
Sorry.

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.667 align:middle
[REKI]
At least you made it back safe.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.542 align:middle
That's all that matters.

00:21:38.542 --> 00:21:42.667 align:middle
[REKI] Langa. You need to
stay away from him.

00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle
Yeah, I know.

00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:57.917 align:middle
Man, I'm starved.
Let's get some food, huh?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.250 align:middle
[LANGA]
Cool.

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:01.042 align:middle
[REKI] Wasn't there a ramen shop
in this direction?

00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle
Over that way maybe?

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.167 align:middle
[LANGA]
What happened?

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle
--[JOE] It's summer!
--[REKI] Beach time!

00:23:44.083 --> 00:23:45.542 align:middle
--[JOE] Where the ladies at?
--[REKI] Teach me!

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:47.833 align:middle
[JOE] Sure! Go ask out that
hottie in the kimono over there!

00:23:47.917 --> 00:23:49.875 align:middle
[REKI]
Okay! Wait, is this a graveyard?

00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:50.833 align:middle
[JOE]
We're visiting graves.

00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:51.833 align:middle
[REKI]
She's counting offerings!

00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle
[JOE]
She keeps good records!

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:53.667 align:middle
[REKI]
She doesn't have legs!

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.667 align:middle
[JOE]
So? She's still cute!

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle
[REKI]
Oh hell no!
