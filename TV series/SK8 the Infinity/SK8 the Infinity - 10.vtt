00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.208 align:middle
Kaoru!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.458 align:middle
Hey, get a grip on yourself!

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle
I thought I could have a little fun...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.708 align:middle
...but Cherry was really boring.

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.625 align:middle
ADAM, you son of a--

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle
Hop on!

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.792 align:middle
Right now, it's more important
to get to a hospital!

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.417 align:middle
I didn't think Cherry would lose like that.

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:45.542 align:middle
I mean, you'd expect that from ADAM, but...

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.167 align:middle
He was a bit harsh today.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle
Lord Cherry...

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:55.375 align:middle
Langa!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.958 align:middle
MIYA! Have you seen Reki?

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle
Reki?

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.292 align:middle
Oh, the redhead who skated against Mr. Ainosuke.

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:10.375 align:middle
I'm sure he was here.
I heard his "Langa" while I was skating.

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:12.292 align:middle
Maybe he ran away...

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:15.292 align:middle
...because he doesn't wanna see you.

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle
You're in the way.
I'm about to start my run now.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.292 align:middle
But make sure to bring him to the next beef
even if you have to put a rope around his neck.

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:28.583 align:middle
I wanna show that slime the moment
where I'm crowned champion.

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.667 align:middle
The next beef is between MIYA
and that mysterious capman!

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.167 align:middle
Do your best, MIYA!

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:45.333 align:middle
He promised me, and yet...

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.208 align:middle
Fallen rocks?

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:52.083 align:middle
You're gonna dodge it at that speed?

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:56.625 align:middle
What's with that skating?

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.167 align:middle
--Is he dancing?
--Wha...?

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.208 align:middle
--That technique!
--What's with that guy?

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:02.708 align:middle
It's like he's dancing!

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.375 align:middle
That skating is...

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle
A dance? They sound like
they're talking about ADAM!

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.917 align:middle
Impossible!

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:20.042 align:middle
I can't catch up to him at all!

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:22.583 align:middle
--What's with that?
--So cool!

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.208 align:middle
Rock bottom. The worst.

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:29.375 align:middle
Both myself and this whole skating thing...

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle
It's Mr. Ainosuke.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.708 align:middle
Would you like to skate with me?

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:03.167 align:middle
As the child of a servant...

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:07.292 align:middle
...it was taboo for me
to get close to Mr. Ainosuke.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:16.208 align:middle
However, Mr. Ainosuke started
to sneak in time and time again.

00:03:16.208 --> 00:03:19.917 align:middle
Skating was Mr. Ainosuke's
one and only breather.

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:24.000 align:middle
Or rather, it was his lifeline.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle
And yet...

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.792 align:middle
I wish I didn't teach him how to skate.

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle
If it was any other hobby,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.375 align:middle
he could have befriended a child
of proper social standing instead of me.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:42.083 align:middle
The Senior Master wouldn't
have had to make him quit.

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:48.292 align:middle
I led Mr. Ainosuke down the wrong path.

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:49.792 align:middle
That is why...

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:57.708 align:middle
I will win and take
skateboarding away from you.

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:7%
"PART #10:
DAP NOT NEEDING WORDS"

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle
Big Brother, you're an idiot.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle
Yeah. Thank you.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.125 align:middle
I'll be going now.

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:19.542 align:middle
Thanks for the meal.

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:22.375 align:middle
Langa...

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:24.125 align:middle
What?

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle
Nothing! Take care.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.583 align:middle
I'm heading out now.

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:39.208 align:middle
He has been like a shell of himself
ever since you passed.

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:42.833 align:middle
He stopped snowboarding at some point, too.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:49.083 align:middle
But after we came here, he seemed like
he was having fun, so I was relieved. Yet...

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:55.833 align:middle
He's not the type that talks
about himself, either.

00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:01.167 align:middle
This face...

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.625 align:middle
It's not like him.

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:06.833 align:middle
He finally has a chance to skate with me.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:10.292 align:middle
Can it be the wedding blues?

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:11.458 align:middle
"Time off"?

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:14.125 align:middle
Yeah. He said he was gonna
take a bit of time off.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.417 align:middle
You haven't heard from Reki?

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:20.250 align:middle
Not at all.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.417 align:middle
He's agonizing in his own way right now.

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle
Leave him alone for now.

00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:32.833 align:middle
Why the hell did I bring this here?

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.083 align:middle
If I say so myself, I'm acting like
I'm not really over this.

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:38.083 align:middle
That's such a lame board!

00:07:38.083 --> 00:07:39.542 align:middle
What is that thing?

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.667 align:middle
That's so tasteless, dude!

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:45.375 align:middle
Lemme see that!

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.042 align:middle
Don't touch it!

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:51.125 align:middle
Well, if it ain't Reki... This guy dropped
out of our team three days after joining.

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.708 align:middle
What's up with that?

00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:55.333 align:middle
So, you're still skating, huh?

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle
You wanna join our team again?

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.333 align:middle
I don't wanna join that rotten team.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.542 align:middle
What was that?

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:06.375 align:middle
Nobody on your team loves to skate!
You're doing it just for fashion!

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:08.083 align:middle
Wait, is he picking a fight with us?

00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:10.208 align:middle
Looks like it!

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.167 align:middle
He's up for it!

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:14.833 align:middle
Hey, get him!

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:19.458 align:middle
It was a good idea to use driftwood.

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:24.083 align:middle
It was all thanks to you, Hiromi.
Especially for big items like that.

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.583 align:middle
I'm glad I could be of help to you!

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:30.583 align:middle
But I didn't think it was that big.

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:31.958 align:middle
Look out!

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle
Hiromi? Keep yourself together!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.708 align:middle
It's all your fault, SHADOW!

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:43.167 align:middle
Miki left me!

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:46.042 align:middle
She said she hated weak guys!

00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:48.250 align:middle
It's all your fault!

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.167 align:middle
Your fault!

00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:54.417 align:middle
"THE 50th ANNIVERSARY
OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE"
We are here celebrating the 50th anniversary
of our chamber of commerce...

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:55.292 align:middle
We are here celebrating the 50th anniversary
of our chamber of commerce...

00:08:55.292 --> 00:08:57.708 align:middle
I have received word from a capman.

00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:01.667 align:middle
SHADOW, who was slated to be
your opponent, was injured.

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.917 align:middle
So, that means I win by default?

00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:07.167 align:middle
That doesn't work up the crowd.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:11.667 align:middle
Go confirm whether or not
SHADOW really is unable to skate.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:12.917 align:middle
Yes, sir.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:16.500 align:middle
Thanks again!

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle
Hey, that's Reki's...

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.375 align:middle
Reki! Hey, are you all right?

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle
Manager Oka?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.208 align:middle
Come on now, did you
get in a fight or something?

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.125 align:middle
I'm kinda weird right now.

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:39.667 align:middle
They really got me,

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:42.542 align:middle
but I kinda feel good.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.583 align:middle
You know, that's because
you hate yourself right now.

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:50.125 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:54.458 align:middle
You hate yourself so much
that you want to punch yourself, right?

00:09:57.292 --> 00:09:59.792 align:middle
You know, Reki...

00:09:59.792 --> 00:10:02.708 align:middle
Langa is different from the two of us.

00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle
You can say the same for Cherry and JOE, too.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.958 align:middle
They're a completely different
kind of people than us.

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle
Are you saying we're not a good match?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.042 align:middle
They're different.

00:10:14.042 --> 00:10:17.625 align:middle
After I realized that, I stopped agonizing.

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.333 align:middle
I stopped comparing myself to them.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:22.000 align:middle
Isn't that sad, though?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.333 align:middle
To give up from the beginning
and comforting yourself...

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.542 align:middle
"S" isn't everything about skateboarding.

00:10:27.542 --> 00:10:32.083 align:middle
Don't we have our own way of skateboarding?

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle
I...

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.125 align:middle
...don't want that.

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:39.708 align:middle
It's not a bad thing to take care of yourself.

00:10:39.708 --> 00:10:44.708 align:middle
It's too late if you get reckless and get
seriously injured. I mean, even SHADOW...

00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:45.958 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle
Why are you here?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.542 align:middle
I don't wanna see you right now.

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:04.583 align:middle
What's up?

00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle
I think Reki was there just now.

00:11:08.375 --> 00:11:10.292 align:middle
H-Hey!

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:14.042 align:middle
Jeez.

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.667 align:middle
Reki!

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.833 align:middle
MIYA...

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.333 align:middle
Why aren't you showing up?

00:11:29.333 --> 00:11:32.875 align:middle
I wasn't chosen.

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:34.583 align:middle
Reki, you're a liar.

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:37.542 align:middle
I'm not lying!

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:40.542 align:middle
You said you wouldn't be going away.

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:46.583 align:middle
We'll never disappear from your sight!

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.667 align:middle
For now, I'll forgive you for lying to me.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle
So, come with me.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:57.458 align:middle
Sorry, but I no longer...

00:12:03.208 --> 00:12:04.583 align:middle
Wait!

00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:07.208 align:middle
You lying little slime!

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.958 align:middle line:7%
"COME HERE!"

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:19.792 align:middle line:7%
"HERE I COME!"

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:21.958 align:middle line:7%
"SLIIIIP!!"

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:7%
"SK8 the Infinity"

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.333 align:middle line:7%
"RATTLE RATTLE"

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:7%
"SK8 the Infinity"

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:35.667 align:middle
He's always back by dinnertime.

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.000 align:middle
I see.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.458 align:middle
You can come in if you'd like.

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:39.208 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:41.333 align:middle
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:42.833 align:middle
What's for dinner tonight?

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:44.250 align:middle
Croquettes!

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.875 align:middle
Croquettes! Croquettes!

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.083 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:15.208 align:middle
Wait, this place is...

00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:18.167 align:middle
A love hotel.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.167 align:middle
Wait, who are you?

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:25.667 align:middle
At 13 mph, you probably
only got a couple bruises.

00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:27.708 align:middle
So, who in the hell are you?

00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.542 align:middle
Agree to a private settlement with me.

00:13:29.542 --> 00:13:30.625 align:middle
Huh?

00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:36.792 align:middle
I don't want this in the papers.
I can't cause trouble to the man I serve.

00:13:36.792 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle
Don't mock me!

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.500 align:middle
I won't sue you or anything.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.625 align:middle
I get this hurt all the time when I skate.

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle
"Skate"?

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:52.792 align:middle
Oh, you're...

00:13:52.792 --> 00:13:54.208 align:middle
What?

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:56.875 align:middle
If you don't need anything, I'll be on my way.

00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:03.708 align:middle
Never been in a place like this?

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:06.083 align:middle
Sh-Shut up!

00:14:07.542 --> 00:14:10.667 align:middle
You should quit skating.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:11.875 align:middle
Huh?

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.958 align:middle
You should pick some other hobby.

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:16.125 align:middle
That's none of your business.

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:20.375 align:middle
Skating is dangerous.
You can get seriously injured from it.

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.417 align:middle
I already know that.

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:27.083 align:middle
It has a bad rep, too. The image
that only delinquents skate is still around,

00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:28.667 align:middle
so people always give you a cold look.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:30.083 align:middle
I know that, too.

00:14:30.083 --> 00:14:33.708 align:middle
There are few instructors,
and many manufacturers are terrible.

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:38.792 align:middle
It's not like you can earn a living by mastering
it like you can with baseball or soccer.

00:14:38.792 --> 00:14:45.958 align:middle
Skating is barbaric, obscure and a worthless
game that only causes unhappiness.

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:49.667 align:middle
You should quit right now.

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:51.583 align:middle
Shut up!

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle
You don't get it at all!

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.917 align:middle
Skateboarding is...

00:14:55.917 --> 00:14:59.875 align:middle
...fun, exciting and awesome!

00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle
You can do it anytime, anywhere!

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.583 align:middle
Practice is slow and steady...

00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:08.750 align:middle
...and you end up being able to do more things.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:14.417 align:middle
And each time you learn something new,
it's joyful and fun.

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:18.292 align:middle
And a lot more fun when you skate
together with someone else!

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.458 align:middle
It's fun.

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:22.208 align:middle
So fun.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.375 align:middle
That's right.

00:15:27.375 --> 00:15:29.583 align:middle
Skateboarding...

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:32.333 align:middle
...is really fun!

00:15:38.417 --> 00:15:39.958 align:middle
It's already midnight!

00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.667 align:middle
One more! Just one more time!

00:15:48.167 --> 00:15:49.667 align:middle
You all right?

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:53.125 align:middle
Oh, I screwed up!

00:15:54.042 --> 00:15:57.125 align:middle
He's still got the same face.

00:15:57.125 --> 00:16:00.667 align:middle
Reki, you know...

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:02.917 align:middle
...skateboarding's really...

00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.958 align:middle
I must be an idiot.

00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:12.208 align:middle
Whether I'm good or talented
doesn't matter at all.

00:16:13.792 --> 00:16:17.333 align:middle
The first time I got on a skateboard...

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle
I'll be blunt...

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.542 align:middle
...I was super craptastic at it.

00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle
All I did was trip and fall.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.375 align:middle
But...

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:31.583 align:middle
...I felt like wanting to ride it more and more!

00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:34.333 align:middle
Yeah, you really don't get it.

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:37.667 align:middle
There's only one reason why we all skate!

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:40.875 align:middle
It's because it's fun!

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:49.292 align:middle
Jeez.

00:16:49.292 --> 00:16:53.042 align:middle
Why are all skaters so stupid?

00:16:55.083 --> 00:16:56.833 align:middle
Do as you like.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:02.833 align:middle
Wait, how do I check out of here?

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle
What about money? And keys?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.083 align:middle
Don't leave me here!

00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:11.875 align:middle
Langa!

00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:15.292 align:middle
Who was...

00:17:15.292 --> 00:17:17.917 align:middle
...this redhead again?

00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:21.708 align:middle
What about SHADOW?

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:24.292 align:middle
It seems he won't be able to skate for a while.

00:17:24.292 --> 00:17:29.708 align:middle
Oh, brother. I guess I'll have to bring someone
like JOE or MIYA up in a consolation race.

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle
Welcome home!

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle
Langa was here.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.708 align:middle
Huh?

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:35.625 align:middle
But he just went home.

00:17:36.917 --> 00:17:41.333 align:middle
And a message from Langa...
He said he was borrowing your skateboard.

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle
My board?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.625 align:middle
I have to see Langa and talk to him!

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle
Talk? About what?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle
How I fled from skating?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.458 align:middle
How I acted so terribly against him?

00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:02.167 align:middle
Or...

00:18:07.292 --> 00:18:08.417 align:middle
Langa!

00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:09.875 align:middle
Reki!

00:18:15.917 --> 00:18:17.542 align:middle
Um...

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle
--I...
--I...

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle
What?

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.125 align:middle
No, you, Reki.

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:29.958 align:middle
Oh, jeez! Words just flew out somewhere!

00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:32.417 align:middle
I've been thinking for all this time!

00:18:32.417 --> 00:18:36.083 align:middle
I'm always no good when it counts!

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.417 align:middle
Let's skate.

00:18:38.417 --> 00:18:39.667 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.708 align:middle
Together!

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:48.500 align:middle
So high!

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.333 align:middle
Langa's skating is totally awesome!

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:53.667 align:middle
Me, too!

00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:10.583 align:middle
This feeling...

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:12.958 align:middle
It really was what I thought.

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:15.542 align:middle
I hear it.

00:19:15.542 --> 00:19:18.292 align:middle
My body is ecstatic.

00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:21.500 align:middle
It was like that back then, too.

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.958 align:middle
So, that's it.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:29.875 align:middle
I loved snowboarding together with Dad.

00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle
That's why when Dad was no longer here,
I lost sight of how fun it was.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.500 align:middle
And it's the same for skating!

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.625 align:middle
--Who I skate together with is,
for me, the most...

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:41.292 align:middle
--Huh? Hey!
--Who I skate together with is,
for me, the most...

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:46.625 align:middle
Ow...

00:19:46.625 --> 00:19:49.458 align:middle
Why didn't you dodge?

00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle
Did you hit your head or something?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle
You're amazing, Reki.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.583 align:middle
Huh?

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:06.667 align:middle
You know all the details about skating,
and you made me my very own board.

00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:09.333 align:middle
Why this all of a sudden?

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:13.833 align:middle
You're good at teaching, too. It's all thanks
to you that I learned how to ollie.

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:16.792 align:middle
That's from your natural potential and effort.

00:20:16.792 --> 00:20:20.958 align:middle
Reki, you taught me that skating is fun!

00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:23.125 align:middle
You're my teacher!

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:29.125 align:middle
Reki, you always go beyond my imagination.

00:20:29.125 --> 00:20:34.833 align:middle
That idea of spinning the tracks,
and that beef with ADAM, too...

00:20:34.833 --> 00:20:37.083 align:middle
That's enough!

00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle
That's really enough.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.792 align:middle
You usually don't talk, yet you're talking
so much in a situation like this.

00:20:45.958 --> 00:20:48.458 align:middle
Can I talk a bit more?

00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:53.458 align:middle
Lately, I lost sight of why I was skating.

00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:57.958 align:middle
No matter who I skated with
or where I skated...

00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.708 align:middle
...I didn't feel it.

00:20:59.708 --> 00:21:01.250 align:middle
Nothing.

00:21:03.042 --> 00:21:05.375 align:middle
But it's different now.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle
I feel it because I'm here with you, Reki!

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle
It feels fun!

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.417 align:middle
I...

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:13.375 align:middle
...was thinking the same thing!

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:16.333 align:middle
I wanna skate together with you a lot more!

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:20.458 align:middle
Tomorrow, the day after that
and long after that!

00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:21.667 align:middle
Me, too!

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:24.167 align:middle
I wanna infinitely skate together with you!

00:21:24.167 --> 00:21:26.417 align:middle
Infinitely? Isn't that a bit much?

00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:31.875 align:middle
You're the one that said it first, Reki,
that skating was infinite!

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.667 align:middle
Come to think of it, I did!

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle
Let's add one more trick to our DAP!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.083 align:middle
Sounds good!

00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:58.250 align:middle
I don't appreciate you
looking elsewhere, Little Langa.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.333 align:middle
I decided on who will take SHADOW's place.

00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:07.458 align:middle
Love always comes with obstacles. Besides...

00:22:07.458 --> 00:22:11.292 align:middle
...don't you get more fired up
when there are obstacles?
