"EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE (EVENINGS)"
So, in the end, you can't get around
this corner without using tricks.

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:24.000 align:middle
Carla, replay that last part.

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle
Cherry, I'm here to visit you!

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.208 align:middle
Wha...

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:35.208 align:middle
You were here, too, MIYA?

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:36.750 align:middle
Where did Cherry run off to?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.875 align:middle
He's getting tested. He won't be back
for at least another half hour.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.208 align:middle
So, that's why you're using Carla
without his permission?

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:46.667 align:middle
It was in sleep mode,
so even I could control it.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.167 align:middle
I see.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.583 align:middle
It even has a projector function?

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.125 align:middle
It's anything goes for this thing.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.875 align:middle
Oh wait, that's yours truly!

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.167 align:middle
This is Langa's debut race.

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle
Look at just how the gallery's all worked up!

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.542 align:middle
My antihero position is simply the best!

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle
You were the best at making him look good.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle
I thought he was a novice,
so I was caught off guard.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.458 align:middle
Hey, you lost against him, too.

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:37.000 align:middle
The Slime Combo!

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:44.292 align:middle
Wha...

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:51.167 align:middle
You called him a "slime," and you still lost!

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:52.833 align:middle
Shut up!

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:56.458 align:middle
Next time we go at it, I'll win!
That's what a tournament is about, right?

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.708 align:middle
I'll make sure to win, too!

00:01:58.708 --> 00:01:59.792 align:middle
I think that's impossible.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:00.833 align:middle
Why's that?

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.167 align:middle
Carla... Stop video.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.125 align:middle
What's wrong with this shot?
I totally got a great taunt going there!

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:09.917 align:middle
Call me an entertainer!

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:12.083 align:middle
--Your face looks vulgar.
--Huh?

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.583 align:middle
Cherry said so, too.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.000 align:middle
Vulgar skating as always.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.958 align:middle
See?

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.792 align:middle
I'm fine being vulgar! Totally cool with it!

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:25.708 align:middle
Those who can get
with my awesomeness get with it.

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:27.125 align:middle
Why are you taking a screenshot?

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:31.708 align:middle
I'm sure the manager of that flower shop
will totally get SHADOW's awesomeness.

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.625 align:middle
Oh, stop it!

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:06.292 align:middle line:7%

Look at that! This is also
where my stylish skating--

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:09.417 align:middle line:7%
    
    
Look at that! This is also
where my stylish skating--

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle
Carla, fast forward.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.708 align:middle
Hey!

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.333 align:middle
Listen to what others say!

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.167 align:middle
I don't listen to what guys who are
less skilled than me have to say.

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:19.958 align:middle
So you say.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:23.375 align:middle
Just wait until you go up against me
in the tournament. If I win--

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:25.125 align:middle
I'll be your cat or dog or whatever you want.

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.833 align:middle
No. You're gonna be my vase.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:28.792 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle
I'll stick some really cute flowers into ya!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle
Yeah, yeah, if you win.

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:39.583 align:middle
Oh...

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:40.917 align:middle
What is it?

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:43.167 align:middle
I told you to leave those guys alone.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.042 align:middle
I get it. Shut up.

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.417 align:middle
It's lonely here without Reki, meow!

00:04:48.417 --> 00:04:50.333 align:middle
MIYA's gonna cry! Meow!

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:52.542 align:middle
"MILK"
MIYA's gonna cry! Meow!

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle
"MILK"
Ow, ow, ow! Don't scratch me!

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.500 align:middle
Ow, ow, ow! Don't scratch me!

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.208 align:middle
I want to...

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.875 align:middle
...try skating.

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:08.667 align:middle
I want to skate.

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:13.792 align:middle
First, you keep your rear foot on the ground

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:16.542 align:middle
while you put your other
foot on top of the deck.

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:18.125 align:middle
Right!

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:20.792 align:middle
Next, put your rear foot on the deck.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:24.708 align:middle
If you're scared, I'll hold your hand.

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:25.958 align:middle
I'm fine.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.542 align:middle
Wait!

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:35.625 align:middle
Ouch!

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:37.042 align:middle
This thing moves!

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle
What just happened was... that after
you got on the board, you got cold feet

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.583 align:middle
and the center of gravity shifted to the back.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:44.792 align:middle
Before you put the rear foot on,
keep the center of gravity at the front,

00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:47.125 align:middle
and after you lift that foot,
keep it at the center.

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.083 align:middle
Amazing.

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:51.625 align:middle
Yours doesn't move at all.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:56.125 align:middle
Push is one of the basics, so you need
to be able to do it with your eyes closed!

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:57.833 align:middle
Your legs are too far apart!

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.292 align:middle
Look ahead!

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.458 align:middle
Hey! You there!

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.875 align:middle
Crap! Let's make a run for it!

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.833 align:middle
Yeah, that's it! Push, push!

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.125 align:middle
Reki!

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.667 align:middle
You'd better not get caught!

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:17.125 align:middle
But well, things really feel
off balance without him.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.792 align:middle
Yeah.

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.083 align:middle
Did Langa say anything?

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.667 align:middle
He said he didn't know.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:28.042 align:middle
This is a problem between the two of them.
No good will come of us doing this and that.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.833 align:middle
The two of them always came together.

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle
But...

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.083 align:middle
...it totally feels wrong without Reki around.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:35.917 align:middle
You didn't teach me how to turn!

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.875 align:middle
Oh man...

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.792 align:middle
Ticktock, ticktock...

00:06:47.792 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle
When he started skating...
It brings back memories.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.708 align:middle
Yeah. It really doesn't take long
before you can ticktock.

00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle
So, your front foot always comes off.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.042 align:middle
You just don't talk enough.

00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:03.292 align:middle
It's not a big deal,
so let's talk a bit more, huh?

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:19.833 align:middle
You okay?

00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:23.958 align:middle
To think an ollie is this difficult...

00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.625 align:middle
You have ollies in snowboarding, too, right?

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.458 align:middle
That's true.

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:32.042 align:middle
But your feet are attached
and your feet doesn't change stances,

00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:34.917 align:middle
so amateurs can pull off something like it.

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle
But in skateboarding, your feet
aren't attached. It still flies with you.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.583 align:middle
It's completely different.

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:43.625 align:middle
How long did it take you
before you got it down, Reki?

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.292 align:middle
Me? Two months!

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:48.542 align:middle
But usually it takes about three months or so.

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:50.583 align:middle
That long?

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:53.208 align:middle
Do you have to be able to do this?

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:57.125 align:middle
The invention of the ollie
changed skating drastically.

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.292 align:middle
It went from a board that just glided along...

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle
...to a board that flies!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle
If you have the ollie down...

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle
...you can go anywhere!

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.292 align:middle
The ollie is a revolution...

00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:09.292 align:middle
...and it is a possibility!

00:08:09.292 --> 00:08:11.958 align:middle
You can enjoy skating without ollies, too!

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.667 align:middle
But if you wanna know the world beyond that...

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:18.417 align:middle
...ollies are a must!

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.958 align:middle
The world beyond that...

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:30.958 align:middle
Here it is!

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.375 align:middle
What about this one?

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:37.333 align:middle
The feet are fixed in place.
I didn't know they had stuff like this.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:40.458 align:middle
Yeah. This would keep me from being scared.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:42.375 align:middle
Want me to make you one?

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:43.917 align:middle
You can make this?

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:46.917 align:middle
You want a bigger deck than that, too, right?

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:47.875 align:middle
You can tell?

00:08:47.875 --> 00:08:50.375 align:middle
Based on how you skated the other day.

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle
With a bigger deck, the wheel base can
be wider, as well, giving you more stability.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.917 align:middle
You're worried about being unstable, right?

00:08:58.917 --> 00:09:01.083 align:middle
Did you wobble in a corner
in the middle of your skating?

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:03.667 align:middle
Yeah, I did! How do you know so much?

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:05.542 align:middle
I know...

00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:07.708 align:middle
...because it's about skating.

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:09.667 align:middle
I see.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.167 align:middle
This might work.

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:16.083 align:middle
What?

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:18.708 align:middle
They don't sell decks that would suit you.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.125 align:middle
So, I'll make one by shaving this board.

00:09:23.542 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle
Don't just admire it,
but think about your wheels!

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.667 align:middle
Wheels... You mean on the skateboard?

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:33.667 align:middle
Yeah. Bigger ones go faster, but they're heavy,
and little ones mean the opposite.

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:36.583 align:middle
You also have to think about trucks
that go along with the wheels.

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.125 align:middle
Trucks?

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:40.042 align:middle
Oh, jeez!

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle
This is a long board.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle
It's used in surfing for offshore training.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.792 align:middle
This is a cruiser.
It's for going around city streets.

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:51.083 align:middle
And this is a street. It's like the one I use.

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.333 align:middle
If you wanna do tricks, go with these.

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:00.125 align:middle
How did he just do that?

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.375 align:middle
Looks cool, huh?

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:02.792 align:middle
Yeah.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.333 align:middle
That, too?

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle
It's wicked! Only a handful of guys
can pull that off, though.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.083 align:middle
But it's possible.

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle
Amazing.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.292 align:middle
You can skate anywhere.

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:26.625 align:middle
You can't snowboard unless you
go up into the mountains, right?

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:30.917 align:middle
It's no good if there's no pileup of snow, but
it's no good if there's a blizzard out, either.

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:34.292 align:middle
But you can skate even in school!

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:35.833 align:middle
The park, the mountains!

00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:37.542 align:middle
Morning, evening!

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:38.958 align:middle
Even if it's not snowing!

00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:39.917 align:middle
Yep!

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle
Anytime, anywhere, under
any circumstances, you can skate!

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.833 align:middle
Time, place, possibilities...

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:48.417 align:middle
Skating is infinite!

00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.042 align:middle
Infinite...

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:40.625 align:middle
You okay?

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:43.625 align:middle
Ouch!

00:11:43.625 --> 00:11:44.833 align:middle
Huh? Blood!

00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:46.500 align:middle
I drew blood! Blood!

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.542 align:middle
You're overreacting.

00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:54.542 align:middle
It took me so long before I could nail
an ollie. It almost made me quit.

00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:56.000 align:middle
SHADOW, how long before you got some air?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.625 align:middle
Took me one month.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle
I did it in two weeks.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.417 align:middle
The more you bail, the better you get!

00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:05.542 align:middle
So, bail to your heart's content!

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle
You make it sound like it's not your business.

00:12:08.917 --> 00:12:12.667 align:middle
But then, it was like that in snowboarding, too.

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:17.625 align:middle
So, Langa, why did you come here to Okinawa?

00:12:17.625 --> 00:12:20.083 align:middle
Did you parents get relocated?

00:12:20.083 --> 00:12:22.833 align:middle
It's because my dad died.

00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:25.375 align:middle
This is where my mom grew up.

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:29.375 align:middle
I was looking for a job so that I could
help out with the family income.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle
I see.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:37.333 align:middle
Is it boring out here?

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle
I mean, it doesn't snow.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.125 align:middle
You can't snowboard.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle
Oh...

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle
After my dad died,
I didn't snowboard in Canada, either.

00:12:51.875 --> 00:12:53.208 align:middle
But...

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.625 align:middle
...after getting on a board
for the first time in a while...

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.333 align:middle
...for some reason...

00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:05.333 align:middle
...right now...

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:07.917 align:middle
...I'm having fun!

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:19.125 align:middle
Ouch!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:25.042 align:middle
So? How do you feel
after nailing your first ollie?

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:29.042 align:middle
It feels really good!

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:30.542 align:middle
Langa...

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:40.792 align:middle
Ouch!

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:44.083 align:middle line:7%
"HEY!
HERE YA GO!"

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:44.667 align:middle line:7%
"HEY!
HERE YA GO!"
"DROOL"

00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:46.333 align:middle line:7%
"HE HE HE"

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.083 align:middle line:7%
"SK8 the Infinity"

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:55.958 align:middle line:7%
"NOOOOO"

00:13:55.958 --> 00:13:57.083 align:middle line:7%
"SK8 the Infinity"

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:08.792 align:middle
Gotta hand it to Cherry!

00:14:08.792 --> 00:14:10.375 align:middle
An accurate skating!

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:13.542 align:middle
Huh! "S" isn't like competitive skating.

00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:16.625 align:middle
The fast and the stylish are the most powerful!

00:14:16.625 --> 00:14:18.083 align:middle
Just like me!

00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:19.833 align:middle
You don't get it, do you?

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:22.750 align:middle
The best is the fast and the cute.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.333 align:middle
You know, you really aren't cute on the inside.

00:14:25.333 --> 00:14:28.542 align:middle
Thanks for saying that I'm cute on the outside.

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:30.292 align:middle
I didn't say that!

00:14:31.917 --> 00:14:33.667 align:middle
Hey, it's JOE!

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.792 align:middle
We'll decide via a challenge!

00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:43.333 align:middle
I accept!

00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:44.750 align:middle
They're fighting again.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.458 align:middle
Ouch!

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:49.375 align:middle
Simpleton.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:51.458 align:middle
These guys are always at it!

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:53.958 align:middle
They sure haven't grown up
even though they're adults.

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:56.292 align:middle
It's a good thing they didn't go up
against each other in the tournament.

00:14:56.292 --> 00:15:00.083 align:middle
Agreed. They would be arguing
at the starting line and not move at all.

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:01.792 align:middle
Possibly!

00:15:05.042 --> 00:15:07.000 align:middle line:7%
"MIYAKOJIMA"
"BENEFITS OF HOT SPRING"

00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:10.208 align:middle
This is when we all went
to that secluded hot spring!

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:12.625 align:middle
All of you guys were in good spirits.

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:15.458 align:middle
Shut up! You were pretty merry yourself.

00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:17.542 align:middle
You got drunk and bear-hugged JOE.

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle
No way!

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.292 align:middle
Carla, pull it up for him.

00:15:21.292 --> 00:15:23.250 align:middle
Manager!

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.875 align:middle
I... I... I'm in love with how you work!

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:27.833 align:middle
Stop it! I'm not your manager!

00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:29.208 align:middle
Seriously?

00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle
After this, JOE had you in a joint-locking move

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.542 align:middle
and your neck was pointing
in a weird direction. Were you okay?

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:38.833 align:middle
Come to think of it, I couldn't
turn my neck when I woke up.

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:40.083 align:middle
Huh?

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:42.583 align:middle
Whoo!

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:43.542 align:middle
Yeah!

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.667 align:middle
Yahoo!

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle
Yeah!

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.667 align:middle
Beach!

00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:57.042 align:middle
What swimwear you choose
really shows your personality.

00:15:57.042 --> 00:15:58.875 align:middle
You and those swim briefs...

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle
You love being seen by others way too much.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.458 align:middle
Why'd you say that? I looked good in that!

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.333 align:middle
Langa's weakness was the sun, huh?

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.292 align:middle
You see...

00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:12.917 align:middle
...he's from Canada,
so he's not used to the heat.

00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:14.833 align:middle
An unexpected weakness.

00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:17.417 align:middle
Cherry didn't go into
the waters the entire time.

00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:19.542 align:middle
What the hell was he there for?

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:21.333 align:middle
Work, wasn't it?

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:23.875 align:middle
Though, JOE tossed him into
the ocean at the very end.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle
Oh, he was totally pissed off about that!

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:31.167 align:middle
Afterwards, he used a paintbrush to
skillfully write insults on JOE's aloha shirt.

00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:33.875 align:middle
Is he still a kid?

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:35.917 align:middle
--SHADOW?
--SHADOW?

00:16:35.917 --> 00:16:36.708 align:middle
Are you okay?

00:16:36.708 --> 00:16:38.583 align:middle
--Stinky!
--Stinky!

00:16:38.583 --> 00:16:40.083 align:middle
--MIYA!
--MIYA!

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.083 align:middle
Hey, get a grip! Stinky!

00:16:42.083 --> 00:16:44.375 align:middle
What in the world-- Stinky!

00:16:54.375 --> 00:17:00.375 align:middle
--Scary, scary, scary, scary!
--Stinky, stinky, stinky, stinky!

00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle
In the end, what were these things?

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.375 align:middle
They could ride skateboards, too.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:08.708 align:middle
I couldn't get the odor from my board
that got used for quite a while.

00:17:08.708 --> 00:17:11.042 align:middle
--SHADOW, they took your board, too?
--You, too?

00:17:11.042 --> 00:17:13.667 align:middle
I was skating along, and suddenly,
something grabbed my foot.

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:15.833 align:middle
I had a ball of mud flung at me.

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle
It stank so bad I pinched my nose,

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.625 align:middle
and that was when they caught me
and smeared me all over with that stuff!

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle
You just made me remember that odor!

00:17:26.583 --> 00:17:32.292 align:middle
--Nooooo!
--Nooooo!

00:17:32.292 --> 00:17:33.458 align:middle
So...

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:36.417 align:middle
...what in the world were those things anyway?

00:17:36.417 --> 00:17:37.958 align:middle
Wha-- What?

00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.667 align:middle
Oh, it's that guy who left you in the dust.

00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:44.125 align:middle
He merely got past one of my 88 special attacks.

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:46.500 align:middle
You have that many attacks?

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.708 align:middle
Just you watch! Next time I see him,
I'll go full throttle from the start!

00:17:53.042 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle
He was an ominous skater.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle
Identity unknown.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle
And...

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.250 align:middle
...it feels like his style of skating...

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.542 align:middle
...is similar to ADAM's.

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:10.583 align:middle
It's ADAM!

00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:11.542 align:middle
He's here!

00:18:11.542 --> 00:18:13.375 align:middle
I've been waiting for this!

00:18:16.583 --> 00:18:18.708 align:middle
And we have our final boss!

00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:24.625 align:middle
Skating should be fun.

00:18:24.625 --> 00:18:27.542 align:middle
You have quite a good quote there.

00:18:27.542 --> 00:18:28.625 align:middle
It's ADAM!

00:18:28.625 --> 00:18:30.042 align:middle
Seriously?

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:31.458 align:middle
I've never seen him before!

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:33.958 align:middle
Whoa, the legend has descended!

00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.208 align:middle
You, at this point...

00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:39.167 align:middle
...have nothing left.

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:42.000 align:middle
...take your foot...

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.333 align:middle
Mind if I touch you?

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:51.750 align:middle
If emotions could be seen by the eye,
what shapes would they be?

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.917 align:middle
Good.

00:18:52.917 --> 00:18:55.042 align:middle
You're good.

00:18:55.042 --> 00:18:56.625 align:middle
It flows out.

00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:58.542 align:middle
It gushes out.

00:19:03.083 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle
I'm free here!

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.167 align:middle
Anything and everything!

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:25.542 align:middle
I caught up!

00:19:25.542 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle
Here, here!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle
Right in my heart!

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.833 align:middle
Squeee!

00:19:35.625 --> 00:19:37.792 align:middle
Now... Little Langa...

00:19:37.792 --> 00:19:39.708 align:middle
...dance with me!

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:54.958 align:middle
Here we go!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.958 align:middle
This is so fun, SNOW!

00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle
Love-Love-Love-Lovely!

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.583 align:middle
Come here...

00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle
...into my arms!

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.792 align:middle
Love Hug!

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.958 align:middle
I found you.

00:20:27.958 --> 00:20:29.875 align:middle
You are...

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:33.000 align:middle
...my true...

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.542 align:middle
...EVE!

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:43.167 align:middle
All you fools who love skateboarding!

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:45.042 align:middle
I had been in love...

00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:46.833 align:middle
...with all of them.

00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:50.167 align:middle
You tend to notice how flamboyant he is...

00:20:50.167 --> 00:20:54.250 align:middle
...but if you don't have the basics down,
you can't do anything like that.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.208 align:middle
His core muscle strength and precision
are both world-class.

00:20:58.208 --> 00:21:00.833 align:middle
But I don't plan on losing.

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.292 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:02.292 --> 00:21:04.458 align:middle
I will win!

00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:06.333 align:middle
I will win and prove...

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:09.083 align:middle
...that I've become a strong man.

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:12.333 align:middle
I'm the one who's gonna win!

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:14.667 align:middle
I'm gonna be number one
in the world someday!

00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:17.458 align:middle
Becoming number one in "S"
is just a stepping-stone.

00:21:17.458 --> 00:21:23.458 align:middle
Quite the words there! If you happen
to go against me, I'll make you pay for it.

00:21:27.458 --> 00:21:28.542 align:middle
Cherry's coming back!

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:29.625 align:middle
Turn it off, quick!

00:21:29.625 --> 00:21:31.708 align:middle
Carla, stop video!

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:35.583 align:middle
It's not stopping!
Isn't there a switch or something?

00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle
Let's see. Is it this thing here?
Or is it this one over here?

00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:44.167 align:middle
Hey...

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:46.417 align:middle
It's starting some kinda countdown.

00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:47.417 align:middle
What should we do?

00:21:47.417 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle
What'll we do if it blows up?
We're gonna cause trouble to the other patients!

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle
It's a skateboard! No way that would happen!

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.458 align:middle
But this is Cherry, so he might have
some self-destruct mechanism built in.

00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle
There's no... Yeah, can't scratch that out!

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:02.667 align:middle
It's not gonna stop!

00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:05.292 align:middle
You know what, in times like this...

00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:08.333 align:middle
Carla, give us some relaxing music.

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle
That's not gonna stop this at all!

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.625 align:middle

"NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW"
Yours truly will go up against ADAM next!

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.833 align:middle
Yours truly will go up against ADAM next!

00:23:44.833 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle
I'm playing games, so keep it quiet.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.458 align:middle
--Why you--
--Hey, my game!

00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:52.083 align:middle
Jeez, kids nowadays... When people
are talking to you, make eye contact!

00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle
Oh, it's the manager!

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.542 align:middle line:7%
   
   
Oh, I'm so embarrassed,
I can't make eye contact!
