Ollies aren't supposed
to be difficult.

Aren't ollies in snowboarding?

Or is this new?

00:12:57.235 --> 00:12:58.695 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Yeah, they are.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
But your feet are attached and
your stance doesn't change,

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.907 position:50% align:center
so it's not some
kind of advanced move.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
Even amateurs can pull it off.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.786 position:50% align:center
Since a skateboard
doesn't attach,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.621 position:50% align:center
you have to get it
to fly with you.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.790 position:50% align:center

How long did it take you

For me? Two months!

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.380 position:50% align:center
But that's pretty
good considering

00:13:17.464 --> 00:13:18.965 position:50% align:center

00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.925 position:50% align:center
Three months?

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:23.470 position:50% align:center
Can't I be the one person who
doesn't know how to do it?

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:25.180 position:50% align:center

don't wanna compete.

into a board that flies!

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:35.273 position:50% align:center

you can go wherever you want!

still fun without ollies.

in the park with the kids...
