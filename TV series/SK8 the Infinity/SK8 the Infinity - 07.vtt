[REKI] Hey, Mom!
Did you make me a lunch?

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:51.042 align:middle
It's on the table, dear!

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.125 align:middle
[REKI]
Got it!

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:59.417 align:middle
Oh my gosh, is he actually
gonna make it on time?

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:12.375 align:middle
Hey, what's up?

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.833 align:middle
Hangin' out. Where we goin'?

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:17.042 align:middle
I was thinking
the Big Wood course?

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:18.542 align:middle
Sounds great!

[TAKANO] The route from Maeda
Construction has been squashed?

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.042 align:middle
It has. And the secret
account ledger as well.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:21.708 align:middle
Good deal. If they
find out about the funding,

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.667 align:middle
it'll be the last time
I wear my badge.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:27.042 align:middle
Mr. Takano.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle
Word on the street is that
there's been some collusion.

Care to share what you know
about Nagahama Dam?

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle
[ADAM] I believe I went over
all this during the assembly.

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.083 align:middle
The bidding was done
according to regulations.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:39.833 align:middle
How very unfortunate.

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.292 align:middle
Still using your same
logic of factions,

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.792 align:middle
but covering for a
more tenured member.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle
I'm simply answering
your question.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle
Just because you
gave an explanation

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:50.625 align:middle
doesn't mean it's accurate,

00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:53.083 align:middle
but you'd never
engage in perjury.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:54.417 align:middle
Glad you know that.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.167 align:middle
And I trust you know
the difference between

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.542 align:middle
innocent speculation
and blatant defamation.

It's not unusual for him to

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:06.458 align:middle
zone out and daydream.

00:04:06.542 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle
But ever since his
father passed away,

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:11.625 align:middle
it's like talking
to Langa's ghost.

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:13.167 align:middle
I was actually debating
whether or not

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.333 align:middle
to bring him back to Okinawa.

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:16.792 align:middle
He loves snowboarding so much,

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle
and I was worried it would
feel like a second loss.

[LANGA'S MOM]
But here we are.

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:25.375 align:middle
And it feels like
I did the right thing.

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:28.583 align:middle
He's made new friends,
and even picked up a new hobby.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:29.667 align:middle
He thinks I don't know that

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.583 align:middle
he sneaks out
several nights a week.

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:35.958 align:middle
I just hope he stays safe
and keeps his grades up.

Everyone loves him.

I don't know why you're
gushing over it.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:51.875 align:middle
The only thing anyone knows
about you these days

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle
is you're his friend.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:54.625 align:middle
Or maybe his groupie.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle
Who cares if I'm his friend?

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:58.083 align:middle
And what in the heck
is a groupie?

00:04:58.167 --> 00:04:59.958 align:middle
That's funny. "Groupie."

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:03.292 align:middle
It's like your new nickname is
"that one who's not Langa"!

You just mean you.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.000 align:middle
This is what's called
a teachable moment.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:56.875 align:middle
Overconfidence is poison,
but true confidence is power.

Wow! How was he able to
gain that much air?

Well, he's gone.

He's higher up
than any of us now.

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.292 align:middle
[CHERRY] Must be one of his
snowboarding techniques.

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:24.167 align:middle
If he can catch that much air,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.667 align:middle
he'll quickly become
a greater threat throughout S.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle
He's got guts.

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.625 align:middle
He doesn't back down
under any circumstance.

00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.792 align:middle
His body never curls up.
His core remains strong.

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:38.833 align:middle
Every move he makes suggests
he's had substantial training.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:40.167 align:middle
Oh, yeah.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.833 align:middle
He said he's been snowboarding
since he was two.

[CHERRY] Many prominent sports
athletes have excellent finesse

and are blessed with
strong backbones.

Langa must've had an
exceptional early instructor.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.542 align:middle
He's been honing his
talents for a while.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle
If it was something he was into,

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:58.542 align:middle
I'm sure he could be on
the Japanese national team.

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.708 align:middle
[CHERRY] All of this
in a matter of months.

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:08.625 align:middle
He's that good? Amazing.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle
Inspector Kamata has managed
to procure a witness.

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:12.875 align:middle
This would be a former
mistress of Mr. Taka--

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.292 align:middle
[ADAM]
I need to head to Crazy Rock.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle
Arrange transportation.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:20.708 align:middle
At a time like this?
You're sure?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.542 align:middle
I'll have it prepared, sir.

00:10:24.625 --> 00:10:26.292 align:middle
[ADAM]
Good doggy.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.208 align:middle
[LANGA] Reki! Why did you head
back without me like that?

00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:38.167 align:middle
Sorry. I spaced out.

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.375 align:middle
[LANGA] What time do you
wanna meet up tonight?

00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:44.458 align:middle
Huh?

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:47.667 align:middle
There's a match, isn't there?

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle
Yeah, guess so. I've got
errands to run so I can't.

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:54.833 align:middle
[LANGA]
At midnight?

00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:58.208 align:middle
[REKI] Why don't you
go without me? Cool?

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle
If you're sure.

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:03.708 align:middle
[SKATER 7I] Is it true?
Is Adam really coming tonight?

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:06.208 align:middle
If so, there's supposed to be
some big news dropped!

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:07.625 align:middle
[SKATER 7J]
What could it be?

00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:09.292 align:middle
[SKATER 7I] How would I know?
But it's gotta be huge!

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:10.958 align:middle
[CARLA]
Approaching corner.

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:15.375 align:middle
[MIYA]
Langa! Where's Reki?

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:17.458 align:middle
He said he had to
run an errand tonight.

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:20.667 align:middle
Oh. What, is he a vampire?

00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:25.667 align:middle
[REKI]
You're leaning back too much!

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.292 align:middle
There you go!
You got it, just keep trying!

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:31.542 align:middle
[REKI] So weird to think this
was just a few months ago.

00:11:31.625 --> 00:11:32.917 align:middle
Look, I'm doing it!

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.167 align:middle
[gasps]

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.208 align:middle
[REKI] I'm the one
who was teaching him.

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:38.458 align:middle
That one was better. Wasn't it?

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:39.583 align:middle
[REKI laughs]
Yeah, it was!

00:11:39.667 --> 00:11:41.708 align:middle
[REKI]
And now he ranks higher than me?

00:11:41.792 --> 00:11:43.583 align:middle
How did that happen?

00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:48.458 align:middle
[REKI] I've been doing this
so much longer than he has.

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:50.708 align:middle
Am I not practicing enough?

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:53.125 align:middle
Not talented, like, at all?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.792 align:middle
[REKI]
I don't get it.

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:58.667 align:middle
How is he jumping
so much higher so soon?

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.083 align:middle
Did he sell his
soul or something?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle
[LANGA]
I can go faster than this.

00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:12.417 align:middle
[LANGA]
Faster!

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:18.375 align:middle
Yeah, I know, that's what
I told him yesterday.

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:22.083 align:middle
[SKATER 7K]
Whoa! Did you see that?

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:28.958 align:middle
[CARLA] Hazardous speeding.
Hazardous speeding.

00:12:29.042 --> 00:12:30.708 align:middle

Children.

Heads up! On your right! Langa!

Yo, kid. You doin' okay?

Yeah, why?

[JOE]
Hm?

[gasps]

00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:47.833 align:middle
No way!

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.625 align:middle
[CHERRY]
Oh goodie.

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:56.708 align:middle
[SKATERS chattering]

00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:57.917 align:middle
[SKATER 7M]
Adam's here!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.958 align:middle
[SKATER 7N]
Frikkin awesome!

00:12:59.042 --> 00:13:00.625 align:middle
[SKATER 7O]
That's how it's done!

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.042 align:middle
He showed up.

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:12.875 align:middle
Good to see me, isn't it?

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle
I come baring exciting news.

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:19.333 align:middle
We'll finally know
who the real top is.

00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:21.083 align:middle
It's a tournament, my loves!

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.083 align:middle
[SKATERS cheer]

[SKATER 7P] As if this night
wasn't already amazing!

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.042 align:middle
[SKATER 7Q]
So, this was the announcement!

00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle
[SKATER 7P] We already
know Adam's gonna win!

00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.167 align:middle
[SKATER 7F] No one's better
than my sweet Cherry!

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.875 align:middle
[SKATER 7R] Joe's gonna
crush all those drips!

00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.083 align:middle
[SKATER 7Q] That Snow Rookie's
been killin' it!

00:13:34.167 --> 00:13:36.458 align:middle
Now they'll all know
who's the best.

00:13:36.542 --> 00:13:38.750 align:middle
I'm down. Let's do it.

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:42.000 align:middle
The first in eight years.

00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:44.000 align:middle
[CHERRY]
Finally, a real fight.

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:47.542 align:middle
This time. I'm ready for him.

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.083 align:middle
[REKI]
I'm beggin' ya.

00:13:49.167 --> 00:13:52.000 align:middle
Promise me you won't
skate against Adam!

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:57.083 align:middle
[ADAM] I've sent an
entry form to your devices.

00:13:57.167 --> 00:14:00.625 align:middle
I'm sure everyone who claims
to love skating will register.

00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:03.625 align:middle
I will be competing as well.

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:05.625 align:middle

[JOURNALIST 3A]
Dang, he's really working hard!

00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:35.500 align:middle
Is he in a tournament?

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.750 align:middle
[COACH 3A] Uh no, I didn't
sign him up for anything.

00:14:38.833 --> 00:14:42.292 align:middle
[MIYA] They're all about to
learn how much I enjoy winning.

00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:46.333 align:middle
I'm sorry about that!

00:14:46.417 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle
I didn't mean to leave
you alone for so long!

All good! Hope I didn't mess up!

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.208 align:middle
I never once doubted
your capabilities!

What?

00:14:58.458 --> 00:14:59.958 align:middle
Remember that time
you said you had a thing

00:15:00.042 --> 00:15:01.625 align:middle
for strong people or whatever?

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:03.208 align:middle

Um. I found a cool place where
I can work out and train myself.

regularly for a while.

ridiculously strong now.

00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle
And I really want to
prove it to you soon.

[CHERRY]
Are you listening to me?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle
You've changed, Adam!

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:30.167 align:middle
I want to know why!

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.375 align:middle
We're supposed to
evolve as humans.

00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:34.292 align:middle
Well then evolve one more time!

00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:36.333 align:middle
You shouldn't be
skating like that!

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:37.708 align:middle
Not your choice.

00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:39.792 align:middle
Besides, I'm out of time.

00:15:39.875 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle
I'm leaving for America
first thing tomorrow.

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:46.042 align:middle
I can't keep playing on
the ramps with you guys.

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:48.375 align:middle
It's time for me to move on.

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:56.042 align:middle
I had a feeling I'd
find you out here.

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle
What do you think?
Gonna enter the tournament?

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.125 align:middle
Foolish question.

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle
What about you?

00:16:04.542 --> 00:16:05.750 align:middle
I can't wait.

to crushing him.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.167 align:middle
Huh? Uh. Last night.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.125 align:middle

I don't care, dude.

I hate him, right?

Hey, Langa.

Um...

do that ten times in a row?

If they find Takano guilty,

I'll be accused of perjury.

new tricks, can ya?

this kinda thing before,

exactly how I
measure up to Langa.

00:18:57.333 --> 00:19:00.167 align:middle
So what if I can't land
ten out of ten like he can.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.208 align:middle
I can do at least one in five!

00:19:02.292 --> 00:19:05.042 align:middle
Screw that!
I can do one in three!

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.625 align:middle

What? Reki's not here?

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:10.833 align:middle
I don't think so.

00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:13.083 align:middle
I just assumed he was
somewhere with you!

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.875 align:middle
[REKI grunting]

00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:25.917 align:middle
[REKI]
Dammit!

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle
[MIYA] Sorry! This is hard to do
if you're not talented!

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:34.833 align:middle
[REKI groans]

00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:37.958 align:middle
Your new nickname is
"that one who's not Langa"!

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:39.125 align:middle
[REKI groans]

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:42.042 align:middle
Not enough. Is this your best?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.375 align:middle
[REKI grunts]

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:53.458 align:middle
[panting]

00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:59.417 align:middle
[REKI] I can't reach.
It's impossible for me.

Reki!

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:20.792 align:middle
Welcome back.

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.833 align:middle
What do you want, Langa?

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:31.333 align:middle
[LANGA]
Adam's hosting a tournament.

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:36.292 align:middle
So what?

00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:38.583 align:middle
I think I want to enter.

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:39.875 align:middle
[REKI]
What about the promise you made?

00:20:39.958 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle
[gasps] Oh, that.

00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:47.292 align:middle
[REKI] You swore you wouldn't
go up against Adam again!

00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:49.292 align:middle
[LANGA]
I know. And I'm sorry--

00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle
Don't say that!

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.375 align:middle
You're apologizing because
you've already decided

00:20:53.458 --> 00:20:55.083 align:middle
to break your promise!

00:20:55.167 --> 00:20:57.667 align:middle
Do you know how much
I trusted you?

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:03.458 align:middle
Forget it.

00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:05.833 align:middle
Reki! Listen!

00:21:05.917 --> 00:21:07.208 align:middle
C'mon, it's just a race!

00:21:07.292 --> 00:21:09.417 align:middle
Against a monster!

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.708 align:middle
Against an amazing skater.

00:21:11.792 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle
I know you understand
what that's like.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:17.667 align:middle
Competing against someone
so good is exhilarating!

00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:21.250 align:middle
You're excited?

00:21:22.708 --> 00:21:24.167 align:middle
Well, I...

00:21:26.167 --> 00:21:28.417 align:middle
[REKI]
I don't get excited.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.625 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:29.708 --> 00:21:32.083 align:middle
I gotta say you're
freaking me out.

00:21:32.167 --> 00:21:34.667 align:middle
I don't see how
you consider this fun.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.458 align:middle
I don't get you at all!

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.167 align:middle
You and Adam are
nothing like me.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle
Not a single bit.

00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle
[gasps]

00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:49.167 align:middle
[REKI]
Do what you want. I don't care.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.458 align:middle
Psycho geniuses have to
stick together, I guess.

00:21:51.542 --> 00:21:53.667 align:middle
Have fun with that.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.583 align:middle
Not like I can keep up.

00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:02.667 align:middle
[REKI]
I thought you were different.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.083 align:middle
Such a stupid mistake.

00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:08.083 align:middle
Reki...

00:23:42.917 --> 00:23:44.667 align:middle
[ADAM] Tadashi,
my references for the meeting.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:45.583 align:middle
[TADASHI]
I have them ready here.

00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:46.708 align:middle
[ADAM]
My skateboard.

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:47.583 align:middle
[TADASHI]
I've loaded it into the car.

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:48.833 align:middle
[ADAM]
Praise me.

00:23:48.917 --> 00:23:49.500 align:middle
[TADASHI] You are magnanimous,
Mr. Ainosuke.

00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:50.625 align:middle
[ADAM]
More.

00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:51.208 align:middle
[TADASHI]
So passionate and dauntless.

00:23:51.292 --> 00:23:52.208 align:middle
[ADAM]
More!

00:23:52.292 --> 00:23:53.083 align:middle
[TADASHI]
You possess the charisma

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.292 align:middle
of the entire "S" community--

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:55.625 align:middle
You have overwhelming
skill and beauty...

00:23:55.708 --> 00:23:56.958 align:middle
[ADAM]
More!
