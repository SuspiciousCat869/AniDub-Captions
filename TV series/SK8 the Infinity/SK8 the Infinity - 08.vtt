WEBVTT

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.875
[ADAM] Oh my. I truly believed
I had found my match,

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:23.500
someone who could
keep up with me.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:30.208
[ADAM] I was right.
It was worth loving you.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:41.083
[ADAM] Join me. Let's go away
to a world meant only for us!

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.709
[SKATER 8A screams]

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.166
[JOE]
Hey, are you okay?

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.166
So the rumors about him
were true after all!

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.417
Adam! Why are you doing
something like this?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.375
[ADAM] I truly had
my hopes up this time.

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:04.291
What the hell are you
talking about?

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:07.583
[ADAM]
Isn't there someone made for me?

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:12.917
[ADAM]
When will I ever find my Eve?

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:45.875
[SKATER 8B]
Looks who's in the first group.

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.000
[SKATER 8C]
I'm in a heat with Shadow?

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:49.250
Hey, I don't see your name.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:51.625
[JOE] Neither of us are
facing Adam up front.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.250
[CHERRY] I'll get there.
I just have to keep on winning.

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:56.709
If you're in the
top two of your group,

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.125
you'll be able to move on
to the main tournament!

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.583
That sounds easy enough!

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:04.542
Langa!

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.041
I thought Reki
would be with you,

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:09.500
but I guess he decided not to
enter the race after all.

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:12.041
That's right, he's not.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:13.000
[MIYA]
What happened?

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:14.417
We, uh...

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.166
I bet he's just being a wiener
about Adam! [chuckles]

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.041
[SKATER 8D] The qualifiers
are about to begin!

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:32.583
Adam's group is up!
I can't wait!

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.250
[SKATER 8A]
Miya! Kick some ass!

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:37.125
What a lovely first.
Skating alongside you.

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.917
Except I'm not one of those
slimey little troll boys.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.750
And I won't be taken out easily.

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:44.208
"Taken out"?
What do you mean by that?

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.709
You're not that dumb.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.709
Sweetie, love's not dumb.

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:51.083
And I always fall hopelessly in
love with my skating partners.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.417
You what?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.834
[ADAM] Oh, at times it
may feel a little rough,

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:59.041
but it's just love
in a different form.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.709
This is for your own good.

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:05.667
I hope you understand
that we aren't doing this

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.166
because we're angry
with you, Ainosuke.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.625
On the contrary,

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.500
we're doing it because
we love you so much.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.041
I'm grateful to you, Aunties.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.959
And I love each
of you very much.

00:04:22.041 --> 00:04:24.041
Thank you for loving me.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:29.792
[ADAM] I have been in love...
with all of them.

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:40.667
[SHADOW]
Adam's in the lead!

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.500
The qualifiers are bookin' it.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.208
Crazy. This battle
isn't gonna last long.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.083
[MIYA]
I have to catch up.

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.709
I didn't realize
there was this big a gap!

00:04:56.667 --> 00:04:59.417
You're still a bud
who hasn't blossomed yet.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.875
But when you do, that's when
I will fall for you.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.583
[SKATER 8E]
Joe's group is next!

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:07.000
[SKATER 8F]
Snow's up, too!

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:09.917
[SKATER 8G] And they're
back to back! That's so wild!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.250
[SKATER 8H] Listen up, guys.
Joe has to win first place.

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:16.291
We gotta take out that newb.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:18.875
It's gonna take
everything we've got!

00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:31.458
[gasps]

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.250
[SKATER 8H]
Bet you haven't seen anything

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.375
like this before,
have you, rookie?

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:39.542
Someone's not playing fair.

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:42.250
[SKATER 8H]
This is going to be so much fun!

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:48.625
[SKATER 8I]
Take that!

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:50.083
[SKATER 8J]
I got him!

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:52.959
[SKATER 8K]
Snow actually got through!

00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:54.709
[SKATER 8L]
Against five of them? No way!

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.083
Not bad, kid,

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:58.083
looks like you don't need
my assistance after all.

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.333
[SKATER 8H]
You won't get away from me!

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.709
That's cute, but no.

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:04.208
[SHADOW]
Heh. Boring.

00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:06.125
[CHERRY]
The qualifiers are misleading.

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:08.208
It's obvious who's going to win.

00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:12.417
Failing in the very first race
is one way to get laughs.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.583
[SKATER 8M]
Here they come!

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.250
[SKATER 8N]
It's Joe and Snow!

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:16.875
[SKATER 8M]
You got this, rookie!

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.291
[SKATER 8N]
They dusted those losers!

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.792
[LANGA]
What is that?

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:25.375
Any other time I've
skated like this,

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:28.041
my heart always pounded so loud.

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:38.625
[gasps] Reki!

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:43.583
How lovely. What a wonderful
performance. Like falling snow!

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.208
You're way too good for this.

00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.458
And I understand how you feel.

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:50.083
That's why you should
work with me.

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:55.375
[CHERRY]
Carla, what was Adam's time?

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:57.417
[CARLA]
Four minutes exactly.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.583
Who's in the lead?

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:06.041
Do you even have to ask?

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.166
[GIRLS]
It's Lord Cherry!

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.041
[CHERRY]
Carla, Type, Long!

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:14.250
[CARLA]
Okay, Master. Type, Long.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.750
All you have to do
is make it to top two

00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:22.417
to move on to the final round.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.417
Why is Cherry being so dramatic?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.041
[JOE] He's going up against Adam
and needs to stand out.

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:28.625
[MIYA]
What?

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:31.291
[JOE] He's focused on
beating Adam's time.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.458
[SKATER 8Q]
Let's go, Cherry!

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.834
[CHERRY]
Carla. Report.

00:07:37.917 --> 00:07:39.792
[CARLA]
Four minutes exactly.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:49.125
[SHADOW] All right, folks,
hold onto your butts,

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:51.625
it's time for the main event.

00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:53.834
You kidding me?

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:56.417
Even at my slowest,
I'm still crushing you punks.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.000
How in the hell did I
end up in Shadow's group?

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:01.875
[SKATERS gasp]

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.333
They're all gonna
feel stupid when I'm

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:05.542
the only one crossing
the finish line.

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:08.333
[gasps] For real?

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:10.000
[SKATER 8U]
Did he just pass Shadow?

00:08:10.083 --> 00:08:12.792
[SKATER 8V] Where'd this dude
in the hat even come from?

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:14.792
I don't think I've
ever seen that guy.

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.500
Is that Reki?

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:20.959
No way. He wouldn't.

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:27.709
[ADAM]
What are you doing?

00:08:27.792 --> 00:08:29.208
[SKATER 8W]
Who the heck is that?

00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:32.125
[SKATER 8X] Some wild card?
Look how fast he's going!

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:33.542
[SKATER 8W]
How is this happening?

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:37.709
Heh. Only an idiot would think
"S" is just about speed!

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:41.625
Haemanthus Bomb!

00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:45.875
Oh no, no!

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:48.333
[SHADOW screams]

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:49.375
[SKATER 8Y]
Rad!

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:50.667
[SKATER 8Z]
Seriously, who is that?

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.917
His registered name is Snake.

00:08:56.583 --> 00:09:00.667
[ADAM] Are you trying to
tempt me to bite your apple?

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:04.917
[CHERRY]
Carla, time?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.625
[CARLA]
Three minutes, 58 seconds.

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:08.083
That's a new record!

00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:09.875
[SKATER 8AA]
He surpassed Adam's time!

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:13.291
Okay, I give up!
Who the hell is that dude?

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:16.750
[ADAM]
What is the meaning of this?

00:09:16.834 --> 00:09:19.375
You have deliberately
disobeyed me.

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:22.625
I never authorized you
to enter the tournament.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.000
Answer me. Dog!

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:32.917
I've been dying
to race against you.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.500
Race me?

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:36.875
[TADASHI]
And if I win, I want you to

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:39.000
step away from skateboarding.

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:41.542
[ADAM] You say that as if
it's even a possibility.

00:09:41.625 --> 00:09:43.625
I realize it's been
quite some time.

00:09:43.709 --> 00:09:46.875
But don't forget I'm the one
who taught you how to skate.

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:53.750
[ADAM] You little worm!
Why would you bring that up now?

00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:59.291
I am going to win this race.

00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:04.500
[ADAM]
Go ahead and try!

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:07.458
A dog is never allowed
to disobey his owner.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:10.250
And if he does,
then he gets broken!

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.750
[CLASSMATE 8A] Yo, Langa!
Wild night last night?

00:10:31.834 --> 00:10:33.250
[CLASSMATE 8A]
Good morning, Langa!

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.667
[LANGA]
Good morning.

00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.834
Hey, Reki. How's it going?

00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:42.375
[REKI]
Hi.

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:45.125
Guess what? First round's done.

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:46.834
Great.

00:10:50.208 --> 00:10:52.792
Not like that has
anything to do with me.

00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:02.000
[INTERVIEWER 8A]
Hello and welcome back.

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:05.333
This is "Good Afternoon,"
a segment where we interview--

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.625
This is the absolute worst.

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:12.250
Wow, you really are
a drama queen.

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:14.333
It's like, nothing's ever
just "meh" to you--

00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:16.458
it's always "the worst."

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:18.667
You don't even know what
that was in reference to.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.625
Okay, then tell me.
What's the worst?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.250
No need to answer,
it's written on your face.

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:28.458
To be honest, you actually
do have some level of cool

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:30.250
when you're skating.

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:33.083
[REKI'S SISTER 7A]
That said, I don't know what's

00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:36.250
up with you lately, but woof.

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:39.125
[REKI] Sometimes I just
feel down, that's all.

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:40.917
[REKI'S SISTER 7A]
Aww.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.917
That's why I quit. I knew I
didn't really have the talent.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.333
[INTERVIEWER 8A] So what
lead you to crafting shoes?

00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:49.625
[INTERVIEWEE 8A] Because I
wanted to be involved in track,

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.166
I didn't care what capacity.
I just love it.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.000
The fact that so many
amazing athletes

00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:56.583
rely on my product
is a dream come true.

00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:58.500
[INTERVIEWER 8A]
That is amazing.

00:11:58.583 --> 00:11:59.834
Is it?

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.333
[MATSUMURA] Congratulations.
It's because of you

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:07.542
that we were finally
able to arrest Mr. Takano.

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.166
Well. I appreciate your

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.875
brilliantly covert
leaks, Superintendent.

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:14.125
And trust me, it's not over yet.

00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:14.959
Huh?

00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:16.750
I will nail Mr. Shindo.

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:19.458
He's not going to get away
with a false testimony.

00:12:19.542 --> 00:12:22.375
You have not changed
a bit. Good job.

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:26.583
Oh, save it. Justice
should be served equally.

00:12:26.667 --> 00:12:29.333
[ADAM'S AUNT 4C] I need to
breathe. He's been arrested?

00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:32.041
I can't take it!
Tell me we'll be okay!

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:33.291
[ADAM'S AUNT 4B]
If you are found guilty,

00:12:33.375 --> 00:12:34.834
then our lives will be ruined!

00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:38.250
You will be slinging mud upon
the Shindo Family name!

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.458
[ADAM'S AUNT 4A] Losing your
Diet badge will be the death

00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:42.542
of your political career!

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:46.333
That can't happen,
Ainosuke. Understand?

00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:49.625
You've got it all wrong.
Everything's fine.

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:52.792
Do my sweet Aunties think
I'd let them down so?

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:54.375
How could I?

00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:58.000
You've done nothing but shower
me with love for my entire life.

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:00.500
And besides.

00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:05.667
[ADAM] I've already
prepared a sacrificial lamb.

00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:29.000
[JOE] I bet Adam's skating alone
in the dark like a loser.

00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:30.959
[CHERRY]
Don't be so ridiculous.

00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.250
Everyone is alone
when they practice.

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:35.417
It was only a metaphor, dummy.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.542
It's like he automatically
assumes everyone's his enemy.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.875
He doesn't even give anyone
the chance to get to know him.

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:42.083
It's kinda sad.

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.834
How do you know he does that?

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:45.583
It's just a hunch.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.333
I can't believe I was
fool enough to ask you.

00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:50.333
Why are you complaining
when it was one of my hunches

00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:52.667
that found your lost wallet
on our social studies trip

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.041
back in the day.

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:55.834
Well your cute hunch is
not the reason we found it!

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:58.125
You led us to a random
restaurant in LA!

00:13:58.208 --> 00:13:59.834
[JOE] Well, what about
the bar in Paris?

00:13:59.917 --> 00:14:02.959
[CHERRY] I created the
itinerary for our night out.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.792
Wow. Reki still
isn't showing up.

00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:12.417
I'm going to go check on him
and make sure everything's okay.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.917
Knock it off.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.709
I have a feeling something
happened between him and Langa!

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:18.250
[SHADOW] If that's the case,
they need to put on

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:20.750
their big boy panties
and make up.

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:22.500
I agree with you, but...

00:14:22.583 --> 00:14:25.375
[SHADOW] Also. I've got
my life on the line here,

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:27.959
they better not wreck it.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:31.000
I'll win. I swear.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:37.875
Oh, that's not my order.

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:39.125
Yo.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.750
[REKI]
Hey, Joe.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.083
[JOE] The main tournament
starts today. You coming?

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:46.709
[REKI]
I didn't enter.

00:14:46.792 --> 00:14:49.834
You can still come and watch
if you want. Come on.

00:14:49.917 --> 00:14:54.667
[REKI] I don't belong there.
I'm starting to accept that.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:59.166
[JOE] Hey, Reki. You don't
wanna end up alone.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.417
Huh?

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:06.166
[LANGA]
Uh. Mom.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.417
What is it?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.792
Nothing. The food's good.

00:15:10.875 --> 00:15:14.333
Really? I actually had
a lot of fun making it.

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:16.500
I learned it from--

00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.375
Can I ask you a question?

00:15:18.458 --> 00:15:20.625
Of course.

00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:23.667
Will it, uh, be sunny tomorrow?

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:26.792
[LANGA'S MOM] It's happening!
He's asking my opinion

00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:28.583
on adult weather predictions!

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:31.208
Speaking of sunny,
he's not very happy lately.

00:15:31.291 --> 00:15:32.500
Wait a minute.

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.250
He wants to discuss
his feelings, doesn't he?

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.542
What should I tell him, Oliver?

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:38.959
Mom? You okay?

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:40.000
[LANGA'S MOM gasps]

00:15:40.083 --> 00:15:41.667
[LANGA'S MOM]
I must remain calm.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:44.583
If I make it a big deal,
he won't want to talk openly.

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.667
Teenage boys are
so afraid of feelings!

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.875
I, uh. I kinda
screwed up big time.

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:54.667
And now someone's avoiding me.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.208
[sighs] The same thing
has happened to me.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.500
I know how it hurts.

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.083
Really?

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:03.166
[LANGA'S MOM] You keep
misunderstanding each other.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.834
But it doesn't mean
anyone is truly "wrong."

00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:10.667
No. It's definitely my fault
for breaking a promise.

00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:15.083
I've been there, but the only
thing that will make this right

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:17.667
is being honest
about your feelings.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.917
Be honest?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.500
You like this person, right?

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:26.375
[gasps] Um, yeah...

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:27.542
[LANGA'S MOM]
That's your truth.

00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:29.625
Those are the emotions
you should share.

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:33.000
No way. That's embarrassing.

00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:36.166
It's the only sure way
to help you regain trust.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.375
Show her she's a lucky girl!

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:41.000
What girl?

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.250
Huh?

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:49.667
[LANGA] I wonder if Reki
will come out tonight.

00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:56.333
[LANGA] His window's open!
Does that mean...

00:16:57.458 --> 00:16:58.750
[SKATER 8AB]
What the heck is that?

00:16:58.834 --> 00:17:00.083
[SKATER 8AC]
It's huge!

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:01.709
[SKATER 8AD] We can watch
the race from here?

00:17:01.792 --> 00:17:02.792
[SKATER 8AE]
What kind of entrance will

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:04.125
Adam be making tonight?

00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:06.625
[SKATER 8AF] How can he top
dropping from the sky?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.542
[REKI sighs]

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:17.375
[LANGA]
Joe! You seen Reki? He around?

00:17:17.458 --> 00:17:19.417
Nope. You sure he's here?

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.959
Maybe.

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:23.417
Uh-huh.

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:33.875
Hey, bitches and bros,
and non-binary hoes!

00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:37.208
And now. Are you all ready
to discover the truth?

00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:39.917
Which one among us
loves skating the most?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.083
And who receives
the skating gods blessing?

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.875
[SKATER 8AG]
It's you, Adam!

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:48.917
You're all dying to know
who it is, aren't ya?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.083
I can feel how excited you are!

00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:52.917
[SKATER 8G]
Joe! I love you!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.250
[SKATER 8AJ]
Give 'em hell, Shadow!

00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:59.208
[ADAM] Well then,
let's get on with the show.

00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:02.166
I wonder who our
first challenger will be?

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.625
Shadow!

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:06.250
All right!

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:07.500
[SKATER 8AK]
Yes! Kill it, Shadow!

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:08.792
[SKATER 8AL]
Who's he up against?

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:11.625
[SKATER 8AM]
Come on, draw another one, Adam!

00:18:11.709 --> 00:18:13.041
Who do you think
will win this thing?

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.583
[SKATER 8AO]
Adam, obviously.

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:16.834
[SKATER 8AN] But did you see
Snow? He had that killer race.

00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:19.083
I still say it's gonna be Joe.

00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:20.583
[SKATER 8AQ]
I'm gonna bet on Miya.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.083
[REKI] They are all considered
the best skaters out here.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.375
[REKI] I'm the only one
who isn't amazing.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.291
[SKATER 8AR] Here they come!
Shadow's in the front!

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:37.125
[SKATER 8AS] Show 'em
how to be a man, Harry!

00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:39.417
[SKATER 8AR]
Come on, Shadow!

00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:44.583
[REKI] He's so fast!
Even faster than when we raced.

00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:46.750
[SHADOW] I'm not messin' around
with you kids today.

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.291
I've got my life on
the line for this thing.

00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:53.834
How'd you like a new
Gladiolus Laser!

00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:58.041
[SKATER 8AR]
Shadow wins the round!

00:18:58.125 --> 00:19:00.208
[SKATER 8AS]
I'm fallin' for ya, Daddy!

00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:03.208
Looks like Shadow's
the first one moving up.

00:19:03.291 --> 00:19:06.125
[CHERRY] We're both watching
the same race, sweetie.

00:19:06.208 --> 00:19:09.125
[ADAM] Oh, poor Harry.
On to the next beef.

00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:11.750
Who shall be the happy couple?

00:19:15.291 --> 00:19:17.125
Snow!

00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:21.583
My heart is pounding with envy!

00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:25.542
Which of you lucky contestants
get to skate behind that act?

00:19:25.625 --> 00:19:29.208
[ADAM] Oh pick me.
Oh my god I hope it's me!

00:19:29.291 --> 00:19:32.041
And the lucky opponent is...

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:34.583
Whatever.

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:35.625
[SKATER 8AT]
It's the Snow Joe show!

00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:36.709
[SKATER 8AU]
Who are you betting on?

00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.709
[SKATER 8AV]
Snow is out of control!

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:42.041
It's you and me, Snow.
Good luck, kid.

00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:47.000
[SKATER 8AW] I've never seen
a beef like this in my life.

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:49.041
--[SKATER 8AX] Let's make a bet!
--[SKATER 8AW] I'm in, dawg!

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:50.458

00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:51.667
[SKATER 8AZ]
I'm counting on you, man!

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:52.667

Where's Reki?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:54.083
[SKATER 8J]
Joe, over here!

00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:56.208
[SKATER 8AW] Fastest skater
in the world is Joe!

00:19:56.291 --> 00:19:57.417
[SKATER 8K]
Joe is the man!

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.583
[SKATER 8AX]
What the hell's gonna happen?

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:03.500
[LANGA] I've never raced against
Joe in something so important.

00:20:03.583 --> 00:20:06.709
I wonder if he'll be
harder on me this time.

00:20:06.792 --> 00:20:10.625
In case there was any doubt in
your mind, skaters are idiots.

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:13.333
It's not like there's a cash
prize or like we get elevated

00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:16.500
to some kind of royal throne
by winning these things.

00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:18.959
And one slip and we've
got nightmare injuries,

00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:21.083
but we just can't stay away.

00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:23.709
You gotta be pretty stupid
to get wrapped up in this.

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:25.792
Sounds like you love it.

00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:29.000
Yeah, which is what
makes me such an idiot!

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:32.750
This nothing but a competition
to crown the biggest moron.

00:20:32.834 --> 00:20:35.083
[LANGA] Wow. So I guess
I'm an idiot, too.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:37.291
[JOE]
Maybe the biggest one of all.

00:20:38.917 --> 00:20:40.417
[JOE]
Our stupid love of skateboarding

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.333
colors our entire world.

00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:46.834
It fuels our friendships,
emotions, problems. Everything.

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.709
[JOE] Anyway, I've got
someone I need to punch

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.959
so maybe he'll wake up.

00:20:55.917 --> 00:21:00.000
[JOE] Which means...
I gotta win this race.

00:21:12.959 --> 00:21:15.750
[SKATER 8AW]
He's so fast! I can't handle it!

00:21:15.834 --> 00:21:18.625
[SKATER 8AX]
Rip 'em apart, Joe!

00:21:18.709 --> 00:21:20.667
[SHADOW]
So far, they're dead even!

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.083
Just wait till they get
to the next corner.

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:25.792
Both of them are strategizing
how to pull ahead.

00:21:25.875 --> 00:21:28.166
And they're gonna
try something crazy.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:33.458
[gasps]

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:37.125
Whoa, that's way too fast!

00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:39.458
Does that guy have a death wish?

00:21:48.959 --> 00:21:50.667
[LANGA gasps]
No way!

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.500
He made a turn on that rock!
And picked up more speed?

00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:56.875
[SKATER 8BA]
Sickening!

00:21:56.959 --> 00:21:59.375
How does he keep
his legs from breaking?

00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:01.583
That looks so impossible!

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:04.583
[CHERRY] Only a bronzed
pile of muscle can do that.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:08.083
Joe's power break
will seal his victory.

00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:11.583
[LANGA]
Amazing! How is he this good?

00:23:43.834 --> 00:23:45.125
[ADAM]
Hey, Little Miya.

00:23:45.208 --> 00:23:46.709
[MIYA] It really grosses me out
when you say "Little."

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:48.291
[ADAM] Wouldn't you like
to be tossed in the air?

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:51.250
[MIYA] I knew it. Adam is a
dirty old man. Think I'll pass.

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:53.417
[ADAM] I see. Then how
about a piggyback ride?

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.250
[MIYA] Only if I can
strangle you from up there.

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:58.000
--[ADAM] Sold!
--[MIYA] I made a huge mistake.
