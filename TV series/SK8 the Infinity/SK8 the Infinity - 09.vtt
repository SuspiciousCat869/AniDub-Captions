00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:17.851 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Check this out.
These wheel marks are from

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.520 position:50% align:center
when I was perfecting
my Crail Snatchers.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.949 position:50% align:center
So many memories.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center
Oh, man, I'm pretty sure
this is where you

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:37.245 position:50% align:center
nailed your first
Laser Flip, isn't it?

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:39.664 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Do you realize how many
times we've challenged Adam

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
to race since he's
returned to Japan?

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.961 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Yeah, and he
never gets back to us.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.921 position:50% align:center
Do you think there's
a reason for it?

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:48.423 position:50% align:center
Honestly?

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.176 position:50% align:center
I think he's terrified of
having his ass handed to him.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:54.679 position:50% align:center
Yeah? I'm not so sure that's it.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:57.849 position:50% align:center
Well what then?

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
I'll have to see for myself.

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:34.029 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS cheering]

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.572 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9A]
Joe's in the lead!

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.701 position:50% align:center
Snow's right behind him but
they're both flying out there!

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.704 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9A]
Get it, Joe! Tear him up!

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.124 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Gaining on him.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9B]
Power Break! That's my dude!

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.926 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9C]
Wicked kick!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.970 position:50% align:center
No way the newb can
keep up with that!

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.556 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Sorry, but you're gonna
have to bite this one.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.059 position:50% align:center
I'm going up against Adam next!

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.435 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Well, it's clear
he's going to do

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.729 position:50% align:center
pointless moves
despite my warnings.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.439 position:50% align:center
You think so?

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.441 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
His angle is too weak, too.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.151 position:50% align:center
If he had entered at 25 degrees,

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.487 position:50% align:center
he could've exited
point three seconds faster.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
You broke it down
to milliseconds?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.574 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Look how poor his body tilt is.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.492 position:50% align:center
I bet he's just winging it...

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.411 position:50% align:center
Can someone press 'mute'?

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:25.413 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] How can he expect
to compete against Adam

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center
when he can't even
outsmart a rookie?

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D]
Looks like Joe's about to win.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.712 position:50% align:center
Well, duh, that's
not much of a fight.

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:34.506 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9F]
He's not much of a rival!

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:36.549 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS laugh]

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.802 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Hey! Why don't you
quit crapping on

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.679 position:50% align:center
people you don't know?

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.931 position:50% align:center
The guy's jumps are
frikkin beautiful!

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:46.726 position:50% align:center
They're like falling snow.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.312 position:50% align:center
In a summer blizzard.

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.731 position:50% align:center
I've been watching
the entire time.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:52.899 position:50% align:center
His talent.

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.401 position:50% align:center
His intuition.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.694 position:50% align:center
His passion.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.446 position:50% align:center
How intensely he loves skating.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D] Hold up. You just
say you're cheerin' on Snow Boy?

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.619 position:50% align:center
The fact that so many
amazing athletes

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.706 position:50% align:center
rely on my product
is a dream come true.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:10.291 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9E]
We're gonna bet. You in?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.252 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9F]
I'm all in on Joe. Obviously.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.920 position:50% align:center
That's not why I'm here.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.380 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D]
Oh, come on, dude!

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
I thought he already
pulled away at the corner!

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:21.886 position:50% align:center
Look how much smaller
their gap is than before!

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.639 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Langa is definitely
faster on straightaways.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.516 position:50% align:center
He's not out yet.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.273 position:50% align:center
[JOE] I guess I can
pull a trick again.

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.193 position:50% align:center
Is he about to do another
Power Break right now?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
Why would he do that when

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.447 position:50% align:center
they're heading into
a straightaway?

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.785 position:50% align:center
Wait! Is that for real?

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:57.172 position:50% align:center
[LANGA] So fast! I don't
think I can catch him.

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.135 position:50% align:center
How does he manage that speed?

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:03.887 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
There's some science behind it.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
You have to minimize air
resistance to increase velocity.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.684 position:50% align:center
So that's what's up with
the hippie yoga crap!

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Turns out his
flesh-rock mountain of a body

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.522 position:50% align:center
serves a purpose sometimes.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:16.775 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D]
It doesn't even matter if it's

00:05:16.858 --> 00:05:18.234 position:50% align:center
a corner or a straightaway!

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:20.070 position:50% align:center
Joe's on this, like,
god-like level that

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
Snow-ball-Boo-boo
doesn't understand!

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
He's pulling a lot further away.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
But my heart
isn't racing at all.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.294 position:50% align:center
And this is such
an intense beef.

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.008 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
I can't even see him anymore.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
Langa's gonna lose?

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.312 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS cheering]

00:05:54.396 --> 00:05:58.233 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9E] You got this Joe!
Melt that snow snowball!

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.319 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D] Did you guys
see where Snow went?

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.154 position:50% align:center
Maybe he finally
threw in the towel.

00:06:03.238 --> 00:06:05.156 position:50% align:center
There's no way he can win now!

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.241 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9E]
Got that right, bro!

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.659 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9G]
He's here!

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.333 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
What's up with him?

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:17.335 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9H]
Get it together, Snowshoe!

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.588 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9I]
I got bets riding on you, dude!

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.925 position:50% align:center
Why am I even doing this?

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.806 position:50% align:center
[REKI] You're so much more
amazing than that!

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
Don't give up so damn easily!

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
Hey! Langa!

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.481 position:50% align:center

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Reki.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:54.205 position:50% align:center
[LANGA] Oh yeah.
I'm skateboarding right now.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
A corner.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
[heartbeat]

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:09.679 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
I know this feeling.

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9B]
Please slow down!

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.018 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9J]
You're gonna crash, bro!

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:25.153 position:50% align:center
[heart beating]

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
I remember this!

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.783 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9K] He's flying! That is
one frikkin genius shortcut!

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:31.117 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9L]
What's up with that jump?

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.494 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9C]
Joe, you're close!

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.913 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9M]
Nail it, Joe!

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.581 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Guess I won.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.170 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9N] Check it!
Snow's actually tryna catch up!

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:45.882 position:50% align:center
Pretty sneaky. Nice try!

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:47.175 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9O]
Joe's still winning!

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:48.968 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9P]
That snow kid is fast!

00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:51.971 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9Q] Is he really gonna
let him push through like that?

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.184 position:50% align:center
What, it's like he
doesn't even think.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.270 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9R]
He's heading for a dead end!

00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:02.565 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY sighs]
Aggressiveness has its merits.

00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9S] So did he just
make his own version

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
of the shortest route?
Joe's a freakin' hero!

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.369 position:50% align:center
Persistence is essential
in both skating and seduction.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
There's no way Snow's gonna
make time with that route!

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.499 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9E] Yeah, I'd say
this seals the deal!

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.920 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
C'mon, Langa.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D]
Hey, Joe! Look out!

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.427 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9T] There's a
steel beam in the way!

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:36.016 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9U]
Like a boss!

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:38.643 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9V]
That's why Joe's the G.O.A.T!

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center
Another ace up that sleeve?

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.281 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] He's heading
right toward the beams.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.033 position:50% align:center
Does he know what he's doing?

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] I seriously doubt he's
got the leg strength for this.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
[ADAM chuckles]

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.873 position:50% align:center
I think I finally
figured you out, my dear.

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
Sweet little Langa.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.837 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9W]
He dodged it!

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9X] No! Its swinging
back behind you!

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
Out of the way!

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:19.851 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
Did he just rip off
Joe's power move?

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.272 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9E]
Snow's about to pass him!

Joe's back!

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.820 position:50% align:center
That was so close!

Kojiro.

[SKATER 9AA]
Did Snow just freakkin win?

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
Talk about a comeback!

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:51.007 position:50% align:center
[ADAM giggles]
I hear it with my own ears.

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.594 position:50% align:center
The dulcet chimes of
wedding bells in our future!

00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:01.226 position:50% align:center
Langa won. For real.
He actually beat Joe.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:04.938 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Hey, Langa. That was slick.

00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:07.899 position:50% align:center
Using my own tricks
against me, huh?

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.234 position:50% align:center
What do I do now?

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:13.446 position:50% align:center
Huh? Aw man, hard luck.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.074 position:50% align:center
They're not meant to
last forever. It happens.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.075 position:50% align:center
Can I fix it?

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.160 position:50% align:center
Nah, dude, just buy one.

00:10:21.996 --> 00:10:24.416 position:50% align:center
I don't think
any other will work.

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:29.629 position:50% align:center
I get it. Reki made that.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
Then I say make him
fix it for you.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.925 position:50% align:center
Would he?

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:37.429 position:50% align:center
It'll be all right.
You two're buddies, remember?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.897 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Be quick and safe.

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:49.816 position:50% align:center
Snow boy actually beat Joe!

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:51.943 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9F] Do you think
he could beat Adam?

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:53.611 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D]
I guess so!

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Langa won
a huge race. It's awesome.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.536 position:50% align:center
I should be so excited for him.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
But for some reason I can't stop
being pissed that it wasn't me.

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:09.294 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
what am I doing here?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.049 position:50% align:center
[REKI] I'm so frustrated
with everything right now.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.763 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
I just. I can't.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:22.307 position:50% align:center
I don't wanna cheer
from the sidelines.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.018 position:50% align:center
I wanna be skating beside you!

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.104 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Congratulations, Snow!

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.939 position:50% align:center
You really do go
above and beyond

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
to exceed my expectations!

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:35.070 position:50% align:center
We're all so lucky to have you!

00:11:35.153 --> 00:11:39.199 position:50% align:center
All right, darlings, why don't
we see about the next beef?

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
Oh my!

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.576 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AB]
It's Adam!

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.828 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AC]
Adam's next!

00:11:44.788 --> 00:11:47.082 position:50% align:center
The only way I'll
agree to the race

00:11:47.165 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
is if I'm guaranteed
a good time.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.299 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AC]
Oh, that is dope!

00:11:56.383 --> 00:11:59.302 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AD] Guess we're
basically in the finals already!

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:00.720 position:50% align:center
Kaoru.

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] I do hate to
disappoint. But here we are.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.936 position:50% align:center
I'll be the one
going against Adam!

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:29.457 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Come on. Hurry,
it's gonna start any minute now.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.584 position:50% align:center
I think this was the place.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9D]
Look, there's Snow!

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.381 position:50% align:center
That beef you won earlier
was ridiculously awesome!

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.549 position:50% align:center
Yeah it was!

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:39.884 position:50% align:center
[LANGA] Hey, um.
Did you guys happen to see

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.512 position:50% align:center
a redhead around here?

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
Let's make a bet!

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.515 position:50% align:center
And when I end up winning,

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.101 position:50% align:center
I'm crushing that stupid
controller a' yours!

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.602 position:50% align:center
It's Cherry.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:56.693 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] Then there's
no need to bet, is there?

00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.195 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS cheering]

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.572 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AE]
Bring it on, Adam!

00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9F]
I believe in you, Lord Cherry!

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.951 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AE]
Our headliner has arrived!

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:09.164 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] I've been waiting
for this. Best of luck to you.

00:13:09.247 --> 00:13:10.540 position:50% align:center
This is a mistake.

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
You're not the one
I wanted to fight.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] You've been dodging a
beef against me for a long time.

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.505 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
What makes you say that?

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.506 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
You know it's true!

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:19.841 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Cherry!

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:30.393 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Back off needy gorilla,
you're smothering me.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.938 position:50% align:center
Don't worry about Adam.
I'll ruin him. You'll see.

00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:37.567 position:50% align:center
If you lose, I'll never stop
laughing at your ignorance.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Do me a favor.

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
Don't get frustrated and
work out too much, muscle brain.

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
Um. Not that isn't adorable,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
but how long does the
little comedy act go on?

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:47.952 position:50% align:center
I believe it's time
to start the race.

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.412 position:50% align:center
Please be careful.

00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:52.082 position:50% align:center
Adam's not the competitor
he used to be.

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.709 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] As if you
needed to tell me that.

00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:08.014 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
So fast!

00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.058 position:50% align:center
Looks like they're dead even.

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:11.810 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AF]
They're going the same speed!

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.561 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AG]
You got this, Cherry!

00:14:13.645 --> 00:14:14.646 position:50% align:center
It started!

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AG]
Adam versus Cherry!

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.941 position:50% align:center
Who do you think'll win?

00:14:18.024 --> 00:14:20.485 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Reki. Are you here?

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.493 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Carla, where is the next corner?

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:31.996 position:50% align:center
[CARLA] Fifteen meters ahead.
Thirty degrees, ten seconds.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.582 position:50% align:center
I don't feel like
waiting that long.

00:14:34.666 --> 00:14:35.959 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
What the?

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.210 position:50% align:center
Adam's getting ready!

00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:41.047 position:50% align:center
He's planning to do
his thing. This early?

00:14:43.049 --> 00:14:44.592 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS]
There it is!

00:14:44.676 --> 00:14:47.137 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AI] He's starting off
with a Love Hug!

00:14:48.179 --> 00:14:51.182 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9G] Get out
while you can, Lord Cherry!

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.146 position:50% align:center
He closed his eyes!

00:14:56.229 --> 00:14:57.689 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:14:57.772 --> 00:15:00.150 position:50% align:center
If he doesn't watch, he won't be
blindsided by the illusion.

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:04.112 position:50% align:center
How's he supposed to go around
that corner without looking?

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.072 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Carla, please count.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.199 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Entry angle, eleven degrees.

00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:09.117 position:50% align:center
Three.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
Two.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.202 position:50% align:center
One.

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.335 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AJ]
He dodged the Love Hug!

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.211 position:50% align:center
Is that an actual method?

00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:22.130 position:50% align:center
It's something I've
seen him do only because

00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:25.592 position:50% align:center
he is able to properly
execute it with assistance.

00:15:28.386 --> 00:15:31.389 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] You were expecting me
to dodge that one, weren't you?

00:15:31.473 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Even if I did, you wouldn't have
gone ahead with your move.

00:15:36.311 --> 00:15:37.687 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Why do you think
Adam won't respond

00:15:37.771 --> 00:15:38.980 position:50% align:center
to our beef requests?

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:40.482 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Honestly?

00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:42.734 position:50% align:center
I think he's terrified of
having his ass handed to him.

00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
Yeah? I'm not so sure that's it.

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:56.706 position:50% align:center
Is Cherry fighting dirty?

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
Why would he pull that now?

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.295 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
I want to see it for myself.

00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
What's your heart
really made of?

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.510 position:50% align:center
I'm dying to know if you
have changed since then.

00:16:08.593 --> 00:16:11.221 position:50% align:center
If you're a completely
different person.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Every day felt like a festival.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.789 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Everyone was enchanted by you.

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:45.005 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
You pulled us along.

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.635 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
And we forgot about time.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.791 position:50% align:center
Adam, you're taking
your hood off?

00:17:21.875 --> 00:17:27.047 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] Hm? Why not?
It doesn't matter if you see me.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.298 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Huh?

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
We're friends, aren't we?
I trust you guys.

00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
Adam's behind now?

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.109 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Way to pull up, Cherry!

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:53.698 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Just as I suspected. I
can still see right through you!

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.701 position:50% align:center
Carla, high-speed mode!

00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
[CARLA] Okay, Master.
High-speed mode on.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] You know, Adam.
You can't defeat me

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.587 position:50% align:center
if you're so willing to
provide mercy leads.

00:18:08.755 --> 00:18:12.008 position:50% align:center
[CARLA] Surface clear.
Entry angle, eleven degrees.

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Recommending Type, Long.

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:20.266 position:50% align:center
[CARLA] Air resistance
increased by four percent.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.145 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AK]
Badass!

00:18:24.229 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AL] That was the
perfect position to take!

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.565 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AK]
He's holding strong!

00:18:28.817 --> 00:18:30.276 position:50% align:center
[SECURITY 9A]
You sure about that?

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
Yeah, I'm good. Later.

00:18:36.408 --> 00:18:38.827 position:50% align:center
That AI Skateboard
is stupid rad!

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.037 position:50% align:center
But what's gonna happen
at the abandoned factory?

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS]
We love you Cherry, Please win!

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:46.001 position:50% align:center
Bro, do you think
Adam's gonna lose?

00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.045 position:50% align:center
[JOE] He never used to skate
as dangerously in the past.

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:50.755 position:50% align:center
This is new.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:53.258 position:50% align:center
Then, why's he doin' it?

00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Who knows?
But I do know that now,

00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.890 position:50% align:center
I don't want anything
to do with the creep.

00:19:03.727 --> 00:19:06.146 position:50% align:center
[TADASHI]
Mr. Ainosuke has changed.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:17.198 position:50% align:center
[TADASHI]
It's my fault. And so...

00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Carla, Type, Short!

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:23.621 position:50% align:center
[CARLA]
Okay, Master.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AP]
It transformed!

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:28.001 position:50% align:center
From here, it's more about
maneuverability than speed!

00:19:32.756 --> 00:19:35.008 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY]
Is he about to make a move?

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.469 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AP]
Adam's dancing!

00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:39.637 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 9AQ]
The Matador of Love has arrived!

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:43.808 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] Adam. I suggest you
don't get too cocky.

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:47.103 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] And don't you
be too optimistic.

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.409 position:50% align:center
[ALL laughing]

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS gasp]

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.550 position:50% align:center
[ADAM] As always,
your skating has no surprises.

00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:20.970 position:50% align:center
It's overcalculated,
so it can never transcend.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.516 position:50% align:center
Let me teach you something.

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
The reason I never responded
to your challenges...

00:20:28.812 --> 00:20:31.690 position:50% align:center
...was because I simply
find you boring.

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:35.860 position:50% align:center
[ADAM]
In comparison.

00:20:35.944 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
Snow!

00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
You truly are the
most wonderful gift!

00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
I wish we could pair
together all the time.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.577 position:50% align:center
I've been waiting for this.

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
The day I find my missing piece.

00:20:47.205 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
Here you are, my Eve!

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.127 position:50% align:center
Your Eve?

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:27.555 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
Are you some kind of idiot?

00:22:27.639 --> 00:22:29.224 position:50% align:center
Who sneaks out of the hospital?

00:22:29.307 --> 00:22:31.810 position:50% align:center
I'm fine, okay?
It's just a scratch.

00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:34.020 position:50% align:center
Says the mummy who just
crawled from the crypt.

00:22:34.104 --> 00:22:35.772 position:50% align:center
These are honorable wounds!

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:38.274 position:50% align:center
Not like you'd ever have
the courage to fight Adam.

00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:39.609 position:50% align:center
I would've won!

00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:42.862 position:50% align:center
Yeah right. Even though
you lost against a rookie?

00:22:42.946 --> 00:22:45.156 position:50% align:center
You know that's
no ordinary rookie.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.702 position:50% align:center
I'm willing to bet he becomes
more of a monster than Adam is.

00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:52.789 position:50% align:center
You overestimate him.
Adam's a unique beast.

00:22:54.499 --> 00:22:55.667 position:50% align:center
There's nothing else in here.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.919 position:50% align:center
Well that's because
it's BYOB now.

00:22:58.003 --> 00:22:59.796 position:50% align:center
I'm injured, you soulless pig!

00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.798 position:50% align:center
And I'm supposed to care?

00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:04.509 position:50% align:center
Is a white okay?

00:23:09.973 --> 00:23:11.516 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:17.105 position:50% align:center
[JOE] Adam is currently skating
all by himself, you know.

00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:19.899 position:50% align:center
He's very talented and
entertaining on a deck,

00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:23.403 position:50% align:center
but I can tell he's
not happy right now.

00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:27.615 position:50% align:center
That's why his matches end
with violence and pettiness.

00:23:27.699 --> 00:23:30.785 position:50% align:center
At least we got this.
We're not alone.

00:23:32.412 --> 00:23:35.832 position:50% align:center
Know what I mean? Kaoru?

00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:44.466 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] Hell yeah!
The Clown Punk advances

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:46.301 position:50% align:center
to main character the next act.

00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:47.635 position:50% align:center
[MIYA]
Try to keep up, old man,

00:23:47.719 --> 00:23:49.471 position:50% align:center
they changed it to
feature me instead.

00:23:49.554 --> 00:23:51.765 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW] Twenty-five minutes
about some bratty kid?

00:23:51.848 --> 00:23:54.726 position:50% align:center
[MIYA] It'll be great. "Let's do
our best together, Carla."

00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:56.978 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
"Okay, Master."
