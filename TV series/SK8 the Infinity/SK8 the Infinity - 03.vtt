You come up with the
weirdest names for stuff.

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.193 position:50% align:center
Also, you left out
the 'R' for Rolling.

I found something
you'll wanna see!

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.284 position:50% align:center
It's Chinen at some competition.

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:24.666 position:50% align:center
Amazing. How is he
not shaking at all?

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.626 position:50% align:center
I've seen several
vids like this.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.379 position:50% align:center
He definitely belongs
on a national team.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:31.339 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he's talented.

Huh? The duct-tape guy?

00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.027 position:50% align:center

If he's up against Miya,

00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:17.821 position:50% align:center

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center

[SKATER 3H] Is that
the snowboarding dude?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.868 position:50% align:center
At least he didn't
bring duct tape!

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.787 position:50% align:center
But he didn't bring
a board either!

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.163 position:50% align:center
He forgot it at home?

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:28.873 position:50% align:center
Maybe his dog ate it.

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center

so disgusted, I'd laugh.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
Is this some sick joke?

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.466 position:50% align:center
My board's still being

losing tonight?

And what will I win?

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:12.625 position:50% align:center
I've thought a lot about it.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.502 position:50% align:center
If I end up slaughtering you,

00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.755 position:50% align:center
then you're gonna
become my lap dog!

Wait, what? Why are you
pointing that thing at me?

I've always wanted a puppy,

shown he can fetch. [chuckles]

crashing down and I lose this,

sideways if he wants.

What do you mean?

The reason we started
skating was to have fun.

[MIYA]
Fun? Sure, I guess so.

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:33.965 position:50% align:center
I think I had
a lot of fun, in fact.

00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.426 position:50% align:center
At least in the beginning.

For a while.

you're all that

Brilliant, actually!

But you'll be even better

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.306 position:50% align:center
if you fix how you
shift your body weight.

00:21:46.389 --> 00:21:49.184 position:50% align:center
For instance,
when you do an ollie.
