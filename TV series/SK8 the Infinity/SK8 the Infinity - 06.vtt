00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.500
Why're you doing this?

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:23.125
[SHADOW, REKI, MIYA]
Let's eat!

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:34.041
I-I think I love your guts!

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:36.542
Mister Manager, you're the best!

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.333
Okay, I get it!
I'm not the manager!

00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:40.875
Get off me, dude!

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:43.125
I don't get the appeal
of drinking alcohol.

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:44.792
That's because you're
"better than everyone."

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.542
Poor you. Ah!

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:50.750
[CARLA] Underage drinking
is strictly prohibited.

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:52.875
[REKI] My bad. I thought
that was water.

00:10:54.041 --> 00:10:56.041
[LANGA]
Reki. Here it is.

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:58.917
[REKI]
Oh yeah. The shaft's a bit off.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.291
Bet you're having a hard time
keeping your balance.

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:02.917
Yeah, how'd you know that?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.750
Because that's
what I do, my friend.

00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:07.667
Wow, you're amazing, Reki.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.959
[REKI]
I'm nothing compared to you.

00:11:10.041 --> 00:11:12.583
Nah, I just see it
a lot at the shop.

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:16.000
[REKI]
Most of the damage is here.

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:18.750
Which means he's definitely
got the center down.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.917
[REKI]
He really has gotten better.

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.500
--That it?
--Yeah, for now. Gah.

00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:29.959
[MIYA] By the way, I'm pretty
sure today is the day.

00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:30.792
[CHERRY]
The day?

00:11:30.875 --> 00:11:33.792
Yeah, when it shows up.

00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:36.291
[LANGA] Huh? What shows up?
Whaddaya mean--

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:38.041
That's ridiculous!

00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.542
I just overheard
the hostess say it.

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:44.125
She told someone not to
forget what day it was

00:11:44.208 --> 00:11:45.792
and asked them to
please not walk around

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:48.291
outside after sunset.

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.291
[REKI] Well, thank goodness
it isn't my

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:52.667
'walk around aimlessly'
night tonight.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.625
Reki?

00:11:53.709 --> 00:11:55.333
[REKI]
I need to grab a drink.

00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:05.792
Injury or not,
this is no time to rest.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.542
Aw man, you've got
the worst timing ever.

00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:17.458
What's goin' on?

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.166
That trick you did
today was awesome.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.166
Can you teach me how to do it?

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:26.834
[JOE]
It's not really a trick,

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:28.917
you gotta stop rotating with
your hand all the time.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.083
Try pushing your foot forward
to turn instead.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.166
My foot?

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.750
Huh. That seems like it would
be pretty difficult to do

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:41.333
while going downhill
at top speed.

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:43.333
Just takes guts and momentum,

00:12:43.417 --> 00:12:45.583
y'know like everything
else in skateboarding.

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.458
Yeah, I guess so.

00:12:47.542 --> 00:12:49.709
Look, if you're not prepared
to break a bone or two,

00:12:49.792 --> 00:12:52.291
you shouldn't be
skating Crazy Rock.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.875
You in? Or you wanna go home?

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.750
[REKI]
Nah, I'm in.

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:01.500
I do wanna work on
getting better first.

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.542
I don't wanna fall behind.

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:09.875
Then you've got the drive.

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.417
[JOE]
That's what's important.

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:33.750
[REKI] What? So there's
no hot spring here anywhere?

00:13:33.834 --> 00:13:36.417
You should've double
checked before we left.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.417
[CHERRY]
The hostess gave me this map.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.709
It's in the mountains
five kilometers from here.

00:13:40.792 --> 00:13:43.125
And it's listed as
a secluded hot spring.

00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:44.709
Five kilometers, huh?

00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:47.417
Sounds like the perfect
distance to have a beef.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.750
Oh. Yeah.

00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:52.125
[SHADOW] Did someone say beef?
I'm in! Let's go!

00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:53.875
Wow, full hair and makeup.

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:56.125
I thought you were
sleeping off your hangover.

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:58.667
Only the weak me is
derailed by booze.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.417
Now the mask is in control!

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.834
[LANGA]
What's this mark mean?

00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:05.333
[JOE]
It looks like a face.

00:14:05.417 --> 00:14:06.959
Monkey meeting spot?

00:14:07.041 --> 00:14:08.291
Guys!

00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:09.458
Maybe it's where the thing is

00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:11.375
that the hostess
was talking about!

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:14.250
They wouldn't draw something
like that on a map! Come on!

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:16.000
Seems like you're afraid of it.

00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:17.834
Oh please. You think
I'm afraid of

00:14:17.917 --> 00:14:20.959
some grade school
ghost stories? I'm not.

00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:24.083
Have any of you been hearing
that strange sound, too?

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.583
Stop, you're freaking me out!

00:14:25.667 --> 00:14:26.792
[clattering]

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:32.083
That was one. There's two.

00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:33.834
There's three.

00:14:33.917 --> 00:14:35.834
[REKI]
Okay, you're not funny!

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:40.166
[JOE] First one to arrive
at the hot spring wins,

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.250
plain and simple.

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:43.166
You can choose
whichever path you want.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.041
Then a lot of this depends on
our ability to read maps.

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:47.959
Dungeons are my forte!

00:14:48.041 --> 00:14:50.667
Hey! Do you really
want to do this tonight?

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.875
It's already dark and maps are
easier to read in the daytime!

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.583

Okay, Master.

elevation changes!

--[LANGA] I'm so grossed out!

00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:07.917
[REKI, LANGA] Of course
there's gotta be a hill!

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.583
Over it!

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:13.750
[BOTH]
I think we lived.

00:19:13.834 --> 00:19:16.125
Oh, man, what in
the world was that?

00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:18.917
Like I'd know!
I wanna get out of here.

00:19:22.083 --> 00:19:24.333
How does that thing
keep finding us?

00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:26.917
[LANGA] What the?
It's riding on Shadow's board!

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.750
Is it even allowed to do that?

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.166
Dammit!

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:33.917
Wow.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.458
Are you judging its skills?

00:19:36.542 --> 00:19:38.417
[LANGA]
Watch that inner side. Reki!

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.875
I know!

00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:44.041
[REKI]
What is that thing?

00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:47.959
Shut up.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.041
Wow, he's good!

00:19:49.125 --> 00:19:50.959
It's trying to kill us!

00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:53.208
What? Stop!

00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:54.917
Get away from me!

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.458
[REKI]
It's over.

00:20:05.959 --> 00:20:07.417
It's gonna be okay.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.875
[REKI]
You totally just saved my life!

00:20:15.709 --> 00:20:22.083
[BOTH screaming]

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.667
[SPIRITS laughing]

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:37.583
[JOE]
Man, those guys are stupid late.

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:39.750
I wonder if they came across
a curse or something.

00:20:39.834 --> 00:20:42.125
[CHERRY] It's absurd.
If I remember correctly,

00:20:42.208 --> 00:20:44.500
you were always quite
fond of haunted houses.

00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:47.417
I'm into hot, scared chicks
grabbing on me.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.333
You're a disgusting pig.

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:51.291
[footsteps]

00:20:51.375 --> 00:20:52.333
[BOTH]
Hm?

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:54.792
[JOE]
Yo! Bout time you showed up!

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.792
That smell is offensive.

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:58.500
So true.

00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:02.375
[SPIRITS]
Cherry... Joe...

00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:06.125
[BOTH scream]

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.667
Bleh. I can still smell it.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.750
I never realized
you were so sensitive.

00:21:18.834 --> 00:21:20.625
I work in a flower shop.

00:21:20.709 --> 00:21:22.625
They're not too cool
when you smell bad.

00:21:22.709 --> 00:21:24.625
Restaurants are the same way.

00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:26.959
That guy sure was
fast, wasn't he?

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:28.792
Was it a human?

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:30.417
[JOE]
Had to be a ghost.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.583
There's no way!

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.583
Then tell us what it was!

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:38.709
[ALL]
I have no idea what it could be.

00:21:59.166 --> 00:22:03.000
When you have an hors d'ovre,
the main dish becomes the star.

00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:07.500
[ADAM]
I've made up my mind, Tadashi.

00:22:07.583 --> 00:22:12.875
We'll hold a competition.
A tournament, if you will.

00:23:43.792 --> 00:23:45.417
[MIYA] That hot spring
was so much fun, Cherry!

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.375
--[CHERRY] 80,031.
--[MIYA] What's that?

00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:48.625
[CHERRY] It's your bill
from the restaurant.

00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:50.792
[MIYA]
Huh? What? I'm just a kid!

00:23:50.875 --> 00:23:52.375
Let the adults take care of it!

00:23:52.458 --> 00:23:54.291
[CHERRY] They each have their
own individual bills as well!

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:56.208
[MIYA] Mommy, will you
please buy me a game?

00:23:56.291 --> 00:23:58.000
[CHERRY]
I am not your momma, boy!
