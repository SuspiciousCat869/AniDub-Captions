[REKI] When I was a kid,
I loved watching

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:21.730 position:50% align:center
all kinds of
superhero shows on TV.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
They were mostly fun
and pretty tame,

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.818 position:50% align:center
but once the hero asked,

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.404 position:50% align:center
"Do you know what
true happiness is?"

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.490 position:50% align:center
[REKI] He said he hated
that his life might end

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.743 position:50% align:center
before he knew the answer
to that question.

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:37.662 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
And that basically we were lost

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.998 position:50% align:center
because no one really
knows the truth.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.583 position:50% align:center
I thought, "Well,
that's messed up.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.336 position:50% align:center

before they're even in school?"

Hooking up with hot girls?

Getting into the best schools?

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.891 position:50% align:center

Climbing up social ladders?

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:03.229 position:50% align:center
[REKI] I'm sure that's what a
bunch of people want in life.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.276 position:50% align:center

what gets me goin'.

[SKATER 1S] Are you
seeing this? Guys, look!

00:18:01.373 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 1G]
The dude's picking up speed.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.793 position:50% align:center
[REKI gasps]

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:08.963 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:13.635 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna ride ahead.
Wanna come?

00:18:13.718 --> 00:18:15.053 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
What's the deal?

00:18:15.136 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:19.891 position:50% align:center
Are they really
that bored already?

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:21.226 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 1T]
Is that him?

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:22.852 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 1P] Was he just
pretending to be terrible?

00:18:22.936 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:25.313 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 1Q]
Looks like he's catching up!

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
He's what?

00:18:28.233 --> 00:18:30.485 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
I don't like surprises, kid.

00:18:32.904 --> 00:18:35.240 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW groans]
I coasted too long.

00:18:35.323 --> 00:18:36.741 position:50% align:center
They better not be
thinking I'm gonna

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:39.035 position:50% align:center
let that punk catch up to me!

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:49.796 position:50% align:center
What?!

00:18:54.342 --> 00:18:55.176 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Idiot!

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.761 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, speed up.

00:18:56.845 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
Good luck making it around
that corner without crashing!

00:19:03.935 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS gasp]

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
What the hell was that?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.690 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:11.234 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
[LANGA] Oh right.
I forgot these have wheels.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.489 position:50% align:center
[CHERRY] I was observing
the way your friend skates

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:17.699 position:50% align:center
and I noticed something about

00:19:17.782 --> 00:19:19.451 position:50% align:center
how he distributes his
weight on the board.

00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
His posture is balanced,

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:23.121 position:50% align:center
and the way he braces
his feet is practiced.

00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
It made me wonder if he might be
a high-level snowboarder.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.461 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What?

00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:35.550 position:50% align:center
[ADAM singing]

00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
[ADAM singing]

00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:53.193 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:19:53.276 --> 00:19:55.987 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
It all feels so familiar.

00:19:56.071 --> 00:19:57.614 position:50% align:center
I've got this.

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
You gotta be joking.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.639 position:50% align:center
What kinda crap
is he tryna pull?

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:27.185 position:50% align:center
I didn't think he was
gonna be that good.

00:20:27.268 --> 00:20:30.188 position:50% align:center
Looks like he might
actually win against Shadow.

00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.816 position:50% align:center
[JOE]
I don't know about that.

00:20:32.899 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
He may be able to
maintain his speed,

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:38.113 position:50% align:center
but it takes more
than that to win "S."

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll throw him a bone
and not write him off just yet.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
We're here! The final stage!

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:47.455 position:50% align:center
Time to step up
and settle the score!

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
[gasps] This is different.

00:20:53.378 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Welcome to S!

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.173 position:50% align:center
Weren't expecting something
like this, were ya, kiddo?

00:20:57.257 --> 00:20:59.926 position:50% align:center
Good news! Goal's right
in front of your eyes!

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.804 position:50% align:center
Too bad there's no way out now!

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.404 position:50% align:center
[SKATER 1R]
He's gonna fall!

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.366 position:50% align:center
[SKATERS scream]

00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:27.704 position:50% align:center
[SHADOW]
Huh? Gimme a break!

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:30.540 position:50% align:center
He may know some tricks, but
there's only one Lord Shadow!

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:33.793 position:50% align:center
Only one clown punk
of the "S" community!

00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.920 position:50% align:center
Let me prove it to you.

00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
Langa, look out!

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Call me crazy,
but I know what I saw.

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:06.034 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
Snowflakes began to fall

00:22:06.117 --> 00:22:08.370 position:50% align:center
right here in Okinawa.

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:44.591 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
Hey, Langa, What's Canada like?

00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:45.967 position:50% align:center
--[LANGA] Vast.
--[REKI] What do you eat there?

00:23:46.051 --> 00:23:47.052 position:50% align:center
--[LANGA] Poutine.
--[REKI] Speak Canadian!

00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:48.553 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
"Sorry."

00:23:48.636 --> 00:23:50.055 position:50% align:center
[REKI] Sounds like we have more
in common than I expected.

00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:52.390 position:50% align:center
Your turn to ask me
questions about life here!

00:23:52.474 --> 00:23:53.933 position:50% align:center
[LANGA]
Okay.

00:23:54.017 --> 00:23:55.518 position:50% align:center
Why is it that every time you
say I can ask you questions,

00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:57.645 position:50% align:center
you just give me a sour
look and don't answer?

00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:59.564 position:50% align:center
[REKI]
I don't do that, come on.

00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:01.983 position:50% align:center
You ask about feelings
a lot and it's weird.

00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:03.651 position:50% align:center
But whenever you wanna
know what's in my bento,

00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:04.861 position:50% align:center
I always tell you the truth!
