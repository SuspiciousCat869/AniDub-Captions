thanks for what you did.

491
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:53,937
You're the one all right.

492
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,521
What does that mean?

493
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:58,201
Why that you're a great
Kushinada of course!

494
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:00,403
Oh, that.

495
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,570
Hm, what's wrong?

496
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,030
(laughs)

497
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:04,197
Nothing, really.

498
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:05,656
(giggling) (romantic music)

499
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,331
No, freaking way!

500
00:21:13,002 --> 00:21:14,282
She made me look
like an amateur!

501
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:18,088
Arg, yah!

502
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,501
Just you wait sacrifice girl!

503
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:22,066
The next time we meet,
I'll be the victor!

504
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,515
The rank of top idol and
number one Aragami buster

505
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,141
will belong to me!

506
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,061
I won't lose!

507
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:31,747
Because of all the
damage to the studio,

508
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:33,869
this year's idol contest
has been canceled!

509
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:36,579
And I was so sure that
Momiji would have won!

510
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:38,530
(crying)

511
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:39,739
(sad comical music)

512
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:46,164
(light music)

513
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:48,052
Ah, I see, I don't know
why I love Kusanagi,

514
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:51,261
but I wonder what part
of Kusanagi do I like?

515
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:54,954
I mean he's perverted, indecent,

516
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,110
and he says mean things
to me all the time

517
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:59,255
and he won't take me out to
have fun either and, what?

518
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:03,141
Tomorrow?

519
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:04,793
I don't have any
plans for tomorrow.

520
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,144
Are you asking me?

521
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:09,091
It's the next
episode of Blue Seed,

522
00:22:10,068 --> 00:22:11,229
number nine, are you serious?

523
00:22:12,654 --> 00:22:13,654
Is this a dream?

524
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:15,405
An exciting date!

525
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:17,557
A girl's heart is
pretty complicated.

526
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:21,161
(relaxed music)

527
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:31,092
(foreign language)
