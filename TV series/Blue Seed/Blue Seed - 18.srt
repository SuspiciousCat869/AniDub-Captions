Nazuchi woke up along with

Nazuchi, but she failed.

For years, Nazuchi and
I have slept as one,

327
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,159
but now that the god
Susano-Oh has awoken,

328
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:55,719
I can no longer control Nazuchi.

329
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,012
This is why I have
called to you.

330
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:01,444
Sakura, use the talisman

331
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:03,597
to destroy me before
I lose control.

332
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:05,741
Hurry, please.

333
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:07,844
You must destroy me
to destroy Nazuchi.

334
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Mommy.

335
00:17:12,623 --> 00:17:13,623
No way!

336
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:14,874
It can't be!

337
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,334

Do it now Sakura, hurry up!

341
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:26,743
I can't control
Nazuchi much longer!

342
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,346
Please hurry!

343
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:32,518
Sakura.

344
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,205
What are you waiting
for, faith healer?

345

You must seal me into
the final darkness!

Oh no, I can't.

359
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,544
I have lived for so long
with no other thought

360
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:34,996
but to avenge my mother.

361

- [Momiji] Sakura.

362
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:37,699
I will not give up my revenge.

363
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:41,781
Even though other
people hated me,

364
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,298
or said I was a freak,

365
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:46,330
I trained myself
in faith healing

366
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
so I could heal Nazuchi.

367
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,510
That was my life's goal!

368
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:51,958
But it wasn't supposed to
happen like this, it's not fair!

369

I didn't come here just
to kill you, Mommy!

370
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:57,185
It isn't fair!

371

I'm sorry, I can't do it!

372

(both gasping)

374

If you keep crying like that,

375
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,272
I'll give you a
thump on the head.

376
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,289
Mommy.

377
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,250
No, ah, oh!

378
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:23,836

- [Kusanagi] Listen,
faith healer.

381

If you can't do it,
stand aside and I will.

382
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,179
Don't even think about it!

383
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:36,152
Then do it, or I'll
take care of it myself!

384
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:38,552
No, this is my responsibility.

385
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I'll handle this!

386

(speaks foreign language)

388
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:52,861
Sakura, I'm sorry your life
was full of so much pain.

Thank you for setting me free.

392

Rest in peace, Mommy.

I stayed up all night.

Good morning!
Sakura, why are you here?

402
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,366
I decided hanging
around you would help me

403
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,160
find Susano-Oh and
kill that little brat.

404
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,049
If Susano-Oh hadn't
awoken Nazuchi,

405

Mommy could have slept in peace.

I have to avenge her, so I
can't quit being a faith healer

Sakura is number one!

myself a legend!
