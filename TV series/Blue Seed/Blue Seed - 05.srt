That's an odd looking
rag you're using.

It's a diaper.

80
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,798
This brand uses a
new hybrid polymer

81
00:04:42,902 --> 00:04:44,002
that actually absorbs water,

82
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:45,466

a solid plastic.

Well, I um...

89

Did she get it when
we fought Orochi?

90

I'm not sure.

91
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,802
Matsudera, do you think
there's a possibility

92
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,490
the seed could be used by the
aragami to manipulate Momiji?

93
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,132
I don't believe so,

94
00:05:12,843 --> 00:05:13,843
as near as we can tell,

95
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:15,771
the seeds are only able
to control creatures

of fairly low
intelligence levels.

97
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:20,999
And how do the
aragami control them?

98
00:05:22,226 --> 00:05:23,059
The seeds seem to duplicate

99
00:05:23,143 --> 00:05:25,262
and override the control
functions of the hosts brain.

100
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:28,542
But I really need
some more hard data.

Excuse me, is this cup
what I think it is?

Aragami.

Hmm, what are they?

Oh yeah, she was just

Kusanagi!

327
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,446
Hello, Momiji here, an aragami
just appeared in Tokyo bay.

328
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,970
If the maritime safety
agency tries to move in,

329
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,711
they'll only get in the way.

330
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Please, urge them not
to approach the aragami.

331
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:06,512
Right. I understand.

332
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:08,802
Sir, from what Momiji says,

333
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:11,195
the creature seems to
be a giant jellyfish.

334
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:12,599
A jellyfish?

335
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:14,615
This one's going to
be a little difficult.

336
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:17,145
Hybrid polymers.

337
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,643
Matsudera, I thought you
were supposed to be in bed.

338
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:21,942
The body of a jellyfish

339
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:23,549
is composed almost
entirely of water.

340
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,962
If we inject it with
the hybrid polymers

341
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:27,572
used in that diaper...

342
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,490
Then the water will congeal,

343
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,292
and the jellyfish's
body will become solid.

344
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:31,699
Right.

345
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,908
Call a diaper company.

346
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,885
Please, sir, I'd like
to handle this one.
