strange, giant plants have
suddenly begun to grow.

14

The Aragami, mankind's
ancient enemies,

15

have awoken the
sleeping God, Susano-Oh,

16
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,699
from his millennia long
slumber, and we now know

17
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,195
that they intend to do
something horrible to Japan.

18

But what?

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,784
Nobody knows.

20
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,930
And the danger continues to grow

21
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,514
as more and more of
the root like plants

22

keep emerging from the ground.

23
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,473
The key to solving the
mystery seems to be

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,351
the Amano Iwato, the
cave of the Sun God,

25

which we think is located in
my old home town of Izumo.

But we can't find it anywhere.

Together with Mr.
Kunikida and Ms. Takeuchi,

28

I've returned to Izumo
to search for the Iwato.

29
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,035
And there's someone
else here, as well.

30
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,270
For some time now, I've
been sensing the presence

31
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,298
of Kusanagi in the
back of my mind.

32
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,231
It's so strange.

33
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,672
Even though we're
really miles apart,

34
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,021
sometimes it's as if he was
standing right next to me.

35
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,757
Kusanagi thinks that
we share this link

36
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,105
because of our mitamas, which
came from the same Aragami.

37
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,442
But maybe it's something more.

38
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,454
If we get through this alive,

39
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,661
once we've finally beaten
Susana-Oh and the Aragami,

40
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,407
maybe we'll have time to get
to know each other better.

41
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,918
To do the sort of things
normal people do together.

42
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,498
I think I'd really like that.

this technological
travesty that we live in,

modern Japan, is an
assault upon my senses,

I raised you as if
you were my own child!

Please, Katy, don't make

You never answered any

Japan is crying.

369
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,263
It is my duty to create
a Japan that deserves

the protection of a Kushinada.

371
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,732
But, to do that I must
regress all of the

more advanced life forms
to the most basic level.

373

Every human must
be transformed into

something I can control.

375

You're insane!

376
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,636
All human lives must therefore

377
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,132
be reduced to the
level of plants!

378

Katy!

What do you mean when you
say that you'll reduce

everyone to the level of plants?

I'm not even if what you
say is even possible.

382
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,791
But how could you think
of doing such a thing?

383
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,668
You'd turn Mom and Grandma

Kusanagi used to
