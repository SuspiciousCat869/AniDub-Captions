from the local fire department,

I've plotted the areas damaged

Assuming that the same
Aragami has been the cause

of both incidents, I've
drawn this conclusion.

272
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:46,633
Ceder trees within a
two kilometer radius

273

of the sides have come into
an abnormally fecund bloom.

274
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:53,349
The Nara forests are
largely comprised of ceders.

275
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:56,392
If this continues, the
entire surrounding area

276
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:58,394
will become uninhabitable.

Please, you have to do

New weapon?

282
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,116
I asked to have a prototype made

283

of a plasma
photosynthesis laser.

284
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:15,662
Konsei Biochemical
was in the process

286
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,415
Uh, Matsu, do you think
you could put that

287
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:20,335
in layman's terms?

288
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:23,838
In other words,
it's an artificial
photosynthesis machine.

289
00:14:23,838 --> 00:14:27,507
Mm, do you know
any smaller words?

290

Yaegashi, why don't
you run the demo?

Yaegashi!

00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:33,389
Uh, yes.

293
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:35,391
By shooting both positive
and negative electroids

294
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:39,591
into the Aragami, we could cause
an electric photosynthesis.

295
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,314
However, the detonator has to be

296
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,900
within one kilometer
from the electrodes.

297
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,441
We'll have to act very quickly

298
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:46,443
and be very precise.

299
