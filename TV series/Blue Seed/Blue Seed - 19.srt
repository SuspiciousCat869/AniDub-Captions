the city of Kigori has
been completely cut off

Recuse teams have already
made several efforts

to break into the city, but
all efforts have failed.

whatever may be occurring

Mamoru, you can't escape

335
00:17:58,727 --> 00:18:00,728
from here because you don't
want to escape from me.

336
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:03,105
What?

337
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,104
Haven't you figured it out?

338
00:18:07,026 --> 00:18:08,266
I'm your heart and your dreams.

339
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm your warmth and passion.

340
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,483
I'm the object of your desires.

341
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Kusanagi.

342

Kusanagi!

343
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:22,625
Kusanagi!

(wind whistling)

345

Susano-o's energy level

00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,052
is almost saturated.

347
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:35,596
As I knew it would be.

348
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,556
Each of these roots was
once a human from this area.

349
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,379
No longer must they
suffer the pain

350
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:43,374
of living in a cold
and polluted world.

351
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,691
No longer will they know
want, fear, or loneliness.

352
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:49,995
Soon they will be blessed
with flowing rivers

353
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,757
of clean, limitless energy.

354
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,902
And then the service of this
planet will belong to us.

355
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,840
The Aragami will rule,
once mankind falls.

356
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,828
Now we will be able, at
last, to execute the ritual.

357

The Ritual of Tamafori.

Well, shall we go.

360
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:17,978
Kushinada, don't worry
yourself about Kusanagi.

361
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,430
You know that, that imperfect
soul will never be able

to escape from that
world of phantoms.

None of us shall
ever see him again.

It's true.

You were created,
just to protect me.

367

That's all you ever wanted.

368
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,202
To serve the Kushinada.

369
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:42,989
Can't we go back to that time?

370
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,605
A time when you were
always beside me

371
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,584
and we were never apart.

372

Kaede?

Why can't we go back
to the way things were?

374
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,579
Why can't you
protect me forever?

375
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:56,271
Because, I'm still
protecting you now Kaede.
