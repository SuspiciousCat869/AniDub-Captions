We've only got three more days,

102
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:23,472

103

We've only got three more days,

104

have we located
the Kushinada yet?

105
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,805
I've had all of the
police department

106
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,437
set up roadblocks and barricades
surrounding the city, but.

107
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
But?

108
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,883
I'm sure that Kunikida
has anticipated that.

109
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,864
It makes one wonder what he's
thinking about, doesn't it?

110
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:42,167
I never would have
thought he was the

111
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,849
sort of man who'd take
such drastic actions

112
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,582
based solely on his emotions.

113
00:06:46,215 --> 00:06:47,173
No, but he's not the kind of man

114
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,455
who ignores his
feelings, either.

115
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,636
That's true.
So,

116
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,239
what's the evacuation status?

117
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:54,063
The exit as from the
city are almost complete.

118
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,129
However, we've never coordinated
an evacuation this large,

119
00:06:58,603 --> 00:06:59,804
not even during World War Two.

120
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:01,163
Therefore, we have
to make sure that

121
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,507
people have enough
food and water,

122
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:04,251
that they receive the
proper information,

123
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,315
otherwise there's no way
we can prevent total chaos.

124
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,930
We can't make people understand
the gravity of the situation

125
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:12,005
with half truths about
mutated vegetation.

126
00:07:14,577 --> 00:07:15,328
There are also rumors spreading

127
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:17,657
that Japan will be completely
destroyed in three days.

128
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,911
Who's starting these rumors?

129
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,042
I believe that they began in the

130
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,607
group of amateur
astronomers working

131
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,649
in a local observatory
here in Japan.

132
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:26,857
They predicted it
after they found

133
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,081
out about the eclipse and the
abnormal path of the moon.

134
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:31,401
Rumors like that could
be very dangerous,

135
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,194
so we must make an
official announcement.

136
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:37,013
Kunikida, where are you,
and what are you doing now?

137
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,519

Is there any possibility that
the U.S. might take action?

148
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:07,605
No, the White House

the joint security treaty,

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,080
the U.S. can only intervene if
your government requests it.

And I doubt our government
will tell the U.S. the truth.

The external layer of this

159
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,571
specimen has become
strengthened.

160
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:57,195
We can't destroy the
cells hidden inside.

161
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,687
We duplicated Momiji's
Kushinada pulse exactly,

162
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,308
but it's still not effective.

163
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,390
I wonder if we need more
power than three generators.

164
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,208
Or maybe the pulse
itself isn't enough.

165
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,347
There are so many possibilities.

166
00:09:09,442 --> 00:09:11,482
Well we can always strangle
the real sacrifice girl.

167
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,374
It would be a lot more
convenient, you know.

168
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:17,492
Straighten out.

169
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:18,979
Ms. Matsudaira, I
think we need to

170
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:20,819
investigate my body some more.

171
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:23,857
That's some outfit.
Ms. Matsudaira,

172
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,171
you can do anything you
want, I won't complain.

173
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,461
That's the spirit Momiji.

174
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,314
Ever since we learned that
Kusanagi's still alive,

175
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,339
there's been a different
kind of fire in your eyes.

177

Yeah, I've never
felt so much like

doing my best in my entire life.

179

Momiji.
Life is wonderful.

180
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:45,056
Have you used your matama
to tell him you're in love?

181
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,730
But I really wanna see him
and talk with him again.

182
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,361
But first, I've gotta do
the things I've gotta do,

183
00:09:53,695 --> 00:09:55,135
or I won't be able
to face him again.

Just what is the
Kushinada doing?

209
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,372
The Kushinada is the wife
of our Lord, Susano Oh,

210
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,624
the king of the Aragami.

Tell me, just what in the
hell could she be thinking?

You're asking me?

I don't have the slightest idea.

She's still planning on
destroying Japan, isn't she?

Yes, that's right.

I thought that the
destruction of mankind

217
00:11:42,387 --> 00:11:44,067
would establish the
kingdom of the Aragami,

218

This can't be.

The Aragami should
be under my control.

which has been passed to
us from ancient times.

- [Momiji] Matsuri?

259

- [Kaede] Yes, when
I first learned of

260
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,604
the rite of Matsuri, I
knew what my fate would be.

(beeping)

262

The mission of the Kushinada
is to protect Japan,

263
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,306
to create a Japan filled with
living growths and foliage.

264
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:48,274
You told us before that Japan

265
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,532
was crying, didn't you, Kaede?

266

Do you believe that
we're killing the plants?

267

Is that why you're
saying you're gonna

268
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,419
create a life of vegetation
and nothing else?

269

Is that why you're
gonna kill everyone?

270
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,904
I will kill no one, we shall
simply start all over again.

271
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,504
This is how it all began when

272
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,229
the very first rite
of Matsuri was held.

273
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,632
The first rite of Matsuri?

274
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:09,362
In those days, Japan
was a much smaller

275
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,275
and more barren country
than it is today.

276
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:14,906
At that time, mankind's
greatest concerns

277
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,001
were simply getting
enough to eat,

278
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,820
thus the faith they held
as the practitioners

279
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,422
of the most ancient
of all sciences

280
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,527
came together and performed
the rite of Matsuri.

281
00:15:25,276 --> 00:15:26,716
In order to guarantee
a good harvest,

282
00:15:26,777 --> 00:15:29,097
a new breed of psychically
enhanced vegetation was created.

283
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:32,396
Psychically enhanced vegetation?

284
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:34,773
Yes, the rite of
Matsuri unlocked

285
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:36,612
a new source of psychic power,

286
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,983
and used these
plants as a strike

287
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:40,529
to control the forces of nature.

288
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,820
I don't understand,
what does this

289
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:44,929
have to do with Susano
Oh, or the Kushinadas?

290
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,241
For the rite of
Matsuri to succeed,

291
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,314
it requires focus, a
god, and human people

292
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,735
who are of willing,
impressionable faith.

293
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,990
This god becomes
the reservoir for

294
00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:56,294
all those seeking psychic power.

295
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:58,329
- [Momiji] That's
Susano Oh, isn't it?

296
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,085
- [Kaede] Yes, in
order to transform

297
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,968
all of the unborn kingdom,
including mankind into plants,

298
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,251
in order to spread
the seeds which have

299
00:16:07,652 --> 00:16:09,892
the power to initiate the
transformation mankind created,

300
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:13,949
Lord Susano Oh.
Liar!

301
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,514
Are you saying that
our god, Susano Oh

302
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:18,865
was created by human beings?

303
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:21,337
It is the truth, the
world's greatest psychics,

304
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,130
those who carry them, the
Kushinada created him.

305
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:26,824
But that's-
You lie, it cannot be!

306
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,786
Don't be a fool,
why do you think

307
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,595
Aragami lose their power
when a Kushinada dies?

308
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,786
All things born
from Lord Susano Oh

309
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:36,338
must return to Lord Susano Oh.

310
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:38,489
Now, we shall perform
the rite of Matsuri

311
00:16:39,475 --> 00:16:40,716
to create a new Japan.
Betrayer!

312
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:42,938
First Kusanagi and now this?
What about Kusanagi?

00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:48,724
Kushinada really is our source,

315
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,111
then it may be illogical that

316
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,438
the Aragami would disappear
with the Kushinada's death,

317
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,395
but why does our Lord Susano
Oh require the likes of you?

318
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,703
To perform the rite of
Matsuri requires a maiden.

319
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:02,315
A maiden?
You mean that the tithing

320
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,808
of the rite of
Matsuri is actually

321
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:05,193
under the control
of the Kushinada?

322
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:08,152
Give up your life
to Lord Susano Oh,

323
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:10,795
and you will sleep with the
other Aragami, Murakumo.

324
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,158
In the future,
Japan will be reborn

325
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:16,298
as a beautiful garden of
trees and vines and flowers.

326
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:20,349
But we were just tools, a means

327
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,119
of distributing your
seeds, weren't we?

328
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,408
More than that, you
served our Lord well.

329
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:27,521
Shut up, if my kingdom of
the Aragami can never be,

330
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:30,357
then I shall slay this one
now and be done with it.

331
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:34,820
Die!

Kusanagi, I knew
you weren't dead.

334
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,873
Momiji, are you all right?

335
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,290
Yes, I'm fine, are you okay?

(ringing)

337
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,117
Why Kaede, why
did you spare him?

338
00:17:53,591 --> 00:17:55,471
I don't understand why
you're doing any of this,

339
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:58,131
your plan's making no sense.

340
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,759
Perhaps that's because you're
simply a foolish human.

341
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,165
That might be true,
it could be true,

342
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:06,494
but do you really
think this is necessary

343
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:08,464
even though it
caused so much pain?

344
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:11,513
Think of Mr. Kunikida and of our

345
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,514
mom and our grandma
and Kusanagi.

346

(crying)

347
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:18,397
So many people that I love,
why would you kill them all?

348
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:20,785
Why does the rite of Matsuri
have to be performed?

349
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,227
It is the purpose
of the Kushinada.

350
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:24,663
Says who?

351
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,951
I don't like it Kaede, and
even if I do make mistakes,

352
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:29,807
I'm a Kushinada too,
I won't let you do it

353
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:31,876
no matter what you say!

354
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,662
And what can you do to stop me?

355
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,622
I don't know that, I don't know,

356
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,763
but I'm also a Kushinada,
so maybe I'll be able-

The Kushinada pulse.
Oh my god.

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,730
It sounds like some
kind of melody.

364
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,912
So this is what the power
of the Kushinada feels like.

365

Are both of you all
right, Momiji, Kaede?

Japan is facing the most
critical danger in it's history.

In two days, a total
eclipse will occur

be devastated by these events,
