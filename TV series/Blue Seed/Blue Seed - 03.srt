My name is Momiji Fujimiya

00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:44,838

But then, I was attacked
by a horrible monster,

and nothing will ever be
the same for me again.

The monster was an Aragami.

Unfortunately, the target of
their latest assault was me.

I never told you this,
but you had a twin sister.

allowed Kaede to be adopted.

the power, and the

This was all Kunikida's idea,

he can babysit the Kushinada
while we go help the others

in the pit.

Huh?

169
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,105
This is the excavation
where Kaede disappeared.

170
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:45,024
We've closed the site to
search for Aragami artifacts.

171
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,026
Hey, over here.

172
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:50,029
On the defense force, they
called me the Hurricane.

173
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,742
Here, I'm just a
freaking pack mule.

174
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,327
Oh, get over it.

175

Damn!

176
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,705
Fighting monsters is
fine, but this sucks!

177
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:00,375
I'd rather be that
pampered sacrifice.

I'm feeling just fine.

181

Maybe I'd better
go get a doctor.

No, I feel fine.

Mr. Kunikida!

188

Could you at least tell
me what the Aragami are?

189
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:39,152
Where do they come from?

190
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:42,750
It's a long story.

Ogres, goblins,

194
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,761
since the dawn of history,

195
00:10:53,761 --> 00:10:56,931
mankind has invented many
strange mythological creatures,

196
00:10:56,931 --> 00:11:00,643
but not all of them are just
figments of the imagination.

197
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:01,894
Oh.

198
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,102
- [Kunikida] Take a
look at these photos.

199
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:05,356
Can you tell what these
creatures have in common?

200
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:07,775
No.
It's a trick question.

201
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:09,861
The Aragami have no
bodies of their own.

202
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:13,072
That's how they live so
long, hopping body-to-body.

203
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,949
Did you notice
anything unusual about

204
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:17,116
the one you
encountered in Izumo?

205
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:18,328
It was a plant.

206
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:18,995
Right!

207
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:21,664
In that case, the Aragami
took the form of a tree.

208
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:24,667
It's our hypothesis that the
Aragami are plants themselves.

209
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,767
During the day, they
photosynthesize,
and store energy.

210
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,131
They become more
active at night.

211
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:33,133
Monsters, ghosts, demons;

212
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,177
they're all creatures
of the night.

213
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,723
Somehow, I don't think
it's a coincidence.

214
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,642
But, what do I?

Huh?

What am I supposed to do?

I'm sorry, so many strange
things have been happening

keeps telling me

that I'm different
from everyone else,

221

but that doesn't tell me
what I'm supposed to do now!

Well?

Why don't you go out
and do some sightseeing?

You know, the room
you're staying in now

there are two Aragami,

Such a pity.

It's not over, yet.

I won't let you take me alive!

Prepare to die.

A ceramic field?

no longer must we protect

Huh?

our dream of a thousand years,

No, maybe not.

I won't go easily.

The blue seeds are the
souls of the Aragami.

And this one?

A bird has no mind or soul.

364

The seeds can't control you,

not as long as you're able
to think for yourself.

Thanks, I was afraid you
were still trying to kill me.

All I wanna do is to
keep killing Aragami,

and the best way to do that
is to keep hanging around you.

Look at the walls!

Right!

Yes, but, Sir...

I'm sorry, Momiji.

387

I just couldn't bear the thought

388

of losing both you and Kaede.

389

I never even thought about
what your feelings were.

I tried to keep you locked
up like a precious jewel,

I almost killed you.

I tried to be nice, but, maybe,

now it looks like I
was a little too eager,
