using the pulse generator

Can't you trust me, Katie?

Mankind may have polluted
Japan for a long time,

us working together

If all of the people living
in Japan really tried,

I'm sure we can
change everything.

The people who live in
Japan now don't have

the faith to do such a thing.

We cannot trust them with
the future of this land.

Then tell me, why did you
help me just now, Katie?

I don't want to fight you.

I want to change this land
into a garden of purest green

and you want to cover
it with filthy humans.

The polluters of this
blighted land must not win.

412
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,894
It is the mission
of the Kushinada

to prevent such a thing
from ever happening again,
