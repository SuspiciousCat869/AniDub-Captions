something to tell you.

169
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,812
Just who are you,
where are you hiding?

170
00:12:02,338 --> 00:12:04,138
- [Woman] Kushinada, the
humans are using you.

00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:07,093
Huh?

172
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,980
- [Woman] They will
sacrifice you, you know?

173
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:11,387
No they won't!

174
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:12,305
Mr. Kunikida promised me

175
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:14,389
that he would never let
something like that happen!

- [Woman] The history of humans

177

is the repetition of mistakes.

Anger, hate, killing each other.

179
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,151
They repeat this ugly
history in an endless cycle.

180
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:26,468
They're foolish
creatures, after all.

181

That's not true!

182
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,299
Mr. Kunikida is very kind to me,

183
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,483
and Mr. Yaegashi sometimes
helps me finish my homework,

184
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,320
and Ms. Kame sometimes takes
me to the arcade with her.

Not only that, but everyone
else is so very nice.

you afraid of dying?

187
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,613
Kushinada, have
you ever wondered

188
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,322
whether it's worth throwing
your life away to save humanity?

189
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:48,508
Who are you?

190
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:49,551
Are you Aragami?

191
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:53,388
Or are you a human?

192
00:12:54,932 --> 00:12:55,932

193
00:12:57,227 --> 00:12:58,227
Neither one.

Kame, where's the cave?

Excuse me?

198
00:13:09,362 --> 00:13:10,962
I followed that nun
and went into a cave,

199
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,850
and then I heard
a woman's voice...

200
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:14,367
Chill out!

201
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,808
Geez have you been
smokin' something?

202

No ma'am, not me.

Oh for gosh sake, you
were just daydreaming.

But it seemed so real.

(eerie music)

206
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:35,389
Yaobikuni?

207
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,356
An old superstition, but
some of the villagers

208
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:39,269
call Mrs. Yamatone that,

209
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,193
and the parallels between
them are intriguing.

210
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:43,172
Yaobikuni, the nun
Yao is the story

211
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,349
of a fisherman's daughter who
ate the flesh of a mermaid

212
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:48,304
and gained eternal
life and youth.

213
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:50,649
Supposedly she became a nun
and went on a pilgrimage.

214
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,437
I think I met her earlier today.

215

I think Momiji needs a nap,
if you know what I mean!

216
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,583
The stories began when
an old man in the village

217
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:00,413
first saw Mrs. Yamatone.

218
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,623
He almost died of fright,
because she looks exactly

219
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,346
like the woman who lived
there 80 years ago.

220
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:07,587
Did you say 80 years?

221
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,111
Here, this is a
picture of the woman.

(eerie music)

223
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,999
She certainly
looks like Awakaba.

224
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,625
It's only natural
that the old man

225
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:17,886
was surprised, but even so.

226
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,391
The villagers all laughed
at him in the beginning,

227
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:22,563
but then the strange
occurrences began to happen.

228
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,633
Trees died, and they were no
longer able to catch any fish.

229
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,242
The people began to
think it might be a curse

230
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:30,746
from the nun Yao, so
they began to shun her.

00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,405
Ridiculous!

232

I'm here.
Huh?

I thought you were staying

in Tokyo.

235
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:39,263
Well the prototype's
been completed

236
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:40,967
and I thought it might
come in useful here.

237
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,651
What is that?
Oh you'll like this.

238
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,683
This is a corona shot,
a kind of gas gun.

239
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,979
It reacts to the carbonic acid

240
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:49,403
that forms inside
an Aragami's body,

241
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:51,960
generating a tremendous heat

242
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,813
that will destroy their
cellular structure.

243
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:56,387
It's a vegetable steamer.

244
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,264
That's a neat trick.

245

So even if that
woman is Yaobikuni,

this lil baby will make her
go up in a puff of smoke!

the house of Mr. Yamatone.

Right, I'm asking you again.

Why did you go to
the house that night?

What were the
three of you up to?

Will you care to explain
to me what that was about?

00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,272
What?

266
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:48,540

bad rumors about her

but running away like
that wasn't normal was it?

don't know anything!

truth or so help me I...

I will tell you the
truth, Mr. Kunikida.

00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:17,549
I am indeed Yaobikuni.

For 800 years I have walked
these lands, never aging.

281
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:25,894
I've avoided being seen,
running from the rumors,

But then I met Mr. Yamatone,
and my life changed.

285
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,203
Perhaps he saw a bit of
his lost Japan in me,

286
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,570
but I didn't care about that.

All I knew was that for
the first time in my life,

I was no longer alone.

Yamatone loved me.

what it was that I had become.

292
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:49,330
He loved me even knowing
that I was no longer human.

that's why he disappeared

three years ago then.

295
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:55,968
It was his desire for us
to come here to Wakasa,

296
00:16:57,674 --> 00:16:58,875
and I could not deny him that.

297

People talked about
us behind our backs,

and as usual the rumors
continued to spread,

days was a happy one.

325

We're in pursuit
of the Aragami now!

326
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,891
If it keeps going
straight, it'll pass

327
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:51,637
right in front of the
Wakasa Hiko Shrine.

328
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:54,706
Uh-oh, it just turned!

329
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,311
Now it's headed for
the Mantoku Temple.

330
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,343
I see, he's avoiding
historic sites on purpose.

331
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:02,113
He doesn't want
them to be involved.

Fall back, retreat
but keep firing!

Come on.
Here!

Don't shoot!

Please don't kill him!
What's wrong?

342
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,052
That Aragami is Mr.
Kunikida's best friend!

343
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:36,832
What?

So what do we do now?

346

What should we do, sir?

347
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,653
Give it to me, I'll
handle this myself.

Yes sir.

love that lasts forever

to casual flirtation.

364
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:52,582
Love is so mysterious, isn't it?

365
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,405
You start thinking about things

366
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:55,630
like what kind of a man is he?

367
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:57,889
Then after a while, you just

368
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,160
find yourself falling
in love with him.

369
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,829
But once you've fallen
in love with someone,

370
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,893
it might still be hard to
let him know you love him.

371
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:04,916
Maybe you might
even begin to think

372
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,900
you shouldn't have fallen
in love with him at all.

373
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,973
Isn't that right, Miss Takeuchi?

It's the next episode of
Blue Seed, episode number 17.

A Blizzard of One-Sided Love!

Are you always in the process
