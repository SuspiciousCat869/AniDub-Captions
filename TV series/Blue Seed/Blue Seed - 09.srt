- [Azusa] Based on the food
remaining in the stomach,

150
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:05,859
it would appear that the
Aragami was merely a stray dog,

00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,608
which became
possessed by a Mitama.

152
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,212
The Mitama, on the other
hand, is quite unique.

153
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,695
It's very different
from the types

There's a new type of Aragami?

156
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,297
Our current investigation
will clear up the mystery.

157

But if the Mitama is like
the Aragami equivalent

158

of the human brain, then
the higher thought centers

extremely underdeveloped.

Huh?

161
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:30,071
Hm, so learning the
origins of this Aragami

162
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,249

important than usual.

163
