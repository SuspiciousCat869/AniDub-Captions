00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,276
What am I doing here?

325
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,027
Yo!
Huh?

326
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,780
Kusanagi!
Mm-hmm.

327
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,302
I can't believe
you're really okay.

328
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,326
Oh, thank goodness, oh, I
was so worried about you.

329
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:47,538
Hmm, oh, really?

330
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:50,236
But you know, you were sleeping
pretty comfortably there.

331
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,199
Uh, oh, you were watching me
sleep, weren't you? (groans)

332
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,231
(Kusanagi laughs)
(gasps) You brought me

333
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:00,884
back here, didn't you?

334
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,009
Well, of course I did.

335
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,980
Didn't I say that I
would always protect you?

336
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,306
(gasps)
(gentle music)

337
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,164
It's true, I will
always protect you.

338
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:12,018
Oh.!

339
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,278
Hmm.
(high-pitched warbling)

340
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:32,122
(laughs) Hmm.

341
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:48,055
(upbeat music)

342
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,260
- [Momiji] Who's calling me?

343
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,888
Something powerful and alive

344
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:52,343
is being born in the darkness,

345
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,447
and yet at the same
time, something wonderful

346
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,856
is happening inside me!

347
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,025
I love you, Kusanagi, from
the bottom of my heart.

348
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,188
I want to tell you how
overpowered my feelings are at,

349
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,217
what, I have to tell
him by doing that?

350
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,659
That's too weird! (gasps)

351
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,600
It's the next episode
of "Blue Seed."

352
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,987
I love you, this is so extreme!

353
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,207
It's time to confess.

354
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,246
I'm so embarrassed but I'm
really happy, too! (laughs)

355
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:23,173
(upbeat pop music)
