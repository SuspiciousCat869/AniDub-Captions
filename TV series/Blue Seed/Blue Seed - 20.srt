All of these?

If we try to keep the
Aragami's existence

Takachiho, you mean

That's right.

Well, around the area
of Takachiho we've got.

Oh yes, sir.

Over a dozen reports already.

63
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:51,374
Exactly as I thought.

64
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:53,347
This means Susano-oh
is now in Takachiho.

65
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,710
- [Everyone] What?!

Kusanagi.

67
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,766
Takeuchi, we're going to
go to Izumo right now.

68
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:07,846
Izumo, not Takachiho?

69
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10,684
That's right, I noticed
something while examining

70
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:12,709
this map of the mass
foliage die offs

71
00:04:13,437 --> 00:04:15,197
besides the big cities,
which have few tracks

72
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:16,691
of green land,

73
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:18,452
there are some spots
that have been skipped

74
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:19,067
by this phenomenon.

75
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:20,684
Ise, Takachiho and here, Izumo.

76
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,969
You're absolutely
right, how strange.

77
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,458
Now what do Ise and
Takachiho have in common?

78
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:27,660
Amano-Iwato?

79
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:29,663
Yes, but the Iwato in
Takachiho is better known.

80
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,198
Right, we know that Susano-oh

81
00:04:32,956 --> 00:04:34,396
has been growing in
the Iwato on Ise.

82
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:36,669
In all likelihood,

83
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:37,793
he visits all the Iwatos

84
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,399
and absorbs the
energy they've stored.

85
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,344
The last time of Iwatos
must be in Izumo, there.

86
00:04:44,427 --> 00:04:45,777
- [Yaegashi] That's the
place where Susano-oh

87
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:48,082
and the Kushinada met during
the Age of Legends, isn't it?

88
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,247
And that's why we're
going to Izumo.

89
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,565
I'm sure that this holy
place must be the Iwato

90
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,939
that's most important to
Susano-oh and Kushinada.

91
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,259
Damn, now I know
what a potato baking

92

in the oven must feel like,

93
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:09,196
but this is going to lead
me right to you, Susano-oh.

94
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:12,454
(dramatic music)

95
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,677
Why are you here?

96
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:11,405
- [Kusanagi] I've
got a lot of reasons.

97
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:12,887
You must want to die.

98
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,380
Only a fool would challenge us.

99
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,850
Maybe I've just got nothing
left to lose blue boy.

100
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,750
On the other hand,
if I kill Susano-oh

101
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,531
it might just solve a
whole world of problems.

102
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:24,773
You have been very foolish,

103
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,020
but merciful Lord Susano-oh
will forgive your impudence

104
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,224
if you surrender
your mind to him.

105
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:32,493
Well, isn't that nice?

106
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,268
But I'm afraid I'll
have to refuse.

stronger and stronger.

00:10:27,936 --> 00:10:28,186
Well.

162
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,874
Oh, don't worry I'll
get another chance

163
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:31,145
to see mom again, right?

164
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,398
Momiji!

165
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,263
Noogies, noogies,
and more noogies.

166
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:39,924
Akiko, what are you doing?

167
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:41,428
You're mother told
me you were coming.

168
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,773
Why didn't you call me you rat?

169
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:44,159
I'm sorry.

170
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,404
Well, sir, why don't we leave
while the getting's good?

171
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:48,915
Right.

172
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,165
But.

173
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,732
You've been gone a
long time, Momiji.

174
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:54,170
Yeah, but.

175
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,169
Hey, you heard her.

176
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,483
Why don't the two
let's head on down

177
00:10:56,507 --> 00:10:57,651
to the good old karaoke palace

178
00:10:57,675 --> 00:10:58,915
and catch up on lost time, huh?

179
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,094
But, I.

180
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,305
Mm, yum.

181
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:09,703
I wonder if we should
have disconnected

182
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:10,895
the phones like that?

183
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,499
It was either that
are starve to death,

184
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:15,156
You really gotta wonder
what Susano-oh's up to

185
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,461
growing those dumb
roots all over Japan.

186
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,114
Well I just heard that the boss

187
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:21,875
and the others can find
something in Izumo.

188
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:23,733
Yeah, I think that it's pretty

189
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,035
strange that nothing's happened

190
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,960
to any of the roots
since they first appeared

191
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:28,243
besides the fact that they

192
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,123
grew in the first place.

193
00:11:29,247 --> 00:11:31,007
I keep wondering if all
those roots are going

194
00:11:31,206 --> 00:11:32,206
to suddenly start moving.

195
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:33,418
- [Woman] Quiet, you idiot!

196
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:35,186
Geez, why'd do you have to
say something like that?

197
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,451
Things are bad enough without
you putting a jinx on them.

198
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:48,979
I'm sorry, I've gone
through everything we have,

199
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:50,664
but there is no
Amano-Iwato in Izumo.

200
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:53,227
That's impossible!

201
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,348
Hey Momiji, where are you going?

202
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:00,734
Akiko, do you know where
the Amano-Iwato is located?

203
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:04,938
What the cave of the sun god,
what is it with you Momiji?

204
00:12:06,242 --> 00:12:08,122
The last time it was the
Kushinada and now this?

205
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,004
Well, I'm pretty sure I
saw something like that

206
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,028
the last time I
came here to pray.

207
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:19,253
There it is!

208
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:20,798
This could be it.

209
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:22,257
Uh huh.

210
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:31,007
What are you doing Momiji, hey?

211
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:34,687
This isn't it.

212
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,550
- [Man] What are
you doing girls?

213
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:38,936
Oh, excuse me, I was looking

214
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,275
for the Amano-Iwato.

215
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:41,526
The Cave of the Sun God,

216
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:43,877
that's just an air
raid shelter, my child.

217
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
An air raid shelter?

218
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:48,658
What's the problem Momiji?

219
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:51,121
I don't understand it.

220
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,646
Why would they put
an arch in front

221
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:53,873
of an air raid shelter?

222
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:56,017
Have you finished
what you're doing yet?

223
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:04,550
Hey, what's wrong?

224
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,687
Another vision it was
Izumo in ancient times.

225
00:13:08,806 --> 00:13:09,806
Momiji are you there?

226
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:11,266
Huh?

227
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:13,346
Hey, you're not in love
with someone are you Momiji?

228
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:15,390
What are you talking about?

229
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,624
You fell in love with
someone in Tokyo,

230
00:13:18,356 --> 00:13:19,024
didn't you know?

231
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,233
No, I mean not exactly.

232
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,131
You're turning into
such a pretty big,

233
00:13:22,778 --> 00:13:23,938
well come with me lover girl!

234
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,965
Wait, this is nothing
to do with love.

235
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,349
The Yaegaki Jinja
Shrine is a place

236
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:29,106
to make your love last forever.

237
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,843
The whole shrine's
dedicated to Susano-oh

238
00:13:31,662 --> 00:13:32,662
and the Kushinada.

239
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:33,831
What?

240
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:34,622
- [Akiko] Hey?!

241
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,910
Susano-oh and the Kushinada?

242
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,041
So anyway, tell me who...

243
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,255
Momiji?
(dramatic music)

244
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,500
- [Akiko] Go ahead, I'm going
to go buy some ice cream.

245
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,594
Okay.

246
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,598
Mr. Kunikida said that there
will be one last ceremony

247
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:00,898
at the Iwato in Izumo.

248
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,615
I wonder what Kaede and
Susano-oh intend to do.

249
00:14:05,528 --> 00:14:06,528
Momiji!

250
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:12,869
This is Tokyo.

251
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,452
Shinjuku in Tokyo.

252
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:21,752
Kaede what is this?

253
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,795
I don't understand.

254
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,450
Are you going to
do this to Tokyo?

255
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,299
Why, why?!

256
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,791
I'm sorry, I'll get
you another one.

257
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,730
What's wrong with you?

258
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:42,756
Something's wrong
with you, Momiji.

259
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:46,068
Sorry, Akiko.

260
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:47,935
Momiji, you've changed somehow.

261
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:51,106
I was so happy when I heard
that you were gonna be back,

262
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,827
but there's something's
definitely wrong with you.

263
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,620
Akiko.

264
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,115
I'm sorry, I'm going home now.

265
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,540
Akiko.

266
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,496
If we succeed in
finding the Iwato

267
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,178
all of this will be over.

268
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,679
Please God, help me.

269
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:16,863
Help me to find the
location of the Iwato.

270
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,346
It's got To be here in Izumo.

271
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:27,808
(children playing and cheering)

272
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,070
Thanks, weird kid (laughing).

273
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:40,934
Lord Susano-oh, we
have come to Izumo.

274
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:44,039
This is the place where we
first met in ancient times

275
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:46,628
so many years ago?

276
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Akiko!

277
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,719
Look I'm sorry.

278
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:56,853
Momiji, you've changed
since you went to Tokyo.

279
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,142
I have.

280
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:00,351
I mean, no, I haven't.

281
00:16:00,435 --> 00:16:02,075
Then why do you keep
suffering in silence?

282
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,788
I've been your friend
for over five years

283
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,705
and it's as plain as
the nose on your face

284
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,191
that you've got a problem.

285
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:09,820
Akiko.

286
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:11,347
This is about the
Kushinada, right?

287
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,075
Wait, Akiko, slow down!

288
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:17,284
(dramatic music)

289
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,359
Six months ago that
monster destroyed

290
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,541
the old school building and
then you just disappeared.

291
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,122
They're connected, aren't they?

292
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:34,741
I know you've been
purifying yourself

293
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,332
since you were in
the fifth grade.

294
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,218
Is that related to all this?

295
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:40,612
I'm sorry, I just can't
tell you right now.

296
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,860
You jerk, you stupid,
dimwitted little turnip.

297
00:16:46,982 --> 00:16:47,482
Akiko?

298
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:49,282
Why must you always be
such a pathetic loser!

299
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,724
Not only are you
dumb and clumsy,

300
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:52,153
you're selfish as well.

301
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,274
Hey, look who's talking here?

302
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:55,757
You couldn't even
get up the nerve

303
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,342
to give that love
letter to that senior.

304
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,372
You wanted to get me to
give it to him for you!

305
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,038
Why'd you bring that up?

306
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,204
Because you piss me off!

307
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,457
Then my plan worked.

308
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,790
Huh?

309
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,129
It's about time that I
saw the real Momiji again.

310
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,048
But I.

311
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:12,946
You've been putting
up a false front

312
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:14,092
ever since you got here.

313
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:15,699
You shouldn't have
done that, Momiji.

314
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:17,551
Akiko.

315
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,596
Momiji, I've been really,
really worried about you.

316
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:23,225
I'm sorry.

317
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:26,144
- [Akiko] Geez, I've never
seen anyone cry so much.

318
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,812
Oh, well, at least it proves
you're the real Momiji.

319
00:17:29,524 --> 00:17:30,884
- [Momiji] I'm
really sorry, Akiko.

320
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,217
Well, I guess I'll
forgive you for now.

321
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:40,816
That's a strange way to put it.

322
00:17:41,744 --> 00:17:42,744
(laughing)

323
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,561
But please Momiji,
don't forget this.

324
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:46,581
You're the kind of person

325
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:47,582
who can't control herself

326
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,426
once she's decided to
give something her all,

327
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:51,421
but think about a balloon.

328
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,466
If you put in too much
air it'll explode, right?

329
00:17:54,757 --> 00:17:55,757
So call me, okay?

330
00:17:56,968 --> 00:17:57,968
Yeah, thank you.

331
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,541
Right, and the
next time we meet,

332
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:00,914
why don't we bring
our boyfriends?

333
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,516
Both of us.

334
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,308
What, why?

335
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:05,475
Of course someone might
need to bring her kids too.

336
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,594
But what are you talking about?

337
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:09,883
Well, you've
already got your man

338
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,148
picked out, don't you?

339
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,931
He's got nothing to do with me.

340
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,319
(chuckling) Yeah, sure.

341
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:18,489
Beautiful, isn't it?

342
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:20,013
Do you remember
when you were little

343
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:21,765
you wanted to play
with the fireworks

344
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,410
and screamed and cried?

345
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,218
Oh, really, I don't
remember that at all.

346
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:29,383
(chuckling) To be honest,
I was like that too

347
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:30,624
when I was a little girl.

348
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,466
At least, that's what
grandma keeps telling me.

349
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:34,628
Really (laughing)?

350
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,493
- [Mother] We share
the same blood,

351
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:39,952
so please tell me anything when
you're having a rough time.

352
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:42,636
- [Momiji] Okay.

353
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,558
- [Mother] That's the only
thing I can do for you

354
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:46,475
to pay you back for.

355
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:47,998
Oh no, no, no, I
really appreciate you

356
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:49,936
for giving birth to me.

357
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:52,861
I've got a lot of troubles
right now, of course,

358
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:55,085
but there's some
people I never would've

359
00:18:55,152 --> 00:18:56,352
met if I wasn't the Kushinada.

360
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:58,651
A wonderful chance to meet
someone was given to me.

361
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,375
Grandmother, if there isn't
an Iwato in this area,

362
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,252
what should we look for?

363
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:15,669
Look at this picture.

364
00:19:16,214 --> 00:19:16,670
(gasps)

365
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:18,271
But this is a picture
of the giant plants

366
00:19:19,176 --> 00:19:20,736
that have been appearing
all over Japan.

367
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:21,927
That's right.

368
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,895
Grandmother, where did
this picture come from?

369
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:25,960
This is the ceremony of Tamafuri

370
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:27,658
from a book on the Kushinada

371
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:29,402
that has been passed
down through my family.

372
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
(dramatic music)

373
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:35,889
Finally, it's time to wipe
away the miserable human race

374
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,051
who've acted as if
they own the earth

375
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,726
and contaminate
its very essence.

376
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:43,472
Soon you will use
your awesome powers

377
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,802
to revive the real
Japan Lord Susano-oh.

378
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,110
The ceremony of Tamafuri will
the clean this filthy earth

379
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:51,583
and make it green again.

380
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:53,026
Then this planet
will be at peace.

381
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:55,665
Susano-oh and the Kushinada,

382
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:57,851
originally those two
were husband and wife.

383
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,073
Then the ceremony
of Tamafuri might

384
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:01,676
be a way of creating mitama.

385
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:03,756
Could this ceremony be a
way to create more Aragami?

386
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,639
Impossible, do you mean
that Kaede, the Kushinada,

387
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:08,765
will create Aragami?

388
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:09,975
How can this be?

389
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,103
If I'm right, something
terrible will happen soon.

390
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,559
Susano-oh has already taken
control of the Kushinada.

391
00:20:15,357 --> 00:20:17,597
He intends to create a whole
country filled with Aragami?

392
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:24,823
It's my future.

393
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,760
I won't let our future
become like that.

394
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:29,578
Right, Kusanagi?

395
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:33,747
Kusanagi!

396
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:34,792
Is that Momiji?

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,281
Kusanagi, can you
really hear me?

398
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,472
This is incredible, I'm
actually hearing you.

399
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:40,965
But why?

400
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:42,932
I don't know, but it
could be that our mitamas

401
00:20:43,301 --> 00:20:44,403
are somehow calling each other.

402
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,107
Our mitamas did come
from the same Aragami.

403
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:48,097
Orochi, remember?

404
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:48,806
That makes sense, right?

405
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:50,253
I understand,
eight beads in one,

406
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:52,393
so the two of us are one.

407
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:55,028
We're together no matter
how far apart we are.

408
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,130
Huh, I guess that's
true, isn't it?

409
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:58,967
Well, let's do the
best job we can.

410
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,101
Even if I'm alone, I'm with you.

411
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:06,694
I'll be able to survive no
matter what happens to me.

412
00:21:09,286 --> 00:21:10,286
(dramatic music)

413
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:12,617
Do you feel it coming trees?

414
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:14,908
Do you feel the time of the
revival of Lord Susano-oh?

415
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,911
At last the earth shall be
reborn as our ideal heaven.

416
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,427
The time of the opening
of the Iwato is at hand.

417
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:27,962
I won't let you go Susano-oh!

418
00:21:29,013 --> 00:21:30,013
Until I've killed you,

419
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:31,378
I'll follow you wherever you go!

420
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,949
- [Momiji] Susano-oh is
about to turn all of Japan

421
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:49,903
into the land of the Aragami.

422
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,053
I've always believed
that we can stop him

423
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,158
as long as we're able to
use my power and Kusanagi's.

424
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,667
But something's wrong.

425
00:21:58,834 --> 00:21:59,915
Kusanagi, what's happening?

426
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:02,158
Talk to me please,
where are you?

427
00:22:03,798 --> 00:22:05,278
You've disappeared,
and it feels as if

428
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:07,923
my heart has turned to ice.

429
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:10,506
It's the next episode of
Blue Seed, episode number 21.

430
00:22:12,724 --> 00:22:13,724
Goodbye, no way.

431
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:15,892
A tearful farewell.

432
00:22:16,394 --> 00:22:17,754
I won't let you
die on me Kusanagi.

433
