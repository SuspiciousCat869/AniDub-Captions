Oh yes, very wonderful.

168

She was such a brilliant,
well behaved, and graceful

young lady and I
liked her very much.

170

Why?

Yes, this factor is one of the

all been very promising.

so we call it a killer factor.

327

- [Yaegashi] The
killer factor, and the

328
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,311
unwanted Aragami that
has infected the planet,

329
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:49,717
are now fighting each other!

330
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,490
Boy, you sure are exasperating.

331
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:21,282
But that's just
the way you are...

332
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:23,297
I- I suppose so...

333
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,259
That's just the way I am!

334
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:30,805
(happy laughter)

335
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:34,265
I didn't get a
chance to show off

336
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,547
all my powers again because
of that stupid sacrifice girl!

337
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:39,206
I may have to reconsider
the terms of my

338
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:40,756
cooperation contract
with your boss!

339
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:44,861
(upbeat music)

340
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:57,264
The construction will
continue, won't it?

341
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,934
I wonder if the
persimmon tree was trying

342
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:01,912
to protect this little shrine.

343
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,774
I don't know, but
if it was protecting

344
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,485
this shrine, then it
was protecting a part

345
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:08,429
of mother earth that we
ourselves have abandoned.

346
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,182
Perhaps this is tied into
the strange phenomenon

347
00:21:11,764 --> 00:21:13,884
of dying trees which has
been going on all over Japan.

348
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,847
- [Koume] Do ya think that
the Aragami are behind it?

349
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,789
- [Yaegashi] I don't
know, but what if

350
00:21:18,896 --> 00:21:20,576
all the anger the earth
must harbor against

351
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,713
human beings were
unleashed at once?

352
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,007
If the Aragami were
able to focus it?

353
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:27,731
It would be the end of life
as we know it, Armageddon.

354
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,322
(bulldozer plowing)

355
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:49,401
- [Momiji] A man has
committed suicide

356
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,346
in the village of Wakasa
in the Fukui prefecture.

357
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,991
And, as I understand
it, the victim was

358
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,421
an old friend of Mr. Kunikita's.

359
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:58,581
Now Mr. Kunikita
must make the journey

360
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,369
to see his friend's
widow, there's a very

361
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,500
sad and tragic tale
behind all of this.

362
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,236
The story of pale blue
tears that lasts forever.

The next episode of Blue
Seed, number sixteen,

Japan is a paradise,
tears in Wakasa.

365
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,406
