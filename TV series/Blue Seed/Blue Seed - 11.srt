the blood had been
drained from their bodies.

Then something must have
manipulated their dead bodies

with some sort of answer.

115

As you know, we
can't afford to make

the very existence of the
aragami public knowledge,

117

let alone that they
intend to destroy Japan.

118

However, the government
intends to issue

119

some kind of statement to
dispel the public concern.

120
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,842
We've received inquiries
from all over the world

121
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,067
about the recent series of
incidents, and let's face it,

122
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,844
we can't keep on
pretending that monsters

123
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,849
haven't invaded our
cities when just last week

124
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,353
there was a giant
frog walking through

125
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,478
the Foreign Exchange Building.

126
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,542
This problem is about to
reach epidemic proportions,

127
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,791
and we must be prepared to
deal with it, Mr. Kunikida.

128
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,675
Well, this is not the first time

129

that Japan has been faced
with such a problem.

130
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,623
I would think our
state department

131
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:52,164
would be rather
used to it by now.

(chuckling)

133
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,169
Well, first of all, we obviously
can't tell other countries

134
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,618
that our nation kept
the aragami a secret.

135
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,042
But if what you
tell me is correct,

136
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,466
we'll have to come
up with something

137
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,976
that at least sounds plausible.

138
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,837
Maybe something to do
with mass hallucinations

139
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,341
induced by a drug
in the water supply,

140
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:11,532
or on the subways.

141

like a promising start.

00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:15,454
Not really.

143
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,557
After all, our police
organizations have a reputation

144
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,541
for being among the best
in the world, don't they?

Hmm.

146
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,129
I understand.

147
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,691
We wouldn't want
to propose anything

148
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,515
that might relect poorly
on our police forces,

149
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,175

Thanks.

- [Sakura] Nuts, she just went
into the teachers' lounge.

176

- [Kusanagi] I thought so.

You're that
schizophrenic psychic.

178

- [Sakura] Kusanagi,
what are you doing here?

I could ask the same
question of you.

Ah, Kusanagi!

Oh, Yamazaki.

We've got more important

200
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,893
- [Momiji] Why did I have
to run away like that?

201
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,260
So what if Kusanagi and
Sakura do have a relationship?

202
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,684
I feel like such an idiot.

203
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,127
I first ran into Reiko
about a week ago.

204
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,154
- [Woman] Reiko!

205
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,322
Reiko, what happened?

206
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:00,191
Don't worry, there's nothing
physically wrong with her.

207
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,185
However, it's my
professional opinion

208
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,579
that she's been possessed.

209
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,832
Just who are you?

210
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,834
Oh, look at this!

211
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,293
What does it mean?

212
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,046
It can't be.

213
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,450
You look like
you've got some idea

214
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,068
of what might be behind this.

215
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,652
I think you'd better
tell me everything.

216
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:19,721
What, who are you?

217
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,208
I'm the world's
greatest exorcist.

218
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,473
My success rate is 100%.

219
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,796
I'm from Kusamikado
Faith Healers,

220
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:27,925
and boy, are you
guys ever lucky.

221
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,962
So anyway, after a
little negotiating,

222
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,237
I've set myself up to
watch Reiko 24 hours a day,

223
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,439
and since I have to stay as
close to her as possible...

224
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,781
So that's why you transferred
into Momiji's school.

225
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,071
But are you sure it was an
aragami that possessed her?

226
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,184
I think so, but there
are alternatives

227
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,371
that I can't ignore.

228
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,874
Alternatives?

229
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,910
- [Matsudaira] The entire
body is completely desiccated,

230
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,253
but look at the neck.

231
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,461
- [Yaegashi] Ugh, a spider!

232
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,276
- [Ryoko] I believe
this might have been

233
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
the control mechanism.

234
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,469
So it is aragami.

235
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:02,556
I knew it!

236
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,728
- [Matsudaira] It would
be wiser to assume that.

237
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,137
Right, we'll make a map of
where the bodies were found

238
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,064
and conduct a search of
all those neighborhoods.

239
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:10,772
Hmm.

240
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:12,265
Hey, look, Momiji's school is

241
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,049
almost in the center
of the pattern.

242
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,445
So anyway, it turned out
that the English teacher,

243
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,951
Mr. Takahara, was only
teaching us dirty words.

244
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:22,825
What a perverted teacher.

245
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:25,358
Reiko, what are you doing here?

246
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,335
Our class has gym class
next, not yours, right?

00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,041

Yes, it is.

I've been told that under that
stone is a bottomless pit.

269
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,577
In the olden days, whenever
there was a drought

270
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,922
or a famine, they
would throw young women

into that pit as a sacrifice.

272

- [Kusanagi] Wonderful.

273
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,180
So why did they put
the seal on the rock?

274
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:52,485
Legend has it that a huge spider

275
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,448
which craved the taste of blood

276
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,493
began to emerge from the hole,

villagers no matter

278
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,534
how many sacrifices
it was given.

279
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,787
I heard the tale from my father,

280
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,648
who learned it from
his father before him.

281
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,777
But I always thought
it was just a story.

282
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,015
I don't know if the creature was

283
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,782
originally an aragami,
or if the aragami

284
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,425
took over its body afterwards.

285
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,106
But it would seem to me
it must have been revived

286
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,345
when the holy seals were broken.

287
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,548
I've gone ahead and
resealed the rock
