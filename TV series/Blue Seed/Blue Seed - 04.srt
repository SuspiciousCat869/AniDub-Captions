- [Momiji] The incident occurred

12
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,872
beside a small pond
at the edge of Tokyo.

13
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,936

My name is Momiji Fujimiya.

17
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,850
I was born in Izumo,
where I was just

18
00:03:07,412 --> 00:03:08,532
another high school student.

19
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:10,760
Or anyway, that's what
I'd always thought.

20
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,377
Then I learned that a
mysterious race of beings,

21
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:16,202
the aragami, had been reborn,

22
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,773
and well, to make
a long story short,

23
00:03:18,584 --> 00:03:20,624
I guess a lot of strange
things have happened to me.

24
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:23,903
I'm now a member of a special
organization known as the TAC.

25
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,630
Ew!

26
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,943
- [Momiji] I'm
also the Kushinada,

27
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,926
the only human with the
power to stop the aragami.

28

Don't ask me how, I don't
like to think about it.

What's going on?
Huh?

Good morning, everyone.

Good morning?

Momiji Fujimiya reporting
everything cleaned and secured.

33
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,469
- [Momiji] This is Mr. Kunikida.

34
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:54,563
He's a native of Tokyo,

35
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:56,327
his sign is Virgo, and
his blood type is B.

36
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:58,924
He seems to be in
charge of the TAC,

37
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,965
but I'm not completely
sure of that.

38
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,423
Next in command is
Ms. Ryoko Takeuchi.

39

A maple roll?

40

born in Hokkaido,

her sign is Leo, and
her blood type is AB.

She used to be with
the police department.

43
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:16,095
She's cool, calm,
and a crack shot too.

44
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:19,056
- [Ryoko] Aren't
these from Hiroshima?

45
00:04:20,122 --> 00:04:21,322
Aren't you from Izumo, Momiji?

46

sign, Pisces, blood type O.

48
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:29,560
I don't know much about him yet,

49
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,103
but he used to be a
computer specialist

50
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:32,865
at the economic planning agency.

51
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,442
Well, Momiji means
maple, so I thought

52
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:37,292
these rolls were appropriate.

sweet bun on my computer.

56
00:04:43,385 --> 00:04:45,744

it's my first day you know?

57
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,929
Oh, I see.

she's a Capricorn and
her blood type is A.

She has degrees in biotechnology

can't even pronounce.

And last of all, the
person who just came in

She's from lower Tokyo,
an Aries and type B.

00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,387
She was in the
Self Defense Force,

68

and I think she
was happier there.

69

Her motto is if you still
have bullets, keep shooting.

Police Department

he wanted us to make a

Mr. Kusanagi?

Odd, aragami?

Yeah.

119

attack me again?

120
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:45,452
No, probably not.

121
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:47,315
This one seems a
little different.

122

What do you mean by different?

123
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,745
Well, I guess we'll both
be finding out soon enough.

125

Kusanagi, wait!

126
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,544
A new kind of aragami?

127
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:02,963
- [Kunikida] A living gel?

128
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,482
- [Ryoko] It was still
attached to the car.

129
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,545
The police have it locked
up in their lab right now,

130
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,452
but if you could
pull some strings

131

to get us inside, we could.

132

There's something else, sir.

Write a report, I've
gotta get Matsudaira

into that crime lab before
your bogeyman melts.

137
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:24,283
But Mr. Kunikida,
there's a pattern here.

138
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,605
Just south of where the
car was found is a pond.

139
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,447
To the east is the river,
a road to the west,

140
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:34,148
and a hill to the north.

141
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:35,441
That means...

142
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,607
When I say follow me, I
mean stay right on my tail.

143
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:39,753
You'll never survive in Tokyo

instructions.

Look, princess,
don't you think it's

about time you got
your act together?

What, why do you keep
calling me princess?

149

I want you wait here.
What?

it's classified.
