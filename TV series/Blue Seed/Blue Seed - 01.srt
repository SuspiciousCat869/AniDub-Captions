00:17:56,157 --> 00:18:00,157
and the old parents
were reduced to tears.

329
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:04,257
Then, one day, the
outcast god Susano-o

330
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,895
appeared before the old couple.

331
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:10,995
Susano-o made the
Orochi-no-Orochi drunk
by feeding it sake,

332
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:15,218
then slew the monster
in a terrible battle.

333
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:19,115
The last daughter, who had
almost become a victim,

334
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,324
instead married Susano-o.

335
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,996
She became the
Princess Kushinada.

336

(sighing)

337
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,459
Oh, this doesn't make any sense!

338
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:33,482
This stuff is driving me crazy?

339
00:18:33,482 --> 00:18:36,258
(laughing nervously)

340
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:40,358
Just what does this Kushinada
stuff have to do with me?

341
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:43,974
- [Creature] Kushinada.

00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:45,349
(gasping)

343
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:46,349
What was that?

344
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:50,449
This whole Kushinada thing
is just getting too...

Kushinada!

We've got to get
there right now!

352
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,609
If we lose Momiji,
the consequences
will be catastrophic!

353
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:43,158
This is it.

354
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:47,258
If we fail again, the
human race is doomed.

355
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:52,567
Momiji.

I must!

I must get Momiji!

no way we can make it

to Izumo in time.

We're too late.

- [Narrator] The huge monster
which suddenly appeared

371
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:16,931
in Izumo has been identified
as an Aragami by the TAC.

372
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:21,323
Now, the birthplace of
legends has given birth

373
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:23,800
to something far more deadly.

374
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,509
In the stream of human history,

375
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:29,609
one tiny eddy has swollen
into a vast, yawning vortex

376
00:21:29,609 --> 00:21:33,601
that threatens to
engulf all mankind.

The future of our planet
is about to be decided.

still don't understand!

380
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:49,159
Who is the Kushinada?

381
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,911
And what's this business
about me being twins?

382
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,790
I'm just a normal girl,
why is everyone after me?

383
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,890
I'm in great danger now,
and I don't even know why!

384
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,838
I'm just a high school student.

I haven't even had a boyfriend!

386

What's happening now is more
than crazy, it's impossible.

Oh, but it's happening
