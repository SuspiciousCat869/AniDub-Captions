The Metro Police announced today

which are related to
unidentified organisms.

Yes, I'm standing in front of

the Metropolitan Police
Department Office.

62
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:22,880
This is Mr. Sugishita,

Director of the 26th
Department of Public Safety,

64
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:27,122

finished speaking

65
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:27,885
to newspaper reporters.

66
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:30,173
Director, what exactly are
these mysterious organisms?

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,801
Well, I'm Director Sugishita.

68
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,649
Currently we suspect
the mysterious organisms

69
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:36,768
are chromosomal mutations.

70
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:39,134
However, the
information gathered

71
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,754
from current samples
is inconclusive.

72
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:43,426
So it's difficult to determine
just exactly what that means.

73
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:46,446
We are working closely
with a team of specialists,

74
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:48,978
so we ask everyone to stay calm.

75
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:50,987
I'm afraid to say, however,

76
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:53,082
that similar incidents
may occur in the future.

77

If you're involved in
one of these incidents,

knew about the aragami

Don't be ridiculous.

166

He's just a young pup.

167
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,940
I like my men to be a
little more experienced.

168
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:05,295
Well, I like the
big muscular guys.

169
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,393
You know, the caveman type.

170
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,224
Well, I'll ask the gorilla
from the zoo if he's taken!

172

Shut it, Yaegashi!

173
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,976
So Momiji, have
you told Kusanagi

174
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:17,435
that you're in
love with him yet?

175
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:18,825
What?

176
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,115
No, I couldn't.

177
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:21,077
Idiot!

178
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:21,828
In order to catch a man,

179
00:08:21,995 --> 00:08:23,955
you've got to spring your
love on him like a trap!

180
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,219
I don't know, isn't
Kome talking about love

181
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,443
one of the signs
of the apocalypse?

182
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:29,794
(screaming)

183
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,103
Yeah, and here come
the four horsemen.

184
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,847
Clippity clop, clippity
clop, clippity clop!

185
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,771
Well anyway, Kusanagi
isn't a mind reader.

186
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,316
After all, Momiji, if
you don't talk to him

187
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:41,281
he'll never know how
you feel about him.

188
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:42,925
But he doesn't care about me.

189
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,019
He probably thinks I'm
just a stupid, klutzy kid

190
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:47,895
with a dumpy figure.

191
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,144
That's not true, Momiji!

192
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,844
You're a very pretty young lady.

193
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:52,558
Besides, he's always with you.

194
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,092
Who else would he
fall in love with?

195
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,874
Well, if Kaede ever
reappeared they might.

196
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:01,784
Then again, maybe not.

197
00:09:02,744 --> 00:09:03,944
Just go ahead and tell the guy

198
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:05,364
that you're in love with him.

199
00:09:05,537 --> 00:09:07,298
But he always creeps up
on me so unexpectedly

200
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,990
that it makes me all flustered.

201
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:11,293
What about a love letter?

202
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,740
But we don't know
where he lives.

204
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:15,867
Well, I think I
have the solution.

What, you want me to wear those?

209
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:27,338

You know.

really do this?

Hello, TAC.

219
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,205
Oh, Sugishita, it's you.

220
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,499
What's the matter?

221
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:54,210
You think what?

222
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,427
Two days ago, two workmen
were reported missing

223
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,697
from the cave-in
site at the subway.

224
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:01,019
According to the other
construction workers,

225
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:03,057
a brilliant flash of light
came from the manhole

226
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:04,707
just prior to their
disappearance.

227
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,582
I can't send someone
over on a lead

228
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:08,183
as flimsy as that.

229
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,984
I realize that, but just
look at the location

230

of the accident.

231
00:10:12,563 --> 00:10:14,323
The subway site is this
red point on the map,

232
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,596
and these three white points
are where the centipede skins

233
00:10:18,235 --> 00:10:19,316
were hung on the buildings.

234
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:20,989
Hmmm?

235
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,238
- [Sugishita] The
incident occurred

236
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,639
at the center of
these three points.

237
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:25,783
Now is it worth your time?

238
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:27,736
Now you're talking, my friend.

239
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:29,613
The team and I are on our way.
