the power of Susano-Oh

163
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:27,816
by using the Rite of Matsuri,

164
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,467
then that means the
power of the Kushinada

165
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,851
can be increased
by the ritual too!

166
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,493
Hm.

167
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,112
When Momiji began to glow red,

168
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,135
Susano-Oh fired energy
at both Kushinadas,

169
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,499
both Momiji and Kaede.

170
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,288
Maybe his instincts told him

171
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,941
that the red light
was his weak point.

172
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,835
So how can we utilize this?

173
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,507
That's the problem, all right.

174
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,988
Mr. Kunikida, could
you please take me

175
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,930
to the place where the
Ceremony of Human Sacrifice

176
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,638
is going to be held?

177
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,514
- [All] What?

178
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,392
She's right!

179
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,435
The Ceremony of Sacrifice
and the Rite of Matsuri

180
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,924
have got to be one and the same!

181
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,701
And if that's true,
then being on the site

182
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,853
of the Rite of Matsuri will
maximize Momiji's power!

183
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,109
I feel something sir.

184
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,277
The blood of the Kushinada
is telling me something.

185
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,394
Understood, it's all or nothing.

186
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
We'll try Momiji's plan.

187
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,035
Right.

188
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,534
- [Both] Hm.

189
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,413
(Kusanagi groans)

190
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,039
(somber music)

191
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,658
The Kushinada is
our last chance?

192
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,255
But how?

193
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,263
The Kushinada pulse is
some kind of ultrasound.

194
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:30,144
It has the power to
destroy the giant plants.

195
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,582
This power used to appear only
when a Kushinada was killed,

196
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,468
or offered up as a sacrifice.

197
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,078
We believe that by
making the Kushinada

198
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,490
and the artificial
Kushinada pulse resonate,

199
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,374
we can now unleash
the Kushinada's power

200
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,489
without having to use
her as a human sacrifice.

201
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,743
A method of electronically
amplifying her power

202
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,365
is now being calculated,

203
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:54,692
and will be completed by
tomorrow morning at the latest.

204
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,595
However, I do regret
that in doing this,

205
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,818
we will be destroying the
great work our ancestors began.

206
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,942
Are we right in
undoing their work?

207
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,300
That decision weighs
heavily upon my conscience.

208
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,733
- [Prime Minister]
We have a duty

209
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:09,838
to make the citizens happy.

210
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,005
- [Kunikida] Hm, but what
is the meaning of happiness?

211
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,432
I wish I knew.

212
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,355
Smell of air, clean air.

213
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,607
I'd forgotten it.

214
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,827
We Japanese lived with
nature for a long time.

215
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,128
However at some point,
we started to ignore

216
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,343
the part of nature
where our gods lived.

217
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,263
- [Prime Minister] The
Japanese government

218
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,528
has already asked the Americans

219
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,903
to use nuclear weapons on Tokyo.

220
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:43,750
Atomic bombs?

221
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,522
- [Prime Minister]
Missiles, actually.

222
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,026
This city will
become a sea of fire.

223
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:48,755
But when sir?

224
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,923
Two days from now, at the
same time as the eclipse.

225
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,192
We will do our best
to evacuate everyone

226
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,644
from the metropolitan
area beginning tomorrow.

227
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:57,473
But sir!

228
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,998
After the beginning
of the eclipse,

229
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,183
I'll give you one hour.

230
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,838
During that time,
you must execute

231
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,683
the Ceremony of Sacrifice,

232
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,598
or whatever you have in mind.

233
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:07,441
I understand, sir.

234
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,168
Have the sacrificial
altar ready for us.

235
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,536
- [Murakumo] I understand.

236
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,819
- [Man] Yes, our propaganda
seems to have taken effect.

237
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,175
- [Murakumo] How about
the special ceramics?

238
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,946
- [Man] We have more than enough

239
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,124
to form the ceramic field.

240
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,979
- [Murakumo] Set
the ceramic field

241
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,403
around the Altar
of Human Sacrifice.

242
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,047
- [Man] Yes sir.

243
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,854
Kaede Kushinada, queen
of traitors beware!

244
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,194

king of the Aragami!

- [Momiji] What are
you thinking about?

249
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,289
- [Kusanagi] Did you finish
typing all that data?

250
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,703
Yeah finally.

251
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,230
Anyway, what are
you thinking about?

252
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:07,708
Nothing.

253
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,192
Liar, you look
pretty serious to me.

254
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,043
Don't be dumb, and just
what are you thinking about?

255
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,454
Do you really think you can win?

256
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,715
You're gonna be up there
on that sacrificial altar.

You're the one who oughta be...

And you really think you'll win?

261
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,396
I can't honestly say,

262
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,930
but I won't just give up
without trying either, you know.

I'd like to thank you all.

Thanks to your support,

Ministry of Investigation.

All of the preparations
will be completed tonight.

Yeah!
Great!

269
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,496
Tomorrow, everything will start,

and tomorrow everything
may end as well.

Hm?
What was that?

I want all of you to
listen to me carefully.

As of this moment, I

by that, dissolved?

has asked the United States
to render assistance.

279

In a worst case scenario, the
final option will be employed.

Now wait a second, what the
hell do you mean, A-bombs?

Yes, nuclear missiles will

enjoying the few
moments we have left

before tomorrow, making
sure you won't regret

what we have to do.

Ha, when did you become
such a pessimist, old man?

We've got a job to do,

it through to the end!

You have live to lead, families!

Don't throw all that away

299
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,585
just because of some
misguided sense of duty.

300
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,828
Once you've thought about it,

You're wrong.

It can take as much
courage to withdraw

00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,702
when the very sky is
covered with darkness?

479
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,357
Nobody knows.

480
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,762
There's only one
thing we do know.

way for us to win,

All or Nothing!

Decision!

487
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,374
My Fate!

488
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,480
Kaede, my twin sister,
I will not lose.

489
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,465
