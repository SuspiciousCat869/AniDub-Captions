focused on a local school

322
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,741
which was completely destroyed.

323
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:45,785
CAN News has not yet been able

324
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,580
to ascertain who or
what killed the monster,

325
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,000
which now looks
like a dead tree.

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,667
Local officials do
not any knowledge

327
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,712
of government intervention,
but eye witnesses

328
00:19:56,712 --> 00:20:00,299
claim to have seen...
Well, it's started now.

329
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,300
From here on out the
question is going to be

330
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,971
how much can we
hide from the media?

331
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,016
Mr. Secretary, I
want no official

332
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:10,268
comments made regarding
this incident.

333
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:13,395
Announce the disaster
relief for Azumo,

334
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:15,773
and our sincere concern.
Right.

335
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:19,838
But you know sir, the
next time it may be worse.

336
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:23,656
Hm, that may be, but
we have a weapon now.

337
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,492
The Aragami won't
be so bold again.

338
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,592
Mr. Kunikida and the
TAC seem up to the task.

339
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:46,633
I'm so sorry
Momiji, please live.

340
00:20:50,253 --> 00:20:54,253
Mother?
Momiji!

341
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,731
It's okay, it's my destiny.

342
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,733
I don't understand
everything yet,

343
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:03,833
but it's okay, I know
what I must do now.

344
00:21:06,782 --> 00:21:10,782
Momiji.

345
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,579
Destiny, hm.

346
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:20,362
(yawns) Looks like this
job won't be as boring

347
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,549
as I thought it would
be, eh, Yaegashi?

348
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,802
That's Mr. Yaegashi
to you, Miss Koume.

349
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:29,555
(laughing)

350
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,892
- [Man] The time of our
greatest test is now at hand.

351
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:35,353
Has the fate of
mankind ever depended

352
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:37,939
so much on one individual?

353
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:42,039
I swear Momiji, we
will protect you.

354
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:48,016
(funky music)

355
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,575
- [Momiji] I told my mom I
was okay with my destiny,

356
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,661
but I'm not really sure
what my destiny is.

357
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,664
Grandma, why didn't
you ever just tell me

358
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:57,415
about this Kushinada business?

359
00:21:57,415 --> 00:21:59,752
That's okay, anyway,
when I woke up,

360
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:03,754
I was in Tokyo which is just
the most incredible city ever.

361
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:04,673
Before I meet my destiny,

362
00:22:04,673 --> 00:22:07,425
I'm gonna hit all the
shops in Harajuku first.

363
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:10,013
Watch me max out
the TAC's credit

364
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:12,140
in Blue Seed, Episode Three,

365
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
It's spring, it's the
capital, I'll do my best!

366
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,356
Oh and I gotta hit the
shops in Shibuya too,

367
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:22,440
I just don't wanna miss a thing.

368
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,540
("Touch and Go")
