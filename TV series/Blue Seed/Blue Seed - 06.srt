gun away from you.

is all my fault.

And if we need help,

175

I'm sure we can get
Kusanagi to give us a hand!

strawberry buns and persevere.

No one can feel bad
while eating these, okay?

Yes, I'll do it.

It's like a library in here.

My boy had such a glowing future

We put him in the
very best schools,

from kindergarten
through college,

you're finished with the tea,

you can leave.

I wonder if he's not
aggressive enough.

228
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:48,837
He was raised in a family
made only of women, you know,

just his two sisters and
I, but he's very bright.

I'm absolutely vital to the TAC!

491
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:47,891
- [Kushinada] The Aragami,

492
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,981
which have been trying to
kill me, the Kushinada,

493
00:21:50,854 --> 00:21:52,056
have launched a new offensive.

494
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,679
But now, a puzzling new mystery
has come up to the surface.

495
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:58,952
Mr. Kunikida, just what
is the Kushinada Project?

496
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,120
Because of this project,

497
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,330
a little girl who has nothing
to do with any of this

498
00:22:04,665 --> 00:22:05,666
is in terrible danger!

499
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:07,776
I can't forgive
something like this.

The next episode of
Blue Seed, I'm Fired Up!

501
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:14,035
I'll Do it Because
I'm the Kushinada!

502
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,822
And let me tell you,
I'm serious this time.

503
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,523
(mellow music)

504
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:32,025
(woman sings in
foreign language)
