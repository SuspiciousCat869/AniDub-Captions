do with me, doesn't it, sir?

Please tell her.

107

I've told you that you have
a twin sister, haven't I?

You mean Kaede, right?

109
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:11,187
Prior to the return
of the Aragami,

110
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:12,939
the Science and
Technology Agency

111
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,401
began a special
research project.

112
00:06:15,401 --> 00:06:18,237
Using Kaede, who was
then the Kushinada,

113
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,946
we tried to control the Aragami.

114
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,991
That was the Kushinada Project.

115
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,951
The TAC was given
total control of it.

116
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,037
We ran batteries
of tests on Kaede,

117
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:31,417
trying to determine what
made the Kushinadas unique.

118
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:33,419
In the process, we
accidentally discovered

119
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,003
that a particular
type of ceramic

120
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:38,382
could actually contain the
power of the Kushinada.

121
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:40,966
Utilizing this ceramic,
we hope to be able

122
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:42,177
to store the Kushinada's power

123
00:06:42,177 --> 00:06:44,430
for use as a weapon
against the Aragami.

124
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,892
Unfortunately, it can also
be used by the Aragami

125
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,992
to protect themselves
from the Kushinada.

126
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:57,522
Then somehow someone managed
to steal some of this substance

127
00:06:57,522 --> 00:07:00,987
without being noticed.

128
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,087
The next time we saw it was in
Izumo, where I first met you.

00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:10,815
(Momiji gasping)

130
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,291
A Ceramic Field?

131
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,501
Orochi said something about that

132
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,628
the first time I was attacked.

133
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:16,462
That's right.

134
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,422
So, Orochi stole this stuff?

135
00:07:18,422 --> 00:07:22,008
Perhaps, but there was no
evidence the Aragami took it.

136
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,762
It's far more likely that
someone in our organization

137
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:28,862
stole the ceramic and then
sold it to the Aragami.

138
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:31,016
An Aragami spy?

139
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,770
The government was
afraid that someone

140
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,020
would use the substance
for the wrong purpose.

141
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,023
So all of the data and remaining
samples were destroyed.

142
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,694
- [Kusanagi] Now
it all makes sense.

- [Momiji] Kusanagi!

144
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,322
I've been wondering
why the Aragami

145
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,532
haven't attacked you lately.

146
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,033
They must not have any of
that ceramic stuff left.

147
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,119
You were originally
on their side.

148
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,080
Do you have any idea
what the Aragami

149
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,375
are trying to do this time?

150
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,209
I don't know.

151
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,337
Listen, Momiji, don't even think

152

about getting involved
in this thing.

Huh?

00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,647
Got that?

163
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:17,063
Hold it!

164
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,774
You're the idiot, not me!

165
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,400
You stupid.

Hm?

169
00:08:26,657 --> 00:08:27,115
Huh?

170
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:31,077
The Chief Cabinet Secretary!

171
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,747
This situation worries me.

172
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,749
You know I cannot
allow the Kushinada

173
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,793
to be placed in
any sort of danger.

174
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,879
The Kushinada is our
trump card after all.

175
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,842
What about the girl?

176
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:47,553
Mr. Kunikida, please
keep a close eye

177
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:49,388
on the Kushinada's actions.

178
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:53,488
And don't let your
emotions carry you away.

179
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:57,102
I'll assign extra
detectives to this case.

180
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:57,896
Stand aside.

181
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:58,814
Let me through.

182
00:08:58,814 --> 00:09:00,399
It's all right, don't worry.

183
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,109
Your husband has always been
a vital part of this project.

184
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:07,112
I won't let them
abandon your daughter.

185
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:08,323
That's Congressman Miyahara,

186
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:12,117
one of the Kushinada
Project's top supporters.

187
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,118
No matter what they say,

188
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:15,120
the most important
thing is Yukiko's life.

189
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,791
Even if the data does get
revealed to the public,

190
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,376
the Aragami won't
defeat the TAC.

191
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:21,126
That's right!

192
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:24,965
I'll help you find her
no matter what happens.

193
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:25,966
Momiji.

194
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:26,717
I can't forgive this.

195
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,817
In order to get to me, they've
kidnapped an innocent child.

196
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:34,433
You're the Kushinada?

197
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,559
I'm so sorry this happened,

198
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,103
but no matter what happens
I'll find the culprits

199
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:42,203
and make sure you
get Yukiko back.

200
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:47,178
What a good girl, I trust you!

201
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:51,272
Um, thanks.

202
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:54,912
Man, this is gonna be a
real pain in the posterior.

203
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:57,498
After the Kushinada
project was shut down,

204
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,832
most of the staff were laid off

205
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,125
or transferred to new positions.

206
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:03,045
Are you sure Momiji's
got to meet all of them?

207
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:05,005
Her locator ability
is our best chance

208
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,633
of finding the Aragami
who kidnapped Yukiko.

209
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:08,801
- [Yaegashi] I
understand that but...

210
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:12,012
Mr. Yaegashi, this is the
best chance we've got.

211
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,848
Please, just tell
me where to go.

212
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,642
Sorry, ma'am.

213
00:10:16,642 --> 00:10:20,185
If you don't speed up,
she'll get really mad.

214
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,229
- [Yaegashi] Okay, okay.

215
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,187
The first name on the list

216
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:25,651
is Professor Akahori
at Touto University.

217
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:29,751
He's been with the university
since leaving the project.

218
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,368
Not him.

219
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,375
- [Yaegashi] The next
stop is the TV station.

220
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,460
Ms. Marukawa who was an
assistant on the project

221
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
is now an assistant professor
and television personality.

222
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:53,118
Huh?

223
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:53,846
Mm-mm.

224
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:55,931
- [Yaegashi] Next we have
the bacteriology department's

225
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,143
fair-haired boy,
Assistant Professor Satou.

226
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:01,061
He left the project
shortly after the theft

227
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:05,146
on grounds of incompatibility
with his coworkers.

- [Yaegashi] So, he
isn't one either?

No, it's not your fault.

It's because I was impatient.

and tell Momiji who's
next on the list.

Yes, sir.

who promoted the project.

258

The closest one to the hospital

259
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:38,004
is Congressman Miyahara's place.

260

Not the Congressman.

261

Momiji already
cleared him, right?

Right.

You've already
found the Aragami.

Now let us take care of our end.

That's an order
from your superior.

Congressman Miyahara
was pretty surprised

301
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,449
to learn that his own
secretary was an Aragami

302

but unfortunately we still
haven't found Yukiko yet.

Did you look everywhere?

We searched all over
Mr. Miyahara's house,

with his full cooperation.

But still once we
catch an Aragami,

00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,133
we ought to be able to
find her pretty quickly.

Maybe it's not an Aragami.

different this time,
