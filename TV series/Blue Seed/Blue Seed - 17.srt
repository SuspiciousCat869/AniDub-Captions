00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,160
I'm here to wipe the human race
from the face of the Earth.

329
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,444
Then this country will
become our kingdom,

330
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:48,928
the kingdom of the Aragami.

332
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,971
Not a very wise move, human.

333
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:53,687
(Kunikida groans)

334
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:54,896
- [Takeuchi] Daitetsu!

335
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:56,815
If you come any closer,

336
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:57,856
I'll kill you now.

337
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:00,859
Somebody, help me!

338
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,111
Is he going to be all right?

339
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:08,725
He's resting
comfortably in his room.

340
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,604
We will go into
the cave, won't we?

341
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,139
It's too dangerous to
go there unprepared.

342
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,107
I wonder what Susano-Oh
intends to do.

343
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,704
We don't know the details yet.

344
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,198
But I'm sure things will get
worse if we don't do something.

345
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:23,411
I guess we don't
have time to wait

346
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:24,883
for the boss to recover.

Oh.

350
00:17:30,391 --> 00:17:31,391
I'm still going with you.

351
00:17:32,393 --> 00:17:33,393
I'm still the boss.

352
00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:35,478
Don't be foolish.

353
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,059
Now you stay here and rest up.

354
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,981
We'll handle this one, sir.

355
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:46,989
Please take me with you.

356
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:50,348
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

357
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:52,328
I need to do something.

358
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:53,912
Anything.

359
00:17:54,914 --> 00:17:56,794
I've got to decide what
it is I have to protect,

360
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,397
and what it is that
I want to protect.

361
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,023
I thought you wanted
to protect Japan

362
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,727
and the rest of the
world from the Aragami?

363
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:05,924
Japan.

364
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,325
Where has the Japan
we dreamed about

365
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,638
when we were young gone?

366
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,211
Japan was what killed Yamatomai.

367
00:18:12,516 --> 00:18:14,677
Tell me the nature of the
Japan that I have to protect.

368
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,260
And Japan took my Kaede as well.

369
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,090
And everyone else
exploited the Earth

370
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:23,695
and contaminated the rivers.

371
00:18:23,862 --> 00:18:26,142
And all the while,
they pretended they
were being cautious.

372
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:28,947
Please stop it.

373
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,651
Why should we fight for Japan?

374
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,909
Why should we protect all
the dirty, murderous filth

375
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:34,705
that destroys the Earth?

376
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,698
Why should we protect the scum

377
00:18:36,956 --> 00:18:38,017
that attacked you in the alley?

378
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,761
Why are we the ones
that make the sacrifice?

379
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
Why should we risk
our lives for Japan?

380
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:44,715
It's better off dead.

381
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:46,965
The Aragami can have it.

382
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,011
You don't really mean that.

383
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:57,936
I'm sorry, Ryouko.

384
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,637
Something must be wrong with me.

385
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:05,984
No.

386
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:08,655
Nothing's wrong.

387

You've just been working
yourself too hard lately.

Huh?

Yes, Takeuchi here.

Kusanagi is missing.

Where is he?

The Cave of the Sun God.

All right, Murakumo.

Where is Susano-Oh?

397

Is Kaede here, too?

398
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,060
So, Kusanagi,

399
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:40,388
are you feeling better now
than you were earlier today?

400
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,021
What does that mean?

401
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,149
Kusanagi.

402
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,836
It means we have
completed the ceremony

for Lord Susano-Oh.

404

Kaede, why did you
help Susano-Oh?

Why did you leave us, Kaede?

What was that?

419

Because the Japan
that the Kushinada

was to protect has disappeared.
