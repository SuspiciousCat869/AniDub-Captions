That girl's not Masao.

Hi again!
Sorry about last time.

Number Two
didn't mean you any harm.

330
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,333
No. It was totally my fault.

331
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,250
So, uh,
could I get a T-shirt?

332
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,583
Mm-hmm, I don't think
it'll fit you, though,

How'd you know that?

[gasps]

Well, we meet a lot of fans,
so it's easy to guess!

00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,083
I see.

[TAKEO]
You see...

341
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,958
I used to have a kid
about your age.

342
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,583
But, uh. I wasn't
what you'd call the best dad.

343
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,000
I was so focused on myself,

344
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,791
I couldn't care
for my child properly.

345
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,250
I hope that your father
is a nice man.

Mm-hmm!

my father's really great!

He's the sweetest

I betcha I'd be better off
if I was like you

and didn't have any memories.

It's great you and your dad
met again.

I mean, if you didn't remember
each other then...

you wouldn't understand
your feelings.

what this familiar feeling is.

a single memory...
