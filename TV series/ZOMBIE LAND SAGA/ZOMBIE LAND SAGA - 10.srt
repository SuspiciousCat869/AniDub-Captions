Yeah, but figuring out how

to survive is more important.

This is bad.

Things have been super awkward
since yesterday on the mountain.

320
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:23,125
But our performance at Arpino
is right around the corner!

-[AI] Sakura.
-[SAKURA] At this rate,

322
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,666
we’ll be way under-rehearsed!

This isn’t a solo.

Let’s try again from the top.

[SAKURA]
It’s not my fault

-we’re out of sync.
-[AI scoffs]

While you guys were
goofing off out there,

00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,875
I was actually
practicing our dance!

334
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,583
Well, that was rude.

Well, I am a courtesan.

You’re here to dance?

[lightly chuckles]
I’m also trained as a geisha.

343

[KOTARO]
Not what I asked.

344
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,208
[YUGIRI] You sent all of us
into the mountains

345
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,708
hoping that Lady Sakura
would find some inner peace

346
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,375
before the concert.

347
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,708
Is that right?

348
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,541
[water pattering]

349
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,000
[KOTARO]
The beauty of a group

350
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,041
is that it makes up
for individual weaknesses,

351
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,541
resulting in greater
collective strength.

352
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,333
But if Sakura can’t see that,

353
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,041
what’s the point?

354
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,541
Indeed, sir.

355
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,416
But couldn’t you just tell her?

356
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,666
It’s something she needs
to learn for herself.

357
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,083
You’re different
with Lady Sakura.

358
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,583
She must be dear to you.

359
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:02,458
[scoffs]
I only care about saving Saga.

360
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,208
[YUGIRI]
And I have a soft spot for those

361
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,291
who can’t express themselves.

362
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:10,916
[KOTARO] Saga’s depopulation
problem is so exhausting.

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,375
Every time we
climb one mountain,

364
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,833
there’s a taller one.

365
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,208
And now, with this show,

366
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,458
it’s like we’re lost
in the wild.

367
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,791
Listen, I’ll be honest here...
I think she can do it.

That’s enough foolishness,
Lord Kotaro!

372
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,250
Mark my words.

373
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,291
That brave girl can do anything!

374
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,583
Uh, yeah, that’s what I just--

You should have
more faith in her! Hmph!

I just said I do.

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,083
You guys heard me, right?

379
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,541
[SAKURA groans] It just keeps
getting more complicated!

380
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,541
How can I make this right?

381
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:07,083
I mean, no matter what,
I want the concert to be great.

382
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:13,083
That venue might have some kind
of connection to my past,

383
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,666
and performing there
could be huge for us!

384
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,500
We have to do everything we can!

385
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,208
It’s okay!

386
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:21,958
I know I’m in the right here!

387
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,708
And after we put on a good show,
I’m sure they’ll understand!

388
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,958
[AI muffled] So, everybody knows
their positions now, right?

00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,750
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

390

whole thing from the beginning.

[SAKURA]
It’s funny.

Franchouchou from the outside.

[SAKI]
Let’s talk about this part.

397
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,791
Kinda feels like I’m standing
in one place for too long.

398
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,541
I see.

399
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,541
Oh you must mean the bit when
we’re across from each other?

400
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,125
-[SAKI] Yeah, exactly.
-[AI] Hmm.

401
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,416
[AI] Well, Arpino’s
a pretty big place.

402
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,250
Do you want to try spreading out
farther on the sides?

403
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,958
-Like, at this part?
-Ooh, good idea!

404
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,000
[AI] The extra space
would give me and Junko

405
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:29,041
more room to move, too.

406
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,541
[chuckles]
That sounds great.

407
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,791
Hey, if you want me to,

408
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,833
I could just switch positions
with Tae.

409
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,916
Oh, I get it.

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,333
Everyone moves around Sakura.

411
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,750
That sounds really interesting,
let’s do it!

412
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:44,291
[SAKI] I love it
when a plan comes together!

413
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,250
Let’s make sure we’ve
got it down so it’ll be easy...

414
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,875
[SAKURA] These guys
haven’t been rehearsing at all.

415
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,500
So how did they
get so in sync?

416
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,958
It must be because
they pulled together

417
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,291
to make the best
of those harsh conditions.

418

[SAKURA]
I’m sorry.

422
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,583
I’ve been thinking, and I see
now that I was being selfish.

423
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,083
Ever since I found out
about the Arpino show,

424
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,250
I’ve just been so worked up.

425
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:15,500
I started obsessing
over doing a great job

426
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,083
and making everything perfect.

427
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,500
But because of that,
I didn’t consider you guys.

428
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,333
I forgot about Franchouchou,

429
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,333
about our team.

430
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:27,916
Yeah, That explains it.

431
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,791
I thought you seemed
kinda hot under the collar.

432
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,208
[KOTARO] You still haven’t
figured it out?

[SAKURA]
Mr. Kotaro?

434
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,291
Think Nijinomatsubara.

435
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,250
A pine forest.

436

Pine as in alpine.

Alpine as in the Alps.

I have no idea what that means,

I’m going running!

Okay!

00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,000
[SAKURA] There’s one week left
before our big solo concert.

455
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,000
I’ve got all the songs
and dances memorized,

456
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,208
and we’re totally in sync!

457
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,583
So I’m beyond excited!

458
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,208
Plus, if I step onto that stage,

459
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
maybe I’ll remember
something important.

460
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:43,708
And then I’ll finally be able
to make peace with my past life!

I know my future will be full
