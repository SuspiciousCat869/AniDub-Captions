One more song!

317
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,000
Hey, you seem different.

318
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,000
-Are your memories back?
-Uh-huh.

319
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,958
[SAKURA] You guys, I'm really
sorry for how I acted.

320
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,541
It's fine!

321
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,166
[SAKI]
Damn! You kicked ass out there!

322
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,458
No wonder your moves
were so sharp!

323
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,500
It really was
an incredible performance!

324
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,458
[YUGIRI] Yes! And it's
so wonderful to have you back.

325
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,875
Hey, uh, listen, if you guys
don't mind having me

326
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,791
and all of my bad luck around,

327
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,000
could we go back
to the way things were?

328
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:56,875
-Don't be ridiculous, Sakura.
-Sure we can!

329
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,083
Thanks a lot.

330
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,958
[KOTARO]
Stop right there!

331
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,625
Jeez! It's like the finale of
some feel-good friendship show!

332
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,083
This ain't over yet,
ya dumb zombies!

333
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,750
You can't just
stand there and rot!

334
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,000
I mean, you haven't even
saved one square foot

335
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,666
of Saga prefecture!

336
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,666
They came for a concert and
that's what they're gonna get!

337
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,041
Your battle's only just begun,

338
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,125
so march your butts
back out there!

339

Go go g-go g-go go go!
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

340
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,833

342
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:30,250
[CROWD cheering, applause]

343
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,666
Hey, Saga!

344
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:34,333
Good morning!

345
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,875
Hey, there you are!

346
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,166
So, you happy with
these pictures we got?

347
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,833
-Uh, is something wrong?
-[grunts] Mm-hmm...

348
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:55,333
[OKOBA]
Now I'm more confused.

349
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:59,583
What the hell's going on
with these girls?
