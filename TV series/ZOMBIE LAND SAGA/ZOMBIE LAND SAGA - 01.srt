you're out of the grave!

168
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,333
That's all you need
to make a zombie, kiddo!

169
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,291
So got any more questions?

170
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,166
Uh. Several, actually.

171
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,458
Like, why's it so important
for me to be an idol?

172
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,958
Because you're
going to save Saga.

173
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,625
Just by singing and dancing?

174
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,333
Yes, that's right!

175
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,958
The concept of local celebrities
is becoming a thing of the past.

176
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:08,375
But, that also means most of
the competition's died out.

177
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,541
Our strategy is to capitalize
on that to revitalize Saga,

178
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,000
which is hurtling
toward irrelevance

179
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,708
in much the same way.

180
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,750
And boom!

181
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,916
Welcome to the Zombie Land
Saga Project, baby!

182
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,875
That's nice and all,

183
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,625
but I don't remember anything
from when I was alive.

184
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,625
So, asking me
to become a pop star

185
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:31,208
and save the whole prefecture
is kind of a big deal.

186
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,583
Not to worry!

187
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,666
The others have much more
baggage than you do.

188
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,875
Uh, so. Who are these girls?

189
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:39,833
Curious?

190
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,333
Well, yeah, sorta.

191
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,291
I mean, when someone's
bitten you 13 times in one day,

192
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,833
you start to wonder
stuff like that.

193
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,208
They are legends.

194
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,416
-Like, famous?
-Correct.

195
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,166
-[snarls]
-Uh...

196
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,291
Each girl is a unique
and shining star

197
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,708
I've hand-selected
for the mission

198
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,916
of saving the Saga prefecture.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,750
And with you, we've finally
assembled the perfect group!

200
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:04,708
Huh?

201
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,583
[KOTARO]
She conquered all of Kyushu

202
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:08,833
at the turn of the century

203
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,916
as the leader
of the Dorami biker gang!

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,583
Cower before
the legendary Saki Nikaido!

205
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,708
This girl singlehandedly
gave rise to the idol boom

206
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,083
of the 1980s!

207
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:22,583
The legendary Showa-period
idol, Junko Konno!

208
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,916
From the turbulent time
spanning the death

209
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,833
of the shogunate
into the Meiji era,

210
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,750
the legendary courtesan
known only as Yugiri!

211
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,500
After her debut
on a long-running period drama,

212
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,958
she left her mark on
every network in the nation!

213
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,166
Legendary child
actress prodigy Lily Hoshikawa!

214
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,708
After the year 2000,

215
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,666
when all the major idol groups
were at war,

216
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,833
she was the implacable center

217
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,875
for the number-one
group Iron Frill!

218
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,833
Legendary Heisei-period idol,
Ai Mizuno!

219
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,083
[SAKURA]
Wait, isn't she--?

220
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,041
[KOTARO]
The legendary Tae Yamada!

221
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,375
Huh?

222
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,958
And now you know
everything you need to know

223
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,083
about the rest of the girls!

224
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,583
[SAKURA]
Wait! Hang on a second!

225
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,500
-Hmm?
-Who's she--?

226
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,208
[KOTARO]
The legendary Tae Yamada!

227
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,500
Uh...

228
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,041
Sorry, I think
I missed something,

229
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,166
could you repeat that?
The legendary--

230
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,541
[KOTARO]
Tae Yamada!

231
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay. I know what her name is,
but is there more?

232
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,916
Does there need to be more?

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,125
[SAKURA]
But what's her legend--?

234
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,750
Who says a legend
has to be anything?

235
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,458
Oh yeah, that's right, nobody!

236
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,000
So she's just
a regular zombie--?

237
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,458
Well, what makes you
so legendary, huh, Sakura?

238
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,750
Not a damn thing!

239
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,333
From now on, I'll say they're
all legendary except you!

240
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,666
[whimpers]

241
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,000
[KOTARO]
Anyway, at this point,

242
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,375
they're all your stereotypical,

243
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,041
run-of-the-mill zombies.

244
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,000
They haven't yet awakened.

245
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:41,625
-That's a thing?
-Yes.

246
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,166
But I figure with a little
stimulation like you had,

247
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,541
they'll eventually regain
their consciousness.

248
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,833
Huh?

249
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,458
Stimulation?
What happened to me, anyway?

250
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,916
Speaking of which,
you girls are going to put on

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,666
a stimulating
live performance!

252

[SAKURA]
This is a death metal concert!

265
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:52,666
It's the only place
with an open stage policy.

266

[SAKURA]
We shouldn't be here!

it'll be impossible to

you went and passed out
as soon as I tried it on you.

I think it should be obvious
by now that I don't!

Chill out.
What's the big deal?

Chill out?

How am I supposed
to "chill out," huh?

All I need you to do
is trust in your instincts.

Well, my instincts say
Tae's gonna bite people.

303

A zombie bite
never hurt anybody.

Okay!

The good news is,
this crowd doesn't know you,

00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,916
so the expectations
are so small,
