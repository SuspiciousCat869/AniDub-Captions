00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,000
Turns out she had some kind of
big scare last night.

486
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,833
The shock's
caused her to forget

487
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,958
everything that happened
yesterday.

488
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,041
Yikes.

489
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,916
[SAKURA whimpers]

490
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,791
You better be glad you're dead.

491
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,166
-[SAKURA crying]
-They say there's no bad press,

492
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,583
but this is bad.

493
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,041
Who would publish that crap?

494
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,291
Let's go kick their asses!

495
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,333
Sorry, it's all my fault.

496
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,583
Don't worry, I promise I'll be
a lot more careful from now on.

497
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,166
There, there.

498
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,666
At least we got the chance
to enjoy

499
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,500
that luxurious foot bath
together.

500
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:21,375
[YUGIRI] I've never had
a communal experience like that.

501
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,625
I think it was
a worthwhile journey!

502
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,708
We had fun!

503
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,416
I bet the better
we all get along,

504
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,875
the better we'll be on stage!

505
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,208
Do you think so?

506
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,083
Hope you're right.

507
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,125
And another benefit.

508
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,250
No more fatigue,
thanks to these.

509
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,666
The old school chick is right!

510
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,958
Next time, we'll nail it!

511
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,958
-'Kay!
-Yeah!

512
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,416
Starting now, we bust
our ass and get paid!

513
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,375
[ALL]
Yeah!

514
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,750
You know that's not going to
solve all our problems, right?

515
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,166
[stretching, groaning]

516
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,250
Ahh!

517
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,750
[ALL laughing]

518
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,125
[ROMERO howls]

519
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:00,375
[ROMERO barks]

520
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,041
Yugiri speaking.

521
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,625
The seven of us are now working
toward a common goal.

522
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,375
Isn't that a noble ideal?

523
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,125
Next time on Zombie Land
Saga, episode five:

524
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,375
"The Nice Bird
SAGA in Your Heart".

525
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,208
We hope you'll join us.
