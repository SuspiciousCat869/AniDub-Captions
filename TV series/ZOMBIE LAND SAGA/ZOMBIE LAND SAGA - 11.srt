Last time on Zombie Land Saga!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,958
We found out we're doing a show
for 500 people!

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,750
And once I realized it
might bring back

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,000
some memories of my past,

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,458
I got super hyped about it!

6
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,625
But then, Kotaro decided
to have us train

7
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:19,875
in the mountains
for some reason?

8
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,708
And I may have gotten
a little upset

9
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:24,958
that everyone was focusing on
survival instead of rehearsal.

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,708
But then, I learned
a valuable lesson

11
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:28,333
when I realized that
working together like that

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,583
made them way more
in sync as performers!

13
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,708
Turns out, I was the one
who lost my head, literally!

14
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,041
And just when I decided
it was better

15
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:36,875
to put that energy
into being a good friend

16
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,708
and working toward the future,
a truck flew by out of nowhere

17
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,208
and knocked the hype
right out of me!

00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,291
So, it's better
if I don't try at all.

323
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,041
I dunno, I guess it's because
I've never really thought

324
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,750
of mistakes or failures
as being a bad thing.

325
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:54,041
They always end up helping you
with whatever happens next.

326
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,916
And if I want to be
the best version of me,

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,791
then I'll just have to find
a way to overcome

328
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,458
any hurdles, ya know?

332
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,708
I was trying my best.

333
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,875
And just when I thought
my bad luck would change,

334
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,666
I died and came back
as a zombie.

335
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,583
Am I cursed or something?

[COP] Hey, what are you doing
out so late, young lady?

Are you trying to get arrested,
‘cause I'll arrest ya!

00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,750
Did you run away from home
or something?

339

What gives, miss?

340
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,625
What's the difference?

I'm sorry.

What are you trying to show me?

Nijinomatsubara.

[SAKURA]
Yeah, I know, the forest, but...

355
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,708
it's too dark out
to see anything.

[KOTARO] There are bright points
all around you.

Saga may be small,

00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,958
but there's a person
for every light you see.

00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,958
[SAKURA] Uh, what are you
getting at here?

361
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,583
[KOTARO] Just like
they're waiting for the sun

362
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,666
to rise over Nijinomatsubara,
there are people out there

waiting for you
to shine as an idol.

-[SAKURA gasps]
-Two or three, at least.

Just do your concert
without me, okay?

366
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,541
I'm sure it'll be much better
if I stay far away from it.

I know I don't have
what it takes.

368

So, you really don't want
to be an idol, then?

00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,083
Can you look into my eyes
and tell me that honestly?

I want to be just like Ai!

She's so strong and confident!

[SAKURA] I wonder if I'll

This is it.
I'm gonna try one more time!

I can't be afraid
to give it my best!

And look at how well
that turned out.

381
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,333
I should've known I'd fail at
that, just like everything else.

382
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,041
That the best choice
was to give in,

383
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,625
but I was stupid and got
my hopes up about being an idol,

384
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,458
so I rushed out of the house
earlier than usual,

385
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,041
and then boom, dead.

386
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,750
That's just who I am.

387
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,458
[KOTARO]
But you came back to life,

388
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,500
as an idol who can save Saga.

389
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,750
[SAKURA] What makes you
think that'll happen?

390
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,125
And why me?

391
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,750
I mean, I never asked
to become a zombie!

392
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,625
One day, you'll understand
all of those things.

393
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,041
Don't give me hope!

394
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,541
Hope is what got me killed
in the first place!

395
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,458
How bad can
one person's luck be?

396

If you want to do this idol
thing, then go right ahead,

397

but leave me out of it!

I just... don't want to be
dragged into this, okay?

00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,875
Well, all right.

400
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,000
Then go wherever you want!

your life this way--

in the matter,

I would've never come back
in the first place.

did you really think

go on all night long?

what it takes is irrelevant,

because I do, got it?

is good stuff!

have, all right?
