[SAKURA]
Last time on Zombie Land Saga,

2
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,916
the others woke up and started
acting like people again!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,375
Then, it was time for us
to start our idol activities!

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,791
Or it would have been,

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,500
but nobody really felt
like singing and dancing.

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,541
Then, there was some drama,
which made Ai and Junko realize

7
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,583
how tough the streets
could be for a zombie.

8
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,583
It was mostly just people
getting mad at me!

9
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,916
But it all turned out okay,
because that gave me the courage

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,250
to step up to the mic
and spit some hot fire!

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,875
And that's how we took
our first step

12
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,208
to becoming a real idol group!

13
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,250
Uh...if you can call us that.

14
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,958
All right! Good morning again
to all you lovely ladies!

15
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,833
[groans]

16
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,958
[TAE continues to groan]

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,333
A good morning to you.

18
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:47,250
I said: good morning to you.

19
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,958
Don't get in her face!

20
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,375
You're gonna freak her out!

21
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,541
[KOTARO]
Straight to business, then.

22
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,833
Clearly, diving into
that Saga Castle show

23
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,041
prematurely was reckless.

24
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,375
So, I'm going to be blunt.

25
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,250
-You girls...
-Huh?

26
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,416
...were absolutely wonderful!

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,708
[ALL surprised]

28
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,291
You somehow managed
to keep your rotten,

29
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,875
little secret under wraps,

30
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,125
all the while playing hot potato
with a disembodied head!

31
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,958
Now that is team spirit!

32
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,791
Your bodies may fall apart,
but your hearts stick together!

33
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:20,041
Which is why I will now bestow

34
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:22,875
my most enthusiastic clapping
upon each one of you.

35
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,625
Feel free to join in and applaud
your fellow decaying flesh-piles

36
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,416
on a successful
zombie-ing endeavor!

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,583
Nice zombie-ing!

38
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,375
-And another thing, Sakura!
-Sir?

39
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,708
[rapping]
Girl, you got the beat.

40
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,500
Uh-huh. Those raps were neat.

41
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:36,208
Yeah. You brought
the heat! Fool.

42
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,416
[chuckles]
Uh...uh, yeah!

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,833
But don't you dare
go getting cocky!

44
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,000

[KOTARO]
Now that your show's over,

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,875
you think it's all
happy-party-fun-time?

48
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,916
Do not lose sight
of our main objective!

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,833
Snap those necks back around
to what's in front of you!

50
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:57,708
Just because you're dead
doesn't mean

51
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,333
you can take
your sweet time and relax.

52
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:03,750
The next task I want you
crumbling corpses to tackle

53
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:07,291
is...one of these.

-[SAKURA] Guerrilla?
-[LILY] He couldn't spell it.

56
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:22,791
Do forgive me, but what is
a guerrilla performance?

57
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,708
Um. You put on a show in public
and don't tell anyone about it.

58
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,500
So, it's like a fun,
surprise type-thing.

59
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,958
Oh. Like testing your sword
on a passerby.

60
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,875
[SAKURA laughs]

61
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,666
Wait, but if we do
a street concert,

62
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,416
won't the police
come after us again?

[JUNKO gasps]

64
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,916
Not to worry!

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,583
As long as you hide
your gross faces with makeup,

66
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,625
you'll all just get
a slap on the wrist.

[SAKI]
Don't be such a wimp, Sakura!

69
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,125
We can't just let the pigs
ruin our rally, right?

70
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:53,166
And you won't be able
to freestyle

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,333
your way out of it this time.

72
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,333
I'll make sure you're all pretty
and cute and perfect,

73
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,208
the way an idol group should be!

74
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,291
I'll teach you!

75
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,208
-One thing.
-[TAE moans]

76

-Yes, Junko?
-It's just...

77
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,458
I've done plenty
of solo concerts,

78
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,125
but I've never been part
of a group before,

79
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,416
-so I'm uh--
-A loner!

80
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,958
A loner?

Uh-huh!
You're a lonely little loser!

82
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,291
Anyway, the performance
will be tomorrow morning,

83
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,500
in the plaza by Karatsu Station!

84
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,041
[SAKURA, AI and JUNKO]
Tomorrow?!

85
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,375
We can't learn a whole song
and the choreography

86
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,875
with just one practice day!

87
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:28,083
Guess you'll have to pull
an all-nighter, then.

88
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,250
I mean, what are you gonna do,
die from lack of sleep?

[SAKI] Damn, I had no idea
how much crap

91
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,958
you're s'posed to memorize
when you're an idol!

92
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,708
[SAKURA] Yeah, but learning
new things is good for you.

[LILY]
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

94
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,833

What's with the racket, squirt?

95
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,833
My name's not squirt!

96
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,208

of stage and screen!

Did you want to say something?

99
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,291
Before we practice, I think
we should pick a leader!

100
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,625
[SAKURA]
Leader?

101
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,416
Yeah! Somebody's gotta
be in charge of us!

102
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,291
That way, there's always someone
to make the tough decisions!

103
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,958
In that case...
I think it would be a good idea

104
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,083
for one of our more
experienced idols to be the--

105

00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,875
[yelling]
I'm the first captain of Dorami,

110
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:01,250
the legendary all-female biker
gang from Saga prefecture!

111
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,500
The name is Saki Nikaido!

112
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:08,458
I did a damn good job bossin'
all those biker chicks around,

-I pick me!
-Jeez, we heard ya.

116
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,666
[SAKI] Who wants to fight me
for captain?

117
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,333
[SAKURA]
Looks like it's just you.

118

Aw yeah!

We're coming to get you, Japan.
Y' wanna start with Kyushu?

120
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,083
[SAKURA]
It's "leader," not "captain,"

121
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,541
this isn't a biker gang.

122

[LILY]
Leader!

123
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,250
We need a group name!

124
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,250
Huh? We don't have one?

125
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,791
You mean like "Death Musume"
and "Green Face"?

126
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,250
None of Tatsumi's dumb ideas
are idol-y enough!

127
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,000
-That's a good point.
-How about this one?

128
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,125
We could be "Magical Cutie Lily
and the Lily-ettes!"

That's a lot of Lily.

131
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,458
I'm not gonna spend eternity

132

with a kiddy-ass
group name like that!

somethin' more like this...

[SAKURA]
Could you read that out loud?

-Says "Joan of Arc!"
-Does it?

136
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,125
I think it has
a noble ring to it.

137

You do?

138
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,958
[SAKI]
She gets what I'm talkin' about!

139
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,416
However, perhaps
this would serve us.

"The Mibu Wolves?"

to be called something cuter!

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,208
-Because I said so.
-Well, let me think here.

159
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,833
-Oh, how about Framboise?
-Aw, that's really cute!

160
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,041
[SAKI]
Framba-what now?

161
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,125
That's kinda hard to read.

162
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,416
[SAKI] A badass logo
is half the battle!

163
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,083
You took a cute word
and made it look stinky.

164
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,583
Well, we are dead, so I'm sure
we do have a terrible stench.

165
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,916
-[ALL gasping]
-[TAE groans]

[ALL laughing]

168
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,958
Let's get back
to that group name!

169
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:36,541
-Any more?
-[SAKI] I bet Sakura's got some.

170
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,666
Uh, let's see.
How does Franchise sound?

171
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,750
Not that, but it should
be something French.

172
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,208
French Bread, French Fries,
French Toast?

173
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,416
What else is from France?
Cream puffs?

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,208
-[TAE sneezes]
-[ALL gasp]

175
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,291
[LILY]
Ew, she's all inky!

176
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,041
She's sneezing from the marker?

177
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,625
[TAE sneezes]

178
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,916
-You okay, Tae?
-[LILY gasps]

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,041
I get it now!

180
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:01,083
-[SAKI] Huh?
-Am I missing something here?

181
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,666
[LILY] I don’t think Tae
was just sneezing.

182
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,041
Really?

183
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,666
[LILY] I mean, she is,
but it's more than that!

184
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,416
[TAE sneezes]

185
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,958
You see? We needed a new name,
and she picked the perfect one!

186
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,458
[ALL]
Hmm?

187
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,833
Franchouchou! Doesn't it sound
so pretty and cool?

188
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,041
Franchouchou?

189
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,041
Yeah, you like it?

190
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,125
Franchouchou.

191
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,916
Franchouchou?

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,625
-[JUNKO] Uh...
-[AI groans]

193
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,083
[SAKI]
Y'know, I don't hate it!

194
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,166
Indeed!
It is quite an elegant name.

195
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,666
So cute, right?

196
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,500
It's way better than
what he came up with!

197
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,666
[SAKURA]
Franchouchou...

198
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,083
Wow, the more you say it,
the more adorable it sounds!

199
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,375
You did a great job, Tae!

200
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,833
[groans]

201
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,000
[SAKI]
Franchouchou...

202
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,791
Yup, looks good to me!

203
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,291
[SAKURA]
Don't write it like that!

204
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,416
[SAKI] Have it your way.
All right, it's official!

205
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,791
From now on, the seven of us
are gonna be called

206
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,208
Franchouchou!

207
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,416
[LILY]
Now, we just need to actually

208
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,125
learn the song for tomorrow!

209
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,500
[SAKURA giggles]
Right!

210
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,000
Sweet! Here we go,
Franchouchou!

211
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,916
It's time to practice
till our butts fall off!

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,750
Ya ready?

213
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,708
[ALL]
Yeah!

214
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,166
[LILY]
I don't think we can do this.

215
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,250
[SAKI]
It's way too hard.

216
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,416
I thought I was
starting to understand

217
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,583
but singing and dancing
are way tougher than I thought.

218
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,333
[TAE moans]

219
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:26,250
-If we blow it, we're done for.
-There's just not enough time.

220
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,833
[SAKURA]
Ai and Junko are the only ones

221
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,583
who know what they're doing.

222
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,875
[TAE grunting]

223
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,791
Uh...uh, Tae?

224
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,416
[SAKURA] We haven't even pulled
it off once during practice,

225
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,083
and tomorrow
we'll have an audience!

226
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,500
[TAE grunting quickly]

227
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,416
We're about to get thrown off!

228
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,958
I don't wanna!

229
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,416
[SAKURA] We should've
thought about this logically.

230
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,541
Being zombies is crazy enough,
but zombie idols?

231
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,958
[TAE panting]

232
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,291
-[LILY] Sakura!
-[SAKI] Get off that thing, now!

233
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,041
[SAKURA] Still, though,
I have to see this through!

234
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,458
I want to relive that feeling
I had the first time

235
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,916
I was on stage,
and figure out what it was!

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,583
[TAE panting rapidly]

237
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,583
Ahh!

238
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,375
[gasps]

[crunch]

241
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,250
[SAKI]
Sakura!

242
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,041
[LILY]
Are you okay?

243
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,125
[SAKURA] I'm going back in
so I can practice some more!

244
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,791
-[SAKI] Whoa.
-Saki. Lily. Tae...

245
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,458
Even though we're zombies now,
as long as everybody works hard,

246
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,666
I know we have a chance
to achieve our--

247

[slap echoing]

248

[gasps]

249
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,666
[SAKI gasps]

250
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,916
Mm.

251
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,291
Shame on you!

252
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,416
Whatever happened to practicing?

253
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,208
I'm confident that even
though we're zombies now,

254
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,666
if we work hard,

255
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,250
it'll be possible for us
to achieve our mission!

256
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,416
Um. That's what
I was about to--

257
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,291
[SAKI] Yugiri's right. We don't
need your negativity.

258
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,875
But...

259
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,583
Yeah, she knew just what to say
to get us all motivated!

260
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,250
Cool...

261
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,833
[JUNKO]
They've been gone a while...

262
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,500
[AI sighs]

263
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,833
[JUNKO] Yugiri was supposed
to bring the girls back here.

264
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,666
Do you think they gave up?

265
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,208
[JUNKO] I think it might
be better if they did.

266
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,416
You can't pull off an idol
performance overnight.

267
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,000
Besides...

268
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,458
If the show doesn't go well,

269
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,625
then the audience
won't have a good time.

270
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:39,500
If it's from the heart,
they'll still appreciate it.

271
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,458
[AI]
But that's if.

272
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,416
[SAKI]
All right, let's get crackin'!

273
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,333
[SAKI] We're gonna put on
a damn good show tomorrow!

274
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,958
[ALL]
Yeah!

275
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,250
[SAKURA] One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, and four and

276
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,250
One, two, three, four! One...

00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,458
Ahh!

278
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,708
[SAKURA]
One, two, three, four! One, two-

279
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,250
Oh, Lily! Are you hurt?

280
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,500
[LILY] The steps for this part
are so tricky!

281
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,583
-Then try dancin' better!
-Wow, thanks for the tip!

282
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,541
Stop bickering,
both of you!

283
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,791
[SAKURA gasps]

284
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,041
Sorry...

285
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,000
Well...

286
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,708
I think we should keep
practicin', with or without 'em.

287
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,666
Come on, girls, let's try again!
I'll start the song!

00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,541
[JUNKO gasps]

289
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,791
-[AI] What?
-[KOTARO] If you don't dance,

290
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,333
then you're just plain
old zombies.

291
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,291
Being an idol is hard!
You don't understand!

292
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,458
Oh, cry me a river.

293
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,416
I'm telling you,
there's no way this'll work!

294
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,333
Is that what you
honestly believe?

295
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:06,291
[gasps]

296
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,333
Trust me, I know.

297
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,875
[KOTARO] Then why were you
two idols when you were alive?

298
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,500
You're dead, but at least
the others are trying to live.

299
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,333
Will you join them, or would
you rather just sit and rot?

300
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,625
Okay, is everybody ready?

301
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,750
Starting now, you're
a guerrilla squadron.

302
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,625
Boldly prowling through
the ruthless concrete jungle.

303
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,833
This train station
is your battleground

304
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,875
where you will unleash
confusion and wonderment

305
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,291
upon the passersby,
so as to claim victory!

306
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,166
All right ladies,
time's a-wastin'.

307
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,833
Go go go go go go
go go go!

308
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,833
-[LILY] Showtime!
-Go, go, go...

309
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,416
[KOTARO]
Let's go!

310
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,500
[sighs]

311
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,375
-Ai. Junko.
-[SAKI] Sakura.

312
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,583
I guess the show'll have
to go on without them.

313
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:50,416
Okay. This is our chance to make
those practice hours count!

314
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,291
Uh...hey everybody,
we're Franchouchou!

315
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,500
We worked hard on this,

316
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,583
-so we hope you like it!
-[CROWD] Huh?

317
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,416
[MAN]
Okay...

318
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,958
[WOMAN] Hey, look! Is she
singing with squid in her mouth?

319
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,208
[MAN]
Whoa, she is! But why?

320
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,333
I wonder how
everyone is feeling.

321
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,000
I think they're okay.

322
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:25,916
Ah!

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,250
Oh no!

324
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,875
What? Don't stop singing,
you idiot!

325
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,250
-[SAKURA] You okay?
-[LILY] Sorry. I didn't mean to.

326
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,541
[SAKURA]
I didn't rehearse enough.

327
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,666
[SAKI] Whoops!

328
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,166
Stay calm!

329
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,125
[SAKURA]
We can do it, guys!

330
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:01,916
[SAKURA] For now, all we need to
do is put our hearts into this

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,083
and try our hardest!

332
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:10,750
Here we go.
Time for the final verse!

333
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,375
[SAKURA] Oh no.
What are the words again?

334
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:22,333
I forgot! What do I do?
Come on, brain!

335
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,875
Please don't do this to me!

336
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,708
[SAKURA gasps]

337
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,041
[SAKURA]
That girl.

338
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,500
She's having a blast!

339
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,750
-Look at her smile!
-[FAN GIRL giggles]

340
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,416
[ALL panting]

341
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,625
[SAKURA] Is it over?

342
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:55,708
-[AI] We should sign off.
-[SAKI] Yeah!

343
00:19:57,458 --> 00:20:00,125
[SAKI]
Anyway, uh. We're Franchouchou!

344
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,041
[FAN GIRL giggling, clapping]

345
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,125
Thanks a lot.

346
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,625
We'll put on a better show
next time, I promise!

347
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:14,083
-I'll see ya then!
-[FAN GIRL'S MOM] There you are!

348
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,083
Let's go.

349
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,666
That was fun!

350
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,833
Well, that coulda gone a hell
of a lot better, huh?

351
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,750
[MALE COP]
Hold it right there, ladies!

352
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,041
[ALL gasp]

353
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,125
Hate to tell ya,

354
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,000
but you can't do
street shows without a permit!

355
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,041
What are you tryin' to do here,
get arrested?

356
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,666
Because I will arrest ya!
You'll never take me alive!

357
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,166
[YUGIRI]
No, Lady Saki,

358
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,708
-now isn't the time!
-[LILY] Yeah, you're the leader!

359
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:49,125
Um, sorry, officer,
we'll leave right away!

360
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,208
Hey. You look familiar.

361
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,333
-Huh? Me? Uh, no I don't!
-[tires screech]

362
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,875
-Get inside the van! Go! Go! Go!
-Oh, wow! That guy's weird!

363
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,583
[YUGIRI]
Farewell, then!

364
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,041
Go, go, go, go, go!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

365
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Go, go, go!
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

366
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:11,625
-Okay, go! Go, go! Go! Go!
-[breaks screeching]

367
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,458
She seemed really jumpy.

368
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,250
Guess I musta poured
on too much of the ol' charm!

369
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,791
[JUNKO] We still ended up
performing, huh?

370
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:37,625
Hey guys, can we talk?
Thank you. Really.

371
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,083
If it hadn't been for you,

372
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,000
nobody would have stayed
through the whole song.

373
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,708
That all?

374
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,708
Both of you did an amazing job,
you totally saved the show!

375
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,875
It made me feel like
the rest of us

376
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,708
might not ever make it
as idols without you.

377
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,500
[BOTH groan uneasily]

378
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,083
No, wait!

379
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,458
I mean, because of that,
I want to practice even harder!

380
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,000
[SAKURA] I know we might not be
real idols yet,

381
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,458
and we're zombies too,

382
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:08,833
which just makes everything
that much trickier.

383
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,208
But I'll give it my very best,
and if each of us does that,

384
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,875
then despite
what we're up against,

385
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,916
I'm sure Franchouchou can become
something really incredible

386
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,916
in the future!
I think that's how we all feel.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,791
[ROMERO panting]

388
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,333
[ROMERO barks]

389
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,750
[SAKURA]
Have a good night!

390
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:45,500
You know,
today was a total disaster.

391
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,375
But performing with everyone,

392
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,625
felt so much better
than I ever thought it would.

393
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,750
[JUNKO]
You were great, too.

394
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,833
Well, this is it.

395
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:22,958
We're starting over
from scratch.

396
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,625
Junko here.
Singing is my greatest passion.

397
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,750
Is this my chance
to return to the stage

398
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,833
and feel the glow
of the spotlight?

399
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:45,541
Next time on Zombie Land Saga,
Episode 4: "Warming Dead Saga."

400
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,083
Hope you like it.
