After screwing up
our first paid job,

3
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:13,500
we got not one,
but two more chances to shine!

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:14,916
First, we starred
in a commercial

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,125
for Drive-In Tori
and worked our tail feathers off

6
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:19,083
to try and cluck up
some quick bucks!

7

The next step in our quest
for press

8
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,375
was competing
in the Gatalympics!

But instead of getting
a taste of fame,

10
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,791
we just got a mouthful of mud!

Chicken and mud?

12
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,416
Those must be the ingredients
for success!

For one day,

483
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,500
Saga will be the center
of the music world,

484
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,708
and you need to stand
as the center of Saga!

485
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,166
This is Franchouchou’s

486
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,666
-first outdoor show.

487
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,000
Your music will light up the sky
and shake the Earth!

488
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,500
Junko here.

489
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,291
If I’m gonna be
in everybody’s way,

490
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:39,541
I might as well turn into
a big, stupid mushroom.

491
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,208
Next time on Zombieland Saga,

492
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,000
episode 7:

493
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,791
“But It’s Zombiemental Saga”.

494
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:46,416
I’ll go away now.
