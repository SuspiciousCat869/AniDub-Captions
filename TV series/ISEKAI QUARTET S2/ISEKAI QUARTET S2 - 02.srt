1
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:15,608
The only think I
want is a drink!

2
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:48,067
Gotta be honest with you.

3
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,692
Life's really not
all that bad here.

4
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:53,150
But it'd be way better with
some of the good stuff.

5
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:54,317
Damn right.

6
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,150
Yes indeed.
Wouldn't mind some of that.

7
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,608
[NUEMANN]
Yep.

8
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:02,233
Too bad, can't buy it in
this world. We already tried.

9
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:04,067
You want the potion that
makes you feel warm

10
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,733
and forget all your troubles?

11
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,650
[KOENIG] No. I don't
think that's the one.

12
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,317
[TOUGH GUY laughs]

13
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,775
I couldn't really
figure out what the hell

14
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:12,192
they actually sold there.

15
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,567
[KOENIG sighs] But still,
there's gotta be some way.

16
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,400
Hey, Lieutenant, good news sir.

17
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:19,775
I was able to locate
some nearby.

18
00:02:19,858 --> 00:02:21,483
[NUEMANN]
Oh yeah, where?

19
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:25,192
Get this. Here, at school.

20
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,650
I saw it in the principal's
office the other day.

21
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:30,442
[ROSWAAL]
You're quite the busy bee.

22
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,608
[KURT] I'll be indisposed
for the next two days.

23
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:35,525
But I'll be back here
the day after tomorrow.

24
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:38,108
[ROSWAAL]
We'll be waiting for you.

25
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,317
[KOENIG]
Was it the red stuff?

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,442
[GRANTZ] Yep, that's what
it was, alright.

27
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:43,400
We know the principal
was drinking it,

28
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:45,900
so we can assume that he
keeps it in his office.

29
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,775
[GRANTZ]
It's a safe bet.

30
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:49,900
What's more, he'll be
away on business.

31
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:51,900
That'll put him out for the
whole day tomorrow.

32
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,525
[KOENIG]
Huh?

33
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,567
Well, what do you think
we should do?

34
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,108
You know the answer
to that, don't you?

35
00:02:58,192 --> 00:02:59,692
[NUEMANN]
Preach it.

36
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:03,567
[KAZUMA] Okay, then we need to
start getting our plan together.

37
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,525
[DEMIURGE] It seems that
you're abandoning your duties

38
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:08,067
as a teacher. Freedom should
be granted as a reward

39
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,233
for talent and
responsibility.

40
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:11,775
Well, that sounds
exactly like what a

41
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,567
black-hearted demon would say.

42
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,775
As an individual, I have the
right to exercise my freedom.

43
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:18,317
Including the
right to do wrong.

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,817
[DEMIURGE] I have no interest
in the rights of fools.

45
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,817
That kind of thinking only
leads to destruction.

46
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,025
Perfect!

47
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,525
That's just what I want!
Give me destruction!

48
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,817
Oops, uh, seems we're
out of time.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,192
That'll be all
for today, class.

50
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:38,358
[KOENIG] Okay, let's kick
this plan into action.

51
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:41,400
Using my "stealth" skill,
we can sneak inside.

52
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,400
Nice.

53
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,442
Here we go.

54
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:45,233
[AQUA] Hey, what are
guys you up to?

55
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:46,692
[KAZUMA]
Ugh! Aqua!

56
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,108
Why'd you say "ugh?"

57
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:49,858
Look, I know you're doing
something that you're not

58
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,317
supposed to, so I wanted to see
if it seemed like an exciting

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,942
adventure or just really stupid.

60
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,275
That's the principal's office,

61
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,025
now tell me what
you're doing here?

62
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:59,233
[GRANTZ] I found out he has
some of the red stuff in there,

63
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:01,025
and, heh,  we're gonna take it.

64
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,025
[KAZUMA]
You idiot! Why'd you tell her?

65
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:04,692
Red stuff? The red stuff?

66
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:06,025
[KAZUMA sighs]

67
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,442
Uh. Should I have kept
my mouth shut?

68
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,858
She doesn't have a problem
with us drinking, does she?

69
00:04:10,942 --> 00:04:13,108
That's not really
the issue, no.

70
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,733
I've been looking
for the bubbly stuff,

71
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,650
but I've had absolutely no
luck finding it anywhere.

72
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,733
So, if there is
red stuff in there.

73
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,608
I'm more than willing
to settle for that.

74
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,108
Let's go inside and take it.

75
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:24,192
You're in luck, guys!

76
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,358
The Water Goddess,
Aqua, is with you.

77
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:28,400
I'm willing to help
any way I can!

78
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:29,775
She's actually cool!

79
00:04:29,858 --> 00:04:31,983
Aw man, you have no
idea how much harder

80
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,400
this mission just got.

81
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,817
Why would that be?

82
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,692
[KAZUMA]
Because... her luck sucks shit.

83
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:38,317
[KOENIG]
Really?

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,525
Huh?

85
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:44,817
[KAZUMA]
And just like that we're in.

86
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,317
So, anybody know where it is?

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,858
[KOENIG] I think it's
in that cabinet there.

88
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:51,358
[AQUA]
Oh, lemme see.

89
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,608
Yep, right there for the taking!

90
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:56,442
[KAZUMA] Geez, do you ever
think before you act?

91
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:59,067
[AQUA]
Jackpot! Looks high quality!

92
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,400
[KAZUMA]
No! Don't touch it!

93
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:03,858
[alarms blaring]

94
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:06,983
[KURT]
You impudent fools!

95
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:09,483
[BOTH gasp]

96
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,608
What's happening?

97
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,025
It's a trap!

98
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:15,775
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?!

99
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,400
[NUEMANN sighs]

100
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,900
This doesn't bode
well for us, huh?

101
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,692
Oh man, that could
cut something off.

102
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:28,775
Ya think?

103
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,108
Damn, Aqua!

104
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,942
This is why you gotta
use your brain, you know?

105
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,567
[AQUA]
Hey, back off!

106
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,525
Besides, how would my brain have
known that there was a trap?

107
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,108
[KOENIG]
It's not just you.

108
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,192
This peacetime has
dulled our instincts.

109
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:42,400
If the battalion commander
finds out about this,

110
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:45,317
she'll have our heads!
Or at least yell as us.

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,817
Yeah.

112
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,817
She'll dress us down till
we're sniveling diaper babies.

113
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,275
Again...

114
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:53,608
Anyway, it's scary in here,
so let's find our way out!

115
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:56,692
Look, the entrance is clear.
We need to head that way.

116
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,817
[KAZUMA]
Was there always a door there?

117
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,733
[NUEMANN]
No.

118
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,983
[AQUA]
Huh?

119
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:04,358
No, it didn't exist before.
Must be a decoy!

120
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:07,983
[AQUA yelps]

121
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,650
Kazuma! Monster! It's a monster!

122
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:14,150
Geez, Aqua. Your memory sucks.

123
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:15,525
[KAZUMA, AQUA gasp]

124
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,567
[KOENIG gasps]

125
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,067
[NUEMANN]
Easy!

126
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,317
[GRANTZ grunts]

127
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:24,608
[KOENIG]
And... we're done.

128
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:26,442
I believe every
last trap in here

129
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:28,358
has been successfully disarmed.

130
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,608
Now all we gotta do is
slip outta this room

131
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,900
and into a tall glass of
this red stuff, right?

132
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,817
Hell yeah!

133
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,108
Something wrong?

134
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,108
[KAZUMA]
Hm. This artwork.

135
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,400
[KOENIG]
What about it?

136
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,483
[KAZUMA]
Well, I don't really know,

137
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,567
just curious about the emblem.

138
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,233
That's the flag of
our glorious Empire.

139
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:46,650
Oh, really?

140
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,317
Yeah. The principal's one
of the bigger ball busters

141
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,483
at our country's strategic HQ.

142
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,942
Bitchin'. And he set all
these traps, huh?

143
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:55,608
Sounds terrifying to me.

144
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,150
[NUEMANN]
You're right about that!

145
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,692
[ALL laugh]

146
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:01,275
Okay.

147
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:03,442
I think it's just about time for
less squawkin' and more walkin'.

148
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:05,525
[KAZUMA]
Yup, time to split.

149
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:09,067
[KURT] You miscreants
aren't going anywhere!

150
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,233
[AQUA] Huh? Oh, no!
What's happening now?

151
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:12,733
[KOENIG]
Head on a swivel guys.

152
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,858
[AQUA] Seriously, guys,
what is all this?

153
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,483
[GRANTZ]
What the hell are those?

154
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,108
[KAZUMA] Giant toads!
Monsters from our world!

155
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,108
[KOENIG]
Heh. They strong?

156
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,817
[KAZUMA]
They're-- Nah.

157
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,108
[NUEMANN]
Alright!

158
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,650
[KAZUMA]
But... punches don't work.

159
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:39,400
[KOENIG]
Neumann! Grantz!

160
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:41,733
[KAZUMA]
Aw man, we are so screwed!

161
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:44,108
[KOENIG] Still. We have to
protect the red stuff,

162
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:46,067
no matter the cost!

163
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,233
[KAZUMA] Lucky for us, there are
only four giant toads!

164
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:50,733
And they can only swallow
one person apiece!

165
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,067
[KOENIG]
I get it.

166
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,900
[KAZUMA] If two of us
sacrifice ourselves so one

167
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:57,358
can escape with it,
the mission will be a success!

168
00:07:57,442 --> 00:08:00,525
All we wanted to do was to
get that bottle out of here.

169
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,983
Yeah. Let's put
our trust in Aqua!

170
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:03,942
[AQUA]
Really?

171
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,150
[KOENIG]
He's right.

172
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:08,025
The hard truth of it is,
this is a man's job.

173
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:12,150
Aqua, when we make it out of
this, let's all drink together.

174
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:12,983
Thanks, Horse-face!

175
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,483
Name's Koenig!

176
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,358
[KOENIG]
Go on without me!

177
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,317
[AQUA gasps]
Horse-face! No!

178
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,900
[KAZUMA] Horse-face!
We won't forget his sacrifice.

179
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:29,275
Okay. Only one left. Go, Kazuma!

180
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,067
Go where?

181
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,400
Whaddaya mean, go where?

182
00:08:32,483 --> 00:08:33,900
You got it all wrong.

183
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:36,983
There's no way I'm jumping down
that nasty thing's gullet.

184
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:37,942
[AQUA]
Huh?

185
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,192
I mean, why in
the hell would I?

186
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,692
It's not happening.

187
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:44,650
Bye-bye Aqua, go have fun.
Stealth Skill. Engage.

188
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,858
[AQUA gasps]

189
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:51,442
Hey there. You seem nice, huh?

190
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:55,567
You'll pay for this, Kazuma!

191
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,608
Thanks, gang.
Neumann and Grantz.

192
00:08:58,692 --> 00:09:01,067
Horse-faced guy. Even Aqua.

193
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,733
I'll never forget you
or your sacrifices!

194
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:08,775
[AQUA screams]

195
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:15,858
[AQUA] Help! Somebody save me!
Don't just stand there!

196
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:17,317
This thing's gonna get me!

197
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,150
Help me out, and I'll grant
you my divine protection!

198
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,983
Shield Prison.

199
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:26,608
[AQUA]
What the hell are you doing? No!

200
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,067
[screams]

201
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,150
[AQUA] I'll bring down
loads of divine punishment

202
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,983
for what you've done!

203
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,775
Divine?

204
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,317
That's what she said.

205
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,150
Well, people that invoke the
divine are never to be trusted.

206
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,775
[screaming continues]

207
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:52,942
[KAZUMA]
The red stuff is mine!

208
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:56,400
[ROSWAAL] Well, well.
What do you have there?

209
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,358
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

210
00:09:58,442 --> 00:10:02,067
Who? Me? Uh. Well, I, uh...

211
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,858
I completely understand
how you feel, truly.

212
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:07,525
[KAZUMA] You ratted us
out to him, didn't you?!

213
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:12,608
But of course. I mean, I am
on Rozzie's side, after all.

214
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:18,650
Hello, Grantz. Neumann.
Koenig. Aqua. And Kazuma.

215
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,192
[gasps]

216
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,108
We have rules at this school.

217
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:25,233
And every single one
of you broke them.

218
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:27,650
As punishment,
you'll all be detained.

219
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,983
After school!

220
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:35,650
[KAZUMA groans]
Aw, damn it!
