1
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:23,138
Once upon a time,

2
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:27,600
there lived a beautiful girl named Cinderella.

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,439
But she was abused every day

4
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,025
by her wicked stepmother and stepsisters.

5
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:38,236
Cinderella, clean our room.

6
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:41,656
That's right! Then you need to scrub the floors.

7
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:43,283
I don't want to.

8
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:46,911
Crawl on the floor and scrub it yourself.

9
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,788
You want me to crawl on the floor?

10
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:50,415
I think I'm up for it.

11
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,083
Sister, don't be ridiculous.

12
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,044
You don't understand, I just...

13
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:57,172
Good. This works out well for everyone, then.

14
00:00:57,172 --> 00:01:00,967
Cinderella, how can you
treat your sister that way?

15
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:03,762
Poor Cinderella is being abused!

16
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:05,096
The poor thing.

17
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:10,685
Poor Cinderella picks up the bucket
and goes to leave the room.

18
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:14,481
But she ends up tripping and dropping it.

19
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,191
Oh no! Water torture!

20
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:19,694
Cinderella, this is wonderful...
I mean... horrific!

21
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:22,364
I'm sorry, sister.

22
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:23,740
I'll use this to wipe you clean.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,450
I get the mop?

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,576
--Hey.
--Are you okay, sister?

25
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:26,993
--What?
--Are you okay, sister?

26
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:27,577
--What?
--Yes. Cinderella is just fine.

27
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:28,912
--Is this how <i>Cinderella </i>goes?
--Yes. Cinderella is just fine.

28
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:31,081
--Is this how <i>Cinderella </i>goes?
--Cinderella, I'm not talking to you.

29
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,083
--No.
--Oh, I see.

30
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,001

31
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:38,254
{\an8}"Episode 12: The Show Begins! Showtime"
Are they going to be okay?

32
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:40,173
{\an8}"Episode 12: The Show Begins! Showtime"
The leader of the Nazarick
Floor Guardians, Albedo, is there.

33
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,218
{\an8}
The leader of the Nazarick
Floor Guardians, Albedo, is there.

34
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:46,471
There's nothing to worry about!

35
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:48,264
Is she that strong?

36
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:49,474
Yes.

37
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:55,313
She's among the strongest of Nazarick's members.

38
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:56,773
I see!

39
00:01:56,773 --> 00:02:00,819
We call her the big-mouthed
gorilla for a reason.

40
00:02:02,028 --> 00:02:06,991
I have the feeling Shalltear is
talking smack about me somewhere!

41
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:09,369
Wow!

42
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:13,957
We'll be on our way, Cinderella!

43
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:15,208
I'm so jealous.

44
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,168
How come I don't get to go?

45
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:18,920
Damn it! I bet you're jealous!

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,589
Sister, don't swear in the school play.

47
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:22,966
--So, where are we going again?

48
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,843
--You can do this!
--So, where are we going again?

49
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:27,512
Mother, we're on our way to the ball!

50
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,557
--You can do this, Demiurge!
--That's right.

51
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,108
Hang in there, Albedo!

52
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,610
Emilia! Puck!

53
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,945
Prepare the ice magic!

54
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,739
--Right!
--Leave it to me!

55
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,324
Aqua, can you make lots of water?

56
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:51,036
What? I'm the Goddess of Water!

57
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,871
Of course I can! Of course I can!

58
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,497
It's like taking candy from a baby!

59
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:58,084
Yes! For a genius wizard like me,

60
00:02:58,084 --> 00:03:01,254
taking you to the ball is like
taking candy from a baby!

61
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:03,965
Nobody actually says that.

62
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:05,967
I bet the one who wrote
that part of the script is...

63
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,093
Emilia.

64
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:08,636
Yup.

65
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:13,058
Sacred Create Water!

66
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:16,519
Well?

67
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,979
I used my full power!

68
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:20,565
That was too much power, but thank you!

69
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,691
Emilia!

70
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:22,984
Right!

71
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:29,657
Puck!

72
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,077
I'm on it, Lia!

73
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:39,876
Um, Megumin said I'm supposed to
say an incantation...

74
00:03:39,876 --> 00:03:42,712
Lia, it's nice that you do what others tell you.

75
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:45,965
But I think you're okay
ignoring Megumin right now.

76
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:47,217
Am I?

77
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,802
Yeah. Okay!

78
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:51,012
Steel turn to ash,

79
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,347
stone to dust,

80
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,181
as the black gathers and...

81
00:03:53,181 --> 00:03:55,308
That incantation is way too long!

82
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:57,727
Who told her she could ad-lib?

83
00:03:57,727 --> 00:04:01,064
If we told her to make it short,
she wouldn't do it anyway!

84
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:02,649
That's right, Ains!

85
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,951
<i>Ora-ora-ora-ora-ora-ora!</i>

86
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:28,925
What happens if that comes over here?

87
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,469
The school festival will be over.

88
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:32,470
I don't want that!

89
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,681
I want to see Master be the duckling!

90
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:36,558
Then fight!

91
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,060
Who are you?

92
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,979
To fight. To struggle.

93
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,648
Got it! Thanks!

94
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,817
Wait, sis!

95
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:51,573
Youth is a wonderful thing.

96
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,743
Behold this awesome carriage!

97
00:04:54,743 --> 00:04:58,830
I'm shocked that a mere pumpkin
could turn into something so pathetic.

98
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,290
Who are you calling pathetic?

99
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,541
A talking carriage!

100
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,376
Carriages don't talk!

101
00:05:03,376 --> 00:05:06,963
You were made to carry things, not talk!

102
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:08,715
That's really cruel!

103
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,346
It's a terrible foe, Death Knight!

104
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:17,515
We should go help!

105
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,477
--Let's go.
--Stay here.

106
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:25,482
There's no place for us in this battle.

107
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,400
Why?

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,777
Because...

109
00:05:28,777 --> 00:05:30,987
This is a battle for maidens!

110
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,531
I'm female.

111
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:41,247
Cinderella, why are you here?

112
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,292
That's right. You don't belong...

113
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,669
This isn't even a conversation.

114
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,294
--But her brutal mocking laughter

115
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:47,545
--Hang in there...
--But her brutal mocking laughter

116
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:49,130
--Hang in there, Demiurge!
--is making me...

117
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,383
--Hang in there, Demiurge!

118
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:54,886
Raphtalia, Filo!

119
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,514
I'm counting on you!

120
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:58,473
We'll help!

121
00:05:58,473 --> 00:05:59,474
Thanks!

122
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:02,894
Attack from different angles
so it can't focus its attacks!

123
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,270
Got it!

124
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,106
Okay!

125
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:15,782
Wow.

126
00:06:15,782 --> 00:06:18,743
She turns into a really strong bird!

127
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:20,912
Am I strong? Am I strong?

128
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,914
Yes! Very strong!

129
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:35,343
Something wrong?

130
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:36,928
Nothing at all, I wonder.

131
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:40,724
She thinks you're thinking
naughty thoughts about her.

132
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,101
I am not!

133
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:44,936
He's right, actually.

134
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:47,105
No!

135
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:55,989
What is that?

136
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,449
It didn't have those last time!

137
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,911
It's not the Destroyer you know anymore!

138
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,627
Missile Parry!

139
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:13,214
Followed by... Counter Arrow!

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,260
Thank you!

141
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,638
I'm saving myself for the one I love...

142
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,267
I'm saving myself for the one I love...

143
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,186
Wonderful! That's wonderful!

144
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:33,026
Yes! For the man I love, Lord Ains,
I must annihilate the Destroyer!

145
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:35,820
That is my own diligence!

146
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,697
Love!

147
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:42,202
And so the two of them fell in love.

148
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:56,841
High-density magic signal
emanating from the target!

149
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,385
Watch out!

150
00:07:58,385 --> 00:07:59,552
Defensive wall!

151
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:01,429
Walls of Jericho!

152
00:08:03,723 --> 00:08:05,850
You're good, for a human!

153
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,603
I was trained in hell!

154
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:11,648
But...

155
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,276
I have to go. Sorry.

156
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,319
Wait!

157
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,113
At least tell me your name.

158
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:28,665
What is this?

159
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,084
Visha!

160
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:35,505
I'm at my limit!

161
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:37,424
I'll protect you!

162
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:40,468
Like Naofumi does!

163
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:46,725
She's absorbing it?

164
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:49,602
That's an amazing power!

165
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,312
Demihuman!

166
00:08:51,312 --> 00:08:53,106
Raphtalia!

167
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,696
Aqua!

168
00:08:59,696 --> 00:09:00,697
Right!

169
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:04,784
You fit the glass slipper perfectly!

170
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:08,663
You are the princess I've been looking for!

171
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:15,337
You're going to pay for trying to
mess with our school festival,

172
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,172
Destroyer!

173
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:20,342
Taste my wrath!

174
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:24,763
My rage at not being able to
see Lord Ains' legendary performance!

175
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:27,724
My sadness at not being able to
eat more chocolate bananas!

176
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:30,518
My disappointment at not being able to
have more fun at the festival!

177
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:31,478
I'm disappointed!

178
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:32,354
Disappointed!

179
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,064
Disappointed!

180
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:37,859
So, it's up to you now, Aqua!

181
00:09:37,859 --> 00:09:39,402
Leave it to me!

182
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:45,450
And this is for everybody!

183
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,328
--<i>God Blow!</i>

184
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,372
--Please accept the love of me,
--<i>God Blow!</i>

185
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:52,999
--the prince.
--<i>God Blow!</i>

186
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,877
--Yes, with pleasure.
--<i>God Blow!</i>

187
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:05,095
So...

188
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,348
Nothing changed!

189
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:12,936
So, let's get back to class!

190
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:19,526
So nothing changed at all, huh?

191
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:22,070
That's not quite true.

192
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:25,365
Everything changes.

193
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:31,371
Only when you come together
can you have the future you want.

194
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,998
Why are you being serious all of a sudden?

195
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:37,961
As long as you have the will to change it,

196
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:41,506
you can change the future as much as you want!

197
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:42,924
