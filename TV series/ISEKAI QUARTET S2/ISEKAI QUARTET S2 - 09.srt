An errand?

Yes. We're all going to be doing
a play for the school festival.

00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:27,267
Yes. We're all going to be doing
a play for the school festival.

00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,602
We can do whatever play we want.

6
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:33,314
So Filo, I want you to pick
the theme for the play.

7
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:34,733
The theme?

8
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:37,777
Yes, why don't you go talk to a bunch of people

9
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:42,198
about what kind of play they want,
and then come up with an idea.

10
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:45,326
I think you need that experience.

11
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:46,327
Can you do it?

12
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:47,370
Okay!

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,997
I'll do my best!

14
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:51,041
I'm counting on you, Filo!

15
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,042
Okay!

And all the classes are doing a play?

00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:36,146
Yup. What kind of story do you like?

45
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:38,273
What kind of story...

46
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:41,026
I want to see a story about my lord!

47
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,945
Doing a play about an Undead
in front of a goddess!

48
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:45,530
Not a chance!

49
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,365
And stop nodding.

50
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:49,075
--Death Knight disappeared!
--Again?

51
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,077
--Death Knight disappeared!
--Aqua!

52
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:55,040
If you want to call yourself a goddess, fine,
but try to get along with others!

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,751
I'm not just calling myself a goddess!
I am a goddess!

54
00:02:57,751 --> 00:03:00,962
Well, I think you should be nicer,

55
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:04,924
but Lord Ains told me to
"be nice to the <i>tsundere</i>."

56
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:07,052
What does that mean?

57
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,596
It means you're a <i>tsundere</i>.

58
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:12,307
You're mean to the person you like.

59
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:16,102
Aqua, the minute you got lectured
by a kid, you already lost.

60
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:20,398
--Why?
--Oh, Death Knight's back.

61
00:03:20,398 --> 00:03:24,027
Why not talk to more people?

62
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:27,322
Yeah, I will! Thanks!

63
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:35,288
It's the skeleton man...
grandpa... skeleton guy!

64
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,498
She tried really hard there.

65
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:37,374
I'm Ains.

66
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:38,500
What is it?

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,293
Do you need to talk to me?

68
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:45,298
Um, I'm talking to a lot of people right now!

69
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,468
A play, huh?

70
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:49,427
Yes.

71
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:52,555
Hamusuke said he wanted to see
the story of an Undead...

72
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,849
That's wonderful!

73
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,977
A story to tell everyone
how wonderful Lord Ains is!

74
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:01,773
Truly a worthy gift to a supreme being!

75
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:03,066
Indeed!

76
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,318
And I can be his empress...

77
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:08,196
Did you say something, lamprey?

78
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,949
Did you say something, big-mouthed gorilla?

79
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,450
Calm down, both of you.

80
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,869
--Okay!
--Perfect harmony!

81
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:20,792
Filo, I'm sorry, but we don't
know much about drama.

82
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:24,087
You'd do better to ask someone else.

83
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:25,338
For example?

84
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:29,718
Hmm... How about Kazuma's gang?

85
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:32,137
Explosion!

86
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:37,100
Well?

87
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,518
Hmm...

88
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:41,146
The firepower is concentrated on
a single point, and extremely effective.

89
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:45,233
Collateral damage is minimal.
An excellent explosion.

90
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,943
What score would you give it?

91
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,153
Forty points.

92
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:51,698
If you can't shorten the incantation,
it will be difficult to use in combat.

93
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,117
A short incantation is out of the question.

94
00:04:54,117 --> 00:04:56,202
They aren't cool!

95
00:04:56,202 --> 00:05:00,790
What's important is casting time. Not coolness.

96
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,958
Not true.

97
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:05,295
No, on the battlefield, a single second
means the difference between life and death.

98
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,172
Shorten the incantation time

99
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:09,632
--Hey, Tanya.
--to efficiently...

100
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:12,969
Her incantations are a mystery.

101
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:17,390
We don't even know if she needs
an incantation to cast a spell at all.

102
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,225
She says something different every time.

103
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:22,479
If I don't use a cool incantation, I will die.

104
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,315
Are you making fun of me?

105
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,233
Are you making fun of me?

106
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,985
Is it good, Filo?

107
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,071
It's good!

108
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,741
This is tough.

109
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,951
Everybody says something different.

110
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:38,661
Hey there.

111
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,497
The girl from Class 2!

112
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:43,124
You seemed like something
was really bothering you.

113
00:05:43,124 --> 00:05:44,250
Is something wrong?

114
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,754
Um, I'm searching for a theme.

115
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:48,838
A theme?

116
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:54,386
Yes. We're doing something called
a "play" at the school festival.

117
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,596
A play at the school festival?

118
00:05:56,596 --> 00:06:01,476
I was asked to find a theme.

119
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:04,521
So you're going around
to talk to everybody, huh?

120
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:08,316
But everybody says
something different, so it's hard.

121
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:10,860
Why not go to the library then?

122
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,946
There's a lot of books there,

123
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:16,241
so I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.

124
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,867
The library?

125
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,829
Got it! Thanks, miss!

126
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:23,498
She's a good girl.

127
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,041
Yup.

128
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,252
Anyway, we have to go find Roswaal and say,

129
00:06:27,252 --> 00:06:30,797
"We didn't hear anything
about a school festival."

130
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:31,798
Yup.

131
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:33,758
But, Puck.

132
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:37,053
Here he's "Mr. Roswaal."

133
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,596
Okay.

134
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:38,888
"Library"
Okay.

135
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,849
"Library"
That book's easy to read. I think
it'll give you some good ideas, too.

136
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:43,309
That book's easy to read. I think
it'll give you some good ideas, too.

137
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:45,437
"Gentle Fairy Tales"
That book's easy to read. I think
it'll give you some good ideas, too.

138
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:46,062
"Gentle Fairy Tales"
Now take it and go.

139
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,440
Now take it and go.

140
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,776
Okay, I'll have Master read it to me.

141
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,820
Thank you, Mare!

142
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,071
Beat...

143
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:55,989
Beako!

144
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,615
It's not Beako, I wonder!

145
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:59,701
Bye!

146
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:02,787
What a rude girl!

147
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,502
Can I ask something?

148
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,046
Yes.

149
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,630
What is it?

150
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,758
Nothing important.

151
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:18,678
Do you remember how you got to the school?

152
00:07:18,678 --> 00:07:22,766
Lord Ains said he pushed a button.

153
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:27,562
Lord Ains apologized and said it was his fault.

154
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:32,067
But he's a supreme being,
so he must have had some reason.

155
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:32,901
I see.

156
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,863
It's nice to have the person
you believe in right next to you.

157
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:39,657
Do you not, Beatrice?

158
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:42,577
Not anymore, I wonder.

159
00:07:42,577 --> 00:07:44,454
What about Subaru?

160
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:48,291
I can't trust that guy at all!

161
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,168
Oh, yeah.

162
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,586
Yeah, I wonder.

163
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,132
What've you got there?

164
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,468
Oh, the wolf girl!

165
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:01,221
Yup. The wolf girl!

166
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:05,016
And the girl who's very interested
in what you've got there!

167
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:10,605
"Gentle Fairy Tales"
This? I got it to help pick the theme
for the school festival.

168
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,856
This? I got it to help pick the theme
for the school festival.

169
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,233
What about this?

170
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,945
A poor little bird is tricked by an evil man
and turned into fried chicken--

171
00:08:16,945 --> 00:08:20,240
Don't make up stories!

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,325
The girls with black hair!

173
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:27,664
You were told by Lord Ains
to follow the rules of the school.

174
00:08:27,664 --> 00:08:33,128
I'm just trying to see how far
I can bend the rules, is all.

175
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,839
Your name's Filo, right?

176
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,800
You're looking for a theme for Class 1's play?

177
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,556
Yes. And Mare and Beako gave me a book to help!

178
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:45,724
Mare gave it to you?

179
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,601
Very well. We'll think of something with you.

180
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:52,230
How about a story where a poor raccoon
is tricked by a man with--

181
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,524
You just did that.

182
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:57,277
But a normal story is boring!

183
00:08:57,277 --> 00:08:59,237
We're the ones who'll be acting!

184
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,113
It's boring!

185
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:01,406
And Narberal's a terrible actor--

186
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:05,035
--A terrible what now?
--Oww! Oww!

187
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:08,997
But if we're going to act, it would
be better if we could be ourselves.

188
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:12,667
Though Narberal wouldn't be able
to talk about anything but murder!

189
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,170
--What did you say?
--Oww!

190
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,630
What are you ladies talking about?

191
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,508
None of your business,
you piece of human garbage.

192
00:09:20,508 --> 00:09:22,802
--Scary words from such a pretty lady.
--Yup.

193
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:27,265
Hearing that from you ugly insects
means nothing to me.

194
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,768
That's it!

195
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:31,728
The ugly duckling!

196
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:35,231
The ugly duckling gets terribly insulted
by the other ducklings!

197
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,526
You could just be who you already are!

198
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,487
Yes, that could work in some cases...

199
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:42,822
It's perfect for you, since you're so violent.

200
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,867
--Who are you calling violent?
--Oww! Oww! Oww!

201
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:47,994
<i>The Ugly Duckling</i>?

202
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:51,122
Got it! Thanks, ladies!

203
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,665
And old guys, too!

204
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:53,917
Yeah, you're wel--

205
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,377
We're not old!

206
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:56,920
"Class 1"
"And they lived happily ever after."

207
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,837
"And they lived happily ever after."

208
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,464
"The End."

209
00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,465
Well, Filo?

210
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,842
Yes, I like it!

211
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:05,303
Naofumi, this is wonderful!

212
00:10:05,303 --> 00:10:06,388
Let's go with this!

213
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,181
You like it that much?

214
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,432
Yes, I do!

215
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:11,601
Yeah, it's a great story.

216
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:15,647
"The real me was actually very noble."

217
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,816
Why are you looking at me when you say that?

218
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,193
Is it okay, Felt?

219
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:22,237
Um...

220
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:27,409
Okay, Class 1 will do <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>!

221
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,910
Okay!

222
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,080
Master, I worked really hard!

223
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,457
Yes, well done.

224
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:37,502
Naofumi, if you'd just asked me...

225
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:38,461
Sorry.

226
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,547
Next time, I'll have you do something.

227
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:42,674
Don't treat me like a child!

228
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,175
Jeez...

229
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:04,821
<i>I've got special makeup on today</i>

230
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,782
<i>My boobs are padded 50% more than normal!</i>

231
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:10,160
<i>I've got a demon's smile on my face</i>

232
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,455
<i>Is it time for my big debut?</i>

233
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:16,624
<i>I've never done something like this! It's rough!</i>

234
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:19,294
<i>Time to show everyone how gallant I am!</i>

235
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:22,213
<i>That's right! Show the whole world my charm!</i>

236
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,549
<i>All right, everyone, let's calm down!</i>

237
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,594
<i>Voices warmed up!</i>

238
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:31,097
<i>Rehearsal went perfectly!</i>

239
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:34,559
<i>I'm saying all kinds of crazy stuff,</i>

240
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,437
<i>and my ad-libs are blowing up in my face!</i>

241
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:42,233
<i>The ditzy girls are about to</i>
<i>put on an amazing show!</i>

242
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:45,904
<i>Welcome! Come in, sit right down!</i>

243
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:48,823
<i>It's a miraculous collaboration!</i>

244
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:54,829
<i>When the four of us get together,</i>
<i>it's a sold-out house!</i>

245
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:57,540
<i>The acting is terrible,</i>

246
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,502
<i>but the fights are so realistic!</i>

247
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,213
<i>It's a messed-up quartet,</i>

248
00:12:03,213 --> 00:12:07,425
<i>aiming for a happy ending!</i>
