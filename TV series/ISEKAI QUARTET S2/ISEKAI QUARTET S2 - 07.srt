1
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:15,358
[MARE]
So, have I gotten any bigger?

2
00:00:15,442 --> 00:00:17,358
I feel like I have.

3
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,983
Well, what does it say?
Any change?

4
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,567
[VANIR]
Same weight as last time.

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,233
You're still tiny, with
comically oversized ears.

6
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,608
Oh, right.

7
00:01:56,733 --> 00:02:00,775
Physicals. Who knew health
was such a pain in the neck?

8
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,275
It's crazy.
Always something going on.

9
00:02:03,358 --> 00:02:05,983
[RAM] Indeed. I've decided
I'm going to just focus

10
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:08,108
all my obsession
on Rem's growth.

11
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:12,108
That's pretty amazing to me.
You two girls are exactly alike.

12
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,025
Almost, besides breasts.

13
00:02:14,108 --> 00:02:16,317
Oh. I'm sorry.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,858
[RAM]
I'm fine with it.

15
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:21,233
They seem like they can
be quite a burden to me.

16
00:02:21,317 --> 00:02:23,775
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] You students!
Give me your attention!

17
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,067
[VISHA]
Yes sir?

18
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,400
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
"Sir" is correct!

19
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:28,233
For I am your leader,
your teacher!

20
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:31,567
I am Pandora's Actor!
I'm one and all!

21
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,733
But "sir" will do.

22
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,733
[RAM] I see.
Great info, goodbye, sir.

23
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,317
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Wait!

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,150
[sighs]
Yes?

25
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,942
Is there something else
that you need from us, sir?

26
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:45,025
Since you're one of Mister
Roswaal's cohorts, I will,

27
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:46,442
with reluctance, hear you out.

28
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:50,733
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
I appreciate that. Mademoiselle?

29
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:53,317
Yes? What now? Spill it.

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,858
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Well, it's
actually your stylish companion

31
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,442
with whom I'd like to speak.

32
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,858
[VISHA]
Huh?

33
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,483
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Your outfit
is simply to die for.

34
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,400
Extremely cool!

35
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,483
Oh... Yeah?

36
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,983
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
My father-- no--

37
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,317
when we're here,
he's my student!

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,817
My Ains must be
very excited by it.

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,192
Wait. Ains is your father?

40
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:14,692
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] Perhaps it's
more accurate to say he's

41
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,150
"my creator".

42
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:19,775
So that magnificently
fashionable and chic outfit,

43
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,442
which is so reminiscent of mine,

44
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:23,692
must be very
eye-catching to him!

45
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,150
[VISHA]
You don't say.

46
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,817
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
I do say!

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,150
[RAM]
That's good to know, sir.

48
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,733
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
My pleasure.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
Heh.

50
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,983
[ERICH]
Try to imagine this.

51
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:41,400
Waking up in a world that
is similar to your own.

52
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,608
But...

53
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:44,775
[DARKNESS] What's wrong Ram?
Are you alright?

54
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,400
Nothing. Everything's great.

55
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:50,150
Are you sure? You look
disgusted or something.

56
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,025
I'd be lying if I said
I didn't like it.

57
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,192
[AINS]
Hmm.

58
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,608
[ERICH]
Anyway...

59
00:03:55,692 --> 00:03:58,567
As I'd mentioned,
physicals are this afternoon.

60
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,233
Girls in the nurse's office,

61
00:04:00,317 --> 00:04:03,150
and the boys will all go
to the gymnasium.

62
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,692
If you happen to be on
the health committee,

63
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,067
it is imperative you follow
the nurse's instructions

64
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,942
to the letter.

65
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:09,400
Right!

66
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,900
Yes, I hear and obey, sir.
I look forward to the task,

67
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:14,692
inspecting every bit
of Lord Ains' body.

68
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:18,567
Calm down. You will
be handling the girls.

69
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,275
Why? Just because you hate me?

70
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,942
[ERICH]
Because you're girls.

71
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:24,192
Weak! Just like your mother!

72
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:26,442
[DARKNESS] Shalltear,
your rage is incredible!

73
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,775
[MOMONGA]
Sorry about her.

74
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,192
[DARKNESS] Your passion
is like a white-hot poker!

75
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,817
[KAZUMA]
Sorry about her.

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,275
And us guys?
Who's taking care of us?

77
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,192
[ERICH]
A class one boy.

78
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,525
You got some kind
of problem, man?

79
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:41,525
No! But yeah, maybe!

80
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:44,067
Well, which one is it?

81
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,817
[VANIR laughs] This fool was
hoping he could fix his gaze

82
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,025
upon a scantily clad classmate!

83
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:53,483
But the shield hero will protect
the virtue of the fairer sex!

84
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,733
If you dare make a move to
storm the nurse's office

85
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,900
to ogle the ladies, he will
stop you in your tracks.

86
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:02,317
Not really. If you wanna give
it a shot, go on ahead.

87
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,317
But you don't want that kind of
blemish on your reputation.

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,358
Trust me.

89
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:07,983
Oh, well, he's kinda
used to that.

90
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,442
Yeah, it's pretty much my
day-to-day existence--

91
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,192
Hey!

92
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,233
Classic Kazuma.

93
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,900
Actually, you're all wrong.
I'm not a peeker.

94
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,692
But you did try on the
beach trip, didn't you?

95
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,525
Yeah, well somebody had
to be the one, right?

96
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,900
Then somebody has
to this time, too.

97
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:23,608
That's true.

98
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:24,483
[KAZUMA gasps]

99
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,025
[AINS]
I'll admit.

100
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:29,233
I'm curious to see if Kazuma
has the skills to pull this off.

101
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:30,775
<i>Et tu</i> , Ains?

102
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,525
[AINS] Rumor is you
have the highest luck

103
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:35,942
of anybody at this school.
Let's test that.

104
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:38,358
[gasps]
Yeah, sure, okay.

105
00:05:38,442 --> 00:05:40,025
Now, I don't wanna do this,

106
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,692
but if I have to
and if you insist.

107
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,817
I have no choice
but so show you.

108
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,483
Don't do it.

109
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,317
I shouldn't.

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,108
[ALBEDO, SHALLTEAR grunting]

111
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:54,817
You fiend! Release me at once!
I must see him now!

112
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,525
I must bear witness to
Lord Ains' unclothed form!

113
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:01,483
Yes! This is so wrong!
I have to see him!

114
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:04,192
You want to look at that human
you lust after as well,

115
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:05,733
don't you?

116
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:09,775
Yes. My wish is to be by my
Subaru's side at all times,

117
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,775
and I'd love
to do his physical.

118
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:13,025
[ALBEDO, SHALLTEAR]
Let's go!

119
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,983
[REM] This simply isn't
the right moment.

120
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:18,358
So I'm content to wait for now.
At some point in the future,

121
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:19,983
I'll give him a
private physical.

122
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,317
[SHALLTEAR gasps]
Oh.

123
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,692
I didn't even think about the
option of giving one in private.

124
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:29,983
One on one? It'd be
a dream come true!

125
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,775
[WIZ] I seem to be having a
little bit of trouble

00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,567
measuring your
real height, Tanya.

127
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,817
[COCYTUS]
So what's up?

128
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,233
Are you not interested
in peeking, Subaru?

129
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,733
It's not that I'm not
interested, per se.

130
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,233
It's more like...

131
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,775
...I'm just not the type of guy
who goes sneaking around.

132
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:46,442
[COCYTUS]
The warrior's path.

133
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:48,442
[JULIUS chuckles]
Perhaps he's learning

134
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:50,233
what it means to be a knight.

weird feeling that somebody's

00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:55,942
[COCYTUS]
What about your team?

138
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:58,233
We're the type of guys
who'd rather just have fun

139
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,400
than try to spy
on naked girls.

140
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,900
Only because Tanya
would murder you.

141
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:05,900
You'd think. But this
may surprise you.

142
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,483
If we don't violate
military code, she's cool.

[KOENIG]
Really. Is that so?

Big surprise.

We'll tell her you
said that, sir.

Because your eye patch is on.

I'm afraid you don't
know what you're saying.

it may unleash hell upon

You know that's not true.

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,775
[MEGUMIN gasps]

158
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:38,317
Why must you insist on acting
like you're 12 years old

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,608
or something?

160
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,775
Don't you think it's time
for you to grow up?

161
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:44,900
[MEGUMIN] What the...?
You need to check your attitude!

162
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,442
I'm older than you, little girl!

163
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,942
And besides, I know
I look incredibly cool

164
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:52,275
with this eye patch.
And I'm not the only one.

165
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:55,067
Yeah? Some other weirdo
likes it? Who's that?

166
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,233
[MEGUMIN]
Ains!

167
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:57,483
What?

168
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,400
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
You!

169
00:07:59,483 --> 00:08:01,108
The girl with the
incredibly cool eye patch!

170
00:08:01,192 --> 00:08:04,108
[MEGUMIN]
Huh? Are you talking to me?

171
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,233
You think I'm cool?

172
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:07,108
[PANDORA'S ACTOR laughs]
Yes indeed.

173
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:10,275
You're the only one with
that dandy eye patch!

174
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:14,358
That's true. Thank you. You have
extraordinary taste, sir.

175
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,400
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Alas, I cannot taste anything.

176
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:21,275
But I do have amazing taste!
For I am Pandora's Actor! Yes!

177
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:22,608
By the way,
that cool eye patch.

178
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:26,942
I can tell it's no ordinary
ocular accouterment.

179
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,692
Ha! I'm surprised that
somebody noticed!

180
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,192
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] If I had eyes,
you could not hope to fool them!

181
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,525
Well then,

182
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:36,275
I'll let you in on a little
secret in that case.

183
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:39,358
That the primary function of
this unbelievably stylish

184
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,942
accessory is to seal
away my hidden power.

185
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,983
[PANDORA'S ACTOR gasps]
I knew it!

186
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,067
[MEGUMIN chuckles]

187
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,150
But you take it off
all the time.

188
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:51,067
[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
<i>Der Alte würfelt nicht!</i>

189
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,483
That was so awesome!

190
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,483
You have to tell me whatever
it was you just said!

191
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,150
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] These powerful
words were taught to me

192
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,775
directly by my creator,
Ains Ooal Gown!

193
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,442
He's a student here, in fact.

194
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:07,275
And, yes, we share the
same exact tastes!

195
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:10,192
The most incredible tastes. Yes!

196
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,233
Ains Ooal Gown, you say?

197
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,692
From the name, I can tell
he's no ordinary man.

198
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,358
[GRANTZ] Have you met
another talking skeleton

199
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:17,858
that's ordinary?

200
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:20,108
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] I'm absolutely
positive that your tastes

201
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,983
dovetail with his
as well. Yes!

202
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,525
Oh really?

203
00:09:24,608 --> 00:09:27,483
I had a strong feeling he was
fit to be my perfect rival!

204
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,525
[TANYA]
Uh...

205
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:31,858
Ains may be undead,

206
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,942
but at least he has
impeccable taste.

207
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:38,775
[TANYA] Hm. I may have to
reconsider my opinion of him.

208
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:40,150
Sorry Filo.

209
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,692
I'm having a little trouble
measuring your height.

210
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,275
[WIZ]
I appreciate your cooperation.

211
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:48,067
Now, head back to
your classroom,

212
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,567
and then you'll all be free
to go home for the day.

213
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,608
[KAZUMA] Aw. Damn it!
Too late. No!

214
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:56,358
I'm so disappointed.
He didn't watch?

215
00:09:58,192 --> 00:09:58,817
[AINS]
Now then.

216
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,817
[ALBEDO]
Lord Ains!

217
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,483
[AINS]
Is something wrong?

218
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,150
My lord. I understand
your tastes much better

219
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,483
than anyone in this
world or our own!

220
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,442
I still fit your ideal of
female perfection, don't I?

221
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:14,067
Just me. I'm the only one.
Not that red-eyed floozy!

222
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,692
With that stupid hat and cape!

223
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:18,150
I'm the succubus you've
always dreamed of!

224
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,400
[MOMONGA]
Huh? What's with Megumin.

225
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,858
When you gaze deeply
into my abyss,

226
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:25,400
you'll find something.

227
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:29,067
You'll find me gazing back into
your own chasm of darkness.

228
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,942
[MEGUMIN laughs]

229
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,233
Heh!
