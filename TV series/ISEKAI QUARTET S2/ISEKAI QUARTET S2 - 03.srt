00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,358
Hey, You there!

160
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:28,733
What perfect timing.
I need your assistance.

161
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,067
[KOENIG]
Please Mister Principal!

162
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,733
If we can help
stop the flooding,

163
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:34,025
will you release
us from detention?

164
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:37,275
I will. Good deeds
deserve to be rewarded.

165
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,525
[ALL gasp]

166
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:40,067
Kazuma! Aqua!

167
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,108
Yeah!

168
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:42,483
Right there with you,
Horse-Face!

169
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:44,442
My name's Koenig.

170
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,442
[KOENIG]
Alright men, deploy a barrier!

171
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:47,900
[GRANTZ, NUEMANN]
Right!

172
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:50,233
[NUEMANN]
Oh yeah!

173
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:53,483
Kazuma. We'll need to dump
the water once I seal it up.

174
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,483
Yeah!

175
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,858
[KOENIG grunts]

176
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,400
Aqua, on you!

177
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,358
I hear ya. It's really
no problem for me.

178
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:02,692
I'm the water goddess!

179
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,817
[KAZUMA] Great! Just do
one of your party tricks!

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,525
What'd you say? I guess
I've gotta show all of you

181
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,775
why I am the goddess of water.

182
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,483
[KOENIG] I thought she
was just full of crap.

183
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,775
But maybe she does
have some real power?

184
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:17,567
[NUEMANN]
Yeah. I think she's a goddess!

185
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,525
Here goes! Water, control!

186
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:23,650
[KAZUMA]
Looks like a party trick to me!

187
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,567
Huh. Whoa...

188
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,983
[PUCK]
Then...

189
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,400
You've all been released
from detention!

190
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:40,567
What's more, all of you
got to perform a good deed.

191
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,567
[SUBARU] Well, only because
Megumin did a bad deed first.

192
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,067
[MEGUMIN] What? I have no idea
what you mean by that.

193
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,358
[SUBARU]
Sure.

194
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:50,275
[KAZUMA] Anyway, great work
you guys. Thanks!

195
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:51,567
Now you just have to really

196
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,067
try not to break any
more rules, okay?

197
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,025
Thanks a lot. I mean it.

198
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,442
No sweat.

199
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:59,817
But you should really be
thanking your commander instead.

200
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,942
I mean, she could have
stopped us, but she didn't.

201
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,400
Hey, Neumann.

202
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,817
Why don't you go over there
and thank her for us, huh?

203
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,192
Not without some backup.

204
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,400
Don't blame ya.

205
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,483
[ALL laughing]

206
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:14,192
[KYOUHUKOU] I'm pleased it all
worked out, Mister Roswaal.

207
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:18,067
[ROSWAAL] Oh, hello there
Mister Kyouhukou, sir!

208
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,233
[KYOUHUKOU] It appears, the
students are closer than ever.

209
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:26,483
Yes they are, sir. And I pray
that this trend will continue.

210
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,858
[KYOUHUKOU]
Indeed. Oh, by the way.

211
00:10:28,942 --> 00:10:31,400
Would you care to join
me for afternoon tea?

212
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:33,067
Not happening.
