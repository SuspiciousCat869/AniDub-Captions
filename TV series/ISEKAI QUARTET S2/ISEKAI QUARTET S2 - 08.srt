[PANDORA'S ACTOR]
Class is done for today!

2
00:00:13,692 --> 00:00:15,192
But don't slack off
on your homework!

3
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:18,817
Treat it as though your
life depends on it!

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,525
Begone!

00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:21,525
[KAZUMA grunts]

6
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:23,275
You actually stayed
awake though class.

7
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,067
I don't think there's
anybody who could sleep

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,275
through all that guy's
overdramatic yelling.

9
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:29,025
Ah, point taken.

10
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,442
Have a great night! I'll see ya!

[COCYTUS]
Hey Demiurge,

13
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:09,067
there's somewhere I wanna
stop on the way home.

14
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,733
[DEMIURGE]
That's fine with me...

15
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,442
So, what's her deal?

16
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:13,483
Huh?

17
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,317
She leaves the
second class is over.

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,650
What's up? I thought she
walked home with you.

19
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:21,817
Well, she probably just needs
a little time to herself.

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,442
I bet that makes you feel
pretty lonely, though.

21
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:28,192
Not really. I actually enjoy
my own company, thank you.

22
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,942
C'mon, you're a
little girl, right?

23
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,317
"Oh, poor me, I'm so lonely.".

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
That's how you feel
deep inside, huh, Beako?

25
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:37,233
Next time the words
"little girl" come up

26
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:38,608
in your creepy conversations,

27
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,858
I'd prefer it if you kept my
name outta your mouth!

28
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,900
[SUBARU] You'd have more
fun if you'd play along.

29
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:44,650
[BEATRICE] I'd have more
fun if I busted your jaw.

30
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,900
Honestly, I'd be really be
lonely without you, Subaru,

31
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,067
so let's go home!

32
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,733
[SUBARU]
Oh, well there's an invitation!

33
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:52,150
I've got nothing going
on after school, so yeah,

34
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:54,692
that works for me.
How 'bout you, Emilia?

35
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,317
I don't have anything
keeping me here,

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,983
so I'll be happy to
go with you guys.

37
00:02:58,067 --> 00:03:00,817
Okay. I say we should
hit up the butcher shop

38
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
on the way back home.

39
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:03,692
Hold on.

40
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,483
You comin' with us, too?

41
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:08,525
If you're getting croquettes,
then I'm willing to go with you.

42
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:11,108
Of course, you can't just say,
"I would love to go with you."

43
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,067
Sounds familiar. Huh, Beako?

44
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,650
[BEATRICE] You can stop name
checking me, you cretin!

45

[RAM]
Come on, ya loser, I'm hungry.

46
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,483
Right. Guess I'll catch up
with you guys tomorrow!

47
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,858
Bye everyone.

48
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:23,108
See you later!

49
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,317
[SUBARU] Hm? So, you're coming
with us, Beako?

50
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,775
[WEISS gasps] That guy is
really popular somehow.

51
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:30,525
Yeah. It seems that way.

52

--[MEGUMIN] Kazuma.
--[KAZUMA] Yeah?

53
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,108
I found a brand new spot.

54
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,358
It's the perfect setting
for my explosions!

55
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:37,942
Come and check it out with me!

56
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,025
Cool.

[DARKNESS]
Now hold on just a minute!

58
00:03:40,483 --> 00:03:42,275
Kazuma was supposed to
win a stuffed animal

59
00:03:42,358 --> 00:03:44,150
for me at the arcade.

60
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,733
No way! I told you that
they're having a sale

00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:48,858
on veggies at the
supermarket today!

You promised you'd go with me!

00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:54,400
Relax, ladies. There's enough
of me to go around.

you've kind of been in a funk

since Valentine's Day.

What are we gonna get today?

73
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:14,650
Croquettes or some
chicken wings, maybe?

74
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:18,608
I'm down for <i>menchi-katsu</i> !
I can smell the fryer boiling.

[VISHA]
Thanks for stopping by!

78
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,567

She does.

[ALL]
Huh?

00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,983
That's 240 yen!

[SUBARU]
Visha?

82
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,567
[SUBARU] And there she
was at the counter.

83
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,192
So you're saying that
she has a part-time job?

84
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,775
Yeah. That's why she
always makes a beeline

85
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,150
to be the first one outta here.

86
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,108

Good morning Tanya, Subaru.

Oh, good morning.

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
Good morning to you, too.

89
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,817
I was just telling her
that I saw Visha.

90
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,483
[AINS] Hm. That's funny,
we saw her too.

91
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,650
I didn't realize she had a job.

92
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,275
[SUBARU]
Where did you see her?

93
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:59,192
[AINS] Well, Albedo wanted to
go to the convenience store.

94
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:02,025
[SUBARU] Really? It wasn't
the butcher shop?

95
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:05,775
[AINS] Uh, no. Why would
she be there instead?

96
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:07,442
[TANYA]
Something's going on here.

97
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:10,067
Check this out, guys.
You'll never guess who we saw

98
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,567
working at the
supermarket yesterd--

99
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,400
[AINS, SUBARU]
Yeah, we know.

100
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:14,608
[KAZUMA, AQUA]
Huh?

101
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:17,108
So, you really saw
Lieutenant Serebryakov

102
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,942
working at the supermarket?

103
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,192
[KAZUMA]
Huh?

104
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:24,858
[TANYA] The reason I've gathered
you all here at this time...

105
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:26,483
...is to discuss our lieutenant.

106
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,525
Let's go over what we know.

107
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,733
Several people in our class
witnessed her working

108
00:05:30,817 --> 00:05:33,608
a part-time job yesterday.
You verify?

109
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,567
[AINS]
Yes. We spotted her.

110
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,692
We saw it too.

111
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:37,858
And so did we!

112
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,025
We did too.

113
00:05:39,108 --> 00:05:40,608
I definitely saw her.

114
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:42,692
[COCYTUS]
Yeah, so did I.

115
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,650
So, where exactly is
she working part time?

116
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:46,942
[AINS]
The convenience store.

117
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,400
No, it's the supermarket.

118
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:49,567
The doughnut shop.

119
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,525
Ramen place.

120
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,942
The karaoke club.

121
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,233
[COCYTUS]
The craft store.

122
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:54,942
Say what?

123
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:56,692
[AQUA]
Are you getting into crafting?

124
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:58,317
I think you could make
something really cool!

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,233
[COCYTUS]
You do?

126
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,442
[AQUA]
Totally!

127
00:06:00,525 --> 00:06:02,650
Let's try to stay on
topic here, you guys.

128
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,483
She was working the counter
at the butcher shop.

129
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,692
This is getting kinda weird.

130
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:07,983
[VISHA]
Morning everyone!

131
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:11,233
Oh, uh, is there something
going on here?

132
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,358
Yes, Lieutenant, since you
mentioned it, there is.

133
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:16,150
[PANDORA'S ACTOR] It's almost
time for us all to join together

134
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:19,192
under the banner of knowledge!
The spirit of learning!

135
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,150
Or as some might
call it, "Class!"

136
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,192
So sit down and shut up!

137
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:26,858
Ah, so you found out I
was working part-time jobs?

138
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,358
Sorry 'bout that.

139
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,775
It's cool.

140
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,692
I mean, like, it's not against
the rules or anything.

141
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:34,150
But we were all
just wondering why.

142
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:37,858
Well, honestly, it's because...

143
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,358
[gasps]

144
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,733
[VISHA] It's really the only
thing I can think about.

145
00:06:49,817 --> 00:06:51,858
The cafeteria's special menu?

146
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:53,817
Do you know if anybody's
ordered it yet?

147
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,733
Well, not me.

148
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,483
[AINS]
It's 30,000 yen, right?

149
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,108
Seems like too much
money to blow on lunch.

150
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,608
[KAZUMA]
That's a lotta chili, bro.

151
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:03,317
[AINS] I'd rather spend my
money on something worthwhile.

152
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,525
How is it not worthwhile?
It's called a special!

153
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:07,650
It's in the name!

154
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,192
I mean, everybody's
curious about it,

155
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:10,692
but you're working way too much.

156
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,108
Oh, it's not so bad.

157
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,858
I found if you work at
a place, they feed you.

158
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,858
I just couldn't stop seeing
foods I wanted to try.

159
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,442
[bell beeps]

160
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,775
[CHRIS] Okay, that makes
sense for her,

161
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,525
but why'd you decide
to get a job too?

162
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,400
Well, after hearing her talk
it up, I started to get

163
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:30,483
curious about what was going
on with this special menu.

164
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,400
Yeah? And now
everyone's working, huh?

165
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:35,358
Yep. Check out these
awesome aprons.

166
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:39,192
Subaru and his crew are
at the karaoke club?

167
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,900
'Scuse me! Uh...

168
00:07:40,983 --> 00:07:43,317
--[CZ] Ah...!
--[LUPUSREGINA] Oh yeah!

169
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,317
CZ's doing the death voice!

170
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,275
[SUBARU] I don't have a clue
what you're talking about,

171
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,983
but that is super creepy!

172
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,192
[AUREOLE]
I see, the mysterious Subaru.

173
00:07:51,275 --> 00:07:53,442
Are you working here,
or something?

174
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,692
Not sure where the "mysterious"
nickname came from.

175
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,692
But, yeah! And I
brought your order.

176
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:58,983
What the...?

177
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,358
How the hell did the
honeytoast just disappear?

178
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,150
[ENTOMA] You probably just
dropped it somewhere,

179
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,483
doncha think?

180
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,900
[SUBARU]
No freaking way.

181
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,858
You'll just have to
make another one, then!

182
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:09,942
[SUBARU] Hey, what are you
chewing on right now?

183
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:11,317
Spit it out!

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,025
I'm not chewing on anything.

185
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:16,025
[SUBARU] That's because you
gulped it down! I heard it!

186
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:18,358
--He's been gone a while.
--[phone rings]

187
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:21,358
Yes? Keep the room
one more hour?

188
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,400
We've got a single in
room three, boss.

189
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:25,192
They want another hour.

190
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,483
[TOUGH GUY]
Hm?

191
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:43,192
Okay, here we go.

192
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:50,233
--[KAZUMA] Look out!
--[AINS] Could it be...?

193
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:51,817
Stay on guard!

194
00:08:54,108 --> 00:08:55,608
[ALL gasp]

195
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,192
So what's up?

196
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,942
[AINS]
Nothing, apparently.

197
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:01,692
[TOUGH GUY]
Here comes the special!

198
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,275
[ALL gasp]

199
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:04,942
[KAZUMA]
Holy crap!

200
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,192
[SUBARU]
Wait. The buthcher?

201
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,108
[AINS]
It's the convenience store guy!

202
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,608
[TANYA]
You mean the doughnut shop.

203
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:11,483
[COCYTUS]
No.

204
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:12,525
[DEMIURGE]
No. No.

205
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,942
[SHALLTEAR]
No. No. No. And, No.

206
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:16,692
Heh!

207
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:21,400
[VISHA gasps]
Yay!

208
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,442
Oh, that's something special!

209
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:33,525
[TANYA] Right, uh, is it just
the size that makes

210
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,567
it special, or what?

211
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,608
Everything else is normal,
so, well, what now?

212
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,233
I mean, we all did
earn a little money.

213
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:44,942
[AINS] But we don't need to
spend any of it on that.

214
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,192
Agreed.

215
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:49,442
[VISHA] Oh my god.
This is freaking amazing!

216
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,025
[TANYA]
Coffee's on me!

217
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:53,358
I feel like I owe you at least
that much for putting up with

218
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,483
my harebrained
subordinate's goofiness.

219
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,858
[SUBARU]
Cool! I'll take an iced, please!

220
00:09:57,942 --> 00:09:59,067
[KAZUMA]
Same.

221
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,567
[AINS] I can't drink,
but I'd like a cup.

222
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,108
Why do you want one if
you can't even drink it?

223
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:04,733
[AINS]
It just seems sad to me.

224
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:07,108
I never imagined that
you'd say something cute.

225
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:09,108
[AINS]
Hey. Don't call me cute.

226
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,483
[REM] I just can't wrap my head
around how she can possibly

227
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,233
eat that much food?

228
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:17,233
And it can all fit inside that
tiny little body? Like... how?

229
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,525
She's the living embodiment
of the word, "gluttony."

230
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,817
She's terrifying.

231
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,733
[VISHA cheers]
This is the best day of my life!
