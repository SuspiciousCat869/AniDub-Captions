00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:25,516
Mr. Roswaal, is it true that we're
having a school festival soon?

2
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:27,351
A school festival?

3
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,186
It looks like it's true.

4
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:31,104
"Rabbits" "What do they eat?"
Nobody told us.

5
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:34,608
Oh, I didn't teeeell you?

6
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:36,443
No.

7
00:00:36,443 --> 00:00:38,195
So, when is it?

8
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,905
Next week.

9
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,532
That's really soon!

10
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:45,577
So, do we have to do something?

11
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:47,788
Correeeect!

12
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:51,542
And if you can make it a successsssss...

13
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:55,045
We might possibly, perchance,
mayhap, be able to go home.

14
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:56,046
Nope!

I believe that you'll make the

I believe that you'll make the

It sounds like fun!

41
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:38,482
A lot more fun than field day, anyway!

42
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:41,360
We can eat a lot of
yummy food at the stalls, too.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,028
Chocolate banana!

44
00:02:44,905 --> 00:02:49,743
So, sir, what will we be doing
at the festival as a class?

45
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:53,497
Well, you have two things you'll be doing...

46
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,541
One, a food stall!

47
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,334
Chocolate banana!

48
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:02,172
And the other is a play!

49
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:03,298
A play!

50
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:08,011
Class 1 is doing <i>The Ugly Duckling</i>, they saaaay.

51
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:12,516
Sister, I don't need to turn around
to tell that you're looking at me.

52
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:15,602
I'm not sitting here thinking that you're ugly.

53
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,729
I do find you disgusting, however.

54
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,565
I saw that coming.

55
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:23,402
You can see that far into the future?

56
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,028
While we're on the subject,

57
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:28,323
why don't we decide what
we'll be selling at our food stall,

58
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:31,660
and what we'll be doing in our plaaaaaaay!

59
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,411
"Nurse's Office"
and what we'll be doing in our plaaaaaaay!

60
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,704
"Nurse's Office"
So Class 2 ended up picking <i>Cinderella</i>, huh?

61
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:36,999
So Class 2 ended up picking <i>Cinderella</i>, huh?

62
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:41,086
Indeed. It was a safe choice.

63
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,922
It's a great story, though!

64
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,382
Right, Naofumi?

65
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:46,300
Yeah.

66
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,721
I love the scene at the end where
the evil women get what's coming to them!

67
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,807
So you're the prince, Rem?

68
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:56,185
Yes. I'm the prince.

69
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,353
And my sister is Cinderella.

70
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:04,359
I'm very nervous about being her co-star,
but I'm going to do my best.

71
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,236
You drew lots for it, huh?

72
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:08,530
Yes. It's an amazing coincidence.

73
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,325
I refuse to accept this.

74
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:17,039
The only royalty in this world,
of any type, is Lord Ains!

75
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,667
But if Ains is the prince,

76
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:24,129
that means he'll end up with Ram, the princess.

77
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,757
That can't happen!

78
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:28,300
Then it all worked out for the best, huh?

79
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,970
But I can't accept the role he got!

80
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,098
What role did he get?

81
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:38,727
Lord Ains is with those humans...

82
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:40,521
Humans?

83
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:42,689
They're the horses.

84
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,899
Horses?

85
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,194
He and the humans he worked with
during the field day

86
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,655
are going to be horses that pull the carriage!

87
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,950
A supreme being, playing a horse?

88
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,285
What's wrong with being a horse?

89
00:04:55,285 --> 00:04:57,496
Everything!

90
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:01,124
He's lucky. I'm The Ugly Duckling.

Should I go watch you quack?

93
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:14,304
Maybe I'll go see your
supreme being neigh, then?

94
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,098
Stop it, guys!

Yes. Also, he means that he
wants me to go buy supplies with him,

105
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,496
not that he wants me to be his girlfriend.

Perhaps this is to be expected, I wonder?

Are you in awe of our grand creation?

Looks like something big crushed it.

No, I'm the one who worked hard making him.

Aren't you glad you saw it on
the day before instead of tomorrow?

164
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:20,490
Yeah. There's still time to remake it...

165
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,076
No! I don't want to remake him!

166
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:26,288
--It was really hard!
--Aqua!

167
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:28,081
No! No way!

168
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,334
If you want to make it,
make it yourself, Kazuma!

169
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,502
Hell no!

170
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:35,255
We won't get it done by tomorrow
unless we all work together!

171
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,507
Aqua.

172
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,967
I said no, and when I said no, I meant no!

173
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,764
Aqua.

174
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:53,398
Aqua, we need to make
the school festival a success.

175
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,317
You understand that, right?

176
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:57,945
You don't need to tell me! I know!

177
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:59,571
That's why I worked hard!

178
00:08:59,571 --> 00:09:02,741
But look what happened to it!

179
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,826
We can't get it done by tomorrow!

180
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:06,078
Let's do our best.

181
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,871
It's really hard!

182
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,165
Let's do our best.

183
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,251
The pressure is incredible.

184
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:16,797
If we have to get it done by tomorrow,
let's start it right now!

185
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:19,299
Let's at least eat lunch first.

186
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:21,635
Let's start now.

187
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:25,472
There's no time,
so let's just do a half-assed job.

188
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:28,600
--That's the best way--
--Let's do it right.

189
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,644
From step one?

190
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:32,437
No.

191
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:33,856
From step zero!

192
00:09:38,652 --> 00:09:40,654
What's going on?

193
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:44,741
A really nice scene just got ruined.
That's what happened.

194
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:06,555
<i>I've got special makeup on today</i>

195
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:09,516
<i>My boobs are padded 50% more than normal!</i>

196
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:11,894
<i>I've got a demon's smile on my face</i>

197
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:15,189
<i>Is it time for my big debut?</i>

198
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:18,358
<i>I've never done something like this! It's rough!</i>

199
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:21,028
<i>Time to show everyone how gallant I am!</i>

200
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:23,947
<i>That's right! Show the whole world my charm!</i>

201
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,283
<i>All right, everyone, let's calm down!</i>

202
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:29,328
<i>Voices warmed up!</i>

203
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,831
<i>Rehearsal went perfectly!</i>

204
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,293
<i>I'm saying all kinds of crazy stuff,</i>

205
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:39,171
<i>and my ad-libs are blowing up in my face!</i>

206
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,967
<i>The ditzy girls are about to</i>
<i>put on an amazing show!</i>

207
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:47,638
<i>Welcome! Come in, sit right down!</i>

208
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:50,599
<i>It's a miraculous collaboration!</i>

209
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:56,563
<i>When the four of us get together,</i>
<i>it's a sold-out house!</i>

210
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:59,274
<i>The acting is terrible,</i>

211
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:02,236
<i>but the fights are so realistic!</i>

212
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,947
<i>It's a messed-up quartet,</i>

213
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:09,159
<i>aiming for a happy ending!</i>

214
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:14,081
Fine!

215
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,416
Is this your doing as well?

216
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,960
Of course not.

217
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,048
It's a sign that something beyond
our expectations is happpppening.

218
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:28,428
And yet, the school festival must go on?

219
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,682
That won't change, I'm sure.

220
00:11:31,682 --> 00:11:36,019
Continuing this school life,

221
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,062
--and continuing to test them?

222
00:11:37,062 --> 00:11:39,731
--Okay, let's get to work!
--and continuing to test them?

223
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:40,357
--Yeah, let's get to it!
--and continuing to test them?

224
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,651
--Yeah, let's get to it!
--That's the top priority

225
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,112
we've been given, huh?

226
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:47,823
As always, it's a tough job.

227
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:52,828
The Goddess of Fate must have it out for us.

228
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:55,455
There are no gods.

229
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,126
Whether they exist or not,

230
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:01,128
--Emilia, hold that end, would you?
--who knows if the choice we're making

231
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:03,255
--Okay, got it.
--is the right one?

232
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:03,964
--Aqua, get to work!
--is the right one?

233
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:04,882
--Aqua, get to work!
--The answer is up to them, I supppppose.

234
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:07,134
--It's heavy.
--The answer is up to them, I supppppose.

235
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:08,552
--Let's do our best.
--The answer is up to them, I supppppose.

236
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:10,679
--The answer is up to them, I supppppose.
