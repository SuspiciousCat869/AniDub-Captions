Are you having fun
at the school festival, everyone?

Yes! We are, ma'am!

00:00:26,933 --> 00:00:30,478
I know you're looking forward to
a chance to let loose.

5
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:35,567
But drinking the water of life
is against the rules. Got it?

6
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:40,613
Yes. Thus, the probability that Captain Weiss
will cause a problem is now very low.

00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:41,781
Yup!

Come on, Seiya, let me have some fun!

You missed!

00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:40,131
Ha, ha!

33
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,509
Shut up, Kazuma!

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,762
I may not be the best,
but I can at least get one!

35
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:50,016
The play's about to begin, though.

36
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:52,310
You're distracting me, so shut up!

37
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,230
Go on, I'll catch up!

38
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:59,150
--Another miss!
--Let's get going.

39
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,985
Yeah, let's do that, I guess.

40
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:05,198
I'll stay with Aqua. Go on ahead.

41
00:02:05,198 --> 00:02:08,159
Emilia, you can just ignore her.

42
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,828
Don't say that.

43
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:12,539
It's fine. I'll catch up.

44
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,207
Okay, if you say so.

45
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,583
See you later!

46
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,295
I'm looking forward to the play!

47
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,715
Emilia's a total angel.

48
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:24,968
Let me guess what you're thinking.

49
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:29,723
You don't have to guess. It's "I wish I could
trade her for my party of losers!"

00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,975
It is, huh?

51
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:33,143
I guess you really want to

52
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:36,312
get up close and personal
with my Explosion Magic, huh?

53
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:38,648
Yeah, something like that.

Matches... Buy some matches, please!

55
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:46,239
You're disgusting! Don't touch me!

56
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,829
Nobody would help the little girl.

57
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,958
--She can do all these parts herself?
--It's terrible! How could
someone do this to me?

00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,419
--Amazing!
--I beg you!

59
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,628
--How much time has she spent alone?
--Get lost!

60
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:04,924
--How much time has she spent alone?
--How terrible! How terrible! I'm so cold!

61
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:08,720
It's time.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,180
Yeah.

63
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,473
Hey, Kazuma.

64
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:13,016
Hey, it's the cheater.

65
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:15,727
You sound like Subaru.

66
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,854
Hey, it's Reinhard the Cheater.

67
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,397
I just said that.

68
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:21,608
We said the same things, huh?

69
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,193
You're good friends, huh?

70
00:03:24,152 --> 00:03:29,449
Last time I let you guys have the starring role,
but this time, Class 1 will win.

00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,242
I'm afraid...

72
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:34,454
...this time we'll win again!

73
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:36,206
Ains.

74
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:38,249
Please don't look up.

75
00:03:38,249 --> 00:03:39,834
Just look at me from here down.

76
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,670
From here down.

77
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,257
What is this?

78
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:48,009
You look so cute, Naofumi!

79
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:51,054
You're so cute, Master!

80
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:53,431
This is impossible!

81
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:56,476
Quit whining, bro!

82
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:58,770
You guys are looking good!

83
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,730
--Go break a leg!

84
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,398
--That's rough.
--Go break a leg!

85
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,232
--That's rough.
--And then break the other leg!

86
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,025
--I sympathize.
--And then break the other leg!

87
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:04,859
--Wait! Why do you sympathize
--And then break the other leg!

88
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,778
--Wait! Why do you sympathize
--And then a nose! Then a spine!

89
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:09,364
--with him and not me?
--And then a nose! Then a spine!

90
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:14,619
A cute horsey!

91
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,413
Thanks.

92
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,456
You're cute, horsey.

93
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:21,668
Are we all making fun of me now?

94
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:25,046
What's up?

95
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:27,507
I got a message from Albedo.

96
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:28,341
What is it?

97
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:33,471
Lord Ains, the mobile fortress Destroyer
has appeared at the school again.

98
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,723
What?

99
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:52,532
Albedo!

100
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,373
This is the enemy we fought before.

101
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:01,708
That's right.

102
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,505
That's the mobile fortress Destroyer.

103
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,883
It's got lots of legs and
it stomps on everything,

104
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:12,218
and for some reason, kids really like it!

105
00:05:12,218 --> 00:05:13,678
I can really understand that!

106
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,722
It's got lots of legs and it's cute!

107
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,975
But it's also heading this way, right?

108
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,021
If we can't stop it,
the school festival is ruined, right?

109
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,314
That's right.

110
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:28,234
It would ruin the performance
of a supreme being.

111
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,445
That cannot be allowed!

112
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:34,616
It seems the Destroyer has returned.

113
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,826
What's going on?

114
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:41,289
Is this another trick of the teachers,
like during field day?

115
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,751
It's not, unfortunatelyyyyy.

116
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,752
What?

117
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:52,008
It seems this world is even more
complicated than I expeeeeected.

118
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:56,096
The world never goes like you'll expect.

119
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:58,473
Of course...

120
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:01,768
Anyway, let's go stop the Destroyer.

121
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:03,645
--Yes.
--Yeah. Let's do it.

122
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:06,481
I'm afraid...

123
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,317
...you can't!

124
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:10,318
Why?

125
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:15,240
Because your play is beginning.

126
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,535
You have to do it.

127
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,578
Is this festival that important?

128
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:21,913
Yes.

129
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,249
I believe it is.

130
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:29,087
Mr. Ros-<i>chi</i>, what happens
if we protect this world?

131
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:31,381
Even I don't know that.

132
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:37,595
But I'm sure a wonderful future
is waiting for ussss...

133
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:41,808
And is there really nobody in this world

134
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:45,770
you can rely upon except yourseeeelves?

135
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,981
What does that mean?

136
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,654
There's no need to worry.

137
00:06:54,654 --> 00:07:00,035
We will destroy the Destroyer
before it can interrupt your play.

138
00:07:00,035 --> 00:07:00,952
Correct?

139
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:02,412
Yes. Let's do it.

140
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:03,747
Fine.

141
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,957
I'll show you my true strength!

142
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,959
Puck, will you help me?

143
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,544
Of course.

144
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,838
My beautiful daughter.

145
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:15,091
Then we'll leave it to you.

146
00:07:16,843 --> 00:07:19,596
Albedo, Aqua, Emilia, Visha.

147
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:21,056
They say they'll stop it.

148
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:22,265
Madness.

149
00:07:22,265 --> 00:07:24,642
No, it's not.

150
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,852
What?

151
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,021
Emilia's got Puck with her.

152
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,981
And Albedo's pretty tough, too, right?

153
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:33,526
In terms of simple combat strength,
she's quite powerful.

154
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:36,529
And you said Visha's good at defense.

155
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:40,825
If Aqua doesn't ruin everything, we'll be fine.

156
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:43,411
I was fine a moment ago, but now I'm worried.

157
00:07:43,411 --> 00:07:44,913
Yes. Me, too.

158
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:47,290
There's no sense in worrying about it.

159
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,002
We have to do our jobs.

160
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:56,299
Subaru, I understand
your desire to go to Emilia.

161
00:07:56,299 --> 00:07:58,343
We feel the same.

162
00:07:58,343 --> 00:08:00,470
--But...
--Naofumi.

163
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:05,433
Fortunately, there's time before
Filo and I have to go on stage.

164
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:08,520
--Can we go help?
--Yes.

165
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,479
I'll go, too, then.

166
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,315
You have an important part.

167
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:16,695
And... you can't fight like that.

168
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:22,200
Naofumi, let's entrust everything to them.

169
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,410
Naofumi!

170
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,120
Master!

171
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:29,040
Raphtalia. Filo.

172
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,792
Just don't do anything stupid.

173
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,377
Yes!

174
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,714
--Let's get going then.
--Yeah.

175
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,591
Well, Class 1 may not need to do anything.

176
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:41,678
Everyone will be moved to tears
at our performance...

177
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:43,722
You've got a lot of confidence.

178
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:46,266
We're pretty good, too, though.

179
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:49,936
{\an8}
Surreal. This is extremely surreal.

180
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:50,270
{\an8}"Dressing Room 2"
Surreal. This is extremely surreal.

181
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,355
{\an8}"Dressing Room 2"
I understand.

182
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:56,484
But Aqua is the fairy godmother.
If she's there...

183
00:08:56,484 --> 00:09:00,989
That's right. Aqua's the only one with a part.

184
00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:02,032
Megumin!

185
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:03,825
What is it, Kazuma?

186
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,410
You wrote the script, right?

187
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,412
Yes. Why?

188
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,748
Then you know the lines, right?

189
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,458
You take Aqua's part.

190
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,417
I refuse!

191
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,711
I'm not ready...

192
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:17,422
Megumin, it's an emergency...

193
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:20,467
I'm afraid I must refuse.

194
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:24,304
You're right. It's too tough a role for you.

195
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:25,680
What?

196
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,602
It's got a lot of lines. You're not ready.

197
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:34,981
No "normal person" could pull it off.

198
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,483
Indeed.

199
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:38,693
Megumin's a "normal" person.

200
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,904
She would never agree to take such a risk.

201
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:43,865
You realize that even among the
highly intelligent crimson demons,

202
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,117
I'm considered a genius, right?

203
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,495
Listen, nobody says you have to do this.

204
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:54,334
Highly intelligent or not, you can't
learn all those lines by the time...

205
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:57,212
I can! It'll be easy!

206
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:58,630
Very well!

207
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,803
I shall become the grand wizard,
and guide Cinderella to the ball!

208
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:05,762
Grin.

209
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:08,515
I thought it was fairy godmother,
not grand wizard.

210
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:10,433
Let it go.

211
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:15,397
All we have to do now
is make the play a success!

212
00:10:16,731 --> 00:10:19,025
You're all ready?

213
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:21,027
We have to do our best!

214
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,987
Are you ready, Aqua?

215
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,618
I don't like the fact that a devil is
running things, but we have a shared goal.

216
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,620
Let's do it!

217
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,294
Here we go, everyone!

218
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:41,673
Okay, let's do our best, everyone!

219
00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:43,091
Yeah!

220
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,863
<i>I've got special makeup on today</i>

221
00:11:04,863 --> 00:11:07,824
<i>My boobs are padded 50% more than normal!</i>

222
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:10,201
<i>I've got a demon's smile on my face</i>

223
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:13,496
<i>Is it time for my big debut?</i>

224
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:16,666
<i>I've never done something like this! It's rough!</i>

225
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,336
<i>Time to show everyone how gallant I am!</i>

226
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:22,255
<i>That's right! Show the whole world my charm!</i>

227
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:24,591
<i>All right, everyone, let's calm down!</i>

228
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:27,635
<i>Voices warmed up!</i>

229
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:31,139
<i>Rehearsal went perfectly!</i>

230
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,601
<i>I'm saying all kinds of crazy stuff,</i>

231
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,479
<i>and my ad-libs are blowing up in my face!</i>

232
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:42,275
<i>The ditzy girls are about to</i>
<i>put on an amazing show!</i>

233
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:45,945
<i>Welcome! Come in, sit right down!</i>

234
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:48,865
<i>It's a miraculous collaboration!</i>

235
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:54,871
<i>When the four of us get together,</i>
<i>it's a sold-out house!</i>

236
00:11:54,871 --> 00:11:57,582
<i>The acting is terrible,</i>

237
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:00,543
<i>but the fights are so realistic!</i>

238
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:03,254
<i>It's a messed-up quartet,</i>

239
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:07,467
<i>aiming for a happy ending!</i>
