Love.

Most beautiful, most noble,
and the most diligent, diligent,

Its day is upon us!

00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:24,483
The day you show the ones
you love what's inside.

00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:28,025
That day is "Valentine's Day!"

6
00:00:28,108 --> 00:00:29,317
Death!

7
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:02,025
Valentine's Day, huh?

8
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:04,817
Indeed. That's what
it's known as.

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,567
Kazuma told us about it.

10
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,942
He said you show your love
by gifting cheap chocolate.

11
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,317
Huh?

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,275
I don't know. I absolutely
love chocolate.

13
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:18,442
So If I had some I'd probably
just keep it for myself.

14
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:21,483
What about you?
Giving chocolate to anyone?

15
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,192
Yeah, to Kazuma.

16
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:25,275
Wow, you answered that quick.

17
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:28,275
It would be a pretty big
power move, to be honest.

18
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:30,400
He told us that his mom
is the only one who's ever

19
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,692
given him chocolate.

20
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,233
Huh.

21
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:36,025
What about you Emilia, do you
have anyone special in mind?

22
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,608
[EMILIA]
Hm... Puck, maybe?

23
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,567
Yay! And I can give
you some in return!

24
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,692

It's a plan!

[PUCK chuckles]

26
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,733
I don't actually think
that's how it works.

00:02:46,817 --> 00:02:48,858
Huh? Major!

28
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:51,983
Hey, you girls aren't
plotting something, are you?

29
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,483
Who, us?

30
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:56,608
Actually, we were talking about
Valentine's Day just now.

31
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,525
Valentine's Day, huh?

32
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:01,150
That's one of my
favorite examples

33
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:05,025
of a true marketplace victory.
Of capitalism beating religion.

34
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,025
[PUCK] Guess that's
one way to look at it.

35
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,608
So does that mean
you're gonna celebrate

36
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:10,817
by giving chocolate
to somebody?

37
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,108
I'd really prefer not, to be
perfectly candid with you.

38
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,192
If I could expense it,
then maybe.

39
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,525
There might be room in the
budget for a little bit.

40
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:21,192
It could be considered
as a kind of "duty."

41
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,983
Given as a duty?

42
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,192
Yeah. I mean what
else would you call

43

you're forced to be around?

44
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,525
Like the people
at work or school.

45
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,608
You have to give away
a lot of it, huh?

46
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:35,733
Don't worry, it doesn't
have to be high quality.

47
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:36,775
Really just a token.

48
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:38,067
Good to know.

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,400
Well, okay.

00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:41,858
I guess, it's my duty
to give some to Subaru.

51

You're really using
your brain there, Lia.

Sucks to be Subaru, huh?

and every last bit of
love that you have!

There are a plethora of ways
to prepare chocolate treats.

So tell me, which of those
paths will you chose to take?

71
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,942
I think the best way,

72
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:33,483
given that Lord Ains is the
supreme commander of the undead,

73
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,692
is to lavish him with
dark chocolate

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,442
to match his dark spirit!

75
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:41,650
Ah, I see. So the taste of
dark adult bitterness, eh?

76
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:44,233
Only the darkest chocolate
is fit for him!

00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,775
And the secret
ingredient will be...

...love!

tear away my clothes and expose
my naughty bits to the prying

00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:54,733
[WEISS]
Give me... choco!

163
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:57,192
Ah! The hell's wrong with you?

164
00:07:57,275 --> 00:08:02,983
[WEISS]
Please give me... choco!

165
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,942
Get back, eyebrows! You wanna
hurt someone, start with me!

166
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,358
Now give me... choco!

167
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:11,775
[REM]
Al Huma!

168
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,442
[WEISS groans]

169
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,400
[SHALLTEAR]
So, shall we go?

170
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:20,150
[REM]
Yes, let's.

171
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,442
But why? All I wanted was
to taste chocolate again.

172
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:25,317
Ya see?

173
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,692
Yeah, he got creamed!

174
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:29,567
So this is how you set
the poor guy straight?

175
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,483
[WEISS]
Hm?

176
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,025
Huh? What happened?

177
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:38,983
Why is Weiss on the floor
in that tattered uniform?

178
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,608
Major.

179
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:44,525
Come on. Speak up. Explain this.

180
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,817
[WEISS]
Give...

181
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,150
[TANYA]
Huh?

182
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:51,442
[WEISS]
Give me... choco.

183
00:08:51,525 --> 00:08:54,442
Oh. I'm sorry Weiss.

184
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,608
[WEISS]
For what?

185
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:58,275
Because, you got bad intel.

186
00:08:58,358 --> 00:08:59,942
[SUBARU sighs]

187
00:09:00,025 --> 00:09:02,192
[BETELGEUSE chuckling]
How splendid.

188
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,067
This is actually, amazingly,
truly splendid!

189
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,067
True love given edible,
corporeal form!

190
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,358
[BETELGEUSE, ALBEDO]
Death!

191
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:16,108
What are you two doing here?
Suspicious. Hm...?

192
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:18,025
I'm making chocolate
for Lord Ains!

193
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,983
The ruthless ruler of my heart.

194
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,317
Diligently!
So diligently for love!

195
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,900
I know all too well what
one does for love.

196
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:27,483
But, who is this man?

197
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,900
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, sir.

198
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:32,483
I am the apostle of
most diligent love.

199
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:36,317
Archbishop of the Sin of Sloth,
Betelgeuse Romanée-Conti!

200
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,567
Death!

201
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,858
[SEBAS] You're trespassing
on school grounds.

202
00:09:39,942 --> 00:09:41,025
Death!

203
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,858
[BETELGEUSE]
Death!

204
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,233
Death...!

205
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,025
[BETELGEUSE]
Well, it matters not.

206
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:52,983
For I have realized the
thrust of my mission here.

207
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:56,858
Wait. My diligent love
sense is tingling again.

208
00:09:56,942 --> 00:10:01,733
Pulling me towards a miasma
of love! I must go! Death!

209
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:04,567
I thank you, love's apostle.

210
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,983
[SUBARU] Huh? 'Sup Albedo?
You whipping up some chocolate?

211
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,817
Yes indeed. By the way,

212
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,150
what do you think of
my Valentine's treat?

213
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,733
All I want is to
please Lord Ains.

214
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:18,567
[SUBARU]
Uh...

215
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,483
[ALBEDO]
It screams love, right?

216
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:23,067
I put all the love I
have into making it!

217
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,983
I'd say the overall
design definitely

218
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:28,150
screams something, alright,
but I believe you.

219
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:31,400
Maybe that your
love is forceful?

220
00:10:31,483 --> 00:10:32,483
Death.

221
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,983
[MOMONGA]
Look at all this chocolate.

222
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,817
Too bad I'm allergic.
