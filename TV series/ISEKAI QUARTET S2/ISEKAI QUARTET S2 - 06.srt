1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,942
This is madness! Do you even
have a brain in that skull?

2
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:17,150
[AINS] You're the one who
should have their head examined!

3
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:19,358
Just stop with all
the yelling, would ya?

4
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:21,358
Shut up and stay in
your lane, tracksuit.

5
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:22,983
This does not concern you.

6
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:25,817
[AINS] I had thought you and
I understood one another.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,108
You understand nothing! Hmph!

8
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,150
[AINS]
Hmph!

9
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:31,233
What in the hell has
gotten into you?

10
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,358
So you guys like different
stuff on your chicken wings,

11
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:35,525
big freakin' deal!

12
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,858
Ram and I went to that
li'l butcher shop

13
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:10,900
down on the corner
the other day.

14
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:14,233
Their wings were to die for!
Like meaty chunks of heaven.

15
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:15,692
[TANYA]
Oh yeah?

16
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,317
You thought they
were awesome, didn't you?

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,692
Yes, and I'm willing to
bet even Mister Roswaal

18
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:21,150
would go gaga for them.

19
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,608
[COCYTUS]
They're that good?

20
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,192
They're amazing! And if you
haven't tried them before,

21
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,400
you've wasted your life!

22
00:02:26,483 --> 00:02:27,733
[COCYTUS]
They're that good?

23
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:29,442
And you call yourself a warrior.

24
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,233
[COCYTUS]
They're that good?

25
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,900
Is that so? Then I suppose
I'll have to try them.

26
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:37,317
Hey, Ains! Would you like
to go to the butcher shop

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,108
with me after school today?

28
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,442
Rumor has it they
have killer wings!

29
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:44,317
[AINS]
Hm. I must say I'm intrigued.

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,442
[MOMONGA]
Sucks that I can't eat them.

31
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:47,650
[AINS]
What do you think?

32
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,692
I wouldn't dream of
going against the wishes

33
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:52,025
of a being as supreme
as you, My Lord.

34
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:53,733
[SUBARU] I'm sorry I put
myself in the middle

35
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,483
of your ridiculous argument.

36
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:57,483
[TANYA] You're in it now,
so I'll ask you.

37
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,900
How do you like to flavor
your chicken wings?

38
00:02:59,983 --> 00:03:02,442
With some salt and pepper,
or with ketchup?

39
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:03,608
With mayo.

40
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:05,317
Looks like I'll be
fighting you as well.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
[SUBARU]
Huh?

42
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:07,942
[AINS]
I can't hide my utter disgust.

43
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:11,858
Huh? How could anyone with
taste buds not use mayo?

44
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,192
[ERICH] At the risk
of breaking up this

45
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,692
riveting intellectual
discussion,

46
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:18,983
I'll remind you that
class is in session.

47
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:24,233
[exhales]

48
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,483
[ERICH]
When people gather together,

49
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,692
it's inevitable that
differences of opinion,

50
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:30,108
both large and small,
will arise.

51
00:03:30,192 --> 00:03:32,608
It appears this current conflict
centers around the question,

52
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:35,650
"what do you like on
your chicken wings?"

53
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,233
It sounds even more idiotic
when you say it out loud.

54
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,525
Ahem. I propose that
we clear things up

55
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:42,900
by conducting a quick survey.

56
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:48,067
[ERICH] And we've got a
deadlock on our hands.

57
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,900
I thought you ladies would
vote the same way as Subaru.

58
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:53,442
To share his preference
would bring me great shame.

59
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,150
I usually agree with
everything he says.

60
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,983
But not this time.
It's killing me!

61
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,192
[AINS] You prefer your
wings with ketchup, too?

62
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,067
Who're we to question the
wisdom of one so supreme?

63
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,358
It'd be heresy.

64
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:06,525
[AINS]
Hm?

65
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:07,817
[COCYTUS]
Please don't consider my vote

66
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,358
to be a show
of disloyalty, my lord.

67
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:11,858
[MOMONGA] I wonder if
that can be modified

68
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,358
in the character settings.

69
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:14,942
So you're a ketchup girl?

70
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,942
No. I'm a Crimson Demon,

71
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:19,233
so naturally, I choose
the crimson sauce!

72
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:20,442
What about the cat?

73
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,942
Ketchup, obviously.

74
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,233
[CHOMUSUKE meows]

75
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,567
[KAZUMA] Team Mayo seems
to have the most people.

76
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,233
[SUBARU] Yep. And that's
because mayo absolutely slaps!

77
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:30,400
End of discussion!

78
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:31,525
[AINS, TANYA]
It's because you're basic!

79
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,067
Hey now!

80
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,442
[TANYA] Hmph. Once again it
seems democracy has failed us.

81
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:37,983
[AINS]
Then how do we decide?

82
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,483
Through brute force
and subjugation?

83
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:41,275
[ERICH]
Perhaps.

84
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,650
Huh?

85
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:45,858
I propose that this be
our weapon of choice.

86
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,317
[SUBARU]
A ball?

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,858
[ERICH] They say, "justice
without force is powerless."

88
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,358
We'll have justice
through dodgeball!

89
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,567
[AINS]
Sounds perfectly reasonable.

90
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,233
Do you agree? Team Ketchup
will take no prisoners!

91
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,483
And team salt will
pull no punches.

92
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:04,317
In time, you'll rue this day.
If you survive the battle.

93
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,817
Not so sure about Team
Mayo's chances here.

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,067
Come on. I'm standing
right here. You know that.

95
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,483
Gird your loins, everyone,

96
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,483
and head out to
the playing field!

97
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,692
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

98
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:17,317
We'll need to even out
the teams a little bit.

99
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:24,192
Basically, put your
magic power into this ball,

100
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:26,192
and who ever it hits is out.

101
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,442
[NAOFUMI]
Hold up!

102
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,858
[ERICH]
Hm?

103
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,692
I would like to know what
exactly we're doing here.

104
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,900
[ERICH]
Ending a debate.

105
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,983
What is that
supposed to mean?

106
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,025
Just go with it, man. We're so
happy to have you on the team!

107
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,983
Hang on. I never
agreed to anythi--!

Appreciate it.

I still don't understand.

Team Salt and Pepper will be
counting on you, soldier.

112

What is this?

lighten up a little and play!

game looks so fun!

Okay, fine.

sword to your shield, but...

It doesn't bother me at all.

the fact you chose ketchup.

making fun of me!

159
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,775
Listen up, everybody.

160
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:33,442
The Axis Order is a benevolent
and merciful religion.

161
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,775
That said,

162
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,233
I'll smite anyone who gets
between me and my mayo!

163
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,733
[AQUA]
Ha! God blow!

164
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,108
[VISHA]
The move is kinda cool,

165
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,525
but what in the heck was
that ridiculous intro about?

166
00:07:43,608 --> 00:07:47,650
Stand back! Walls of Jericho!

167
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,650
Did you really have to
pretzel-ize me to pull that off?

168
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,858
Meow?

169
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,358
There is seriously
something up with that cat!

170
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,900
My cat is perfectly normal,
thank you!

171
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:59,317
I've never seen a "normal cat"
do anything like--

172
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,442
[gasps]
Here it comes!

173
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,358
Boop.

174
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,317
[SUBARU]
Appalachian Mountains!

175
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,275
Really! You should
stay focused, I suppose!

176
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,858
Thanks a lot, Bea-ko!

177
00:08:09,942 --> 00:08:10,692
Help me!

178
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,400
I've got this, Lia!

179
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:15,025
Okay, that is most certainly
not a normal cat!

180
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,400
It's a perfectly not-normal cat!

181
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,067
Sorry!

182
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,483
[TANYA] Shield Man! We can't
lose to the Mayo Freaks!

183
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,567
Total overkill, ya know!

184
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,608
[AINS]
So, then.

185
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:36,817
I believe it is time to end
this farce once and for all.

186
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,983
Such a cool thing to say.
And speaking of cool...

187
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,483
[AINS]
Hm.

188
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,817
I have an awesome idea for
what our next move should be.

189
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,733
[AINS]
Oh?

190
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:46,733
[MEGUMIN whispers]

191
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,067
[AINS]
Excellent. I concur.

192
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,733
Check this out, guys!

193
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:54,317
We drink the blood,
the crimson offering!

194
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,692
[TANYA]
A combo attack?

195
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:58,942
We feast upon the, uh...
Are you just standing there?

196
00:08:59,025 --> 00:08:59,775
[AINS]
Hm?

197
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:01,317
You gotta do the chant, too.

198
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,108
Huh?

199
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:03,983
Just say what I say, okay?

200
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:06,108
[KAZUMA]
Uh...

201
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:08,858
Guess I'll just have to
pull out the big guns.

202
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:11,900
Oh God, thou art an
impregnable armor of faith!

203
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:14,108
May thy steadfast
protection and thy glory

204
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:15,817
prevail over these foul demons!

205
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,650
[MEGUMIN, AINS]
Explode! Nuclear Blast!

206
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,608
Defensive shield!

207
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,483
[ALL gasp]

208
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,525
[VISHA] It looks like the ball
completely exploded! What now?

209
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,733
So, you've made your
choice then, have you?

210
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:34,650
Well...

211
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,025
Does that mean something, or...?

212
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,108
Heh!

213
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:40,150
[TANYA]
Okay... Game over, I guess?

214
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,567
[AINS]
Seems so.

215
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,942
[SUBARU] I don't actually
remember what we were

216
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:44,775
fighting about anymore.

217
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,692
Gotta feeling it was
something stupid.

218
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:48,983
[NAOFUMI sighs]
Yeah, as a matter of fact,

219
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,650
it was something
unbelievably stupid.

220
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:54,567
[AINS] Forgive me, Tanya.
I was being childish.

221
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:57,900
It's fine. I'll admit I was
being pretty childish myself.

222
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,900
A childish little girl,
ya' don't say.

223
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,400
Though personally,

224
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,942
I've never heard of an undead
being called that before.

225
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:04,650
[AINS]
Me either.

226
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:06,608
Yep, that's a first.

227
00:10:06,692 --> 00:10:08,358
[ALL laugh]

228
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,233
[VISHA] Hey you guys,
since we're all friends again,

229
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:13,733
let's go out and chow down
on some croquettes!

230
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:17,233
I'm down! Plus, no one'll argue
about what you put on 'em.

231
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:20,192
Even I can resist slathering
'em up with mayo.

232
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:21,192
Really?

233
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,733
Well, I didn't say
"all the time".

234
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:23,983
I'm not made of stone.

235
00:10:24,067 --> 00:10:26,317
[AINS] Oh, of course.
You agree, Tanya?

236
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,608
Yeah. The only thing they need
is salt and some pepper!

237
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,650
[ALL]
Salt and pepper?
