1
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,608
The big test is almost upon us.

2
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,775
Too much happens at this school!

3
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,858
[ROSWAAL]
In case you're wondering,

4
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:53,192
this test will only cover things
we've learned in class, okay?

5
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,233
--[AINS] Is it possible...
--[ROSWAAL] Hmm?

6
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,483
[AINS]
...for one to fail the test?

7
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:00,567
[MARE gasps]
Lord Ains, please don't worry!

8
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,733
[AINS]
Oh, uh.

9
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,692
My Lord, never fear.

10
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:05,733
Don't lose faith in
your loyal guardians.

11
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:06,817
We will not fail!

12
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,025
[AINS]
Um, good.

13
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,275
Even Shalltear possesses
the basic competency

14
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:11,650
to pass the test.

15
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:14,192
She's still a floor guardian
of Nazarick, after all!

16
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,400
And we all know the
penalty of failing you!

17
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,150
Yes! I can do it!

18
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:20,275
Now, I may not be
as wise as you,

19
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:22,192
still I make this
fervent pledge.

20
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,317
I won't let you down, My Lord!

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,192
[AINS]
Excellent.

22
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:27,358
[MOMONGA]
I was actually more worried

23
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,858
that I was gonna flunk it.

24
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,817
[AINS] I'm not concerned
in the slightest.

25
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,567
But I am curious
as to what effect

26
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,567
it would have on this world.

27
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,567
I was looking for confirmation.

28
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,442
No doubt some here
don't test well.

29
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,317
I feel you staring at me.

30
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,567
[AINS]
Huh?

31
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,150
Do you really believe
I'm some kind of idiot?

32
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,858
And after I gave you a pass
on being a filthy undead.

33
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:49,525
[AINS]
You've got the wrong idea.

34
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:52,400
[AQUA]
No--you and me! Let's go!

35
00:02:52,483 --> 00:02:53,900
Who'll get the higher grade?

36
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,442
[MOMONGA] Aw, cmon!
This freakin' sucks!

37
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:59,692
I never even graduated
middle school!

38
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:02,358
Huh? Everyone's staring at me!

39
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,983
They need leadership!
What am I gonna do?

40
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,317
I know!

41
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:11,733
[AINS] Are you certain that
you want to go down this road?

42
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,317
[AQUA scoffs]
Hell yeah!

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
[MOMONGA]
That backfired!

44
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:16,983
Ah, I get it now.

45
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,567
What is there to "get" exactly?

46
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,233
[KAZUMA] I'd say I can't
believe you're stupid enough

47
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:24,067
to challenge Ains,
but I'd be lying!

48
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,358
[AQUA]
I just thought--

49
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,525
You don't pay even the
smallest bit of attention

50
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:28,900
in class like he does.

51
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:30,358
How could you think
you'd beat him?

52
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,025
Not to mention your
intelligence stat

53
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:36,108
is ridiculously low, and it
ain't gonna rise anytime soon.

54
00:03:36,192 --> 00:03:39,442
[AQUA shouts] Why do you have
to always embarrass me?

55
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,108
Just because you're a shut in
NEET with a sucky life...

56
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,817
If you want my honest advice,
it'd be to study hard enough

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,900
that you don't
embarrass yourself.

58
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:48,317
[TANYA]
Now is the time!

59
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,650
[AQUA]
Huh?

60
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,858
Join my two hundred third
Aerial Mage Battalion's

61
00:03:51,942 --> 00:03:53,275
famous test prep course!

62
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,983
[AQUA]
Sorry, not interested.

63
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,608
My short-term training
program's unparalleled.

64
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,817
There are many ways to hone
your skills as well as--

65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,483
[AQUA]
Sorry, not interested.

66
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,025
[PUCK yawns]
Can I take a nap?

67
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:08,817
I don't actually get sleepy in
this world, but I do get bored.

68
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,733
You need to work hard,
Puck, and study.

69
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,108
Meh.

70
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:15,775
You're doing great, Subaru!
I'm so impressed by you!

71
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:19,900
Thanks! He, he. This brings
back some memories.

72
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,192
[EMILIA, REM]
Huh?

73
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,025
When we studied? Before?

74
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,150
Those were some
crazy times, huh?

75
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,108
Sure were.

76
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:27,442
So crazy.

77
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:28,608
Uh...

78
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:32,025
[SUBARU] What the hell
am I talking about?

79
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:35,733
When did that happen?
We've never studied together.

80
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,067
Am I thinking about our time in
this room, like earlier today?

81
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,608
Wait a second. How long have
we been stuck in here?

82
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,108
[MARE]
Oh. Is something bothering you?

83
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:48,275
It's nothing, I suppose.

84
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,775
[BEATRICE] Think long and hard,
but I'd bet my life,

85
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,817
you'll never find the answer.

86
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,108
[EMILIA]
Are you okay?

87
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:57,775
Huh? Ah, Sorry.
Just lost in thought.

88
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:00,692
You surprised me by
shuttin' yer trap like that.

89
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,858
[SUBARU]
Nobody says "shuttin' yer trap."

90
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:05,442
[EMILIA giggles]
Shall we move on?

91
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:06,400
[REM]
Yes, let's.

92
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,275
[SUBARU]
Roger that!

93
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:10,858
[CHRIS] So you see, it's because
of this that that happened.

94
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:15,900
[FELT groans]
I just don't get it!

95
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,150
Chris, wassup?

96
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,483
[CHRIS]
Hey, Kazuma!

97
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,275
Can you lend us
some brain power?

98
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,358
Aqua needs help
studying for the test.

99
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,942
Ah! It's the guy who hangs
with homeboy's friend's dude.

100
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:29,858
Why don't you just call me
by my name? It's Kazuma.

101
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:31,775
I didn't know that you
two ever hung out.

102
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,317
Oh, yeah, we're cool.

103
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,733
People were saying
that she's a thief.

104
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,650
So I thought we'd have
something in common,

105
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,108
turns out I was right.

106
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:41,817
Kazuma's an adventurer,
but he's okay in my book.

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,275
I taught him a few of my skills,

108
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,733
so he's actually a pretty
decent thief, too.

109
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,817
[FELT] Very cool!
What's been your best score?

110
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,025
Her panties.

111
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:52,233
You didn't have to mention that!

112
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,983
[AQUA] Hey, I thought we were
here to get me some study help.

113
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:01,150
Okay, class. I hope that you're
prepared to start the test!

114
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,900
The questions were written
for us by Mr. Pandora's Actor,

115
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,108
and we appreciate it, don't we?

116
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:08,192
I'll add that if any of you
are caught cheating,

117
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:12,108
you'll get a big, fat zero.
So please, don't cheat.

118
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,942
[TANYA] This test is nothing
more than a slap in the face.

119
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,275
Which reminds me.

120
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,942
There much are better ways
to extract information.

121
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:22,067
I'm sure Ains is just as put out
by this whole thing as I am.

122
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,650
[MOMONGA]
Tanya's looking at me again.

123
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,233
I know she respects
me or something,

124
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:28,025
but I'm gonna mess
the bed on this test.

125
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:29,983
No stealing anybody's
answer sheets.

126
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,275
Gulp!

127
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,483
[SUBARU] Uh, did somebody
actually say "Gulp"?

128
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,650
I said "good"
'cause I love tests!

129
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,650
Kazuma won't stoop that low.

130
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,983
He's not as smart as
a Crimson Demon,

131
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,358
but I'm the only one born
with that advantage.

132
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,775
Still, I think his intelligence
is sufficient enough

133
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:46,858
to pass this test,
at the very least.

134
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,275
So, you're not totally
incompetent, then?

135
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:52,650
Uh no, not totally.

136
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:56,442
Well, I suppose I
underestimated you, I'm sorry.

137
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:57,900
[KAZUMA] She'd be
disappointed if she knew

138
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,608
I was gonna steal her answers.

139
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:01,400
I think I just
overheard somebody's

140
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:02,817
guilty inner monologue
going off.

141
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,483
There's no way,
and it wasn't mine!

142
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:16,817
[ROSWAAL] Okay class.
Let the test begin, now!

143
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,650
[MOMONGA] I spent the entire
week trying to relearn

144
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,775
everything from
elementary school...

145
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,067
...but I don't know
a single answer.

146
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,858
Why did that disappointing
fool make these so hard?

147
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,608
I mean, I would've if I
were asking the questions,

148
00:07:33,692 --> 00:07:35,608
but I still don't like it.

149
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:37,192
Okay, fine.

150
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:39,942
If I don't wanna look stupid,
I'll just have to do the smart

151
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,525
thing and, uh, cheat.

152
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,483
I think the best way, would be
to use the eleventh-tier spell,

153
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,942
"time stop."

154
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:47,817
Alright, here goes...

155
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,442
[AINS]
Time Stop.

156
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:54,358
[AINS] Now. I'll just
sneak a little peek.

157
00:07:54,442 --> 00:07:57,358
[AQUA] Huh? That's weird.
Everybody froze!

158
00:07:57,442 --> 00:07:59,775
Poke-poke! Hey!

159
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:04,233
[MOMONGA] Aw, man. I forgot
Aqua's supposed to be a goddess.

160
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,150
She's immune to the time stop!

161
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:10,775
This is awesome! Now let me
see those answers, Kazuma!

162
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,275
[MOMONGA] Ya know, seeing her
in action like this,

163
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,275
I realize it's not a great look.

164
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:17,400
You can almost smell
the desperation.

165
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,858
It makes me even more
ashamed of myself.

166
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:22,233
But what else am I
supposed to do?

167
00:08:22,317 --> 00:08:23,817
I was the one who
stopped time, after all.

168
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,025
[TANYA] Are you behind this
temporal manipulation?

169
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:29,150
Wasn't me. I can't
do this kinda stuff.

170
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:32,733
[TANYA] I see. Then I take it
to mean you're not Being X.

171
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:34,817
'S'why I never said that I was.

172
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,983
[TANYA] Well, anyway.
What in the hell are you doing?

173
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,442
[AINS, AQUA gasp]

174
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,942
It takes a massive set of
stones to so brazenly cheat

175
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:43,567
in front of me like that.

176
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,108
[gasps] I wasn't cheating,
I just uh--

177
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,567
[TANYA]
Shut your trap!

178
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,400
[MOMONGA]
Why the hell can Tanya move too?

179
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:51,858
Wait a minute.

180
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,775
Tanya had told me that she
was brought to another world

181
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:56,067
by a being that
called itself a god.

182
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,858
Maybe there's some
rule that says gods

183
00:08:57,942 --> 00:09:00,525
and people who can talk to
them are immune to time stops?

184
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,317
Never heard that one, but...

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,442
[SUBARU] Be quiet! We're in the
middle of a big test right now.

186
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,483
See how still everyone else is?

187
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,233
I mean, they are really
concentrating hard.

188
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,650
[MOMONGA yelps]

189
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,025
[SUBARU] Whoa.
They're not even breathing?

190
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,442
Hey, what's goin' on?

191
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,442
[MOMONGA]
Subaru can move too?

192
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:18,650
Back in my other world,

193
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,400
hardly anybody can use
eleventh-tier magic!

194
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,775
But this many people here
aren't affected by it?

195
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,983
This world blows my mind!

196
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,442
I should stop before
I get busted.

197
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,608
[SUBARU]
Hm?

198
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:33,025
[AQUA gasps]
Uh-oh, not good.

199
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:36,233
[ROSWAAL]
What are you doing Miss Aqua?

200
00:09:36,317 --> 00:09:37,567
[gasps]

201
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,858
[KAZUMA] Why is it so hard
to breathe-- Pencils?!

202
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,858
Alright, Aqua.

203
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,442
[grunts]

204
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:48,150
Hallway please. This instant.

205
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:51,358
[AQUA]
I didn't do anything!

206
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:53,525
[AINS]
Sorry about that.

207
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,942
[MOMONGA] I did the
best I could, but...

208
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:03,858
[AINS]
Hm...? Hm...? Hm?!

209
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,942
[ROSWAAL] Ains I need
you to shut your trap.

210
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,400
Tests are back now.

211
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:39,942
[MOMONGA] Pandora's Actor
is eccentric and self-serving,

212
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:42,400
but I thought I was
talking a risk here.

213
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:45,983
[AINS] A perfect score,
just as I expected.

214
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,775
It goes to show you,
you shouldn't test Lord Ains.

215
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,400
He's truly invincible.

216
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,275
[MOMONGA]
Yeah, totally cool with this.

217
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:55,067
I didn't know that Ains
was such a genius.

218
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,608
All Hail Ains! An all-knowing,
all-powerful force of nature!

219
00:11:58,692 --> 00:11:59,733
[MOMONGA]
On second thought,

220
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,025
I am extremely cool
with all of this.
