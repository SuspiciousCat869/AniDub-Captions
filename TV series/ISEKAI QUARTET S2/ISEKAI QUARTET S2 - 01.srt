Um, who's that?

4
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,650
He just walked off
without saying a word.

5
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:31,400
Well, most people would nope out
after seeing this class.

6
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:34,067
[AINS] I can tell you're
looking at me, by the way.

7
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,150
Of course I'm looking at you.
You scared me at first.

8
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:39,192
Yeah, I remember you
saying something like,

9
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,608
"The hell are we walking into?"
Bet you crapped your pants, too.

10
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,567
That's right. The winning
combo of loud and tardy.

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,233
[SUBARU] Hey! Why am I
getting dragged like this?

12
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:49,817
[AINS] This example proves
that compared to Subaru,

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,442
the guy we just saw
is probably normal.

14
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,442
[SUBARU] What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

15
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:55,483
Mr. Roswaal! The quiet boy.

16
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:56,858
Yes?

17
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:59,483
The quiet boy. He's our
transfer student, isn't he?

18
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:02,483
Well, no. That sullen young man

19
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,775
will be joining the
students in classroom one.

[EMILIA]
Class one?

21
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,733
Yes. I don't recall
his real name.

22
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:12,150
But you can call
him Shield, kay?

23
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:14,233
[ALL]
Shield?

24
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:16,483
Shield? What kind
of name is that?

25
00:01:16,567 --> 00:01:19,900
Okay then. But we are getting
a new student, aren't we?

26
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,275
If not him, then who?

27
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:24,233
[SUBARU] Yeah, come on.
I wanna know who it is, too!

28
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,108
[KAZUMA] You're not even gonna
tell us when they're coming?

29

My, what a silly thing to say.

00:01:29,858 --> 00:01:31,317
[KAZUMA]
Hm?

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,442
Because class two's transfer
student is already right here.

Tah-dah!

Just keep your mouth shut!

[TANYA] I'll bite my
tongue and keep quiet,

38
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,150
but somebody is
gonna say something.

00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,525
They can't let this slide.

00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,733
[SUBARU] You're just
joking with us, aren't you?

[MOMONGA, SUBARU, TANYA]
There it is!

42

This cat. What's its name again?

00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,483

It doesn't seem fair.

If they're a full-fledged
student now,

47
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,483
then why isn't poor Puck
considered to be one, too?

[CHOMUSUKE meows]

I kinda can't believe our
new classmate's a kitty.

52
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,817
Well, we do already have
a couple of demons

53

and an undead guy in our class.

54
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:20,275
So is a cat really that
far beyond the pale?

55
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,233
That's right! Not to
mention I'm a goddess.

expect us to believe that?

swipe at your personal faith,

to support that kind

60
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,192
of delusional thinking.

00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,858
I agree. Can you really
call yourself a "goddess?"

never lie about who I am!

convinced. Is she or isn't she?

a little here, Kazuma?

[SUBARU] It means you won't be
able to hide behind Cocytus

79
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,400
and slack off anymore.

anything is possible.

Yeah, but not in the
way you think it is.

Point taken. Being able
to see all of your bright,

would be good, right?

Oh, there's no
problem here, sir!

at the back of Lord Ains' head

all day, and, I'd just
hate to lose that.

allowed to gaze upon

strong and handsome face.

Yes, well my side
has the best view!

I'm sorry. But the
best one is diagonally!

Everyone.

94
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,900
Please try and keep in mind that
we weren't summoned here

95
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:48,358
to slack off. In fact,
it's against the rules.

96

We're not!

In regards to the
discussion at hand,

98
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:54,442
I clearly have the ideal seat
because I can admire Lord Ains'

99
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,233
form and pay attention in class.

100
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:57,900
That is so unfair!

101
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,650
[ROSWAAL]
I said, focus!

102
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,733
We still need to determine
our new seats, yes?

103
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:04,775
We'll do that by...

104
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:05,525

...a drawing?

105
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:06,858
[ROSWAAL]
Correct.

106
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:16,358
[whines] I'm way too far from
Lord Ains! Ah... Sir, please!

107
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:17,942
I request we change
seats again--

Is this another Wave?

So, you were abruptly
summoned to this world as well?

Yeah.

transformed on me.

[NAOFUMI]
Yeah.

127

[WILHELM] I know this
is all very confusing,

128

but there must be some reason
why you were brought here.

It's the look your eyes.
Reminds me of how I once was.

You're not drinking your tea.

I'm not.

you care to grab some lunch?

Oh! I wasn't aware
you had a visitor.

We shall meet again. I'm sure.

[SEBAS] Hm. I hope today finds
you in good spirts, Wilhelm.

Seeing a boy become a man
never fails to amuse me.

144
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,983
It's entertaining,
if drama's your thing.

145
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:08,233
Now then, what do you suggest
we we talk about today?

146

Let's see. The same
thing as every day?

00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:32,900
If you're ready,
I won't go easy on you.

157
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:37,108
[DARKNESS]
Damn it!

158
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,358
[COCYTUS]
Strike.

159
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,400
Missed again!

160
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,983
[COCYTUS]
Strike.

161
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,108
This sucks!
I can't hit anything!

162
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,275
[COCYTUS] You need to get the
bat closer to the ball.

163
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,900
Yes I know. I'm using
every attack I have!

164
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:53,692
[COCYTUS]
Well, uh...

165
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:57,900
Alright. Here goes.
Closing time!

166
00:06:57,983 --> 00:06:59,650
A new strategy!

167
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,817
[VISHA] Whoa! Darkness just
threw herself at the ball!

168
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,192
[DARKNESS groans]

169
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:11,025
That's the stuff. Wait a sec.
Is this a dead ball?

170
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,275
[COCYTUS]
Strike! You're out!

171
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,775
Why? I hit the
damn thing, didn't I?

172
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,608
[COCYTUS] Hitting a ball
with your body like that

173
00:07:17,692 --> 00:07:19,317
is against the rules!

174
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,317
[DARKNESS]
No way!

175
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,983
[SUBARU] Hey guys. We only keep
two pets in here, don't we?

176
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,858
I thought so.

177
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:31,108
[SUBARU] 'Cause it seems
we've got three now.

178
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:33,358
Then we'll just get
rid of one 'em.

179
00:07:33,442 --> 00:07:35,150
[DEATH KNIGHT yells]

180
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,442
[HAMSUKE gasps]
Oh no!

181
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:37,900
Death Knight disappeared,
he did!

182
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,233
[SUBARU] Uh-huh. And that means
we're back down to two,

183
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:42,858
as we should be!
Hey! Something's not right!

184
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:45,150
[AURA] Anyone know where
the bird came from?

185
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:48,067
Who me? Nice to meet you,
my name's Filo!

186
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,900
Have you seen my master?

187
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,358
[AQUA] And who might that be?
What's their name?

188
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:55,608
His name is Naofumi.
And he's a really great guy!

189
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,025
[AURA] What? I've never
heard of him before.

190
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:01,733
Ah! Come back to join us,
Death Knight has!

191
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:08,317
Naofumi! Are you here?
Where could he have gone?

192
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,817
[AINS]
Hm?

193
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,358
A monster!

194
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:16,233
Hey, slow your roll.

195
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:18,775
You've been transported into a
whole 'nother world, okay?

196
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:19,983
Things are a little
different here,

197
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,567
so just put the sword down!

198
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,733
[AINS] Relax, fellow traveler,
we mean you no harm.

199
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:27,275
[KAZUMA]
He's telling the truth.

200
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:30,233
Listen, we know this must all
be very shocking and scary.

201
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:34,192
Because believe it or not, the
same exact thing happened to us.

202
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,442
Was Naofumi sent here too?

203
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,608
[AINS]
Naofumi?

204
00:08:37,692 --> 00:08:40,483
I'm not sure if he's
here with us or not.

205
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,317
So, what can you tell me
about him? Who is he?

206
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,108
You may know him by his title.

207
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,275
[KAZUMA]
And that is?

208
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:50,733
The Shield Hero!

209
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:54,317
[AINS] Okay. So he's some
type of hero, is he?

210
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,650
[KAZUMA] Oh, an "I'm so OP"
type guy? Ugh.

211
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:00,692
[RAPHTALIA] Brave Naofumi
was summoned to save the world

212
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,525
and then cruelly betrayed.

213
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,067
Persecuted for a crime
he didn't commit!

214
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,108
[KAZUMA]
Talk about playing on hard mode.

215
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,775
[RAPHTALIA]
But he's never given up,

216
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:10,775
and does all he can
to protect others.

217
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,025
[AINS]
Hm...

218
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,317
[RAPHTALIA] But he can
be a little difficult

219
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,733
to get along with,

220
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,400
and he's not really that great
at expressing himself.

221
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:19,858
[KAZUMA] So hard mode
for everyone else too?

222
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,858
[RAPHTALIA] But deep down inside
he's actually really nice!

223
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,400
[AINS] Is that what
they call a "tsundere?"

224
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:27,150
[KAZUMA laughs] It sounds
so freaking weird

225
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,233
when you say stuff like that.

226
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,108
[AINS]
It feels weird to say it, too.

227
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:31,442
I need to find him right now

228
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:34,358
and this conversation
isn't helping me do that!

229
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:37,942
Well, we can help you
look for him if you want.

230
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:39,233
Wow, really?

231
00:09:45,358 --> 00:09:46,733
[COCYTUS]
Strike!

232
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:53,150
Oh. Hey there Aqua.
What's goin' on here?

233
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:56,275
[SUBARU laughs]
Run, ya big bird!

234
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:58,942
Filo?

235
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,775
Uh. You know them?
That's good, I guess.

236
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:05,192
[SUBARU]
Whoa, hey! Uh...

237
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:06,400
[BOTH yelp]

238
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:09,483
[FILO]
Raphtalia, it's you!

239
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,608
[AURA gasps] I want a giant
transforming bird, too!

240
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:13,567
Is everything okay?

241
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,067
Yeah!

242
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,108
[AINS] This girl is searching
for a hero called Naofumi.

243
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:20,608
Oh, that's probably the transfer
student in class one, huh?

244
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,192
[AINS]
I'd imagine.

245
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:25,275
[VISHA]
Last pitch. Take this!

246
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,983
[SUBARU]
Hey! Look out!

247
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,275
[BOTH gasp]

248
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,858
[NAOFUMI]
Air Strike Shield!

249
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:44,233
[AINS]
What's this?

250
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,608
[AINS, SUBARU gasp]

251
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:58,650
Second Shield!

252
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,233
[BOTH gasp]

253
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,817
[yells]

254
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,858
[BOTH gasp]

255
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:25,775
[RAPHTALIA]
It's Naofumi!

256
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:28,442
[FILO]
Master, you're here!

257
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,817
Hey there. You okay?

258
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,775
Yes!

259
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah!

260
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:36,150
Seems like there are
no other heroes around.

261
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:39,025
And there's a rule here that
you have to go to school.

262
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,983
[RAPHTALIA]
That's what I was told as well.

263
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,150
[NAOFUMI]
Honestly, I don't understand it.

264
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:50,733
Still, I'm glad we're
all here together.

265
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:53,650
I say we just follow the rules
and see what happens.

266
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,025
Works for me!

267
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,900
Whatever you say!

268
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:00,900
Alright. Let's do this, kay?

269
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,025
[RAPHTALIA, FILO]
Yeah!
