1
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,117
Big Brother!

2
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,677
Oh, hey, Komachi. Did you come here alone?

3
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:21,606
I did! But the only reason I came was to see you!

4
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,948
I'd sure give myself a lot of points for that one!

5
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:27,144
Where are Yui and Yukino hanging out?

6
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:30,115
Yuigahama's in our classroom, but Yukinoshita...

7
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:31,547
No clue, really.

8
00:00:31,873 --> 00:00:34,167
So why are you out here and not in your classroom?

9
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:35,142
Shouldn't you be?

10
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,652
I am but a solitary, wandering soul.

11
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,823
I have no desire for a place to belong!

12
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:42,693
Wow, aren't you cool... What are you really doing?

13
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,300
I'm working.

14
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:47,850
What?! My own big brother? Working?!

15
00:00:49,574 --> 00:00:51,591
That makes me so very happy!

16
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:53,741
Though, I admit it's a little strange...

17
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,064
Like my brother has left for some far-off place!

18
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:57,565
I'm not sure how to feel...

19
00:00:57,592 --> 00:01:01,961
Well, actually, I call it work, but in reality
it's like I'm the lowest of the underlings.

20
00:01:01,986 --> 00:01:03,196
Well, that I can see!

21
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:05,610
Okay, then I'm gonna go look around now.

22
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,004
See ya, Bro!

23
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:09,465
Ah?

24
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,483
Huh?

25
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:19,026
Oh?

26
00:02:53,213 --> 00:02:54,172
Were you working?

27
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:55,990
Yeah, can't you tell by looking?

28
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,651
Why do you think I asked you?

29
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,096
So, what about you?

30
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:02,173
On my way to a meeting before the closing ceremony.

31
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:05,576
Oh, man! We've gotta hurry or
there won't be any seats left!

32
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:06,549
What's that?

33
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,557
You'll see soon enough.

34
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:09,070
Huh?

35
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,480
She's amazing.

36
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,963
It's a bit weird to hear you complimenting her.

37
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,236
Is it?

38
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:47,046
Despite appearances, I have
quite a high opinion of my sister.

39
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:50,347
When I was young I wanted to be just like her.

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,499
I think you're fine the way you are. Don't change.

41
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:01,201
Huh?

42
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,123
Sagami's missing?

43
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,370
She is. We've not been able to reach her on her cell.

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,737
This is a problem.

45
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,419
Without her, we can't hold the closing ceremony.

46
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,426
Worst case, we replace her?

47
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:16,204
It's actually more difficult than that.

48
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,807
Even if we found someone and managed
to get through the closing comments,

49
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,743
Sagami is still the only one here who knows the
voting results for the excellency and regional awards.

50
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:27,021
Why don't you just make up the results for the awards.

51
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,342
It's not like the vote counts ever go over well.

52
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:30,922
Hikigaya...

53
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,981
We definitely can't do that.

54
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:35,791
Put off the award presentations for another day, then?

55
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,710
That's the worst case scenario.

56
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:41,288
The regional award is kind of pointless
if it's not presented here today.

57
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:42,545
Something wrong?

58
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:45,887
I see...

59
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:47,908
Hmm...

60
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,938
What if we added another song to our performance?

61
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,442
Could you really do that?

62
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:53,324
Yeah.

63
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:54,617
Yumiko,

64
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:56,496
can you play and sing one more song?

65
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:58,899
Are you serious, Hayama? One more?!

66
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,224
No way! I can't! I'm totally on edge here!

67
00:05:01,255 --> 00:05:02,899
Hmph. Pretty please?

68
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:08,890
Thanks for this.

69
00:05:08,914 --> 00:05:11,383
Don't thank me, 'cause I'm not doing it for you!

70
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:11,854
Hmph!

71
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:14,147
The previous act just ended! Come on!

72
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:15,651
For real?

73
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:16,564
Oh, God...

74
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,817
This is so wrong.

75
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:20,427
I've posted online in a few different places.

76
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,938
If anyone has seen her, they should let me know soon.

77
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:24,139
I appreciate it.

78
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:25,386
Heh, no worries.

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,327
Even so, if we take the stage now,
we can only stall for 10 minutes.

80
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,142
Someone needs to find her quick.

81
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,089
Yeah...

82
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:33,726
I can go look around for her.

83
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:36,142
You won't find her by looking around randomly.

84
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,088
What you need to do is pick one place that
you can get to and back within 15 minutes.

85
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,620
Hey, Hikigaya,

86
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:45,651
do you think if I were able to buy you another 10 minutes,

87
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:46,893
could you find her?

88
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,447
Don't know. That's all I can tell you now.

89
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,929
But you didn't say it was impossible.

90
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:54,373
That's good enough for now.

91
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,452
Haruno, I need your help.

92
00:06:04,302 --> 00:06:05,087
Wow.

93
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:10,012
Okay. I'm shocked. You know this is the
first time you've actually asked for my help.

94
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,694
So, I will actually accept your request.

95
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,720
"Request"? Don't go getting the wrong idea here.

96
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:18,306
This is an order as a planning committee member.

97
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:22,106
Oh? And is there a penalty if I
defy your order, Little Sister?

98
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,410
It's not like you can actually go
and take down my festival display now.

99
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,081
Will you run and go tell the teacher?

100
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:32,479
There's no penalty, but there is a benefit.

101
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:33,479
What kind?

102
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,545
The kind that says I will owe you a favor.

103
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:39,531
How you perceive that is entirely up to you.

104
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:40,637
Ohh...

105
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,871
Well, Yukino, you've certainly grown up.

106
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,957
No. You're wrong. I've always been like this.

107
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:50,721
Have you not been watching me
all this time? It was obvious.

108
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:51,974
Heh!

109
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:53,681
What's funny?

110
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,679
Nothing.

111
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:57,505
<i>Yeah, that's exactly right.</i>

112
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,909
<i>This is the kind of person Yukino Yukinoshita is.</i>

113
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:03,214
Well? What do you plan to do?

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,718
Fill in the gap.

115
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:11,641
Oh? You sure do come up with some fun ideas.

116
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:13,945
We do have all the members here, and all.

117
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:16,562
So, which song is it?

118
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:21,349
I think I can still play the
song I played with you before.

119
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:22,379
Meguri?

120
00:07:22,428 --> 00:07:24,586
Oh yes! Don't worry about me!

121
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:26,603
Now we just need a vocalist.

122
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:29,878
Yuigahama...

123
00:07:30,915 --> 00:07:32,728
Will you do us the honors and sing?

124
00:07:33,214 --> 00:07:34,232
You'd be great.

125
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:37,267
Oh, well, uh... I'm not sure I can...

126
00:07:37,385 --> 00:07:39,240
I might just make things worse...

127
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:40,273
But...

128
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,157
I've been waiting for ages for you to ask me.

129
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:48,941
Thanks, Yui.

130
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:52,942
Mm-hmm! To be honest, I only
vagooly remember the lyrics.

131
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:54,659
Please don't expect too much.

132
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,145
I think the word you're saying is "vaguely."

133
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,747
That mistake of yours has me a little worried now.

134
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:02,597
What the heck, Yukinon?! That was mean of you!

135
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,359
Hikigaya...

136
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,753
Please find her.

137
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:09,111
You can do it, Hikki!

138
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,014
<i>The one thing someone who's lost
their own place really wants...</i>

139
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:25,925
<i>is for someone to find a new place they can feel safe.</i>

140
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,205
<i>She wants to be found, so she's here at school.</i>

141
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,984
<i>And in a place where she can be seen.</i>

142
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:33,570
<i>Where is she?</i>

143
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,276
<i>There's not much time.</i>

144
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,216
<i>I need to narrow down my options.</i>

145
00:08:41,579 --> 00:08:42,616
<i>It is I!</i>

146
00:08:42,885 --> 00:08:46,600
Zaimokuza, where would you usually hang
out at school when you want to be alone?

147
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,864
<i>What's all this, out of the clear blue sky?</i>

148
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,410
I'm hanging up.

149
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:55,015
<i>Wait! Wait! Please! The nurse's office, or
the balcony! I'm in the library a lot, too!</i>

150
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:56,988
<i>Also, the top of the annex tower!</i>

151
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:12,096
Ah! Uh...

152
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,162
You know the closing ceremony's about to start?

153
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:22,129
Hasn't it started already?

154
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,364
Should've. And it normally would have.

155
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:29,096
But they're doing all they possibly can to stall.

156
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,277
Oh? And who exactly is doing that?

157
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:35,281
Well, Miura, Yukinoshita, and some others.

158
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,475
Then why doesn't Yukinoshita just do it?

159
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,264
She might as well just do everything!

160
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,803
Huh? That's beside the point, Sagami!

161
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,709
As you know you're the only one that
has the voting results, among other things.

162
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:49,319
Fine! Then why don't you just take back the results?!

163
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:57,379
<i>The request Yukinoshita accepted was to have
Sagami fulfill the duties of the committee chairman.</i>

164
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,344
<i>If I just take back the voting results,</i>

165
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:03,317
<i>I'd be denying all the work that Yukinoshita has done.</i>

166
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,881
<i>What I need to do</i>

167
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:09,831
<i>is get Sagami to take her place on stage as the chairman.</i>

168
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,624
<i>Also, I need to give her the
glory of the chairman position,</i>

169
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,206
<i>along with a healthy dose of frustration and regret.</i>

170
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,112
<i>To accomplish that,</i>

171
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,035
<i>I only have to tell Sagami</i>

172
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:22,129
<i>exactly what she wants to hear.</i>

173
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:26,854
<i>But, unfortunately, I'm incapable of that.</i>

174
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,806
Huh? Ah?

175
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,104
Hayama?

176
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:51,076
We couldn't get in touch, so we got worried.

177
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:54,995
We were asking around for you and
someone had seen you climbing the stairs.

178
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:58,368
Let's hurry back.

179
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:01,129
Everyone's waiting for you. 'Kay?

180
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,907
Yeah, he's right.

181
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:04,759
Everyone's worried about you.

182
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,849
Yeah, but going back now isn't going to help anything.

183
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,227
Don't worry about that. Everyone's waiting.

184
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,983
Please, come back with us!

185
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,414
No way, I caused so much trouble for everyone.

186
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:16,909
I can't face them...

187
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:21,894
It's okay. Everyone only wishes the
best for you and totally supports you.

188
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,596
<i>Yukinoshita always saw things through her way.</i>

189
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:31,819
<i>So I'll do this my way.</i>

190
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,852
<i>Face it head-on, fair and square,</i>

191
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:38,533
<i>in the lowest, nastiest, most servile way I can.</i>

192
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,509
It's okay. Let's go.

193
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:44,465
I'm just the worst...

194
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,021
Yeah, you are kind of the worst.

195
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,223
Sagami, in my opinion, I think
you want people to fawn over you.

196
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:59,782
You do this stuff because you want attention.

197
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,890
Even now, you just wanted them to say "That's not true."

198
00:12:05,316 --> 00:12:08,491
Of course, nobody treated you like the real chairman.

199
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:10,501
What are you saying?

200
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:13,446
You really just wanted to be like Yukinoshita, didn't you?

201
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:17,444
You wanted to be acknowledged
and sought after, like she is.

202
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,741
You wanted people to depend on you.

203
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,842
So that's why you instantly pushed
the title of chairman onto her.

204
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,920
You wanted to confirm your superiority

205
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:30,314
by putting the label on someone else
and looking down your nose at them.

206
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:32,870
That's what you really meant by "growth."

207
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,385
I'm pretty sure everyone's noticed.

208
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,044
I don't really even know that much about you at all...

209
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,857
but, jeez, even I can see it.

210
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:44,216
You see nothing. Don't talk like we're the same.

211
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,164
We are the same.

212
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:48,994
And the best part is we're seen as the lowest of the low.

213
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:50,519
I mean, just think about it.

214
00:12:51,096 --> 00:12:53,349
I have like zero interest in you as a person,

215
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,770
yet found you before anyone else did.

216
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:57,195
In other words...

217
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,904
Does that mean nobody was seriously looking for you, then?

218
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,126
You realize it, don't you?

219
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,411
That you're nothing more than...

220
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:13,401
Hikigaya, just shut up already.

221
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:15,131
Heh.

222
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,754
Hayama, don't bother. It doesn't matter!

223
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:20,421
He's not worth it. Let's just go, okay?

224
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:25,443
Come on, then.

225
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:28,036
Who was that jerk? Talk about harsh!

226
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:30,801
What a creep, talking like he knows everything.

227
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:32,992
He has no right to say you're like him.

228
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:45,409
Tell me, how's this your "go to" solution?

229
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,079
Thank you!

230
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,341
Encore! Encore! Encore!

231
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:56,487
This, uh...

232
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:03,813
This year's cultural festival
is unlike any other in history.

233
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:05,747
Among all this excitement...

234
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,389
Hey, it'll be okay.

235
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:15,357
You know you'd have been fine if that
guy hadn't said those things to you.

236
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:16,809
It threw you off, didn't it?

237
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,223
Hikitani can be such a mean jerk!

238
00:16:20,248 --> 00:16:22,399
He was kinda like that over the summer, too!

239
00:16:22,424 --> 00:16:25,476
I guess. He's been known to say some pretty harsh things.

240
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:27,469
Hayama is such a nice guy...

241
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:30,459
Isn't he so sexy coming to Hikitani's defense?!

242
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:33,356
Yesterday's enemy is today's boyfriend...

243
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,830
Seriously, Ebina, can't you act more like us?!

244
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,591
Here, your nose is bleeding. Blow.

245
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,018
Hm?

246
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,517
Ya-hello!

247
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,849
Oh wow, Hikigaya, you're the greatest there is!

248
00:16:51,874 --> 00:16:54,674
I've heard all about your heroism from the others.

249
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:57,910
I love that kind of stuff, but
it's kinda wasted on Yukino, though.

250
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,991
Right? Isn't that so, Shizu?

251
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,330
First, your idea for the slogan,
now this thing with Sagami...

252
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:13,593
Somehow your efforts always seem to
find a way to play a part in the end.

253
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:17,713
But I don't feel like I can honestly praise you for it.

254
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:25,438
Hikigaya, you know you don't always have to put yourself
out there as the enemy in order to help someone else.

255
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:28,650
What's the difference? It's not
like any of this really gets to me.

256
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:32,859
Not true. Even if you're used to
hurting it doesn't have to be like this,

257
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,586
It's time you opened your eyes

258
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:38,478
and see that there are people around you
who hurt when they see that you're hurting.

259
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:39,967
Understand?

260
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,337
That's all I have to say.

261
00:17:49,877 --> 00:17:50,448
'Kay.

262
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:03,081
Huh?

263
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:08,305
Hm?

264
00:18:08,814 --> 00:18:10,222
Oh, hey. What's up...

265
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,901
most hated person in the school?

266
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,645
Are you picking a fight with me?

267
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:18,311
What about the after-party? You not going?

268
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,148
Don't ask questions you already know the answer to.

269
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,788
Tell me, how does it feel being genuinely hated?

270
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:27,877
Heh, having my presence acknowledged is a good thing.

271
00:18:28,044 --> 00:18:28,608
Right?

272
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:31,587
I don't know if I should be surprised or disgusted.

273
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,651
You're really a strange one, you know?

274
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:37,392
But there is one thing I don't dislike about you.

275
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,488
Your awareness of your own weakness.

276
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:41,735
Yeah, I don't really dislike it, either.

277
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:44,481
Actually, that's kind of my favorite aspect of myself.

278
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:47,351
So, what are you doing here?

279
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,064
I'm just trying to fill out my career plan sheet.

280
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,909
I didn't really have time to work on it
while we were preparing for the festival.

281
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,889
So, what's your reason for being here?

282
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:57,675
I need to put my reports together.

283
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:00,908
I wanted to do it in a place that's
quiet where I could concentrate.

284
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,628
Oh... I guess we think a lot alike, don't we?

285
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,001
Well, we don't really have many options.

286
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:09,422
It's just convergent evolution of loners.

287
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,984
But it in no way means you and I are alike.

288
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:14,443
Hm...

289
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>Nope. She and I aren't the least bit alike.</i>

290
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:24,758
<i>Then again, that could be why our conversations</i>

291
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:26,698
<i>always feel fresh and comfortable.</i>

292
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:27,993
<i>Is that why, though?</i>

293
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,334
<i>After repeating the question, the answer I was led to</i>

294
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,613
<i>has turned out to be true.</i>

295
00:19:36,105 --> 00:19:38,901
<i>So... So are she and I...</i>

296
00:19:40,966 --> 00:19:42,686
Hey, Yukinoshita...

297
00:19:45,832 --> 00:19:46,231
Could we...

298
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:47,703
I'm sorry, but that's not happening.

299
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,541
Gah! Why wouldn't you let me at least finish my thought?

300
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:52,393
Haven't I already told you?

301
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:55,215
It's just impossible for you and I to be friends, okay?

302
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,462
Are you serious?

303
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,604
I am. I never tell a lie.

304
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:02,279
Well, it doesn't matter to me if you lie.

305
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,836
I lie all the time.

306
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,117
Who cares if you know something, but say you don't?

307
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,954
Forcing something out of someone
without permission is worse.

308
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,826
I wasn't lying then.

309
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:17,392
I mean, at that point I really didn't know you at all.

310
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,757
However, I'm pretty sure I do now though.

311
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:24,227
Guh!

312
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,369
Oh, you think so?

313
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:29,112
Yes, I do.

314
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:33,562
Ya-hello!

315
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:36,141
Such a great job with the festival!

316
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,868
Let's go to the night-after party!

317
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,879
Not going.

318
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:41,020
What is a night-after party, anyway?

319
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:43,024
You don't even know, and you refused?!

320
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:45,672
The night-after party is, well... it's, uh...

321
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,791
It's kinda like a regular after-party, but bigger?

322
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:50,873
Don't you think you should know if you're inviting us?

323
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,856
Let's see, judging from the name, it sounds like
it would be the opposite of a night-before party.

324
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:59,565
That's it! Yeah! Hayato and his
buddies booked a club near the station.

325
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,344
Said to invite everyone we know!

326
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:02,736
Well that was nice of them.

327
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,599
Well you should go and join them,

328
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:05,566
He'll-look-better-with-ya?

329
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:08,311
Hey! Don't casually say my name wrong!

330
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:12,289
And who you talking about, 'cause it's not
Hayama, 'cause I don't want to make him look good.

331
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,917
We don't get to do this often. Let's just go.

332
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,354
Thanks, but I'll pass.

333
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:19,244
Even if I went, I'd be sitting in a corner the whole time.

334
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,544
I'd feel kinda bad for destroying
the festive atmosphere for everyone.

335
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:27,176
He's right. Besides, the night-after party
isn't sponsored by the planning committee.

336
00:21:27,282 --> 00:21:29,510
So I don't see much reason for me to attend.

337
00:21:29,735 --> 00:21:32,032
Aww, let's just go!

338
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:34,237
Wait, what are you doing in here, anyway?

339
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,738
I'm doing reports.

340
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:37,046
Doing my career plan.

341
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:40,566
Oh... Well then I'll just wait until you're finished!

342
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,228
Wait just a minute, Yui, we never said we were gonna go...

343
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:52,664
<i>You don't get much of a chance to redo things in life.</i>

344
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:57,351
<i>Even a stupid act like this will eventually be lost.</i>

345
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,472
<i>And I sit here and think about how...</i>

346
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:04,360
<i>I might actually regret that loss one day...</i>

347
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:44,414
Don't treat my athletic past like a dark moment in time.

348
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,808
God, I hated the competitive class relays.

349
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,628
Yeah, well, I couldn't run very
fast, so it was hard for me too.

350
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,861
Okay, we must get out there
and do our best to win this thing!

351
00:23:51,886 --> 00:23:53,209
I am young, after all.

352
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:54,640
Don't call me "Sakisaki"!

353
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,042
Ahem, ahem, ahem.

354
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:56,735
Oh, Hachiman!

355
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,066
Same question as my left.

356
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,328
We need to come up with some strong ideas!

357
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,966
Stand up, citizens!

358
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:08,827
Next time: "Thus, Their Festival Will Never End."
