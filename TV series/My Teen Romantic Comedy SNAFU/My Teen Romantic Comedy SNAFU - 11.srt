1
00:00:02,023 --> 00:00:06,091
Before they become big baobabs,
they start out by being little baobabs.

2
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,967
Yes. But why would you want
your sheep to eat little baobabs?

3
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:12,246
Oh, come on! You know why that is!

4
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:13,179
Stop it!

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,727
You know what the baobab tree symbolizes...

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,000
don't you?

7
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:19,347
Uh...

8
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:23,942
The young prince needs to look up at
him shyly but with an inviting expression!

9
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:27,654
As if to say, "I know I'm inviting
you, but I'm going to torment you!"

10
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,275
One more time! Go!

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,337
Uh...

12
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:36,261
Before they grow big, baobabs started
out by being small little baobabs.

13
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,289
Tell me, why would you ever want
your sheep to eat little baobabs?

14
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:43,287
Oh, come on! You know why that is!

15
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,465
Come on, boys. Do your job.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,898
We're doing our job!

17
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,592
Are you going to be done in time?

18
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,828
You know we've got a lot riding on this musical!

19
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:55,558
Oh, are the costumes done yet? Let me see!

20
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,767
Wow, this is fantastic!

21
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,066
Look, the stitching is so clean!

22
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:09,405
Uh, hey. Why are you calling me in school?

23
00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:12,257
Hey, did you know Yukinoshita's absent today?

24
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:12,886
Huh?

25
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:15,425
<i>Apparently, she called in sick.</i>

26
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,656
No way...

27
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:56,875
Damn.

28
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:03,437
Ignoring us?

29
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,207
It'd be okay if she was...

30
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:08,244
But if she's really so sick that she can't answer, then...

31
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:08,746
<i>Yes?</i>

32
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:12,294
Yukinon? It's me, Yui! Are you okay?

33
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:15,648
<i>Yes. I'm fine, so...</i>

34
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,813
<i>"So..."? So what?</i>

35
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,685
<i>What's she trying to say "so" as in "go home"?</i>

36
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,879
Just let us come in.

37
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:26,674
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

38
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:28,052
Just wanna talk.

39
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,216
Welcome... Come on in.

40
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:03,701
Have a seat.

41
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,822
Tell me, what did you wanna talk about?

42
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,406
Oh, well, uh...

43
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:18,399
When we realized that you were
absent today, we were worried about you.

44
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:21,778
You're overreacting. It was just for the day.

45
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,088
Maybe so, but you look really tired.

46
00:04:24,113 --> 00:04:25,703
You're also looking kind of pale.

47
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,869
I have been tired lately.

48
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:30,455
But really, it's no big deal.

49
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,794
That is the real problem, isn't it?

50
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:37,953
You don't have to take on everything alone.

51
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:40,405
Yes, I know that.

52
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,506
That's why I divided up the
work, to try and lighten the load...

53
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:45,067
Obviously it didn't work.

54
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:46,277
Ah?

55
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,297
You know what, I'm kind of mad at you for this.

56
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:52,887
And the same goes for you, Hikki.

57
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,110
You said you'd help her if she was in trouble.

58
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:58,647
He's been doing his job in
general records quite well actually.

59
00:04:58,672 --> 00:04:59,805
That's enough for me.

60
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,637
Yeah, but...

61
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:03,276
Seriously, everything will be all right.

62
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,466
I've been working at home as
well, so we're not falling behind.

63
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:09,139
As you can see there's nothing you need to worry about.

64
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,127
But I don't think that's the right way.

65
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:14,322
It's not? How so?

66
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,139
Relying on others, helping each other out,

67
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,978
and supporting each other are generally
the right things to do when overwhelmed.

68
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:23,822
And?

69
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:25,488
But that's idealistic.

70
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,983
Someone will always get the short end of the stick.

71
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,262
I have no intention of telling
you to rely on anyone. But...

72
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,979
The way you're going about this is wrong.

73
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:38,195
So, do you know the right way to do it?

74
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,548
I don't, actually.

75
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:43,667
However, I can tell you it'd be way
different from what you've been doing lately.

76
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:49,044
I'm so sorry, I forgot to serve tea...

77
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:51,658
No, it's okay, actually. Why don't you let me do it?

78
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,273
Seriously, don't worry about me.

79
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:56,469
I'll feel a lot better after I get some rest.

80
00:05:56,712 --> 00:05:58,896
So all you need is some rest? Sure.

81
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:02,035
Listen, Yukinon...

82
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,773
Let me and Hikki help you, okay?

83
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:07,296
Not someone or everyone, just...

84
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,818
know you can rely on us.

85
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:12,608
Hikki is...

86
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:14,062
Is black tea okay?

87
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,375
Thanks a lot, Yukinon.

88
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,575
Agh! Well, I'm gonna go now.

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,972
Huh? O-oh, me, too!

90
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,143
Yuigahama...

91
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:47,227
What is it?

92
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:51,769
I... just can't accept your help right now,

93
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,286
but I promise someday that I'll ask for it.

94
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:55,828
I swear it...

95
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:58,734
So, thank you.

96
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,003
Yukinon...

97
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:06,662
But I want to think about things a little longer.

98
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:14,399
Yuigahama, she's all yours.

99
00:07:14,424 --> 00:07:14,891
Huh?

100
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,319
Hey, no! W-wait!

101
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:27,514
<i>Saying that if you change, the
world changes with you is a lie.</i>

102
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,557
<i>It's just a convenient lie forced
on you just to make you compromise.</i>

103
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:37,189
<i>Well I'll show them how you change the world... for real.</i>

104
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,572
Wow, that's amazing!

105
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:49,632
Uh, Sagami, everyone is here.

106
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,314
Oh, okay.

107
00:07:56,284 --> 00:07:57,509
Are you ready to start?

108
00:07:57,607 --> 00:07:58,047
Huh?

109
00:07:59,169 --> 00:07:59,757
Uh...

110
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,325
The meeting has now begun, everyone.

111
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:08,615
As our president has stated, deciding the school
slogan for the festival is at the top of our agenda today.

112
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,347
<i>That's all wrong.</i>

113
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,433
<i>Oh, hell no.</i>

114
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,989
<i>Blech. I know who's writing this garbage.</i>

115
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,272
Oh! Slogans like that are pretty cool.

116
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,988
"One for all," and all that.

117
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,540
I like that kind of thing. It's nice.

118
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,606
Heh. Well, I guess that's easy to see, huh?

119
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,318
You make one person carry the
burden and then you exclude him.

120
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:38,531
Hooray for "One for all." People do it all the time.

121
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,474
Hikigaya, what are you?

122
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,420
All right, everyone, this last one comes from us.

123
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,419
What's the problem? Is something wrong with it?

124
00:08:58,444 --> 00:08:59,935
Not particularly.

125
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,450
But you do have something you want to say about it.

126
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,349
Nope, I really don't.

127
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:07,911
Well, fine. Feel free to offer up your own then.

128
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,531
Okay, I will...

129
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:16,374
People: "Look Close And You'll
Realize One Side is Getting Off Easy".

130
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:17,161
How's that?

131
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:26,038
Idiot, you are such an idiot!

132
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:29,238
That was so awesome! Oh my God, my stomach!

133
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,132
Pull it together, Haruno.

134
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:35,932
Wow, that was pretty good, I think.

135
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,055
I mean, if it's funny it works for me!

136
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,828
Hikigaya, please explain.

137
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,971
Well, they tell us that the kanji for "people"
reflects two people that are supporting each other.

138
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,264
But have you ever noticed one side is leaning?

139
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:53,843
I believe that the acceptance of sacrificing
someone is really the idea behind "people."

140
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:58,708
That's why I think my slogan is perfect
for this festival, and this committee.

141
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:02,520
What exactly do you mean by "sacrifice," Hikigaya?

142
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,646
I'm totally the sacrifice here.

143
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,840
I mean, I'm forced to do stupid amounts of work.

144
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:09,500
Hell, even other people's work is dumped onto me.

145
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:12,915
Or maybe, that's what the chairman meant the other day.

146
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,545
Is that what "helping each other out" looks like?

147
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:18,513
I've never had anyone help me back, so I wouldn't know.

148
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:34,602
Your slogan is...

149
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:37,501
Denied.

150
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,479
Sagami, let's dismiss for today.

151
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,060
We're not getting any good suggestions anyway.

152
00:10:46,303 --> 00:10:46,955
But we need to deci...

153
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,041
It would be foolish of us to
waste a day's work on this right now.

154
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:54,460
All committee members, come up with
some ideas and we'll choose one tomorrow.

155
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,368
If all members are able to work
every day from now until the festival,

156
00:10:58,393 --> 00:11:00,343
we can easily make up for lost time.

157
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:01,571
Sound good?

158
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,981
Yes, sounds good to me.

159
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:07,116
Okay, everyone, I'll see all of you here tomorrow.

160
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,696
I really appreciate it.

161
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:11,761
What was that?

162
00:11:12,513 --> 00:11:14,760
He just wants to make his own job easier.

163
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:19,241
This okay?

164
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:21,481
Is what okay?

165
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:24,218
It's best if we clear up the misunderstanding.

166
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:27,513
It won't clear up. The solution is already there.

167
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,076
That's the end of the problem.

168
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,051
You make excuses for things that don't matter.

169
00:11:32,154 --> 00:11:34,222
When it's important, you don't make excuses.

170
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,397
There's no point in making excuses.

171
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:39,476
Humans tend to make their own
judgments when it's important to them.

172
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,830
I understand... and you may be right.

173
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:44,870
Excuses are meaningless.

174
00:11:45,673 --> 00:11:47,864
Which begs of me to ask the question again...

175
00:11:48,258 --> 00:11:49,424
Hmm?

176
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,708
Well anyway, what was all that? It didn't make any sense.

177
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,316
Well, it was better than yours.

178
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:56,940
What are you, a thesaurus?

179
00:11:56,965 --> 00:11:59,275
It's infuriating how you never change.

180
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,186
Humans don't change that easily.

181
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,667
Especially ones who are weird to begin with.

182
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,291
That was one phrase too many...

183
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:08,526
Watching you makes me think

184
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:11,725
that trying to force myself to
change is just a pointless endeavor.

185
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:14,188
Later.

186
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,413
Yeah. Goodbye.

187
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:24,777
See you tomorrow.

188
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:27,967
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

189
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,799
It's decided. This is going to
be our festival slogan this year.

190
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,340
So, Sagami, we should start
incorporating the slogan now...

191
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,096
Uh... Right. Okay, please incorporate the slogan.

192
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,631
Okay, guys, let's crank out the posters!

193
00:12:47,038 --> 00:12:49,735
Vice Chairman, the update of our website is complete.

194
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:52,259
Got it. Sagami, please check it.

195
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:55,349
Huh? Oh... okay. Got it.

196
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:57,674
All right, please transfer it to the live site.

197
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,561
Got it.

198
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,694
Well, now, aren't we working hard here?

199
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,066
As you can see for yourself.

200
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:16,140
Actually, it doesn't look like
you're working at all that hard to me.

201
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,256
<i>What!? I'm working my ass off!</i>

202
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:19,417
I mean, really...

203
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,360
Its not like your real contributions
will actually be recorded in these minutes.

204
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:25,406
Hey, quiz time!

205
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:29,176
Tell me who it is that actually
unites a team above everything else.

206
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,556
Let me guess, it's the ruthless leader?

207
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:34,292
Oh, come on, now. You know what the answer is.

208
00:13:34,317 --> 00:13:35,886
It's the presence of an enemy.

209
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:39,497
Well, except this enemy is pretty tiny.

210
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:40,542
Just lay off.

211
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:45,092
Yeah, but if a baddie like you is pulling his
weight then there's going to be opposition, right?

212
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,512
They can't exactly grow if
their enemy isn't doing his job.

213
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:52,036
That's why war is seen as the
great advancer of technology!

214
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:53,481
<i>God, she's annoying...</i>

215
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,179
Hey, so, did you intentionally make Yuki...

216
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,715
You know, smart boys know when to be quiet.

217
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,414
Get to work. And stop goofing off.

218
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:08,418
Uh...

219
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:11,269
Draft up the papers required to approve the slogan.

220
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:12,637
Then record the minutes,

221
00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:16,063
and finally notify all teams of the new slogan via email.

222
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:20,655
Actually, while you're at it, scan in the
project proposal form and upload it to the server.

223
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,432
By the end of the day, please.

224
00:14:22,457 --> 00:14:23,519
Want me to help out?

225
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,414
You're in the way. Just go home already.

226
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,646
Ouch! You're so cruel, Sis!

227
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:30,728
I'll stay anyways. Nothing else to do.

228
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:36,173
If you insist on helping, you can review
the budget since it's next on the list.

229
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:39,785
Yes! Now that's how a planning committee should be!

230
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,476
Ah, I am feeling so fulfilled right now!

231
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:51,456
Three minutes to showtime. Three minutes to showtime.

232
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,589
<i>Yukinoshita here. Notice to crew...</i>

233
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:55,098
<i>We're proceeding on time.</i>

234
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,416
<i>All departments sound off.</i>

235
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,825
<i>If there are any problems, report them now.</i>

236
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,110
<i>No problems with lighting.</i>

237
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:01,745
<i>PA here. No problems.</i>

238
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,724
<i>Backstage here. Cast prep
is running slightly behind.</i>

239
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,684
<i>But don't worry, they should be ready in time.</i>

240
00:15:07,403 --> 00:15:10,380
Roger that. Everyone on standby until cued.

241
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:12,359
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

242
00:15:13,248 --> 00:15:18,032
<i>Eight, seven, six, five, four,</i>

243
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:21,288
<i>three, two, one...</i>

244
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:25,554
Hi there! Is everyone culture-ing?!

245
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,499
Yeah!

246
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,818
Chiba's Specialties are dance and...

247
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,712
Festivals!

248
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:34,147
When in Rome, Dance like the Romans!

249
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:36,226
Sing a Song!

250
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:44,888
<i>Almost ready to cut the music.</i>

251
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,540
Roger that.

252
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:49,864
Chairman Sagami, you're on standby.

253
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:56,262
Next up is our planning committee's chairman
to give us the festivals opening remarks.

254
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,330
How about we try again?

255
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:16,198
Chairman, if you would be so kind, take it away.

256
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,998
We're starting to run behind here.

257
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:25,610
You can do it!

258
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:31,431
<i>Hikigaya, signal her to wrap things up.</i>

259
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,943
I have been signaling her. It looks like she can't see me.

260
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,809
<i>Great... Maybe I chose the wrong person for this.</i>

261
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:40,468
Did you just take another dig at my lack of presence?

262
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:42,669
I didn't say anything like that at all.

263
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,303
Anyways, where are you? Out front?

264
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,457
<i>That was obviously a dig.</i>

265
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:49,303
<i>I know you can see me right here.</i>

266
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:52,498
<i>Um, Vice Chairman, we can hear you...</i>

267
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:56,855
As everyone knows this year's slogan is...

268
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:59,786
"Chiba's Specialties: Dance and Festivals. When..."

269
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,095
<i>We're moving the rest of the
schedule up. Proceed accordingly.</i>

270
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,360
I didn't understand anything!

271
00:17:09,518 --> 00:17:11,793
I shouldn't have been deceived by his words.

272
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,563
It's just that he smelled so nice,

273
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:16,500
and he was always shining.

274
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,452
You couldn't help it. You're still so young.

275
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,351
You just didn't know how to love him yet.

276
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,261
Oh...

277
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:28,894
<i>What the hell is this role?</i>

278
00:17:28,952 --> 00:17:31,018
<i>Maybe I should've kept the part after all.</i>

279
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,850
You mustn't come tonight.

280
00:17:34,194 --> 00:17:35,641
Tell me why not?!

281
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:38,313
Didn't I tell you we'd always be together?!

282
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:42,941
<i>Weird. Even the lines from the
original work all sound like yaoi.</i>

283
00:17:43,794 --> 00:17:46,313
But seeing me might make you sad.

284
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,693
We're always going to be together!

285
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,998
There's no way! You just need to give up on me now!

286
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:54,718
I'll never give up! We'll always be together!

287
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,118
<i>Well, she's done for.</i>

288
00:17:58,446 --> 00:17:59,906
<i>I guess I should do something.</i>

289
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:03,968
In the end, you decided to choose him over me...

290
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,632
But it's all right. I'll see you soon.

291
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,851
After all, the muzzle for that sheep I drew...

292
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,548
Has... finally been broken...

293
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:20,570
The sh-sheep... The sheep...

294
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:26,618
Hm?

295
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:29,515
Working hard?

296
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:30,759
How'd it go?

297
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:35,096
It seems to have gone well. I mean the audience liked it.

298
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,496
Everyone has been working really hard.

299
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:40,433
Yeah, well, I guess. I'm sure they did work hard.

300
00:18:40,775 --> 00:18:42,345
I wouldn't know, since I wasn't there.

301
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:45,275
You had the committee. So it's not like
you'd have been able to come check it out.

302
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,355
What the hell?

303
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,248
Let us in!

304
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:53,165
Ahh. Looks like trouble there...

305
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,155
They're going to lose control over
the crowd if those guys keep it up.

306
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,562
Everyone, move out.

307
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:01,864
Line up here, please.

308
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,061
The end of the line is over here!

309
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:06,192
Is the class E representative here?

310
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:08,987
She just so darn cool!

311
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,897
She seems to be feeling better.

312
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,499
Seems to be.

313
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,607
Hey, can I ask you something?

314
00:19:21,837 --> 00:19:23,088
Huh? Like what?

315
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:24,882
When we went to Yukinoshita's,

316
00:19:24,937 --> 00:19:26,388
did you talk about anything?

317
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:26,937
Hm?

318
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:28,789
Um, nope.

319
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:29,516
Huh?

320
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:34,163
After you left, we got hungry, so we just
ended up getting food and eating together...

321
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:37,708
Then we watched some DVDs, and after that I went on home.

322
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:39,144
So...

323
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,603
To answer you, she didn't say anything you'd want to know.

324
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,825
Uh, there's nothing I wanted to know...

325
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:48,468
Really? I wanted to know things.

326
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:50,731
See...

327
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,875
I've decided I can wait for Yukinon a bit.

328
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,895
I think she's trying, at least,
to get a little closer to us...

329
00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:59,285
So then I'll wait.

330
00:20:00,758 --> 00:20:03,592
However, I won't wait if there's no point in waiting.

331
00:20:04,023 --> 00:20:04,503
Hm?

332
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:07,513
Well, I don't think it will do you
any good to wait for someone like that...

333
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:08,807
That's not what I mean.

334
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,877
Instead of waiting, I'll move first.

335
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:12,737
Oh!

336
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:16,391
Is that right?

337
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:17,786
Yup, that's right.

338
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:20,814
Oh, yeah. You haven't had a chance to eat lunch, right?

339
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,398
Look! Honey toast!

340
00:20:24,385 --> 00:20:26,628
It's not really all that uncommon here, is it?

341
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,867
<i>Wait, this is really bread, isn't it?</i>

342
00:20:29,474 --> 00:20:32,204
<i>Couldn't they have tried a little
harder to make it look less like bread?</i>

343
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,532
<i>It's obviously bread. Totally bread.</i>

344
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,380
Yum!

345
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:41,806
<i>The bread is hard.</i>

346
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,876
<i>The honey hasn't soaked all the way through.</i>

347
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,515
<i>My mouth tries to stop chewing halfway through.</i>

348
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:48,028
<i>Is this some kind of punishment?</i>

349
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:49,989
Oh my God, this cream is amazing!

350
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,680
<i>Why did it have to be honey toast?</i>

351
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,037
<i>Also, she stole that cream from my piece of toast.</i>

352
00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:03,630
<i>I guess... it's pretty good.</i>

353
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,093
Oh, my gosh, I'm so full!

354
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,632
So how much do I owe you?

355
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,166
Don't you worry about it.

356
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,139
No, Yui. I can't let you do that.

357
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:13,325
Don't worry!

358
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:15,725
I'm completely fine with being fed,

359
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:17,393
just not to receive charity.

360
00:21:17,418 --> 00:21:19,828
What is up with that stupid pride of yours?

361
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,340
Okay, fine!

362
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,685
I guess you can treat me to honey toast next time then.

363
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:25,465
At Pasela.

364
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:27,627
You've already picked out the place?

365
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:30,900
<i>Does that mean... it's...</i>

366
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:37,204
Uh...

367
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:41,473
Would it be okay to get something else?

368
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:44,129
Sure! So, um, when do you wanna go out?

369
00:21:44,482 --> 00:21:46,305
Uh... Well...

370
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:50,509
Okay. I need to think long and hard about this.

371
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:10,131
Next time: "Thus, His and Her and
Her Youth Continues to Be Wrong."
