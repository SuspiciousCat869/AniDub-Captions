1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,515
Okay, everyone pair up!

2
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:11,395
Pass it to me!

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,197
I'm not feeling very well,
Coach. Can I just hit off the wall?

4
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:16,083
I'll just bother people otherwise.

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,200
Here it comes!

6
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:18,065
Nice!

7
00:00:20,497 --> 00:00:21,877
<i>It's too perfect.</i>

8
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:25,090
<i>This is the countermeasure to
pairing up that I have mastered</i>

9
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:27,616
<i>since I have spent so many years alone.</i>

10
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:34,465
<i>The double whammy of "I'm not feeling
well" plus "I'll just bother people."</i>

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,043
<i>They produce a synergistic effect and subtly
show that I am, at least, willing to participate.</i>

12
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:43,744
<i>Maybe I'll teach it to Zaimokuza someday.</i>

13
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:45,707
That shot was crazy, man!

14
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:49,242
You're exaggerating. I just
happened to slice it the right way.

15
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:49,637
Sorry!

16
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,736
That was totally a magic shot!

17
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:53,272
You're awesome, Hayato!

18
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:55,305
Now I'm gonna have to nail one, too!

19
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:58,062
Here, man! It's my Magic Slicer!

20
00:00:58,128 --> 00:00:58,722
Huh?

21
00:00:59,186 --> 00:00:59,799
Huh?!

22
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:00,766
Ngh!

23
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:02,509
Ah?

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,433
My bad!

25
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:06,185
Hey, uh, little help?

26
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,754
Would you mind hitting the ball over to me, Hikitani?

27
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,627
<i>Who the hell is Hikitani?</i>

28
00:01:13,144 --> 00:01:15,260
Thanks, Hikitani. Sorry for that!

29
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:16,612
Yeah...

30
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:20,022
<i>Why did I nod to him?</i>

31
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:24,068
<i>Looks like I've instinctively
determined that Hayama ranks above me.</i>

32
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,657
<i>Pretty submissive, even for me.</i>

33
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:30,820
<i>I slammed my impending depression against the wall.</i>

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,605
Gah!

35
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:36,432
<i>Walls are an unavoidable part of youth.</i>

36
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,753
<i>I feel at peace when I eat lunch in my favorite place.</i>

37
00:03:16,407 --> 00:03:18,547
<i>This school is situated near the coast,</i>

38
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:21,733
<i>and because of that, the winds
start to change around noon.</i>

39
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,168
<i>The sea breeze we get in the early
morning blows towards the ocean,</i>

40
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,356
<i>as if going back to where it once came from.</i>

41
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:30,681
<i>I suppose I kind of like this moment.</i>

42
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:33,104
Oh, it's you, Hikki!

43
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:34,122
Huh?

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,254
What are you doing out here by yourself?

45
00:03:39,124 --> 00:03:41,360
This is where I always come to eat my lunch.

46
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:44,012
What? For real? Why don't you just eat in the classroom?

47
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,374
<i>Get a clue.</i>

48
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:47,838
What are you doing out here, anyway?

49
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:51,235
Oh, that! Well, you see...

50
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,092
I lost a game with Yukinon...

51
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,167
so this is my punishment.

52
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:57,654
Your just punishment is talking to me?

53
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,694
N-no, that's not what I meant!

54
00:03:59,904 --> 00:04:02,602
I just meant the loser has to go buy drinks.

55
00:04:02,627 --> 00:04:03,988
<i>Oh, thank goodness.</i>

56
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,901
<i>I thought I was going to die there for a minute.</i>

57
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,290
First, Yukinon said,

58
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,926
"I can obtain my own sustenance, thanks.

59
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:14,941
Where is the joy in fulfilling
such meager desire just for conquest?"

60
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,051
That was her trying to get out of it!

61
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:19,062
Well, that sounds like her all right.

62
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:22,503
Yeah, but when I said I would probably lose she agreed.

63
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:24,165
That sounds like her, too.

64
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,828
Oh, well. I've done this with the girls before,

65
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:29,936
but this is the first time I
thought a "punishment" was any fun.

66
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,264
"The girls"? You sound like you're in a clique.

67
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,872
That was mean. Are you saying
you don't like friend groups?

68
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:39,411
Are you dense or something? Of
course I hate in-groups and in-jokes.

69
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,651
Oh, but I do like me some in-fighting.

70
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,134
But that's because I'm not part of any of the "in" crowd.

71
00:04:45,323 --> 00:04:47,256
Ah... Oh, yeah...

72
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:50,815
But you and Yukinon sound like an
"in-group" when you're talking with each other.

73
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:53,829
Sometimes I have a hard time joining in your conversation.

74
00:04:53,854 --> 00:04:56,482
Yukinoshita's different. She's a force of nature.

75
00:04:57,268 --> 00:04:58,439
What do you mean by that?

76
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:02,149
Meaning something people can't do
anything about because it's who they are.

77
00:05:02,332 --> 00:05:04,188
Sorry for using such a difficult term.

78
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,898
I'm not dumb! I know exactly what
that phrase is supposed to mean!

79
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,836
Quit making fun of me, you condescending tool bag!

80
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:13,812
I took the entrance exam to get
into Soubu High, too, you know!

81
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,326
Ah! What the...

82
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:20,864
Hey, speaking of that, I was thinking...

83
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,098
Do you remember that day of our ceremony?

84
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:28,508
Hm... Actually, I was in a car
accident the day of the ceremony.

85
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,078
An accident?

86
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:31,839
Was it when you went...

87
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:32,715
Hey!

88
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,267
Oh, it's Sai!

89
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,114
What's up?

90
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:38,727
Hey there...

91
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:43,121
What are you and Hikigaya doing
here? Eating lunch together?

92
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,754
Nothing special, really. So are you practicing now?

93
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,313
Yeah.

94
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:49,953
You have your club and practice during lunch?

95
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,398
Didn't you choose tennis as your PE activity?

96
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,623
That must be hard!

97
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,868
Not really. I do it 'cause I like it.

98
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:59,168
So, Hikigaya... you're pretty good at tennis.

99
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:00,088
Huh?

100
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:01,651
He is?

101
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:02,424
Yeah.

102
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,332
He has really nice form when he plays.

103
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:07,616
Aww, you're embarrassing me.

104
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:09,753
Who are you?

105
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,886
What?! You're in the same class! I can't believe you!

106
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,459
Well I'm afraid it's true.

107
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:16,691
I'm Saika Totsuka, and I'm in your class.

108
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,600
Uh...

109
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,974
I don't really hang out with girls much...

110
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,371
<i>I mean, I don't really hang out with guys, either.</i>

111
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,562
Oh, I understand, but I'm a guy.

112
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:28,499
Huh?!

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,732
Ah!

114
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,299
I got you there!

115
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:44,522
<i>Whoa, what is this feeling? If he weren't a guy,</i>

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,633
<i>I almost would've confessed and gotten rejected.</i>

117
00:06:46,714 --> 00:06:48,184
<i>Wait, I'd get rejected?</i>

118
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:49,581
Yeah, what is it?

119
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:53,573
Well, it's just the kid I
usually pair up with isn't here...

120
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,179
If you don't mind, can we play?

121
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,554
<i>Jeez, don't look at me like that.</i>

122
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,740
<i>You're too cute, so stop blushing!</i>

123
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:04,407
Really? Okay? I don't have a partner, either.

124
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,601
You really are good at this, Hikigaya.

125
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,292
Hm?

126
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,533
<i>Too close, too close, too close!</i>

127
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:20,567
So, um, actually, there's something I wanted
to ask you about, if that's all right with you.

128
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:22,505
Sure... Okay.

129
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:26,743
Yeah. Well, it's actually about our
tennis club, and if you didn't know...

130
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,591
We're really quite terrible.

131
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:30,182
We have few members,

132
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:31,882
and once the third-years leave,

133
00:07:32,176 --> 00:07:33,708
we'll probably get even worse.

134
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,216
Oh, that's a shame.

135
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:36,789
So, I was...

136
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,090
thinking if you don't mind...

137
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:42,183
that maybe... you'd join our tennis club?

138
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:44,098
Huh?

139
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:45,915
Not possible.

140
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:47,750
What do you mean, "not possible"?

141
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,379
Now you listen here...

142
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:51,201
I said not possible.

143
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:55,293
Come on now, all I have to do is give the
tennis club a good ol' shot in the arm...

144
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,967
<i>My plan was for me to quit the Service Club...</i>

145
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,533
<i>and then I could pretend to join the tennis club.</i>

146
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:04,095
<i>From there, I could gradually
fade out from that activity, too...</i>

147
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:07,401
Do you honestly believe that
you're capable of group activities?

148
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:11,516
No group would accept someone like you...
much less have them play on their team.

149
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:12,417
Ugh!

150
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:16,038
Now, true, it may cause the team to become unified...

151
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,080
just by the fact of accepting you as a common enemy.

152
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:24,627
But, no, working together so they can get rid of you
wouldn't really improve their performance at all...

153
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,411
so it wouldn't solve their problem.

154
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,055
Source: My own.

155
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,152
Yeah, that does make sense...
Wait, where did you come up with that?

156
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,738
I used to live overseas.

157
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:37,461
While I was enrolled in middle
school, all the girls there...

158
00:08:37,676 --> 00:08:40,080
well, they were determined to get rid of me.

159
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:41,780
But they never could succeed...

160
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:45,434
since none of them could ever improve
themselves enough to be better than me.

161
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:47,147
Those stupid imbeciles.

162
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,704
Isn't there anything we can do to help out Totsuka at all?

163
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:55,438
Are you normally the type who worries about other people?

164
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,988
Well, you know, it's just that this was the
first time anyone ever came to me for help, so...

165
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,283
You can't hand out help for every request...

166
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,300
It's just not always the best solution, you know?

167
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,144
Well fine, then what's your solution?

168
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,501
Let me see...

169
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:12,378
I would perhaps have them all run until they die,
then swing until they die, then practice until they die.

170
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:13,153
How's that?

171
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:16,941
Ya-hello!

172
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:19,129
I brought someone with a request for help!

173
00:09:21,463 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, Hikigaya!

174
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:24,174
Totsuka?

175
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:26,473
Huh? What are you doing here?

176
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:29,341
Uh, my club meets in here. What about you?

177
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,925
Oh, you know, since I'm a member of the Service Club,

178
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,048
I thought it would be good to help you all out.

179
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:37,444
And it looked like Sai over here needed some help,

180
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:39,033
so I decided to bring him with me.

181
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:40,188
Yuigahama...

182
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:43,107
Don't worry, there is no need to thank me, Yukinon.

183
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,563
I was only doing what a club member should do.

184
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:49,228
But, Yuigahama, you aren't exactly a member of this club.

185
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:51,361
I'm not a member?!

186
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:55,155
<i>She's not? This isn't one of those things
where she's just suddenly a member somehow?</i>

187
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,403
No. You never turned in an application.

188
00:09:58,488 --> 00:10:00,704
Plus, you haven't received the advisor's approval yet.

189
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:02,055
I'll fill one out!

190
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,453
So, you're Saika Totsuka?

191
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,154
Uh...

192
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:08,644
Very well.

193
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:10,257
Request accepted.

194
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,905
You would like us to help
improve your tennis ability, right?

195
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:17,486
Yeah, I do. I think if I can get better,
maybe the others will work hard with me...

196
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:18,652
Hopefully.

197
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,789
So, what do we do?

198
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:23,650
I just told you earlier. Or did you forget?

199
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,017
Wait, you were actually serious about that?

200
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:27,578
Oh?

201
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:47,326
Blasty Sand Rock!

202
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:50,653
<i>So as the days went by,</i>

203
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:53,604
<i>our tennis challenge entered into its second phase.</i>

204
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:01,918
Ah!

205
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:05,287
Sai! Oh no! Are you hurt?

206
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,808
I'm okay. Keep it going.

207
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,583
You intend to keep playing?

208
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,405
Yeah. You're all still going,
so I want to try a little longer.

209
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:14,686
Fine.

210
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:17,643
Then, please, Yuigahama, take care of the rest.

211
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,503
Huh?

212
00:11:18,903 --> 00:11:20,282
Oh, dear. Well...

213
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,346
I guess she got tired of me since I'm not improving.

214
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,599
I don't think that's the case here.

215
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:28,953
Yukinon doesn't turn her back
on people who are relying on her.

216
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,440
That's true. After all, she put up
with your horrible cooking didn't she?

217
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,078
What do you mean by that?!

218
00:11:36,253 --> 00:11:38,238
Hey, you're playing tennis!

219
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:41,623
So, mind if we play some tennis here, too?

220
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:45,029
Miura... But we're not really playing right now...

221
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,915
What was that? I can't hear you.

222
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:52,876
Yeah, Totsuka got special permission to use this court.

223
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:54,532
No one else can use it right now.

224
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,687
Yeah? Well, you're using it, aren't you?

225
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:59,980
No, I'm helping him practice.

226
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,945
It's like a subcontract... or outsourcing.

227
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:06,286
Huh? What are you even talking about over there?

228
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:07,459
You're so creepy...

229
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,935
Come on, don't try and pick a fight with these guys.

230
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,752
It's more fun to play with everyone.

231
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:12,845
<i>"Everyone"?</i>

232
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:15,779
Who do you mean "everyone"?

233
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,337
Huh?

234
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,003
The same "everyone" you use to beg your mom
for something by saying "Everyone else has one"?

235
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,644
Who's that supposed to be?

236
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:25,637
I don't have any friends, so
I never got to use that excuse.

237
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,393
I didn't mean for it to come across that way.

238
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,440
I'm sorry.

239
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,983
If something's bothering you, we can talk.

240
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:34,915
Hayama, I appreciate that you're always kind.

241
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,835
And I get that you're a really nice guy.

242
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:41,347
You're an ace at soccer... and you're
quite the blonde, good-looking guy to boot.

243
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,135
You must be quite popular among the ladies.

244
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,160
Wh-where's this coming from?

245
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,394
Someone like you, who has so much already,

246
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,181
wants to waltz in all mighty and take
this court from me, who has nothing but this?

247
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:54,564
Do you feel no shame at all by your audacity?

248
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:54,969
Huh?

249
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:57,631
Precisely! Good Sir Hayama!

250
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:01,845
Your behavior is clearly an abhorrent
violation of simple human ethics!

251
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,018
This is so sad...

252
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:05,860
It's four time more depressing with them both here.

253
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,118
Huh?

254
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:12,487
Hey, Hayato, will you hurry
up? I wanna play tennis already.

255
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:15,379
Hm... All right let's do this.

256
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:18,535
As a fellow and former outsider,
I'll play against Hikitani.

257
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:22,127
And the winner will get to use this
tennis court during breaks from now on.

258
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:23,258
Um, what's that?

259
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,424
And the winner will help you practice, too.

260
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,877
After all, you should want to
practice with someone good at tennis.

261
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:30,005
Sound good?

262
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,442
No way! That sounds so fun!

263
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,560
And since that's the case, we
might as well play mixed doubles!

264
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,608
Oh my god, I'm so smart!

265
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:43,661
This is bad. No girl would be willing
to assist a dull, solitary guy like you!

266
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:44,765
What will you do?

267
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:46,423
I'll play with you, Hikki.

268
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:47,281
Huh?

269
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,127
Well, what can I tell ya?

270
00:13:49,585 --> 00:13:51,236
I'm in the Service Club now.

271
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,065
So I should, shouldn't I?

272
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,102
Idiot. Don't you dare do it.

273
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:57,167
Miura's glaring daggers at you, already.

274
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,814
What?! Is she really?!

275
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:03,998
Surely, you do realize, Yui... that
you would be playing against me, right?

276
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,559
You okay with doing that?

277
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,607
I-I wouldn't say that...

278
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,204
But you have to understand...

279
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,557
That my... my club is important to me.

280
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:13,258
Hm...

281
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:25,604
Okay, let's begin.

282
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:28,288
Ha!

283
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:29,731
Guh!

284
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,101
Fifteen-love.

285
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,278
She's good.

286
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:38,818
Well, Yumiko was chosen for the prefectural
girls' tennis tournament in middle school.

287
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,538
So those ringlets aren't just for show.

288
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,441
That's actually more of a loose wave that she wears...

289
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:50,839
Game!

290
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,056
Ow...

291
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:54,391
Hey, are you okay there?

292
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:57,297
Sorry. I might have twisted my ankle a little.

293
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,985
It'll mess things up for Sai if we lose...

294
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:01,331
This really stinks...

295
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,484
Well, you know.

296
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:03,066
Hm?

297
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:05,412
Why don't you just stand on the court and not move at all?

298
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:07,612
I think I can handle the rest.

299
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,816
What will you do?

300
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,279
Well, worst case, I get serious now.

301
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:15,171
When I get serious, I've got no problem
with licking boots to get things done.

302
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,460
I don't think that's what you should really be doing...

303
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:21,190
Wait just a minute.

304
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:29,192
What's the problem now? Did you two fight?

305
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:30,686
Did she abandon you?

306
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:34,184
Don't be stupid, you insolent fool,
I've never been in a fight before.

307
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,623
In fact I've never even had a friendship
that was deep enough to have a real fight.

308
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,033
<i>Self-deprecating jokes really freak
people out if they don't really know you, huh.</i>

309
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:44,375
Hmph.

310
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:46,193
Huh?

311
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:47,022
Huh?

312
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:50,102
<i>Well, either way, guess it's time to grovel.</i>

313
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:54,267
<i>When sucking up, throw away your pride first.</i>

314
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,239
<i>That's what I'm proud of.</i>

315
00:15:56,893 --> 00:15:59,000
<i>I'll show you what happens when I get serious.</i>

316
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:01,249
Huh?

317
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,245
What's all this ruckus going on?

318
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:06,172
What's with that outfit?

319
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,382
I don't know. Yuigahama just asked me to put
it on and come down here for some unknown reason.

320
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:16,128
I couldn't stomach the idea of us losing like
this, so I just wanted you to come play for us.

321
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:17,765
Why choose me for this?

322
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,973
Because you're the only good friend I
can ask to do something like this, Yukinon.

323
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,777
Good friend? Really?

324
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:25,554
Yeah! You're my friend!

325
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,553
Take care of your injuries.

326
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,634
I couldn't find the school nurse
anywhere, so it took longer than I thought.

327
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:35,018
Thanks so much.

328
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:37,539
You sure are a nice person, Yukinon.

329
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,983
Well, it seems a certain creepy little boy has
been calling me the "ice queen" behind my back.

330
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:42,463
Uh!

331
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:46,681
Though, not that I really care
what anyone thinks about me.

332
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:47,555
So then...

333
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:52,526
If it makes you happy, I don't
mind if you call me a friend either.

334
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:53,912
Yukinon!

335
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,796
Could you not cling like that? You're smothering me.

336
00:16:57,758 --> 00:16:59,781
You're Yukinoshita, right?

337
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:02,691
Sorry, but so ya know, I can't go easy on anyone.

338
00:17:02,716 --> 00:17:04,620
Don't worry, that doesn't bother me.

339
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,384
I'll just have to go easy on you.

340
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:09,270
I'll crush that cheap pride of yours to dust.

341
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,754
It looks like you've given my frie-

342
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:15,603
my fellow club member a great deal of grief down here.

343
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,120
Are you ready to get broken?

344
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:20,653
I may not look it, but I like to hold a grudge.

345
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,855
<i>That's exactly how you look.</i>

346
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,553
A feint?! Did you see?

347
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:44,104
I can't believe you were able to return that...

348
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,733
It was easy...

349
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:49,849
She was making the same wretched face as
the girls in my class who always picked on me.

350
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:53,323
I can easily discern what such lowlifes are thinking.

351
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:55,325
Hah!

352
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,196
Game!

353
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,188
Our forces are positively overwhelming!

354
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:12,129
Mow those suckers down!

355
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:13,846
You're awesome, Yukinon!

356
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,427
She's actually going to do a jump serve?

357
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:25,864
You're a ridiculous person, you know that, right?

358
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:27,660
Keep that up and finish this thing.

359
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:30,556
Believe me, I'd love to do that if I thought I could...

360
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,454
but that's asking too much out of me.

361
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:33,185
Huh?

362
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:36,719
The one thing I lack confidence in is my weak stamina.

363
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,337
Huh?

364
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:39,296
Deuce!

365
00:18:40,116 --> 00:18:41,751
I heard what you just said.

366
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:45,421
You came in out of nowhere, but I
think you're probably just about finished.

367
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:48,928
Come on, I think both teams
did their best here. It's a tie.

368
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,077
Hayato! What are you even saying?

369
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,883
This is a match. We have to finish it for real!

370
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:57,285
He will now be the one finishing this match off.

371
00:18:57,354 --> 00:18:58,898
So just give in and lose.

372
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,431
Huh?

373
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:03,243
Listen, I may say rash and improper things...

374
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,109
but I have never told a lie.

375
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,496
<i>Lunch break will be over soon.</i>

376
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:17,816
<i>Normally, I'd be finishing lunch
in my favorite place right now.</i>

377
00:19:26,167 --> 00:19:27,140
All right!

378
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,457
<i>Miura, you obviously don't know...</i>

379
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,927
<i>but there is a unique sea breeze that
only blows here, in the early afternoon.</i>

380
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:39,617
<i>Hayama, you obviously don't know
that this breeze doesn't blow only once.</i>

381
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,764
<i>Only I, the one who sits over there
alone, never speaking to anyone...</i>

382
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:46,819
<i>can hit my magic serve.</i>

383
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,439
We have a match point!

384
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:55,273
Now you mention it, I've heard of this... the legendary
ability to manipulate the wind's power like that,

385
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:57,988
The Wind Successor: Eulen Silpheed!

386
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,952
I don't believe what just happened!

387
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,696
You got me there. That was a magic serve.

388
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:06,874
As a kid, how many people did you play baseball with?

389
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:09,503
Uh, well, eighteen's the usual number.

390
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:12,470
That's true. But I usually played baseball alone.

391
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:14,520
<i>That's right.</i>

392
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:16,422
<i>I've gotten through everything alone.</i>

393
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:22,367
<i>While all of you were arguing and consoling
each other, and giving pats on the back,</i>

394
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,066
<i>I was taking on everything head-on, alone.</i>

395
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,445
<i>What do you think of this strength?</i>

396
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:31,731
Damn you, insufferable youth!

397
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:35,529
Look at that! It's the Meteor Strike!

398
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:37,568
God of Destruction in the Sky!

399
00:20:37,593 --> 00:20:39,517
What exactly is the Meteor Strike?

400
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,915
<i>It's not that big a deal.</i>

401
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:41,994
<i>Just a pop up.</i>

402
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:44,573
<i>This allows me to throw, hit,</i>

403
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,668
<i>and catch the ball by myself.</i>

404
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,686
Wh-what is that serve?

405
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:51,352
Yumiko! Get back!

406
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:52,533
Oh no!

407
00:20:59,087 --> 00:20:59,607
Ah?

408
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:03,966
Game...

409
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:09,095
Hayato! Hayato! Hayato!

410
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,488
What the hell?

411
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,740
We won the game, but lost the match, I suppose.

412
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:16,296
Hikki won, and they still ignore him.

413
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,864
I feel so bad for him.

414
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:20,108
Yukinon!

415
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,718
Sorry, but could you get off?

416
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,145
You're smothering me.

417
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:24,928
Hm?

418
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:28,539
Thank you for, um, playing with us.

419
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,919
<i>What kind of rom-com development is this?!</i>

420
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,311
<i>Girls with girls, guys with guys...</i>

421
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:40,009
<i>Are all the rom-com gods idiots?</i>

422
00:21:40,838 --> 00:21:43,559
I didn't really do anything. You should be thanking them.

423
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:48,997
Hey, Totsuka says-Huh?!

424
00:21:52,994 --> 00:21:54,178
Get the hell out!

425
00:21:58,374 --> 00:22:01,121
<i>Of course. Now this is a real rom-com.</i>

426
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,108
<i>Well played, gods of rom-com.</i>

427
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,899
Hikigaya, are you okay?

428
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,732
I got a weird message, so I was just a little surprised.

429
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,114
A chain mail?

430
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:51,101
You just assume I'll sexually harass someone, and
you act like I'm the culprit. Let's see your proof!

431
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:52,399
I think I know who did it!

432
00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:54,771
I don't want to think that one of them is the culprit.

433
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,901
All three of them, stepping
aside for the sake of their friends!

434
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,626
That has to be it!

435
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:02,809
Oh, Big Brother!

436
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,586
I've solved all the mysteries.

437
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:09,632
Next time: "In Other Words, He Doesn't Have Many Friends."
