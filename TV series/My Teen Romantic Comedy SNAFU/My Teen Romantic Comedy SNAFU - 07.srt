1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,512
<i>You've got mail.</i>

2
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:05,213
Hm?

3
00:00:11,944 --> 00:00:12,811
<i>That'll do it.</i>

4
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:18,167
<i>Later tonight, I'll reply back, "Sorry, the
power was off," or, "I must have had a bad signal."</i>

5
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,259
<i>If I do it that way, she can't hold it against me.</i>

6
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:24,370
<i>Source: My own experience.</i>

7
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:27,895
<i>In middle school, whenever I worked
up the courage to message a girl,</i>

8
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:30,472
<i>I got these responses 40% of the time.</i>

9
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,165
<i>30% of the time, I got no response,</i>

10
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,719
<i>and the remaining 30%,</i>

11
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:38,250
<i>I got responses from some
foreign dude named Mailer Daemon.</i>

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,683
<i>You've got mail. You've got mail. You've
got mail. You've got mail. You've got mail.</i>

13
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:46,223
<i>You've got mail.</i>

14
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:54,361
<i>"It's Ms. Hiratsuka. Please
contact me as soon as you get this."</i>

15
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:59,233
<i>Hikigaya, I need to speak to you immediately
concerning the Service Club's summer activities.</i>

16
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:00,897
<i>Please call me back.</i>

17
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:04,169
<i>Come on... are you still sleeping?</i>

18
00:01:04,889 --> 00:01:07,599
<i>I've tried to call and email you several times.</i>

19
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>You've actually seen them, haven't you?</i>

20
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,415
<i>You have, haven't you?</i>

21
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,121
That's way too frickin' scary.

22
00:01:18,074 --> 00:01:21,464
<i>I think I just had a glimpse of one
reason why Ms. Hiratsuka can't get married.</i>

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,876
<i>She must like me a whole lot, jeez.</i>

24
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,831
<i>You're scary. You're scaring the crap outta me.</i>

25
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,979
Whew! I'm finally done with all of my summer homework!

26
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,036
Well, good for you.

27
00:03:07,348 --> 00:03:10,659
Big Brother! You know I studied
really hard to finish it all.

28
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:12,187
I'm sure you did.

29
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:16,693
I think I deserve a really cool
reward for all the hard work I put in.

30
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,112
What are you, an office lady from Marunouchi?

31
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,643
Whatever. I need to be rewarded!

32
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:25,828
So I proclaim here and now that you have
to come with me to check out Chiba city.

33
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:27,755
Well, that's a huge leap of logic.

34
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:31,421
Huge enough that I bet it could have
won the Birdman Rally if it were entered.

35
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,870
What do you want over there, anyway?

36
00:03:35,497 --> 00:03:39,115
I can't get you anything too
expensive. I've only got 400 yen on me.

37
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:41,210
Ugh, that wouldn't buy anything.

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,916
I didn't really want anything specific at all.

39
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:46,755
I would just be happy to hang out with my big brother.

40
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:50,196
Hey, I'd give myself a lot of points for that one!

41
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:51,536
You're a pain.

42
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,462
Fine, I'll go with you, but change your clothes.

43
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:56,204
If you go out looking half-dressed like that,

44
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:59,834
I'd have to shoot laser pointers in the
eyes of every pervy guy who walks by us.

45
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:02,851
Oh, hey, I'd give myself a lot of points for that one.

46
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:06,527
You're way too overprotective of me, and don't be creepy.

47
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:08,287
I don't know what you wanna do in Chiba,

48
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,795
but if you just want me to hang
with you, that's fine with me.

49
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,582
Yay! Thanks, Bro!

50
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:16,220
You should go change into some
better-looking clothes as well, Big Brother!

51
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:20,361
There!

52
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:22,609
Okay, let's go!

53
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,600
Chiba...

54
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,557
Hm? Chiba, Chiba!

55
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,581
So...

56
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:31,880
How about you tell me why you didn't answer my calls?

57
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,541
Well, all's well that ends well.

58
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:38,625
I was just relieved to finally
get in touch with your sister...

59
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,433
after exhausting myself.

60
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,554
<i>She's got a scary way of texting and checking in on me...</i>

61
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,024
Anyway, you need something? I'm going to Chiba...

62
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:50,603
<i>We're</i> going to Chiba. You still didn't look at my texts?

63
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:51,343
Huh?

64
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:53,152
You're late, Hikki!

65
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,389
Huh? Why are you guys here?

66
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:57,142
Why? For the club, of course!

67
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,096
Yui! Yahello!

68
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,003
Komachi! Yahello!

69
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:02,831
<i>Is that greeting a thing now?</i>

70
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,357
<i>Stop it. It's stupid.</i>

71
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:06,597
And Yukino, too! Yahello!

72
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:07,169
Ya...

73
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,427
Afternoon, Komachi.

74
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:12,757
Ah! I'm so happy you invited me along!

75
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:13,864
Hmph!

76
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,455
<i>Using my affection for my sister
to lure me out... That's low.</i>

77
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,491
<i>My sister is the lowest one of them all.</i>

78
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,190
Hachiman! Hm?

79
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:26,036
<i>No. I foresaw this, and just
pretended to be lured out by my sister.</i>

80
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:26,860
Hachiman! Hachiman!

81
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:29,304
<i>Thank you, God. I knew you were there.</i>

82
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,476
Totsuka, yahello!

83
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:32,176
Hey, yahello.

84
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,722
<i>Omigod, that's so cute!</i>

85
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:35,189
<i>Let's make that popular!</i>

86
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,245
All right, then. Time for us to get going.

87
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:45,499
So, um, why are we taking the
highway to get to Chiba Station?

88
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,032
Let me ask you this.

89
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:50,977
When did you come up with this grand
delusion that we're going to Chiba Station, huh?

90
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,791
What delusion? When people say they're
going to Chiba, they're usually...

91
00:05:53,816 --> 00:05:55,497
You thought we meant Chiba Station?

92
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,308
No, we're going to Chiba Village!

93
00:05:58,428 --> 00:05:59,664
Not what you expected!

94
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,240
Why did you get so hyper about that?

95
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,364
Now I remember this place.

96
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:13,744
It's ingrained in me.

97
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,161
We were here for our outdoor class in middle school.

98
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,874
Hayama?

99
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:23,027
Hey there, Hikitani.

100
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:24,405
Why are you guys here?

101
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,845
Looks like everyone's here.

102
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,618
You're going to be volunteering.
Doesn't that sound like fun?

103
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,098
Volunteer work?

104
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:36,466
You're going to work as assistants.

105
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,803
This camp school will act as part
of a training camp for your club.

106
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:46,045
Finally, let's say hello to the young men and women
who are here to help you during your stay at the camp.

107
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,998
Nice to meet you!

108
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,568
Please know you can come talk
to us about anything at anytime.

109
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:56,471
I hope you will all make loads of great
memories while having fun here at camp.

110
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:58,668
Can't wait to work with you!

111
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,789
So, um, what are Hayama and
his friends doing here exactly?

112
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:07,021
They were short on staff, so they
offered extra credit to recruit volunteers.

113
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:08,474
It's a good opportunity.

114
00:07:09,034 --> 00:07:12,637
You guys need to start to learn how to
work with other communities around you.

115
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,192
That's impossible. We'll never
get along with those people.

116
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:19,358
That's not what I mean. You don't have to get along.

117
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:19,937
Huh?

118
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:22,362
I'm just saying to try and work with them.

119
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:27,503
Learn how to work side by side instead of
ignoring each other or finding ways of being hostile.

120
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:30,745
You know, that's just what it
means to be socially well-adjusted.

121
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,858
Now then, kids, let's get ready for orienteering!

122
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:40,413
Okay, your first job is to help
make sure orienteering goes smoothly.

123
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:44,241
So just work together and make
sure trouble doesn't break out.

124
00:07:48,147 --> 00:07:51,108
Man, these grade school kids are so young!

125
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,867
Being in high school must make us old fogies, huh?

126
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:57,040
Will you cut that out? You make me
sound like an old hag or something.

127
00:07:57,207 --> 00:08:01,751
But when I was in grade school, I found all the
high school kids seemed really grown up and mature.

128
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:05,895
I'm with you. I think high school kids
seem really grown up and mature, as well.

129
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,816
Excluding my brother, of course.

130
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:10,592
Hey now, I'm really grown up and mature too!

131
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:11,728
What more do you want?

132
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:15,285
I grumble and I tell filthy lies,
and I do really underhanded things...

133
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,173
I never knew you had such a sad image of adulthood.

134
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,643
Hey, what are those kids doing over there?

135
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:24,915
I'll check it out.

136
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:26,928
I'm scared...

137
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,325
It's okay. It's just a harmless rat snake.

138
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:32,738
Oh, you're amazing!

139
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,428
You touched it, too!

140
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,191
It's fine. They don't bite,
and they're not venomous at all.

141
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,556
I don't want to touch one whether it bites or not!

142
00:08:39,612 --> 00:08:40,529
Yeah!

143
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:41,088
Huh?

144
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,511
<i>Just like Stand Users are drawn to one another,</i>

145
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:51,752
<i>lonely people have a knack
for finding other lonely people.</i>

146
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,002
Hey, Big Brother, can you tell
us where the checkpoint is located?

147
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:56,422
I'm not sure where it is.

148
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:58,115
Hey, will you look for it with us?!

149
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:00,425
Sure... I'll help you with this one.

150
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,905
But don't tell the others I helped, okay?

151
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,124
<i>Typical Hayama.</i>

152
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:07,781
<i>Master of communication. Sharing secrets...</i>

153
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,153
<i>Is this another technique needed to work well with others?</i>

154
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:12,528
Big Brother! I think this is really bad!

155
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,645
What is it?

156
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,825
You have no chance of beating a hot guy like him!

157
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,193
Danger! Danger! Danger! Red light ahead!

158
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,720
Shut up. Go away.

159
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,913
This very well may be terrible.

160
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:28,512
Hikitani, you have a strong uke aura, but a lazy one,
so if Hayama makes a move on you, you'll be down fast.

161
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,563
R-really? Guess I'll be careful.

162
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:50,500
Did you find the checkpoint yet?

163
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:52,223
Not yet...

164
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:55,682
I see. Then let's all look together. What's your name?

165
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,408
It's Rumi Tsurumi.

166
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,629
I'm Hayato Hayama. Nice to meet you.

167
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:02,942
Think it might be hidden over there?

168
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,188
Hey, did you just see that?

169
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,769
He just went up and talked to her so easily.

170
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:09,756
He even got her name like it was nothing.

171
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:13,161
A trick you could never master,
even if you spent your life trying.

172
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:14,228
Although still...

173
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,620
I can't say it was a good way to go about it.

174
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:21,841
I thought so.

175
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:25,535
I guess that kind of thing happens in grade school too.

176
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:28,083
Grade school and high school
students are not any different.

177
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,836
We're all still humans, no matter the age.

178
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,563
That should stoke the fire, don't you think?

179
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:45,216
Seems like you've got a lot of experience doing this.

180
00:10:46,165 --> 00:10:49,805
I may not look it, but I went to barbecues
all the time during my college days.

181
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,843
The couples would all hang around flirting...

182
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,812
while I just sat there and lit the fire...

183
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:56,089
Ugh. It made me sick to my stomach.

184
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:59,825
Boys, start the fires. Girls, get the ingredients ready.

185
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:01,372
Okay!

186
00:11:02,034 --> 00:11:04,882
<i>Dividing up the boys and girls. Still holding a grudge?</i>

187
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:06,481
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

188
00:11:08,548 --> 00:11:12,343
Well, considering we're cooking outdoors
for a bunch of rowdy sixth graders,

189
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:13,641
the menu's appropriate.

190
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,825
Everyone's personality comes
out when making homestyle curry.

191
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:20,126
My mom's curry has a bunch of
stuff in it, like thick fried tofu.

192
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,239
It's so good.

193
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,221
Ours, too!

194
00:11:22,451 --> 00:11:24,703
And fish paste cakes, am I right?

195
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:25,631
I guess.

196
00:11:26,157 --> 00:11:27,964
<i>Don't be so casual all of the sudden!</i>

197
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,112
<i>He'll think we're friends!</i>

198
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,838
Mom's curry always has stuff like that, too.

199
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,523
Not long ago, our curry had weird leaves in it.

200
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:37,612
My mom's kind of a space case
when it comes to things like that.

201
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:40,987
Do you think she might have
put some laurier into her curry?

202
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:42,528
<i>What? Loli-e?</i>

203
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:46,543
I can't believe some kind of leaf got put into the curry!

204
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:50,219
Just to let you know, laurier are
bay leaves, from the bay laurel tree.

205
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:53,143
Oh, so it's not just a tissue brand?

206
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,497
Now we just wait for everything to cook.

207
00:11:57,446 --> 00:12:00,192
If you aren't busy, how about going around and helping?

208
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:03,673
Well, we don't get many opportunities
to talk to grade school kids.

209
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:04,800
So, sure!

210
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:06,998
Sounds, great... I'll watch the pot.

211
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:09,147
Don't worry about that, Hikigaya.

212
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,557
I'll be sure to watch your pot for you.

213
00:12:24,237 --> 00:12:25,604
Tell me, do you like curry?

214
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:28,630
<i>I agree.</i>

215
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:32,245
<i>When you speak to a lonely person,
keep it quiet and confidential.</i>

216
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:33,400
<i>Do not startle them.</i>

217
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:37,630
<i>You have to use the utmost consideration
to avoid making them feel exposed.</i>

218
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,213
Not really. I don't care about curry.

219
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,605
<i>Good answer.</i>

220
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,339
<i>If you answer favorably,</i>

221
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,213
<i>people will think you're full of yourself,</i>

222
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,930
<i>and if you answer curtly, they'll
think, "What's with that attitude?"</i>

223
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:53,336
<i>A strategic retreat is your only hope.</i>

224
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:57,326
Since we're making curry, why
don't we add a secret ingredient?

225
00:12:57,351 --> 00:12:58,224
Who has something?

226
00:12:58,248 --> 00:12:59,030
Me! Me!

227
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:01,719
Me! I think we should add some fruit to it!

228
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:02,422
Like peaches!

229
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:03,784
Is she some kind of idiot?

230
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:05,772
They're all idiots.

231
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,700
Yeah, well, that's how most people are in the world.

232
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,525
Good for you for realizing it.

233
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,910
You do realize you're part of "most people"?

234
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,459
Don't you underestimate me.

235
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,172
I've the extraordinary ability to be
alone even in a large crowd of "most people."

236
00:13:19,293 --> 00:13:23,310
Only you could say something like that
with such pride and conviction in your voice.

237
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,390
I've gone beyond exasperation to contempt.

238
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,797
If you're beyond that, wouldn't you end up at respect?

239
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,334
So, your name?

240
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,587
What exactly is that supposed to mean?

241
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:34,640
I'm asking what your name is.

242
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:36,435
Wasn't that clear enough for you?

243
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:40,877
Generally when you ask for someone's
name, it's polite to give your own name first.

244
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,244
Uh! Rumi Tsurumi.

245
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:46,525
I'm Yukino Yukinoshita, and he's...

246
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:48,935
Hiki... Hikiga...

247
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,112
Hikigaribbit, was it, again?

248
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:54,234
Hey! How did you get a hold of
knowing my fourth grade nickname?

249
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:57,914
<i>In the end, they dropped the
"Hikiga" and just called me "Ribbit."</i>

250
00:13:58,729 --> 00:14:01,444
Hey, Ribbit! You're hopping home already?

251
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:05,102
I'm Hachiman Hikigaya.

252
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,819
And the one here running is Yui Yuigahama.

253
00:14:08,409 --> 00:14:10,109
You're Rumi Tsurumi, right?

254
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:11,675
Nice to meet you!

255
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,673
Those two...

256
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,280
they seem kind of different from everyone else.

257
00:14:17,353 --> 00:14:18,977
Like they're both a little off.

258
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,521
I'm different too... from others.

259
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:24,233
What do you mean by "different"?

260
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:26,277
They're all such kids.

261
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,831
So, I... I figured I'd just as well be alone.

262
00:14:29,856 --> 00:14:32,799
But I think having friends and
sharing memories from grade school

263
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:35,424
are important things to have
when growing up in the world...

264
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:38,047
I don't need any memories.

265
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,343
Once I start middle school,

266
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:43,283
I can just make friends with
kids coming from other schools.

267
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,663
Sorry to tell you, but I'm
afraid it doesn't work that way.

268
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,375
The kids who are ostracizing you now

269
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,619
will probably be in middle school with you, too.

270
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:53,918
So it'll just end up happening again.

271
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:57,488
And this time, they'll just do it along
with the kids coming from other schools.

272
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,369
So that's it... That's how it works...

273
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:04,403
I've really been acting stupid.

274
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:06,490
What happened?

275
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:10,033
I've excluded people at times here and there...

276
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:14,390
But it eventually ends somehow,
and I'm back to talking to them again.

277
00:15:15,103 --> 00:15:18,837
Someone always says something, and
everyone else just jumps on board.

278
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:24,853
After doing that for a while, before I
knew it, I was the one being excluded.

279
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:28,868
It's not like I really did anything to them...

280
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:33,875
Am I going to end up like this in middle school, too?

281
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,273
I hope she's okay...

282
00:15:39,462 --> 00:15:41,566
Hm? Is there something worrying you?

283
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,527
Well, it's just there's one
girl who's sort of all on her own.

284
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,407
I feel sort of bad for her.

285
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,443
<i>No. They don't understand the real problem.</i>

286
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,423
<i>There's nothing wrong with being isolated or being alone.</i>

287
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:56,342
<i>The problem is that she's been
driven to isolation by malice.</i>

288
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,192
So then, what do you guys want to do?

289
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,333
Well, I...

290
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,944
I wanna be able to do whatever I can for her.

291
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:06,592
So you want to do whatever you can, huh?

292
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:07,447
Uh...

293
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:09,420
Look you can't help her.

294
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,040
You couldn't before.

295
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:13,997
Hm...

296
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,147
What about you, Yukino?

297
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:20,089
You said earlier this doubles as a
training camp for the Service Club, correct?

298
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:23,659
So, it's possible that her case falls
within the scope of our club's activities?

299
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:28,155
Volunteering at this camp school is
technically a club activity on its own.

300
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:31,905
Fundamentally, I think it's fair
to say that her case does qualify.

301
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:32,918
Understood.

302
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:38,281
Then, if she seeks our help, we'll use any means
necessary to find a solution to her problem okay?

303
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:40,849
That's great,

304
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:42,653
but, do you think she wants your help?

305
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,844
I don't know about...

306
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,605
Yukinon...

307
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,662
I think she wants to, but she
just can't seem to say it aloud.

308
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:52,794
Remember what Rumi said? She
once did the same things to others.

309
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:57,286
Maybe she feels bad for being the
only one coming to ask us for help.

310
00:16:57,673 --> 00:16:59,319
I bet the others feel the same.

311
00:16:59,605 --> 00:17:04,682
Even if they want to talk to her and be friends,
the circumstances around them make it impossible.

312
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,790
Anyone opposed to helping this kid out?

313
00:17:07,932 --> 00:17:11,775
Good. Then, all of you think about what you
should do and then go and get started on it.

314
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,670
In the meantime, I'm going to bed.

315
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:24,105
Um, you know, that girl is pretty cute, so
shouldn't she just hang out with other really cute kids?

316
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:25,931
I mean she takes a shot at talking to them,

317
00:17:25,973 --> 00:17:27,611
and then they become like friends.

318
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:28,804
Piece of cake, right?

319
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:30,031
That's totally it!

320
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:31,846
You're so on the ball, Yumiko!

321
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:33,664
Yeah, I know, right?

322
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:36,347
That only works for you 'cause of who you are, Yumiko.

323
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,739
But I think Yumiko's got the right idea...

324
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:40,694
At least to establish a foothold.

325
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:43,449
Although, in her current situation,

326
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,017
it might be too difficult for her to even talk to them.

327
00:17:46,577 --> 00:17:47,357
Oh...

328
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:48,243
Please.

329
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,303
Go for it, Hina.

330
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,516
She just has to live for some kind of new hobby.

331
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,585
When you're absorbed in a hobby that you really love,

332
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:57,685
you start going to events and making new acquaintances.

333
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:01,861
I think it'll help her find out where
she belongs and give her some options.

334
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:04,508
She'll realize pretty soon that school isn't everything.

335
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:08,424
I made new friends through our mutual love of yaoi!

336
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:08,944
Huh?

337
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:11,776
Every girl <i>loves</i> to watch the gay guys!

338
00:18:11,801 --> 00:18:13,303
So, Yukinoshita, you and I should... Oh...

339
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,986
Yumiko, go with Hina to get some drinks.

340
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:16,759
Okay!

341
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,375
Come on, Ebina. Let's go.

342
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,562
Hey! I'm still evangelizing!

343
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:21,899
Hey! Wait!

344
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:26,632
I guess this won't be solved unless we come up
with a way for all of them to be friends somehow.

345
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,600
Ha! "All of them," huh?

346
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,620
That would never be possible.

347
00:18:31,268 --> 00:18:33,161
Not in a million years would that work.

348
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,556
Hey, what's the deal with you, Yukinoshita?

349
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:36,324
What's that?

350
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:40,672
Seriously, why do you go and say stuff like
that when we're supposed to be getting along here?

351
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:45,288
I don't really like you at all, but here I am
putting up with it for the sake of this stupid camp trip!

352
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:47,346
Come on, Yumiko, that's enough...

353
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:49,916
Oh, I didn't know you thought so highly of me.

354
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,528
That's really too bad because I don't like you at all.

355
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,352
Yukinon! Hold it in!

356
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:59,173
But, um, Rumi seems like the abrasive
type, so it might be hard for her to fit in.

357
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:00,473
Yeah, you're right.

358
00:19:00,498 --> 00:19:03,362
She does seem a bit distant, maybe even a little frigid.

359
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:07,293
Frigid? She totally looks down her nose
at everyone she comes into contact with.

360
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,923
She's excluded because she goes
around acting like she's above everyone.

361
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:12,310
Like someone else I know.

362
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,984
That's just your own persecution complex.

363
00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:19,652
Maybe you feel like you're being looked down
on because you're aware of your own inferiority.

364
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:22,394
You know something... it's because you say stuff like...

365
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:23,682
Yumiko, stop.

366
00:19:23,921 --> 00:19:24,375
Ah!

367
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:25,552
Hmph!

368
00:19:34,135 --> 00:19:35,300
Oh my goodness...

369
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,095
Yes, Hachiman...

370
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,881
<i>I'm never gonna get to sleep like this.</i>

371
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:45,701
Huh?

372
00:19:58,417 --> 00:19:59,131
Who's there?

373
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,181
It's me.

374
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:01,950
Who?

375
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,923
Why did you say that like you didn't know me?

376
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,850
We are in the same club, after all.

377
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:07,977
What are you doing here at this hour?

378
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,139
You should be in the midst of eternal sleep.

379
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:13,552
Could you please not sentence me
to death and disguise it as kindness?

380
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,623
Are you looking at the stars?

381
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:20,289
Miura tried to pick a fight with me in the cabin.

382
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:24,053
I spent about thirty minutes
out-arguing her until she cried.

383
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,383
Things got awkward, so you left?

384
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,962
Truth is, I never expected her to
start crying in front of everyone.

385
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:33,648
For the moment, Yuigahama is there consoling her.

386
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:37,120
Honestly, I thought someone like you
could handle the pain of someone crying.

387
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,792
<i>What the hell? I think I'll take up bawling.</i>

388
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:43,643
We need to help that girl out.
We can't just leave her like that.

389
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:46,477
You're awfully motivated to help someone you don't know.

390
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,669
Everyone we've helped has been someone I didn't know.

391
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:54,544
After all, I don't ever reach out to
help people because I might know them.

392
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:58,296
Besides, doesn't she remind you of Yuigahama a bit?

393
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:00,157
Does she?

394
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:05,776
Yeah, I think Yuigahama must have had
some kind of similar experience in her past.

395
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:06,842
That, and...

396
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,983
I think Hayama has been
concerned about her well-being, too.

397
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:15,811
So, well, um... is there something between you two?

398
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:18,006
We just went to the same grade school.

399
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,196
Plus, our parents know each other.

400
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:23,722
His father is working as a corporate
lawyer for my parents' company.

401
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:28,014
Is that so? I guess it must be kinda
tough knowing someone through family.

402
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:29,692
I suppose it must be.

403
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:31,602
You're acting like this isn't about you.

404
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:35,041
It's my sister's job to make
appearances on the outside like that.

405
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:36,467
While I'm just...

406
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,482
just an understudy.

407
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,785
But even still, I am glad I got to come here today.

408
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,460
I didn't think I'd get to.

409
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:47,442
Really? Why's that?

410
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,399
I'm going to head back now.

411
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:56,174
Okay... Later.

412
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,631
Right. Goodnight.

413
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,252
In Takama-ga-hara...

414
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,716
Do you think wizards can be counted as monsters?

415
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:50,141
Grr! I'm going to eat you!

416
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:51,241
What are you, a cat monster?

417
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,169
Seriously? Talk about scary.

418
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:55,697
Your eyes looked so dead, I thought you were a ghost.

419
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:57,001
Wait!

420
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,354
Gah! What?

421
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:00,047
Is that...

422
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:03,786
I can do traditional Japanese folklore stuff, too!

423
00:24:05,971 --> 00:24:09,129
Next time: "One Day, They Will Learn the Truth."
