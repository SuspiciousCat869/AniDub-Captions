1
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:05,895
<i>"It's taking part that counts."</i>

2
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:10,046
<i>These words became famous after
the father of the modern Olympics,</i>

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:12,985
<i>Baron Pierre de Coubertin, used them in a speech.</i>

4
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:17,108
<i>But some say the quote is frequently misused,</i>

5
00:00:17,254 --> 00:00:20,162
<i>and is used as a coercion tool to force participation.</i>

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,787
<i>Yet, there are countless situations in
society where it's a waste to even show up.</i>

7
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,325
<i>If it's taking part that counts,</i>

8
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:33,504
<i>then taking part in the side that
doesn't take part should also count, right?</i>

9
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,098
<i>If everything can be chalked up to experience,</i>

10
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:40,267
<i>then the experience of experiencing
nothing should be worth just as much.</i>

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,746
Huh?

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,900
The fact is, the simple act of not
getting experience could be just as priceless.

13
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,046
Jeez, there he goes again...

14
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:53,542
Considering he's so convincing despite the
ridiculous "logic" he spews, it's really pretty pathetic.

15
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,764
Wait a sec. I'm not to blame here.

16
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:57,094
That's on society!

17
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:01,169
Now this is what I call real teamwork!

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,124
All right then, let's do this!

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,534
Hey! Hey! Hey! Yay!

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,971
Yay...

21
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,660
Hm...

22
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:49,820
What do you think we should do about this?

23
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:52,054
Oh, do you mean this?

24
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:58,965
<i>Trans Chiba Email Counseling.</i>

25
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,909
<i>This is the newest aspect of our club's work.</i>

26
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:05,912
"I'm looking for ideas to make
our athletic festival more exciting.

27
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:08,891
Also, it's my last one, so I want to win!"

28
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:11,608
Ugh. That time of the year already?

29
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,876
God, I seriously hated the competitive class relays.

30
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,486
All that unexplained pressure...

31
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:20,288
Yeah, well, I couldn't run very
fast, so it was hard for me too.

32
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,887
I forgot, there was always <i>that</i> guy...

33
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,327
Anytime that a classmate would start to fall behind,

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,679
the soccer player Nagayama, would rage out.

35
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:29,879
Who is that? Why'd you even say his name?!

36
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,036
<i>Well, I hated that guy.</i>

37
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,643
<i>Though I'm pretty sure he hated me right back.</i>

38
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:39,231
And also, the girl who didn't want to take the baton.

39
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:41,705
Why would she say, "I can't believe this!"

40
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,281
When she was the next one after me?

41
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:44,094
So cold...

42
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,605
Uh, no, she's just...

43
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:49,215
I believe you know the answer perfectly
well so there's no need to comment.

44
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:52,623
Usually, when girls act reluctant
like that, she probably means it.

45
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,573
Well that sounds like a comment.

46
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,744
You should probably look up "comment."

47
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,496
You know what else happens at athletic festivals?

48
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,272
Oh boy, you have more?

49
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:05,514
I do! When you're one person short, and you
have to do gymnastic formations with the teacher.

50
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,905
Because you don't even have enough for a fan formation.

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,260
I pity the parents who had to see their kid do that.

52
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:12,957
Come in.

53
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,975
Ah! I've come to the right place
for the Service Club, haven't I?

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,712
I sent an email earlier about the athletic
festival, but I didn't get a reply, so I came in person.

55
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,537
So this email came from...

56
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:28,559
Yeah, that's probably the one I sent over.

57
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:32,454
I want to make the athletic festival
as exciting as the cultural festival!

58
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,423
You did such a great job last time,
please help Yukinoshita and... Hmm...

59
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:37,880
Oh, uh...

60
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:40,272
Hikigaya. It's Hikigaya!

61
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:43,243
Oh, yes, Hikigaya! And you're...

62
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:46,559
Uh, actually I'm Yuigahama.

63
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:47,649
He's Hikigaya.

64
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:52,585
I'm sorry. I don't know why, but
I've gotten so bad at remembering names.

65
00:04:52,745 --> 00:04:57,729
Oh, don't worry about it. Hikigaya's a professional
when it comes to not having his name remembered by anyone.

66
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:59,883
I don't want to hear that kind of stuff from you.

67
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,609
You're not wrong, but still.

68
00:05:01,838 --> 00:05:03,020
Then it's okay, right?

69
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:05,077
You're also good at erasing your own presence.

70
00:05:05,102 --> 00:05:05,888
It's like a superpower.

71
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:07,694
No, that isn't true, Hikki!

72
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:10,982
You're in the classroom alone a
lot, so you actually do stand out more!

73
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:13,041
Does that even count as a defense?

74
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,994
So, uh, Hikigaya...

75
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,880
Ah... Y-yes?

76
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,797
Hikigaya, right? 'Kay, I've got it now!

77
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,137
You worked hard on the cultural festival, too!

78
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:23,957
I know I can count on you!

79
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:24,645
Sure.

80
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:28,223
Just hold on a second.

81
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:32,882
You can definitely forget about that one, so
why don't you just tell us more about your request.

82
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,422
Oh, that's right!

83
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:38,805
I need help in coming up with the boys' and
girls' featured events at the athletic festival.

84
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,508
Featured events? 'Kay...

85
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,432
Come to think of it, what were
the featured events last year?

86
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,861
Now that you mention it, I don't remember.

87
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,141
Well you do know they say that people block
out memories that are too painful for them.

88
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,525
My athletic past is not just some dark moment in time.

89
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,444
Besides, if it were that easy to forget,
I wouldn't still bear the scars of trauma.

90
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,264
You know, I actually don't remember last year's either.

91
00:06:03,491 --> 00:06:05,493
That's because they're always so dull.

92
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,365
I want to do something different
with some flair this year.

93
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,585
That makes sense...

94
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,832
Now I understand why you need us.

95
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:13,513
How soon do you need our ideas?

96
00:06:13,638 --> 00:06:15,515
Now that you mention it, we're actually having

97
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:19,102
a committee meeting down the hall and
could use your help. Could you join us?

98
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,688
Are you talking about right now?

99
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,253
Ah! What team are you guys on?

100
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:26,790
Every class in the school has been taken and split in
half to make up the two teams, so I'd like to make sure.

101
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,742
I'm on the red team, what about you?

102
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:30,251
I'm red.

103
00:06:30,497 --> 00:06:31,174
Me too.

104
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,045
Same here.

105
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:33,951
We're all on the same team!

106
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:36,850
Okay we must get out there and
do our best to win this thing!

107
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,870
Yay!

108
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:50,182
Hey, looks like you managed to secure some new members.

109
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:53,088
I did. And it went exactly as you said it would.

110
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,556
So you're the one behind this little scheme then, huh?

111
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:58,742
I was getting so bored watching
the same athletic festival.

112
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,617
It just repeats every year.

113
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,814
I'm looking forward to something more fun.

114
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,715
You sound like you're playing around...

115
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,232
I find it interesting that you're in
charge of the athletic festival, too.

116
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,661
Ah, yes...

117
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:12,792
These kinds of jobs tend to fall
to the young teachers around here.

118
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:16,814
And mark my words kids, I am <i>the</i> young one. Very young.

119
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,504
<i>She said it twice to show how important that point is...</i>

120
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,181
Okay, Shiromeguri, let's start the meeting.

121
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:28,431
Great. On our agenda today is
featured events for the festival.

122
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,165
We need to come up with some strong ideas!

123
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,007
Raise your hand if you have a suggestion!

124
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:34,020
Over here!

125
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,846
Yes, Yuigahama!

126
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,893
What about doing a club relay race?

127
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,846
If you do that, people who aren't members of a
club don't get to participate. They'll complain.

128
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:49,078
Any others? Let's keep them coming!

129
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,957
Yes, Yukinoshita!

130
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:54,756
How about a nice, orthodox, bread-eating contest?

131
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:57,813
I'm afraid the students who prefer rice will complain.

132
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:02,711
I didn't know the bread versus rice debate was so serious.

133
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:06,905
Well let's just regroup and keep trying. Who's next?

134
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:07,350
Hah!

135
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:08,877
Yes, Yuigahama!

136
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,954
Let's do a scavenger hunt!

137
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,317
We need to be sensitive to all the students
who are suffering under their parent's debts...

138
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,605
All we're doing is being sensitive...

139
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,821
Everyone's so nitpicky these days.

140
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:23,310
There are so many regulations to uphold.

141
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,910
Anyway, let's keep thinking!

142
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:27,410
You guys over there need to be throwing out ideas, too!

143
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:38,712
<i>This has turned into a word association game.</i>

144
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,098
<i>Why don't they just use Magical something-or-other?</i>

145
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,643
Is that it on ideas?

146
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:55,980
They're far more lacking in
ideas than I originally thought.

147
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:59,795
No matter what we pick, our ideas
are scrapped for insensitivity...

148
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,670
It was a bit much to expect us to come up with ideas.

149
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:03,769
What do we do now?

150
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,035
We find the right person for the job?

151
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:09,354
Well that sure is a valuable perspective there, Hikigaya.

152
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:12,160
It's typical for organizations to pull this stuff.

153
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,184
Milk people until they're completely dry.

154
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:16,499
But yet, they'll never see a pay raise.

155
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,921
You said it! I totally hear that!

156
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:23,350
Ms. Hiratsuka, I don't think that
you're supposed to agree with that.

157
00:09:23,705 --> 00:09:26,451
It's pointless for unfit people
to try too hard at something.

158
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:29,030
It's better to call someone who's a pro in the field.

159
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:33,051
In other words, you're saying that the
club should go ahead and renounce this request?

160
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,171
Workshare, that's what I'm talking about.

161
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:38,184
Like a job rotation. You know, outsourcing. Get it?

162
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:40,630
I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds good.

163
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:45,956
I'm just impressed you came up with so many terms
that mean the same thing. I guess it's in how you say it.

164
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,951
But it's also important that we
have faith in this, right, guys?

165
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:50,458
Well, see there you go, then.

166
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:51,577
Yuigahama.

167
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:52,423
Yeah?

168
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:54,274
Ah?

169
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:58,593
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

170
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:02,045
You got it. I'll go give them a call now.

171
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,318
Uh, those are our resources?

172
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,017
So, why'd you call me here, Yui?

173
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:12,050
Aherm, aherm, ahem. Same question as my left.

174
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,149
Well, the thing is...

175
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,995
I see! The Universe!

176
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,425
You want us to come up with thrilling
events that will go down in history?

177
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,306
And they should be exciting, right?

178
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,479
It doesn't matter how they're exciting, though, does it?

179
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:27,418
Uh...

180
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,871
Okay, no problem! I'll think of something!

181
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,117
You can also count on Yoshiteru!

182
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:12,545
Thank you guys so much!

183
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,526
This is shaping up to be a lot of fun thanks to you guys!

184
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:18,860
Hang on, we have plenty more still left to do.

185
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:22,873
Huh? Don't forget, we're only halfway
through the request that you sent to us.

186
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,972
Oh yeah! While we're at it, we gotta win too!

187
00:11:27,503 --> 00:11:29,385
Yeah! Let's do this!

188
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,544
Go! Keep it up!

189
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:50,283
Ah?

190
00:11:56,471 --> 00:12:01,858
And now, as the athletic festival nears
its end, the white team has dominated so far.

191
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:05,677
Our own Hayama Hayato has been a major source of points,

192
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:08,208
giving our team the advantage throughout each event.

193
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,401
However...

194
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,987
Don't forget, this is still anyone's battle!

195
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:14,364
And now, what we've all been waiting for,

196
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:20,801
the main event that's the Chiba Girls'
Mock Cavalry Battle! Also known as Chibattle!

197
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:22,902
Hey, are you sure this is okay?

198
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,474
Listen up!

199
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:29,241
Long ago, a battle took place right here
in Chiba between the Satomi and Hojo clans.

200
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:32,445
This magnificent event was
created with that battle in mind.

201
00:12:32,616 --> 00:12:35,190
That's great but I think this area was underwater then...

202
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,430
Huh? What's with those outfits?

203
00:12:40,268 --> 00:12:42,431
Believe me, that's what I want to know as well.

204
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:44,186
This is really embarrassing.

205
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,165
Well, it's a battle, after all.

206
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,445
The captains should always be wearing armor!

207
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:49,548
Right, but we're not actually...

208
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:50,582
Hold still.

209
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:56,638
These are very special battle costumes that have
been produced by me and made all by hand by Sakisaki!

210
00:12:56,663 --> 00:12:58,264
Don't call me "Sakisaki"!

211
00:12:58,289 --> 00:13:00,225
<i>Wow, you guys sure get along well.</i>

212
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:02,258
Why are they Western style?

213
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,131
Good point. Shouldn't they be more samurai?

214
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,867
You know why. This is what we like.

215
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,228
All right! Let's go take the lead!

216
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:14,588
Yay!

217
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,791
We get 30 points if we win this event, right?

218
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:24,172
And if the boys beat their next
event, that means we might actually win.

219
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,344
Telling me that doesn't really help me here...

220
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,976
Don't worry, we'll keep our promise.

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,568
Yep!

222
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:33,789
I wouldn't exactly call a one-sided
declaration a promise. But whatever.

223
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:38,828
And the horses and riders for both teams have assembled.

224
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:42,880
The team that knocks down the
most riders from the other team wins!

225
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:55,160
All right, folks! The Chibattle
has begun and as you can see...

226
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,573
I'm so psyched!

227
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:00,310
Let's go!

228
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,909
Good game, everyone!

229
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,561
Yui!

230
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:09,863
Ah! She's after me!

231
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:12,302
Wait, look!

232
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:15,068
It appears there's a clash of
captains on the other side, too!

233
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:17,807
Miura versus Yukinoshita!

234
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,034
Oh, an air throw?

235
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:36,000
Is she actually Master Asia? Is she going to die at dawn?

236
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:48,527
Remarkable skill! The red team wins!

237
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:52,083
Huh?

238
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,767
Good job, girls.

239
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,078
Go take care of the rest.

240
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,218
It's all yours, Hikki!

241
00:14:58,468 --> 00:15:00,023
That's easy for you to say...

242
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:04,457
And for our next festival event,
we have the boys' Pole Topple.

243
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,919
For something Ebina came up with,
this one seems pretty normal so far.

244
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:13,622
All those sweaty boys fighting
and grappling over a big pole...

245
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,330
It's so obscene!

246
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:20,821
Huh?

247
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,482
Ah! Oh, Hachiman!

248
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,671
Hey, Totsuka. What's the deal with that outfit?

249
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:31,579
Uh, apparently, athletic club presidents
are supposed to be captains, so, uh...

250
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:34,005
So, do you think I really look weird?

251
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:35,181
Uh!

252
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,039
You look great! Uh, not weird at all!

253
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:40,816
<i>No, not weird at all!</i>

254
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,519
<i>This must be love!</i>

255
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:47,556
Oh, I think I just witnessed the moment
when someone fell in love for the first time.

256
00:15:48,146 --> 00:15:51,217
We will begin by introducing the captains of each team!

257
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:54,998
For the white team, the soccer
club president, Hayato Hayama!

258
00:15:55,114 --> 00:15:57,418
And for the red team, the tennis club president,

259
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:58,846
Saika Totsuka!

260
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:07,537
Zaimokuza, I think I've worked out a plan.

261
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,816
Oh, yeah? Well let us hear it then.

262
00:16:10,331 --> 00:16:11,744
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

263
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,375
Yes! I've got it!

264
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,494
Just leave it to me, Boss!

265
00:16:15,946 --> 00:16:17,339
Listen up, men!

266
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,417
Your supreme commander is here!

267
00:16:20,737 --> 00:16:24,180
Uh, hi, I'm the team captain, Saika Totsuka.

268
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:26,813
Now, let's get out there and do our best!

269
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:31,284
We only have one enemy! And
that's Hayato Hayama! Okay, guys?!

270
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:34,877
Do you want that good-looking creep to
run away with our well-deserved victory?!

271
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:37,861
Well, I don't! I seriously don't want that!

272
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:40,520
I don't want to feel pathetic anymore!

273
00:16:40,871 --> 00:16:46,969
I don't want to smile convulsively every time he
glances my way and speaks to me, as he's floating by!

274
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:49,857
I don't want to shut up and
give him the right of way anymore!

275
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:51,675
And how about you guys?!

276
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:53,441
Sure...

277
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,400
In that case, we must win!

278
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:58,026
Now is the time to awaken!

279
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,006
Let's stand up, citizens!

280
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:05,113
So tell me, was that performance to your liking?

281
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,133
Sure, that works for me.

282
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,216
It was so creepy, nobody could miss it.

283
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,196
C-creepy?

284
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:11,893
The plan is ready to go.

285
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,384
And now, all that's left...

286
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:36,258
And so, the game has finally begun! A boys'
game of boys' Pole Topple, by boys for boys!

287
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:39,731
We've got both seme and uke mixed deliciously together!

288
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:43,090
The white team has come out
strong launching a preemptive attack!

289
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:48,460
I'm really sorry about that...

290
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:51,275
It's my pleasure. Let me take him down for you, Captain!

291
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:51,908
Ah...

292
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,060
Thanks for that!

293
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:00,094
Guys? Are you okay?

294
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:02,158
There's so much cuteness...

295
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:05,455
All the guys on the red team are complete idiots.

296
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,732
Hmm...

297
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:19,662
I have not one shred of regret in my life!

298
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:21,242
How sad!

299
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:25,905
What the hell do you think he's doing down there?

300
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:28,899
As usual, he's being a total pain in the ass.

301
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:31,190
Although, with him drawing everyone's attention,

302
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,067
now I get to finally do my job.

303
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:36,108
I can't feel my hand!

304
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:38,097
Not yet...

305
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,190
It's not time yet!

306
00:18:46,054 --> 00:18:47,547
<i>And this is my skill.</i>

307
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:50,657
<i>Carefully cultivated through my many years spent alone...</i>

308
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,292
<i>Stealth Hikki.</i>

309
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:00,185
Hey. I thought you'd be coming.

310
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:01,520
Hayama...

311
00:19:09,922 --> 00:19:12,297
Nice wrap. You get a head injury earlier?

312
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,720
I've always got a bit of a headache, you know.

313
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:22,477
So, Zaimokuza, was it?

314
00:19:23,177 --> 00:19:26,014
Using him as a decoy to get this far was a good plan...

315
00:19:26,596 --> 00:19:27,358
But really...

316
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:30,281
there's no way I wouldn't have had a mark on you.

317
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,283
Don't think too highly of me, there.

318
00:19:32,489 --> 00:19:33,896
Don't hold it against me.

319
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:37,286
But I'm going to fight your
grandstand play with team play.

320
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:40,464
You know that's what they call tyranny of the majority.

321
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,668
That just sounds evil. It's just numbers-based.

322
00:19:44,797 --> 00:19:45,282
Hmph.

323
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:46,826
Give up?

324
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,245
No way...

325
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,784
Zaimokuza!

326
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,834
Gotcha!

327
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:59,107
If you're gonna fight with numbers,
then we're gonna fight you with weight!

328
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,504
Decoy for a decoy?!

329
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:01,950
We're in trouble! Get 'em, guys!

330
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:03,561
You won't be able to get past us!

331
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:05,303
Just come and try it if you can!

332
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:06,599
We're gonna get you!

333
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:09,694
Zaimokuza...

334
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,841
Crusher!

335
00:20:40,654 --> 00:20:41,757
Hachiman!

336
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:43,621
You're amazing, Hachiman!

337
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:49,316
We did it! We won! We won!

338
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:58,659
I can't believe we lost.

339
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:02,360
Yeah, I never expected to lose on a foul.

340
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:06,683
If only someone hadn't done such a lousy
alteration on his headband, we'd have won.

341
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,147
I'm sorry, okay?

342
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,520
I didn't think anyone was watching me.

343
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,042
No, people do watch you!

344
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:17,731
She's right. Even I wondered what you were gonna
do when you took that bandage out of your pocket.

345
00:21:17,837 --> 00:21:19,715
Wait, you were watching him, too?

346
00:21:20,026 --> 00:21:22,256
Ah? I just happened to see it...

347
00:21:22,645 --> 00:21:24,306
Can you guys please stop watching me?

348
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:27,666
Wait, calm down. Meguri was
really happy with the outcome!

349
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,772
Still, it's actually quite frustrating
to lose an athletics festival.

350
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:33,100
I didn't know that before.

351
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,699
Yeah! We'll win next year!

352
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,102
You're right. We'll win it next year.

353
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:41,729
You don't know if we'll be on the same team next year.

354
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,892
You always say stuff like that...

355
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:47,704
That's true. Hikigaya seems
like he'd enjoy being the enemy.

356
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,279
You've become more motivated?!

357
00:21:50,821 --> 00:21:51,928
I'm excited already!

358
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:57,059
<i>The festival after the festival is over...
And everything after that is a festival.</i>

359
00:21:57,557 --> 00:21:59,112
<i>Some things can't be redone,</i>

360
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:02,633
<i>but whether we laugh or cry, our days carry on,</i>

361
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,502
<i>and our high school lives will end.</i>

362
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:09,289
<i>Thus, their festival will never end.</i>
