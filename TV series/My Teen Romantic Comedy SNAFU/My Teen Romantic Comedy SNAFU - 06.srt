1
00:00:17,673 --> 00:00:19,119
<i>It's already been a week...</i>

2
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:23,304
It was a total fluke that I saved your dog, you know.

3
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:27,320
Even if I hadn't gotten into that
accident, I probably still would've been alone.

4
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:30,321
If that's why you're being nice... then just stop it.

5
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,908
<i>Why did it turn out like this?</i>

6
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:36,804
<i>Jerk.</i>

7
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:40,530
Wait! Sable!

8
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,785
It's so hot...

9
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:23,565
Hm?

10
00:02:26,076 --> 00:02:26,677
Hey.

11
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,468
Uh... hey.

12
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,821
<i>Okay. Super cool.</i>

13
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:39,729
<i>I've managed a complete reset.</i>

14
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:45,235
<i>By resetting our relationship
like this, I regain my inner peace,</i>

15
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,072
<i>and Yuigahama is free from her sense of obligation,</i>

16
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:50,526
<i>so she can return to her fulfilling daily life.</i>

17
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:53,181
<i>This definitely wasn't the wrong choice.</i>

18
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:55,795
<i>No, I know it's the right one.</i>

19
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:58,457
<i>So this whole matter is said and done with.</i>

20
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,919
<i>We just have to reset and go back to our respective lives.</i>

21
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:06,322
<i>You can't reset life, but you
can reset human relationships.</i>

22
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,796
<i>Source: My own experience.</i>

23
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,491
<i>I haven't contacted any of my
classmates from middle school-</i>

24
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:14,120
<i>Wait, that wasn't a reset. That was a delete.</i>

25
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,753
So, something happen with you and Yuigahama?

26
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:20,968
Nope, nothing.

27
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:25,062
I don't think Yuigahama would stop coming
here if nothing happened between you two.

28
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:26,737
Did you have a fight?

29
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,832
No, we didn't... I don't think so.

30
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:33,322
Anyway, we couldn't have...

31
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,052
fighting is something you do
with people you're friends with.

32
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,225
So it wasn't so much a fight as...

33
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:39,331
A dispute?

34
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:42,184
Nope, but that doesn't sound too far off.

35
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,419
Then, maybe a war?

36
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,020
That's completely wrong... and further off.

37
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:47,244
An annihilation.

38
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:49,799
Were you even listening? You're further.

39
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:52,641
Different opinions... Is that about right?

40
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,687
Something like that.

41
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,812
Well... Nothing we can do then.

42
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,520
What, Yuigahama's not here again?

43
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:03,240
Do you not know how to knock?

44
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,021
And here I was holding in some hope for that girl...

45
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:11,491
Um, Teacher, did you want something from us?

46
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:14,299
That's right, Hikigaya! I certainly do.

47
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,982
I think we should make that showdown a battle royale.

48
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,782
A battle royale? Just the two of us?

49
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,292
You can go ahead and recruit new members if you need to.

50
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,419
Doesn't look like Yuigahama's returning.

51
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,939
It's not as if Yuigahama has just quit...

52
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:29,749
Not coming to the club is quitting.

53
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,536
No need to waste time on any unmotivated members.

54
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,762
Anyone who doesn't attend can leave.

55
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:38,867
U-um... Can I leave?

56
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:41,127
I have neither motivation nor discipline.

57
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,392
Huh?

58
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,637
I-I didn't think so.

59
00:04:46,122 --> 00:04:48,577
Anyway, thanks to Yuigahama,

60
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,988
I now know that a club is more
active when it has more members.

61
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:54,990
Here's an opportunity.

62
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:01,218
You're to go out there and actively recruit at least one
new member with both motivation and discipline by Monday.

63
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:01,805
Got it?

64
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:03,320
You can...

65
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:05,095
start now.

66
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:09,356
Yeah, this is tyranny.

67
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:10,887
Perish the thought.

68
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:13,266
I'm only trying to help in my own special way.

69
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:16,183
Ms. Hiratsuka, I just want to confirm...

70
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,442
You want us to increase our membership, right?

71
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:20,144
That's right, Yukinoshita.

72
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:21,881
I wish you luck.

73
00:05:25,476 --> 00:05:28,076
How does she think we're
supposed to increase our membership?

74
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,218
I have an idea of someone who might just be interested.

75
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:32,715
Who? Totsuka?

76
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,973
Totsuka? Totsuka, right?

77
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:36,422
Yuigahama.

78
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,801
Huh? But isn't she quitting?

79
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,244
If she quits, then she just has to join again.

80
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:46,520
Ms. Hiratsuka said we only need to
increase our membership, not who we bring in.

81
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:48,471
Will she come back that easily?

82
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,161
When someone leaves, they usually just don't come back.

83
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:54,816
The date June 18th... ring any bells?

84
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:56,343
No...

85
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,381
It's Yuigahama's birthday. I think.

86
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:01,908
Her email address has 0618 in it.

87
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,193
But you've never actually asked her about it?

88
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,561
Gotta love those communication skills...

89
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:08,247
Hmph.

90
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,960
The point is, I want to do something for her birthday.

91
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,516
Even if Yuigahama doesn't decide
to come back to the Service Club,

92
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,646
I want to show her my gratitude for helping us out.

93
00:06:20,117 --> 00:06:20,853
I see.

94
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,883
Hey, Hikigaya...

95
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:23,943
Yeah?

96
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:27,706
Th-that is... well, um...

97
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:28,732
Uh...

98
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:31,609
W-would you please go out with me?

99
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:36,059
What?

100
00:06:39,787 --> 00:06:42,835
I'm sorry to make you come and hang
out with me on one of our days off.

101
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:47,600
No problem! I want to be able to buy
a birthday present for Yui, as well.

102
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,930
And it's gonna be fun to go out with you!

103
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,277
Okay, let's be efficient about this.

104
00:06:52,615 --> 00:06:53,642
I'll go that way.

105
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:55,980
Then I guess I'll head over that way and have a look.

106
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,172
Okay, Komachi, then you go over there...

107
00:06:58,426 --> 00:06:59,086
Stop!

108
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:02,262
My god. What the hell are you doing? That hurts!

109
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:04,882
Since we're all here, why don't we go together?

110
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:06,847
Then we can give each other advice!

111
00:07:06,872 --> 00:07:07,816
Sound like a plan?

112
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:10,771
But then we won't have a chance to make it to every store.

113
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:12,038
Not to worry.

114
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:16,131
My sound shopping judgment tells
me that based on Yui's tastes... Ah?

115
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:20,124
As long as we hit everything in this
area, we shouldn't have any problems!

116
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:30,243
Komachi, you meant around this area, right?

117
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,822
Hm? What? Did you see where she went?

118
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:36,134
<i>Hello?</i>

119
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,641
Hey, where are you?

120
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,487
<i>Huh? Oh...</i>

121
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:42,866
<i>I totally forgot that there
was some stuff I wanted to buy.</i>

122
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,494
You're the one who said we should all go together!

123
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:49,007
I didn't realize your brain was
already starting to go downhill.

124
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,037
As your brother, I'm a little shocked.

125
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,047
<i>Jeez, you really can't take a hint, huh?</i>

126
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:55,553
What do you mean, "can't take a hint"?

127
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:56,908
<i>Nevermind.</i>

128
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,319
<i>I'll probably take like five hours to finish!</i>

129
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:01,505
<i>I'll go home by myself if I have to.</i>

130
00:08:01,593 --> 00:08:02,749
<i>Good luck, you two!</i>

131
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:04,793
H-hey! What the...

132
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:07,903
How does good luck help with
buying any of this stuff? Idiot.

133
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,688
Yukinoshita?

134
00:08:11,713 --> 00:08:12,188
Eh?

135
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,934
What did Komachi have to say?

136
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:17,711
Oh... Uh...

137
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:19,666
She said there's something she wanted to buy.

138
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,017
And that she's leaving everything to us.

139
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,425
Well, we did bring her here on one of her days off.

140
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,511
We've got no right to complain about this.

141
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,999
Let's just figure something out on our own.

142
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,211
Thank you very much.

143
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,406
Let's go.

144
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:45,483
Hey, you think I look that suspicious?

145
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:48,177
I don't think it's you, per se.

146
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:50,893
It just looks like men are
viewed with suspicion in this area.

147
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:53,741
Doesn't look like there's anything I can do here, anyway.

148
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:55,902
I'll be over here.

149
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:56,382
Wait.

150
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:57,566
Hm?

151
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:00,054
Are you leaving this all to me, then?

152
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,059
Not to brag or anything here,

153
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:05,760
but my standards are quite a bit different
from those of regular high school girls.

154
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:07,832
So you do realize it...

155
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,418
So, um, well...

156
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,373
I would appreciate your help with finding something.

157
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,644
<i>I've given a gift to a girl
before, and been rejected, of course,</i>

158
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,042
<i>but I've never actually bought anything for one.</i>

159
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,441
Yeah, but I can't go into these stores...

160
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,049
I guess we've no other choice.

161
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,264
Try not to put too much distance between us.

162
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,555
What the hell does that mean?

163
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:30,206
Do I have to spell it out for you?

164
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:35,375
If all you can do with the air is breathe it, then any
air conditioner out there is way more advanced than you.

165
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,004
Ah...

166
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:37,084
<i>She has a point.</i>

167
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:40,082
<i>It'd be damn convenient if those
things could read the air, too.</i>

168
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,933
I'm saying that... just for today...

169
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:47,140
I hereby give you express permission
to treat me as you would your girlfriend.

170
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,964
Nice way to try and talk down to me.

171
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,168
You've got a problem with it?

172
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:53,792
Nope, none in particular.

173
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,442
What? Um... what?

174
00:09:56,993 --> 00:09:58,919
<i>It's nothing to be that surprised about.</i>

175
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:03,830
<i>I have absolutely no interest in being
her boyfriend, but Yukinoshita doesn't lie.</i>

176
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:08,011
<i>We'd definitely be pretending, no doubt
about that, so nobody would get the wrong idea.</i>

177
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,416
I was certain you would dislike the idea immensely.

178
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:12,795
Nah, I don't really have any reason to not like it.

179
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,332
But... I thought you'd probably hate it.

180
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,042
No, I don't really mind at all.

181
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,189
As long as there's nobody around who knows who we are,

182
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,979
then there's no need to worry
about anyone getting the wrong idea.

183
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:33,387
I can't leave things like this with him...

184
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:36,386
I guess I really should go talk to him about this.

185
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,461
I didn't even have the chance to give him the cookies...

186
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:40,158
Huh?

187
00:10:42,395 --> 00:10:43,099
Ahh!

188
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,097
You're not shopping for office supplies.

189
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:49,720
If you pick out clothes based on their
durability, you'll never settle on anything.

190
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:54,265
Come on now... I doubt seriously she looks
for defensive properties in her clothing.

191
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:55,618
I can't help it.

192
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:59,304
The material and stitching are
the only things I know how to judge.

193
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:02,563
I never bothered to find out what Yuigahama likes...

194
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,209
or even what her hobbies are.

195
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,150
What kind of friend am I?

196
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:08,124
Don't see why you'd need to know.

197
00:11:09,212 --> 00:11:12,547
If you pretended to know me based
on offhand info, I'd be pissed.

198
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,894
Like giving a Chiba resident
peanuts from some other prefecture.

199
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:18,609
That comparison was too Chiba-based to make sense.

200
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:22,224
It's like giving wine to a sommelier
when you know nothing about wine.

201
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:24,478
I see...

202
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:26,875
If it's like that...

203
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:29,904
Well then?

204
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,150
I don't know how to answer that...

205
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:34,009
except to say it looks good on you.

206
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:36,318
You think so? Thank you.

207
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:39,976
But I didn't mean me. I was asking
you how it would work for Yuigahama.

208
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,718
I don't know about that.

209
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:47,263
It seems to me that Yuigahama would prefer stuff
that's more frilly and somewhat stupid-looking?

210
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:49,373
That's a harsh way to put it.

211
00:11:49,505 --> 00:11:51,744
It's so accurate, I don't know how to respond.

212
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,119
I'll take this.

213
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,936
Yeah, sounds good to me.

214
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:57,527
Well, anything does. You're getting that, too?

215
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:01,888
Huh? Yukino?

216
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,042
Ah! I can't believe it's really is you!

217
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:08,788
It's Nee...

218
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,647
Huh? Who's Nee? What?!

219
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,581
I'm Yukino's older sister, Haruno.

220
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:22,734
What's your name?

221
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,101
Oh... Hikigaya.

222
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:27,107
That so? Well...

223
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,723
So you're Hikigaya, huh?

224
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,520
Well, nice to meet you!

225
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:37,130
How long have you two been going out?

226
00:12:37,764 --> 00:12:39,390
Come on, why don't you just tell me?

227
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:40,865
We're in the same grade is all.

228
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:41,845
Aww...

229
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,620
I'm telling you I'm not her boyfriend.

230
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:46,257
Look... you're getting all serious there!

231
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,233
If you make Yukino cry, I'll never forgive you, got it?

232
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,574
<i>Th-that hurts!</i>

233
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:52,903
<i>She's too close! Too close! Too close!</i>

234
00:12:53,003 --> 00:12:54,514
<i>And... she smells good...</i>

235
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:57,103
All right... that's quite enough, Nee.

236
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,851
No... Sorry...

237
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,765
I guess I got a little carried away for a minute there.

238
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,166
Yukino can be a very delicate girl at times,

239
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,055
so be nice to my little sis, okay?

240
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:13,007
Ah? Sorry, did I do something to make you uncomfortable?

241
00:13:13,411 --> 00:13:16,668
Oh, you know, um... my ears are sensitive...

242
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:21,124
Hikigaya, don't reveal your fetishes
to strange older girls you've just met.

243
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:23,196
Or you can't complain if they try to sue you.

244
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,701
Hikigaya, you're so hilarious!

245
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:32,525
Are you finished yet? If you have no
business with me, we'll be leaving now.

246
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,392
Hikigaya, if you actually start dating, let's grab tea!

247
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,365
Your big sister really is something.

248
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,608
Everyone who meets her says the same thing.

249
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:47,709
I suppose it's rare finding someone as perfect as she.

250
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,765
Everyone likes to sing her praises.

251
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:50,804
Huh?

252
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,803
That doesn't sound like it's so different from you.

253
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:55,146
Is that a roundabout brag?

254
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:56,080
Hm?

255
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:58,019
When I said she's something, I meant...

256
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:02,223
Well, it's almost like she's
wearing a powered exoskeleton.

257
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,353
She has the whole package, really.

258
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,399
She's friendly, always smiling, and conversational.

259
00:14:08,423 --> 00:14:10,116
Truly any guy's ideal woman.

260
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,859
But ideals are ideals.

261
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:15,933
They're not real. So it seems kind of fake.

262
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:21,175
Coming from you... it's... not surprising
you can actually see through that.

263
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,995
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

264
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:25,690
If you would like. It's a rave review.

265
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:28,309
What?

266
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:33,666
A dog...

267
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:36,584
Hm?

268
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,610
H-Hikigaya...

269
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:41,618
Ah!

270
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:42,775
Whoa...

271
00:14:43,859 --> 00:14:46,075
Hey, where's your owner, pup?

272
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:50,227
Are you running loose?

273
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:54,459
What's with this dog?

274
00:14:54,778 --> 00:14:56,065
You're a little too friendly...

275
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,614
Is this...

276
00:14:59,656 --> 00:15:00,907
I'm sorry!

277
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:03,085
Was Sable bothering you two?

278
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,224
Oh, Yuigahama...

279
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:08,719
Huh? What?! Hikki and Yukinon?

280
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,114
But... wh-why are you two together?

281
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:13,375
What now? Uh... No reason...

282
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,254
Uh, nevermind!

283
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,105
No worries. It's nothing!

284
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:19,323
You're out together on our day off.

285
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,135
It's obvious what this is...

286
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,289
I see... Why didn't I notice before?

287
00:15:25,314 --> 00:15:28,271
I mean... Reading the room is the one thing I'm good at...

288
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,216
<i>She's definitely getting the wrong idea about us...</i>

289
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,484
Well, I guess I'll be getting on my way now.

290
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:37,666
Yuigahama.

291
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,321
I want to talk to you about the two of us.

292
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,789
Would you maybe be free to come to the club room Monday?

293
00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:43,522
Ah...

294
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,696
I'm not sure I really wanna hear the story...

295
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:50,878
I don't think it would do much
good for me to hear it now...

296
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,334
I mean, there's really nothing I can do about it.

297
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:57,980
You know, being the way that I am, I
couldn't say it the way one is supposed to...

298
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,708
But I want to be able to tell
you properly, if you'll allow me.

299
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:02,672
Okay?

300
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,362
What exactly are you doing? Ah!

301
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:23,544
Ahh! H-Hikki!

302
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:28,023
Well, uh, you know... the air just felt so good out here!

303
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,478
Come on, let's go.

304
00:16:35,282 --> 00:16:35,751
Hm?

305
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:37,373
Yuigahama...

306
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:40,688
Oh, y-yahello, Yukinon.

307
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:51,059
Ah! Um, so... Yeah...

308
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:54,186
Y-you you wanted to talk to me about you and Hikki, right?

309
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:56,120
Yes.

310
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:59,017
I wanted to talk to you about our future...

311
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:03,040
Oh! No! Please! You didn't have to
worry about my feelings in all of this!

312
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:07,867
I mean, yeah, I was surprised and all, but it's more
like I want to celebrate and congratulate, you know!

313
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:09,688
Y-you already figured it out...

314
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:12,578
I want to congratulate you properly.

315
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:14,822
Also, I'm grateful to you for helping with...

316
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:16,272
Oh, stop it!

317
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,919
I didn't do anything that you should be grateful for.

318
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,605
I haven't done anything...

319
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,561
But still, I'm forever grateful to you.

320
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:28,955
Congratulations doesn't always have
to be about something you did, right?

321
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,412
That's all I want to do.

322
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,393
Fine... Sure.

323
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,303
<i>I get the feeling they're not quite on the same page...</i>

324
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:39,321
So with that... I...

325
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:41,490
I don't think I want to hear any more.

326
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:44,633
Yuigahama, I think you're getting the wrong idea here.

327
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:46,668
W-wait a minute!

328
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:49,983
So you guys aren't actually
sneaking around and dating each other?

329
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,704
Of course we're not dating!

330
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:55,712
Yuigahama, even I manage to get angry sometimes.

331
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:59,970
Besides, there's no way he's even capable
of having a proper relationship with a girl.

332
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,548
He can't even handle relationships with regular people.

333
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,767
Stop. I don't need to waste
my time on those relationships.

334
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:09,148
If a girl called me crying in the middle
of the night, I'd dump her then and there.

335
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:14,284
Sorry... Huh?

336
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:18,465
Our time to congratulate you has run out.

337
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:20,785
And I even made you a cake and everything...

338
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,960
A cake? Why a cake?

339
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,177
"Why a cake?"

340
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,678
I called you here today because I
wanted to celebrate your birthday with you.

341
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:28,864
Huh? What?

342
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:33,781
You haven't been coming to the club
recently, so it was also a sort of a bonus.

343
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,891
And, well... I guess you'd say a token of thanks.

344
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:40,479
Is that a present?

345
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:43,694
Yukinon!

346
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:47,448
Yeah, well, it's not like I'm the only
one who brought you something today...

347
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:47,941
Hm?

348
00:18:50,953 --> 00:18:53,228
I never thought you'd have one for me, too, Hikki.

349
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,502
That's a surprise.

350
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,360
It's been a little weird, huh? Since the other day...

351
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:02,159
Sorry. It's not because it's your birthday.

352
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:02,934
Huh?

353
00:19:03,565 --> 00:19:06,836
I mean, can we all just forget this just happened now?

354
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,897
The fact that I happened to save your dog,

355
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,412
and the fact that you were nice to me because of that.

356
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:12,580
All of it.

357
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:17,010
It's not like I helped you specifically
just so as to get gratitude out of you,

358
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:20,973
so there's no need for you to
feel indebted to me specifically.

359
00:19:22,889 --> 00:19:23,645
But, well, you know...

360
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:26,205
I want to return the kindness you gave me.

361
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,187
This makes us even.

362
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:30,771
You don't have to concern yourself with me.

363
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:32,895
In other this is over now, right?

364
00:19:37,026 --> 00:19:40,979
Why do you think of it that
way... as just pity or being nice?

365
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,891
I never once thought of you in that way, ever.

366
00:19:44,703 --> 00:19:46,530
I guess I just... well...

367
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:51,822
I'm... just not sure, it's too complicated.

368
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,195
I thought it would be much simpler than all this...

369
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,740
There's nothing complicated about it.

370
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,086
Hikigaya has no recollection of helping you,

371
00:20:02,053 --> 00:20:04,043
and you have no recollection of showing him pity.

372
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,981
You were mistaken from the start.

373
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,167
So I think Hikigaya's idea of ending
all of this turmoil is the right idea.

374
00:20:14,078 --> 00:20:16,488
But I don't want it to be over...

375
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:18,568
not now... not ever...

376
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:20,121
Silly.

377
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:23,198
If it's over, all you have to do is start again.

378
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,045
Neither of you has done anything wrong.

379
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:25,686
What?

380
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:30,936
Even if one of you is the
savior and the other is the saved,

381
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:32,833
you're both victims equally.

382
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,310
Only the one who's done wrong
should be viewed as the aggressor here.

383
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,475
If neither of you were wrong,

384
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,610
there was no need to fight in the first place.

385
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:45,714
So... The two of you can make
a proper start now, as of today.

386
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,915
Now, I need to go inform Ms. Hiratsuka
that we've recruited a member to our club.

387
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,990
So, can I open that?

388
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,477
Knock yourself out.

389
00:21:13,976 --> 00:21:15,537
Hey, how does it look?

390
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:20,783
Uh, wait. That's for your dog...

391
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,148
Huh? You should have said so, you dumb jerk wad!

392
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:30,369
Oh, forget this! I'm going to go see Ms. Hiratsuka!

393
00:21:31,653 --> 00:21:33,445
Thank you... idiot.

394
00:23:41,735 --> 00:23:46,573
Hikigaya, I need to speak to you immediately
concerning the Service Club's summer activities.

395
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:48,057
Please call me back.

396
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:51,406
Come on, are you still sleeping?

397
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:54,207
I've tried to call and email you several times.

398
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,484
You've actually seen them, haven't you?

399
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,114
You have, haven't you?

400
00:24:01,824 --> 00:24:04,191
You're scary. You're scaring the crap outta me.

401
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:09,503
Next time: "Anyway, Getting No Rest
Over Summer Break. Just Isn't Right."
