1
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:07,505
<i>Youth is a lie. It is nothing but evil.</i>

2
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:09,845
Check this one out!

3
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:12,286
Heh.

4
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,169
<i>Those who look to rejoice in their youth</i>

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,926
<i>deceive themselves and those around them,</i>

6
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:22,682
<i>accepting in full the circumstances that devour them.</i>

7
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,452
Here.

8
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,825
<i>In the face of the great and reverend word "youth,"</i>

9
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:33,702
<i>they will twist any common interpretation
or accepted notion out of recognition.</i>

10
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:38,852
<i>In their minds, lies, secrets, sins, and even failure</i>

11
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,766
<i>are nothing more than the "spice of youth."</i>

12
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:46,025
<i>If failure is truly the designated mark of one's youth...</i>

13
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:47,811
Hey, is that you?

14
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:53,448
<i>then would it not be considered abnormal for one
not in his youth to still fail at befriending anyone?</i>

15
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:54,593
Come on, let's go!

16
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:57,961
<i>But I'm sure none of them would admit to that being true.</i>

17
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,708
<i>They only define "youth" to their own benefit.</i>

18
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:04,004
<i>In conclusion, I leave you with this:</i>

19
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:06,543
<i>All you fools who delight in youth...</i>

20
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:08,438
<i>drop dead.</i>

21
00:02:39,496 --> 00:02:41,549
You're the one who needs to drop dead.

22
00:02:42,382 --> 00:02:43,576
Look, Hikigaya,

23
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:46,808
can you tell me what the
assignment was I gave you in class?

24
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:51,627
Well, you wanted us to write an essay
about looking back on our high school days.

25
00:02:51,727 --> 00:02:55,310
And how exactly did that lead you
to turn in this smart-ass essay to me?

26
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,474
What is this? How did that theme result in this?

27
00:02:58,514 --> 00:02:58,896
Well...

28
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:00,362
Seriously...

29
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:03,053
Look at you...

30
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,205
You have eyes like a dead fish.

31
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,977
Do I look that rich in omega-3s?
It makes me sound pretty smart.

32
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,801
I'm being serious.

33
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:14,646
Uh, but I am looking back on my
high school days, just like you said!

34
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,515
Isn't that how we kids think? I mean, at least nowadays.

35
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,913
You brat... Just cut the crap, okay?

36
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:21,221
You just call me brat?

37
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:24,244
Well, I guess I could understand how
someone your age would think that I'm a-

38
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:30,238
Didn't anyone ever teach you
that you never talk about a woman's age?

39
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,186
I'm sorry about that. I'll rewrite-Huh?

40
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:38,122
I think you had better come with me.

41
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:46,806
Huh?

42
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,959
Oh...

43
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,400
Hello, Ms. Hiratsuka.

44
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,215
I believe I asked for you to knock before entering.

45
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:04,521
Even when I do bother to knock, you never deign to answer.

46
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,649
That's because you always come in
before I have a chance to respond.

47
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,733
And this?

48
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,333
Who's the space case?

49
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:11,925
Guh!

50
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:15,046
<i>Oh crap, I know who this girl is.</i>

51
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:18,092
<i>International liberal arts, class J.</i>

52
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:21,580
<i>The class is 90% girls, since
they score higher than average,</i>

53
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,297
<i>and most know it to be a "very colorful" class.</i>

54
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:26,472
<i>And the one with the most color of the lot...</i>

55
00:04:26,644 --> 00:04:28,365
<i>is Yukino Yukinoshita.</i>

56
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,788
<i>Everyone at this school knows her.</i>

57
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:33,882
He wants to join your club.

58
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:37,173
Uh, Hachiman Hikigaya. Class 2-F.

59
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:38,320
So, um...

60
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:40,153
What do you mean, I want to join?

61
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:41,139
Suck it up.

62
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:44,562
I'm making you join this club as
punishment for your smart-ass essay.

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,277
You will give me no arguments,
protests, questions, or backtalk.

64
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:53,206
So then, I'm sure you can see by now, his
personality is as rotten as the look in his eyes.

65
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:56,645
This makes him a pathetic soul who is perpetually lonely.

66
00:04:56,758 --> 00:04:59,788
I want this club to fix his contrary, solitary nature.

67
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:01,132
That's my request.

68
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,674
I must decline.

69
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:07,797
Just looking at the ulterior motives behind
that lewd gaze of his makes me fear for my life.

70
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:10,430
<i>I am not looking at those modest breasts of hers.</i>

71
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:12,412
<i>Seriously, I'm not.</i>

72
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,209
Don't worry. He's a decent guy
with a good grasp on risk and return

73
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,137
and he has a need for self-preservation.

74
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:22,061
He wouldn't dare do anything
worthy of criminal punishment.

75
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:24,928
Trust me, this thug attitude is an act.

76
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:28,370
I'd rather you just say that I can
make rational decisions for myself...

77
00:05:28,523 --> 00:05:30,507
Thug attitude? But of course.

78
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:32,887
<i>She's not even listening, and she's convinced!</i>

79
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,668
Well, if it's your request, then I
can't very well refuse, now can I?

80
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:38,967
I'll allow him to join.

81
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:41,360
Perfect.

82
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:43,530
Good luck, Yukinoshita!

83
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,091
Uh, what?

84
00:05:58,076 --> 00:06:00,391
<i>Come on, are you serious? What just happened?!</i>

85
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:03,445
<i>A bittersweet memory suddenly came back to me.</i>

86
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:11,066
Can we just stay friends for now?

87
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:16,602
<i>Forget being friends. After that, we never spoke again.</i>

88
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:23,305
<i>I mean, seriously, romantic comedies
don't actually happen in my life.</i>

89
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:28,204
<i>Someone as rigorously trained as me would
never get caught in a rom-com trap like this.</i>

90
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,703
<i>Girls only take interest in attractive guys</i>

91
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,831
<i>and indulge in impure relationships.</i>

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,328
<i>In other words, they're my enemies.</i>

93
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,619
Do you mind if we just stay friends for now?

94
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:41,331
<i>Being hated is the fastest way for
me to avoid feeling like that again.</i>

95
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:45,692
<i>So, in lieu of pleasantries, I
decided to intimidate Yukinoshita.</i>

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,635
Uh...

97
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:53,384
Quit standing there and just sit down.

98
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,732
Huh? Uh, right! Sorry.

99
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:04,679
Problem?

100
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,864
Uh, it's just...

101
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,821
I'm pretty confused about all this.

102
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,884
What kind of club is this supposed to be?

103
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,872
Try and give it a guess.

104
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:15,960
Literary club?

105
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,044
Oh? Why you say that?

106
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,475
Well that's easy, this room has no
particular backdrop and no special equipment.

107
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,886
Plus, you've been reading a book this whole time.

108
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,455
You're wrong.

109
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:27,691
Then what type of club is it?

110
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:31,576
So, what I'm doing here right
now is this club's exact activity.

111
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,331
Then I give up. I have no clue.

112
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:38,589
Hikigaya, how long has it been
since you spoke with a girl?

113
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:39,175
Guh!

114
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,197
I believe it was two years ago, in June.

115
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:44,663
God, it's so hot today, right?

116
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:46,589
More like humid, I would say.

117
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,329
Huh?

118
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,389
Well, yeah...

119
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:56,037
A compassionate few donate their
time... to those who are less fortunate.

120
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:58,555
Society calls it "volunteer work."

121
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,974
We extend a helping hand to those in need.

122
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:03,115
That is what this club does.

123
00:08:04,055 --> 00:08:06,903
This is the Service Club. I welcome you.

124
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,353
And as I have been asked, I will fulfill my duty.

125
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,862
I will come to fix that little problem of yours.

126
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:14,412
Show some gratitude.

127
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,978
Are you serious?

128
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:17,525
My problem?

129
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,847
So you know, I'm damn efficient in my own special way.

130
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,862
I was third on the Japanese ability test.
And I'm pretty good-looking.

131
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:28,688
Ignoring that I have no friends or
girlfriend, I'm in a pretty high league!

132
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:31,734
In a way, it's impressive you
can say all that so confidently.

133
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,900
You're weird. I'm already creeped out.

134
00:08:34,197 --> 00:08:36,251
Shut up! You're the weirdo!

135
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:40,740
Based on my observations so far,

136
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:42,889
it seems the loneliness that plagues you

137
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:47,627
is simply a direct result of your
stupid pride and contrary sensitivity.

138
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:50,931
As for your appearance, beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.

139
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,747
In other words, as of right
now, only what I say is correct.

140
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,692
Your opinion's ridiculous,

141
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,068
but it feels like you're making some sense.

142
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:03,671
Now, that completes this conversation simulation test.

143
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:04,143
What?!

144
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:07,157
If you can actually converse
with a beautiful girl like me,

145
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:09,970
then I believe you will be able
to talk with most anyone else.

146
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,997
So, do you think I have I fixed you a bit?

147
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:15,535
Just so you know, it's not like I
can't talk to people or anything.

148
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:19,409
I just don't make pointless small talk.
So, you see, I don't need to be "fixed."

149
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:23,483
Well I believe you're at a level that
will make living in society difficult for you.

150
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,733
I'm coming in, Yukinoshita.

151
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:27,875
I said knock...

152
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,113
Yeah, sorry.

153
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:32,785
Sounds like you're having some trouble
rectifying our little friend here, huh?

154
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,351
It's because he isn't aware he has a problem.

155
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:36,899
No, it's not.

156
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,613
What in the hell?

157
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:43,011
Why is everyone always telling me to change? I
don't want other people trying to tell me who to be.

158
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:45,197
That's how you run from your problems, isn't it?

159
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:48,429
Changing is a way of running
from your problems, too, isn't it?

160
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,715
Why can't you just accept someone for
who they are and what's in their past?

161
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:52,601
That won't...

162
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:56,196
'Cause that's not gonna solve anyone's worries...

163
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:57,836
nor will it save anyone.

164
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,319
Just relax, you guys.

165
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,682
You might not know,

166
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:09,552
but it's a time-honored shonen manga custom to
try and settle conflicting opinions with a showdown.

167
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:11,311
What are you even talking about?

168
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:16,216
I want there to be a showdown... to see
which one of you can do the most acts of service!

169
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:17,801
You're way too intense...

170
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:21,713
Well then, how about we let the winner
make the loser do anything they want.

171
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>By "anything," does she mean what
I think she means by "anything"?!</i>

172
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:30,394
I must decline. Doing so with him as my
opponent would make me fear for my life.

173
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:31,408
That's sexist!

174
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:34,151
Sexy stuff is not the only thing guys like me think about!

175
00:10:34,271 --> 00:10:36,542
<i>We also think about... world peace?</i>

176
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,654
<i>Actually, I don't think about much else...</i>

177
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:41,594
I guess even Yukinoshita has her fears.

178
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:43,246
I never thought I would say this...

179
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,892
but are you that afraid you'll lose?

180
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,646
Fine then. I cannot believe I'm
falling for such cheap provocation,

181
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:51,911
but I will accept.

182
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,661
Then that's that!

183
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,184
<i>Don't I get a say in this?</i>

184
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:08,748
Huh?

185
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:14,654
Well, hello again.

186
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:16,934
I didn't think you'd come back.

187
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,654
Are you a masochist, then?

188
00:11:18,723 --> 00:11:19,402
No.

189
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:20,684
A stalker, then?

190
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:24,443
Why are you assuming that I'm harboring
some sort of illicit feelings for you?

191
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:25,480
So, you don't?

192
00:11:25,536 --> 00:11:26,258
No!

193
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,755
Your overconfidence is weird, even to me.

194
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,685
Let me guess... you don't have any friends?

195
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:36,021
Well, then first why don't you explain to me where
the definition of "friend" begins and where it ends-

196
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:40,214
Please, say no more. That's exactly
something someone would say with no friends.

197
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,345
Because I'd say that.

198
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,384
You seem like a likable girl, so then how
can you have no friends? What's your problem?

199
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,884
Yeah there's no way you could understand.

200
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,141
I've always been considered really pretty...

201
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:53,604
Guh!

202
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,797
So any guy who has gotten close to
me has done so with ulterior motives.

203
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:58,983
How can people like you say you're lonely?

204
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:01,463
You're a disgrace to lonely people everywhere.

205
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:04,100
If everyone actually had liked me,

206
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:06,167
perhaps then I would have been alright.

207
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:08,280
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

208
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:13,302
In grade school, my indoor shoes were
taken and hidden from me about sixty times.

209
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:15,731
Fifty of those times were done by other girls.

210
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:20,101
And it was all thanks to them that I had to
take my indoor shoes and my recorder home every day.

211
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,007
Sounds like you had a rough time.

212
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,728
Yes, it was rough.

213
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,499
It was because I'm pretty.

214
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:27,323
Ah...

215
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,967
But then, it can't be helped, can it?

216
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,939
Although, nobody can be considered perfect.

217
00:12:33,313 --> 00:12:37,325
People are weak, they're ugly, they
get jealous and try to bring others down.

218
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,479
Oddly enough, the better you
are, the harder it is to live.

219
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,814
Don't you think that's wrong somehow?

220
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,472
But I can and will change it...

221
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,511
and all the people within this world.

222
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:50,321
You're putting too much effort into a crazy cause.

223
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:51,554
Oh, you think so?

224
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:54,969
Well, I think it's better than your
efforts to dry up and fade into nothing.

225
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:59,088
You know, I hate the way you
accept your weakness as a positive...

226
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,048
It's stupid.

227
00:13:01,508 --> 00:13:04,927
<i>Yukinoshita carries the pain of
someone who has more than others.</i>

228
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:09,383
<i>It shouldn't be too hard to hide that
and go through life lying to everyone.</i>

229
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,604
<i>After all, that's what people do in this world.</i>

230
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:15,843
<i>But Yukinoshita doesn't do that.</i>

231
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:18,674
<i>She would never lie to herself.</i>

232
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:23,361
<i>"I'm sure she and I are alike in some way."</i>

233
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,869
<i>I couldn't help thinking that, in spite of myself.</i>

234
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:30,186
<i>Even the silence in that moment felt comfortable...</i>

235
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:31,730
<i>like it belonged.</i>

236
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:37,297
<i>I felt like my heart inside me was wanting
to race faster than even the second hand...</i>

237
00:13:38,422 --> 00:13:39,792
<i>itching to press forward.</i>

238
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:41,933
<i>Then...</i>

239
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:43,813
<i>Then she and I...</i>

240
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,512
Hey, Yukinoshita...

241
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,668
If you want, I'll be...

242
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:50,181
your frien-

243
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,673
Yeah, that's not gonna happen, sorry.

244
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,481
What? But I wasn't even finished telling you what I...

245
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:57,167
Come in.

246
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,764
E-excuse me!

247
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:05,911
So, Ms. Hiratsuka sent me here...

248
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,376
Wha... What is Hikki doing in this room?!

249
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,604
Well, um... I'm a member of this club.

250
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,975
<i>Wait, is "Hikki" supposed to be me?</i>

251
00:14:15,094 --> 00:14:16,241
<i>Also, who is she?</i>

252
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:19,582
Yui Yuigahama of class 2-F, correct?

253
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:20,773
Well, have a seat.

254
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:24,861
Wow! You actually know who I am?

255
00:14:25,092 --> 00:14:27,284
I bet you've memorized the name of every student.

256
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,057
Not so. If you remember, I didn't know who you were.

257
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:31,141
How could I forget?

258
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,105
You don't have to feel bad.

259
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,863
I can only blame the weakness of my heart for
wanting to avert my eyes from your existence.

260
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:39,709
Are you trying to make me feel better?

261
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:41,834
No, I'm being sarcastic.

262
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:43,335
This club...

263
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,387
looks like a lot of fun!

264
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,641
And, Hikki, you're sure talking a lot.

265
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:50,533
Huh? Uh, no, sorry! What I meant to say is...

266
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:53,377
You're just totally different
from the way you are in class.

267
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,096
I mean, you usually act sort of weird and creepy.

268
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:57,902
You little slut.

269
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,999
What?! Who are you calling a slut?! I'm still a virgin-

270
00:15:01,048 --> 00:15:03,678
Oh! Uh, ah! Never mind!

271
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,642
It's really nothing to be embarrassed about.

272
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:08,253
What I mean is that... you...

273
00:15:08,278 --> 00:15:09,399
What are you saying?!

274
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:12,209
I'm a second-year! It's super embarrassing!

275
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:13,911
Shouldn't you be a little girlier than this?

276
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:15,493
Such values are pointless.

277
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:18,712
I don't know, saying something like
"girlier" sounds pretty slutty to me.

278
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:22,540
Stop it! Calling someone a slut is so
not cool! You're such a creep, Hikki!

279
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,170
Calling someone a slut has nothing to do with creepiness.

280
00:15:25,349 --> 00:15:27,069
Stop calling me Hikki, slut.

281
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,340
Wha... Huh?

282
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:29,942
You are so damn creepy!

283
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,730
I can't believe you would say that!

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,414
What? Cookies?

285
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,681
Apparently our friend here would like
to make homemade cookies for someone.

286
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,407
But she's not very confident, so she wants our help.

287
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:42,778
This is her request.

288
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,166
Uh, why don't you ask your friends to help you with this?

289
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:49,018
Y-yeah, well, I...

290
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,578
I don't really want any of them to know.

291
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,050
And it's just that it'd be...
weird acting serious with them.

292
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,356
I guess... I see.

293
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,802
And besides, I heard from Ms. Hiratsuka...

294
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,690
that this club is supposed to
grant students' wishes, right?

295
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,290
Not quite. The Service Club only assists people.

296
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:10,360
We don't just give fish to starving people. We
teach them how to fish so they can be independent.

297
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:12,071
Th-that's kinda amazing.

298
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:16,021
That's crooked. Can't you even
manage to put on an apron correctly?

299
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:17,449
Sorry. Thanks.

300
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,244
And? What am I supposed to do here?

301
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:23,757
You can taste them and offer your opinions.

302
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,419
How in the world can someone
really mess up so much and so often?

303
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:32,419
It looks kind of like the charcoal
they sell at the hardware store.

304
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,050
I feel like the royal tester.

305
00:16:34,112 --> 00:16:35,584
I didn't put poison in it!

306
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:40,663
It might be poisonous, though.

307
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:42,142
We won't die, right?

308
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,977
Well, let's think on how to improve this.

309
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,403
How about, "Yuigahama never cooks again"?

310
00:16:48,428 --> 00:16:50,080
That's how you're planning to solve things?!

311
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,237
Maybe you're right, then...

312
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:54,297
I suppose I'm not cut out for cooking.

313
00:16:54,444 --> 00:16:57,245
I guess I just don't have... the talent needed.

314
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,779
The only solution is to try harder.

315
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:04,427
Yuigahama, you just said you
don't have any talent, correct?

316
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,271
Uh...

317
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,892
Try changing your perception.

318
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:13,269
People who don't apply even minimal effort have
no right to go around and envy those with talent.

319
00:17:13,677 --> 00:17:19,261
Unsuccessful people are unsuccessful because they can't
imagine the effort that successful people have invested.

320
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:22,917
Yeah... But lately, everyone
says they don't even cook like this.

321
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:25,103
This just isn't who we are...

322
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:30,146
Could you find it within yourself to
stop trying to match everyone around you?

323
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,564
It's terribly annoying.

324
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:37,255
Aren't you embarrassed waiting for others to tell you
why you're awkward, clumsy, or foolish? I mean, come on.

325
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,667
You're...

326
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:43,813
You're so cool...

327
00:17:44,053 --> 00:17:44,633
Huh?!

328
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:46,914
You don't say anything superficial.

329
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:49,880
Actually... that's kind of cool, you know?

330
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:52,000
W-were you even listening to me?

331
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,324
I believe I was being rather harsh to you...

332
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:56,461
Yeah, your words were kind of harsh and all,

333
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:59,113
but I felt that's how you actually feel.

334
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,259
All I've ever done is just try to be like everyone else.

335
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,482
Sorry! Next time, I'll do it right!

336
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,757
Teach her the right way. Show her what to do.

337
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:13,162
I'll give you a demonstration. Do exactly as I do.

338
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,255
Mm!

339
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:17,730
Totally different...

340
00:18:18,592 --> 00:18:21,298
How am I supposed to make you understand?

341
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,854
I don't get it. Why are you guys
trying to make cookies that taste good?

342
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:25,770
Huh?

343
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:27,012
What are you saying?

344
00:18:28,076 --> 00:18:30,206
Come back to this room in about ten minutes.

345
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:34,156
I'll show you some real handmade
cookies you've never experienced before.

346
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:36,624
<i>Now it's my turn in the showdown.</i>

347
00:18:39,716 --> 00:18:42,543
These are what you call "real" handmade cookies?

348
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:44,242
These things don't taste very good!

349
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,657
You think so? Sorry. I'll toss them.

350
00:18:46,682 --> 00:18:50,006
W-wait a second! You don't
have to go and toss them all out!

351
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,264
I mean, they're really not that terrible!

352
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:55,488
Yeah? Well, these are the bad cookies you made, actually.

353
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,789
Huh? What are you talking about?

354
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:01,088
Here's a relevant little story I
once heard about a friend of a friend.

355
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:04,387
<i>There was a girl he knew who'd tell
him everything that happened to her.</i>

356
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,842
<i>"I thou-I mean, he thought," This must
mean she likes me! I've got it made!"</i>

357
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,575
<i>So he made up his mind, and he asked her.</i>

358
00:19:11,707 --> 00:19:15,377
Hey, so who is it that you like
in our school? Just his initials!

359
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:15,964
Huh?!

360
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:19,314
H...

361
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:20,012
"H"?!

362
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:22,384
That's my initial... Is it me?!

363
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:25,545
What are you talking about?
You're being creepy. Would you stop?

364
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,490
Wait a minute.

365
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:30,199
So that's a personal experience of yours?

366
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:32,039
Hey, now! I told you, it was a friend of a friend!

367
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:35,656
Oh, please. And just what are we
supposed to take from that anyway?

368
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:36,529
I don't know.

369
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:38,817
I guess that guys are just simple and stuff.

370
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:41,472
They'll get the wrong idea if you so much as talk to them,

371
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,913
and they'll be happy just to
get handmade cookies from you.

372
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,284
So they don't have to taste good.

373
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:48,318
They don't taste good? Well, shut up!

374
00:19:48,343 --> 00:19:52,155
As long as he knows you tried your very best,
wouldn't that make him like you?

375
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,317
I would think that's the response you're looking for.

376
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,299
Is that how it's supposed to work?

377
00:19:56,926 --> 00:19:58,460
Would it work on you, Hikki?

378
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:01,218
Huh? Sure, it'd work great on me.

379
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,335
And stop calling me "Hikki," okay?

380
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,827
So, what are you going to do, Yuigahama?

381
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,697
Yeah, I think that I'm going
to go ahead and try it my way.

382
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,029
Thanks, again, Yukinoshita!

383
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,399
Did we really do the right thing?

384
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:21,555
Did we handle Yuigahama's request?

385
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,664
What are you yakking about?

386
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,300
I think if you really want to
improve yourself in some way,

387
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,993
you should go out there and
try to challenge your own limits.

388
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,868
And maybe that would have probably benefitted
Yuigahama most in the end, don't you think?

389
00:20:31,893 --> 00:20:33,679
Your efforts will never betray you.

390
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:36,166
But they can always come betray your dreams.

391
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:36,778
Huh?

392
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,224
Not all dreams will come true through effort.

393
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,713
Actually, most of them won't even come true.

394
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:44,957
But if you tried your best, you can take solace in that.

395
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:46,856
That's self-satisfaction.

396
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,742
You're naive. It's creepy.

397
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:50,614
Hm?

398
00:20:51,096 --> 00:20:52,273
Hello, guys!

399
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,241
You need something?

400
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,649
What? Am I no longer welcome to come in here?

401
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:59,036
Yukinoshita, do you hate me?

402
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:00,129
But why?

403
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:02,430
I wouldn't say I hate you.

404
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:03,859
You're just not my type.

405
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:06,084
That means the same thing in girl-speak, you know!

406
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:08,039
So, did you need something?

407
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,154
This is thanks for the other day.

408
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,594
I made cookies!

409
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,912
But I'm not really hungry...

410
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:15,994
Man, it's pretty fun once you give it a try!

411
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:18,228
Maybe I'll try making a boxed lunch next time.

412
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:21,439
Oh, and, Yukinon, let's eat
lunch in the club room together!

413
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:25,576
No, thanks... I like to eat my lunch
alone, so I think I'll pass on that offer.

414
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,333
And "Yukinon" creeps me out, so don't-

415
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:31,028
Also, Yukinon, I'm free after school,
so I'll help with the club! It'll be fun!

416
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:33,306
Yeah, this is, what would you call it? To say thanks!

417
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,087
Are you listening? Yuigahama?

418
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:37,657
Hikki!

419
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:38,415
Hm?

420
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,299
Ah! Huh?

421
00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:43,642
I just want to show... my thanks.

422
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,090
You helped me just as much last week.

423
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:52,373
Well, this sure looks like something ominous.

424
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:54,426
It feels like some kind of bad omen...

425
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,630
but I'll accept it with gratitude.

426
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:06,364
And stop calling me "Hikki."

427
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:46,206
That indecisive attitude of
yours is really getting annoying.

428
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:48,876
Sorry. I thought you were an ape trying to intimidate me.

429
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,331
I am disgusted with you, Hachiman!

430
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,698
That's just a delusion of grandeur.

431
00:23:53,758 --> 00:23:55,549
Delusion of grandeur?

432
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,966
Yukinon, run!

433
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:58,849
I think I understand.

434
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:01,357
You'd like us to cure you of this illness, right?

435
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:05,974
I am the Kengo Shogun, Yoshiteru Zaimokuza!

436
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:09,851
Next time: "All People Surely Have Their Own Worries."
