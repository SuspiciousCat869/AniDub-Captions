1
00:00:08,018 --> 00:00:08,834
Wow...

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,654
<i>That article is about as intelligent
as the tree stump it was printed from.</i>

3
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,066
What part of this do you relate to?

4
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,151
Oh, seriously!

5
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,089
Hey, it's time.

6
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,550
And wipe your mouth off first.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,260
Huh? Is it jammed?

8
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:29,042
I wasn't aware your mouth was an automatic rifle.

9
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:31,373
You do know that's not what "jammed" means, right?

10
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:35,690
You know, Big Brother... sometimes I
have no clue what you're talking about.

11
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:36,864
That's your own fau...

12
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,827
Clean up for me, okay?

13
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,215
<i>Younger sisters are strange beings.</i>

14
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:46,618
<i>However cute she may be, I feel nothing.</i>

15
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,777
<i>Her underwear is nothing more than cloth to me.</i>

16
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:53,235
<i>That's what a real little sister is like.</i>

17
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:57,018
Huh?

18
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,282
Let's go!

19
00:00:58,828 --> 00:00:59,864
<i>This brat...</i>

20
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:09,334
Don't go get in a wreck again,
okay? Remember, I'm riding with you.

21
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,205
What, it's okay to get in a wreck if I'm by myself?

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,370
Big Brother, sometimes you zone out with this
dead fish look in your eyes, and it really worries me.

23
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:20,952
Hey, I could give myself a lot
of points for that one, couldn't I?

24
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:27,281
<i>I got into an accident on my first day of
high school, and she'll never let me live it down.</i>

25
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,611
<i>I got too excited about the start of my new life...</i>

26
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,397
<i>so I left home a whole hour early...</i>

27
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:37,372
Huh?

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,649
<i>and ended up hospitalized with a fracture.</i>

29
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,822
<i>That was when I knew I'd always be alone in my new school.</i>

30
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:56,195
By the way...

31
00:01:56,843 --> 00:02:00,677
After that wreck, the dog's owner came
over to say thanks for saving her dog.

32
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,144
She brought you desserts! They were really good.

33
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,475
And I never got to eat any of them, did I?

34
00:02:06,952 --> 00:02:08,132
Tee-hee!

35
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:09,755
<i>God, she's so annoying.</i>

36
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:14,792
But the girl who brought the desserts goes to
your school, so you've probably met her already.

37
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,651
She said that she would thank you at school.

38
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,613
Why didn't you tell me this back then?

39
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:20,479
Well, didn't you get her name then?

40
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:22,374
I forgot it.

41
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,122
Oh! We're at my school!

42
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,149
Well it looks like I'm off then!

43
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:28,024
Thanks again, Big Brother! See ya!

44
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:30,431
Uh... Huh?

45
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,791
Oh, Big Brother!

46
00:02:33,016 --> 00:02:34,270
Such an idiot.

47
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:07,848
"People in ancient times
believed that to work was to lose.

48
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:11,492
Manual labor requires high risk to earn high returns.

49
00:04:11,582 --> 00:04:17,807
Therefore, my decision to start a family without
working is appropriate, and in fact, entirely justifiable.

50
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:21,458
This is why I have decided that
requesting my home be the workplace

51
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:25,025
for a stay-at-home dad, is
perfect for my career observation."

52
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:25,651
Guh!

53
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,775
You know what I'm about to say...

54
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:31,221
Do you not?

55
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:33,291
I'll rewrite it! Don't hit me!

56
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:37,136
You better believe it! And here I
was thinking you had changed a bit.

57
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:40,495
Hasn't your time in the Service
Club influenced your attitude at all?

58
00:04:40,621 --> 00:04:43,128
I always say my motto is, "Stick to your guns."

59
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:51,848
If you don't want to get shot by my Annihilating Second
Bullet, you'd better shut your mouth while you still can.

60
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,066
Just try and spare me the Exterminating Last Bullet...

61
00:04:55,422 --> 00:04:58,548
Hmph. Glad you're catching on fast, Hikigaya.

62
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:02,647
Anyway, you will resubmit your application survey.

63
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:08,125
Also, I forgot to tell you, but students will
attend this workplace observation in groups of three.

64
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,170
You can team up with whoever you
want, just make sure to come prepared.

65
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:14,705
I don't want random people from my
class coming into my house at all.

66
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,035
I take it you still intend on
"observing" your own home, huh?

67
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,304
Seriously...

68
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:25,965
You didn't see her?

69
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:27,364
See who?

70
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,544
Hey! You!

71
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:30,712
What's with you?

72
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:35,385
Since you hadn't shown up to the club room
in a reasonable time, you had to be looked for.

73
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,752
By Yuigahama, that is.

74
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:41,311
You don't have to use inverse word order
to stress that it wasn't you. I'm well aware.

75
00:05:41,336 --> 00:05:43,660
I even went around asking people, you know.

76
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:46,094
And they were all, "Hikigaya? Who's that?"

77
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,092
That made it really difficult for me to find you!

78
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,557
W-well, sorry about that.

79
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,919
Thanks... not like I minded or anything.

80
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:54,867
So... like... maybe...

81
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:55,660
Hm?

82
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,201
G-give me your number!

83
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:02,796
'Cause I shouldn't have to run around looking
like a fool looking for you! It's distressing!

84
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:05,697
I mean I don't want people knowing I'm looking...

85
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:07,276
for you, that is...

86
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,134
That's fine with me, I guess.

87
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,562
You want me to type it?

88
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:16,294
Also, I'm amazed you can just hand
over your phone like this to someone.

89
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,535
You're typing really fast.

90
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,681
It's normal.

91
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:25,902
I bet your fingers are only weak 'cause you
don't have any friends to text back and forth with.

92
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,068
Well, that's rude.

93
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:29,887
I'll have you know that I texted
with a girl in middle school.

94
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,239
No way...

95
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,171
Hey! That was my phone!

96
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:36,558
Oh...

97
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:39,985
I was just having a hard time
imagining you texting a girl!

98
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,472
Listen, moron. It went down like this...

99
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:45,389
<i>When we were changing classes
and everyone was exchanging numbers,</i>

100
00:06:45,414 --> 00:06:47,256
<i>I took out my phone and looked around...</i>

101
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,029
Thank you. Oh?

102
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:56,200
Do you want to exchange phone numbers?

103
00:06:56,307 --> 00:06:59,395
You might as well say I was
popular enough for her to ask me that.

104
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:01,212
Well... Huh...

105
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,504
Sometimes kindness is cruel, isn't it?

106
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:04,404
Don't pity me.

107
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:06,437
I did text her as a matter of fact.

108
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,444
What kind of girl was this brave middle schooler?

109
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,977
She was a health nut and very refined if you must know.

110
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:16,766
She was such a devout health nut, in fact,
that when I texted her at seven in the evening,

111
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,013
she would always respond in the morning saying,

112
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,082
"Sorry, I was asleep. See you at school."

113
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,514
Hm... That means that...

114
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,487
She pretended she was asleep to ignore your text.

115
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,277
Hikigaya, don't avert your eyes from the truth.

116
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,070
Accept the reality.

117
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,631
I know what the reality is, you little fool.

118
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:36,752
Hell, I could probably write a Hikipedia article on it.

119
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:41,820
<i>This looks like the sender line of a spam message!</i>

120
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:43,301
Huh?

121
00:07:45,185 --> 00:07:46,038
Something wrong?

122
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:49,280
What? No, nothing's wrong. It's just...

123
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:52,830
I got a weird message on my
phone. It's surprising, is all.

124
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:56,415
Hikigaya, if you don't want to
end up in court at some point,

125
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,154
you should refrain from sending such vulgar messages.

126
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,532
You just assume it's sexually charged, huh?

127
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,636
And I'm the culprit.

128
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:04,659
Let's see the proof you have!

129
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:07,343
I think your words are proof enough in this matter.

130
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:07,790
Guh!

131
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,987
There are certain lines the criminals always say.

132
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,704
"Where's the proof in all this?"

133
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:16,600
"Impressive deduction skills. You should
really write crime novels for a living."

134
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,400
"I'm not comfortable being in same room as a killer."

135
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,650
Really? That sounds more like the victim.

136
00:08:21,978 --> 00:08:23,483
It's basically a death flag.

137
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,009
Is that what you think?

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,884
No, I don't think Hikki's the culprit for this one.

139
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:29,335
Why do you say that?

140
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:31,494
Hmm... I guess because...

141
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,882
it was about people that are in my class.

142
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,970
So Hikki would have nothing to do with it!

143
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,221
Except I'm in the same class as you...

144
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:39,572
Oh, I see.

145
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:42,049
Then, Hikigaya can't be the culprit, now can he?

146
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,306
She considered that to be valid evidence...

147
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,785
Well, these things are bound to come up now and then.

148
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,733
But I just don't worry about it that's all.

149
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:50,255
Huh?

150
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,947
Uh, hey... I wanted to ask a favor...

151
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,720
This is where the Service Club meets, right?

152
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:00,456
<i>I instinctively admitted defeat again...</i>

153
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:05,486
Ms. Hiratsuka said this was the place to
go to if I had a problem that needed fixing.

154
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,859
So... Man...

155
00:09:06,972 --> 00:09:08,998
I had a hard time getting out of my club meeting.

156
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:10,518
We don't need to hear your story.

157
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,702
You came here to ask us for something...

158
00:09:12,808 --> 00:09:14,401
Hayato Hayama?

159
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:16,154
Oh, yeah, about that...

160
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,993
Oh, that weird message...

161
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:24,447
"Tobe is a delinquent from Inage.
Staking out West High kids at the arcade.

162
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,594
Yamato dates three girls at once. He's total scum.

163
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,599
Ooka takes out rival schools' aces with rough play."

164
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,565
A chain mail, huh?

165
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,921
Since this started going around, it's
been really awkward with everyone in class.

166
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:40,630
And it makes me mad to see someone writing
this awful stuff about all my friends...

167
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,480
Oh, but I'm not interested in finding out who did this.

168
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,843
I wanna settle this thing peacefully.

169
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,320
Can you help me?

170
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,155
Hmm...

171
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:49,222
<i>There it is...</i>

172
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:50,952
<i>Special technique: The Zone!</i>

173
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:52,612
<i>Allow me to explain.</i>

174
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:58,637
{\an8}<i>The Zone is an inherent skill that only those
who live truly fulfilling lives may possess.</i>

175
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:03,425
<i>Its most prominent characteristic is
its ability to put a situation in order.</i>

176
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,882
<i>Because they are fulfilled in real life,</i>

177
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:08,367
<i>they are kind even to people who are often scorned.</i>

178
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:12,968
<i>One might call it a unique atmosphere
belonging to good people with strong charisma.</i>

179
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:17,584
I see, so you want us to get the situation under control.

180
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,904
Hm. Yeah, that's about right.

181
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:22,923
Then, we'll need to find the
person who put out the message.

182
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,633
Hm. I'm counting... What?

183
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:26,760
But why? You don't have to do that.

184
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,170
Chain mail...

185
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:32,313
A despicable action that
tramples upon the dignity of others.

186
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:34,937
Their intention is to hurt those people...

187
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:38,294
while at the same time making sure
their own identities are never known.

188
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:42,192
In order stop this disease effectively,
it must be eliminated at the root.

189
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:43,485
Source: My own...

190
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,499
Your own experience?

191
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,016
Killed it at the root, then?

192
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:49,238
At any rate, people like that
must be thoroughly destroyed.

193
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:50,899
That's my way.

194
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,907
I will find the one who did this.

195
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:56,342
I believe a single word can stop them.

196
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:59,073
I'll let you decide what to do with them after that.

197
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,592
Is that all right with you?

198
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:03,063
Sure, that's fine by me...

199
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,139
When did you notice that the messages started to show?

200
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,263
It was last weekend, wasn't it? Yeah.

201
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:12,658
Something happen in your class, huh, Yuigahama, Hayama?

202
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,983
Nothing in particular that I know of...

203
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:17,702
Hm. Yeah, it was the same as always.

204
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,898
For the sake of asking, and you?

205
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:21,483
What is that supposed to mean?

206
00:11:21,857 --> 00:11:23,108
Last weekend, huh?

207
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,155
So it was pretty recent that this started...

208
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,630
Workplace observation will be in groups of three.

209
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:29,921
Workplace observation?

210
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:31,621
Oh! That's it!

211
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,831
It's because we're being split into groups!

212
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:45,257
Hm?

213
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:51,625
I think I know who's doing it!

214
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,338
Could you explain?

215
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,472
Some people can't be grouped in events like this.

216
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:59,225
It can really affect their relationship afterward.

217
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,312
These people can get pretty sensitive.

218
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,137
Our workplace observation is done in groups of three,

219
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:06,361
so with a group of four friends, one's out.

220
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:09,237
He'd kick someone out so as not to be excluded.

221
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:13,701
So, I would think for starters, we can
assume that one of those three is the culprit.

222
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,852
W-wait just a minute.

223
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,506
I don't want to go about thinking that
any of my friends would be the culprit.

224
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,881
That message said bad things about all three.

225
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,948
I don't think any of them did it.

226
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:25,234
Are you stupid?

227
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:29,564
Everyone knows the culprit just did that so
he wouldn't be suspected as the instigator.

228
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:31,875
And, in fact, if it were me doing it,

229
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,344
I would pick the one person to not say
bad things about, so I could frame him.

230
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,893
You know you're absolutely terrible, Hikki.

231
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:39,199
Call me a smooth criminal.

232
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:43,004
Okay then, why don't you start
telling me about your three friends?

233
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:45,281
Hm... I admit...

234
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,327
Tobe often looks like a bad guy,

235
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,802
but he's the most easygoing and cheers people up.

236
00:12:49,989 --> 00:12:52,196
He's the most proactive when stuff like this happens.

237
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,666
He's a good guy!

238
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,047
So he's a class clown who isn't
good at anything but making a scene.

239
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:00,408
Hm? What's the matter? Go on.

240
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,935
Uh, Yamato is really level-headed
and a super good listener.

241
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,955
He does things at his own pace and
puts people at ease. He's a good guy!

242
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,238
So you're saying that he's dense and indecisive. Next.

243
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:16,368
Ooka is really great with people! He's good-natured
and always helping someone out when they're in trouble.

244
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:17,103
He's a good...

245
00:13:17,135 --> 00:13:20,171
Reader of people's moods like a weathervane. Yeah?

246
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,957
Any one of these people could be the culprit.

247
00:13:24,117 --> 00:13:27,371
What Hayama has said doesn't
really give me much to go on, exactly.

248
00:13:27,511 --> 00:13:29,928
What do you two think of the three suspects we have?

249
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,570
Huh? That's a bit hard for me to say, really...

250
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,798
I don't really know those guys enough to judge yet.

251
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,434
Then, would you mind looking into them for me?

252
00:13:37,632 --> 00:13:38,884
Hm. Sure...

253
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:40,413
Sorry.

254
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:43,033
I understand it's not a pleasant thing to do.

255
00:13:43,226 --> 00:13:43,928
I'll do it.

256
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:44,791
Huh?

257
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,452
It's not like I care what the
rest of the class thinks of me.

258
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:51,151
Plus, finding fault in people is one of my 108 talents.

259
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:53,508
Then I guess I won't expect too much.

260
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:54,842
I'll do it, too then!

261
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:57,046
I can't just leave this to Hikki, after all!

262
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,448
Besides, I can't ignore a
request coming from you, Yukinon!

263
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:01,558
Oh?

264
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:03,268
I'll do my best!

265
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:04,513
You sure are good friends.

266
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,960
Those two are, yes.

267
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:08,769
I meant you, too, Hikitani.

268
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:10,174
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

269
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,304
<i>There's no Hikitani in this club.</i>

270
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:15,113
Huh?

271
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,187
Okay then, for now, you don't have to do anything.

272
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,429
Well, that's a big load off.

273
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:22,112
What are you going to do, anyway?

274
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,913
I'll see what the girls have to say.

275
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:27,491
After all, girls know more about
how everyone in the class gets along.

276
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,766
And if I bring up someone they dislike,

277
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,547
then they'll get all into it
and tell me all kinds of stuff.

278
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,476
Girl talk is super scary...

279
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,901
Anyway, as I've said, I've got
this, so don't worry about it!

280
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:42,427
Well, if I tried to question any people, the
punchline would be them asking, "Who are you?"

281
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:43,740
It's all yours.

282
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:44,606
Great!

283
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:46,267
Okay!

284
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:46,863
Huh?

285
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:52,272
Yeah, so like, Tobe, Ooka, and Yamato,
they're acting kinda weird lately, huh?

286
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:53,666
What do you think is going on there?

287
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,527
<i>That's getting straight to the point...</i>

288
00:14:56,253 --> 00:14:59,108
I don't remember you being
the type to say stuff like that?

289
00:14:59,132 --> 00:14:59,560
Huh?

290
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:02,751
You know, that probably wasn't one of your smartest ideas.

291
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,081
You shouldn't being saying damaging
stuff like that about your good friends.

292
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,603
Oh no! That's not what I meant...

293
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,530
It's just been on my mind lately.

294
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:13,076
Really? Then do you have a crush on one of them?

295
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,939
What?! Absolutely not!

296
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,639
I mean, there is someone on my mind, but that's just a...

297
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:20,486
You have a crush on someone?

298
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,680
Come on, tell me who it is! I'll help!

299
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:24,516
I told you, that's not it at all!

300
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,129
I just wanted to know what kind of relationship they have!

301
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,506
I hear you.

302
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:30,493
So that's been on your mind, as well?

303
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,087
I feel the same way.

304
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,024
Yeah! Like, it seems awkward or something, right?

305
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:37,453
Personally I think... but seriously...

306
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,661
Tobi's definitely the uke!

307
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:40,782
Huh?

308
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,953
And Yamato is the seme, and Ooka is the inviting uke!

309
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:47,580
There's definitely something going on in that triangle!

310
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:48,873
One things for sure!

311
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:51,167
All three of them are totally after Hayato!

312
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,599
Am I right or what?!

313
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:55,630
All three stepping aside for the sake of their friends!

314
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,298
That has to be it!

315
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:01,990
You know what, girl, you're way cuter when
you're quiet, Ebina, so learn to blend in.

316
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,876
And wipe the blood from your nose.

317
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,361
Sorry! I couldn't find anything out!

318
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,644
Well, you were doing several
things wrong right from the beginning.

319
00:16:09,908 --> 00:16:10,945
I'll do it next.

320
00:16:11,084 --> 00:16:12,705
Do what next? What do you mean?

321
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,857
You're going to go ask around?

322
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:15,621
No. I'm gonna watch.

323
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,399
Huh?

324
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,042
<i>I will now disclose one of my
108 talents: Human Observation.</i>

325
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:25,849
<i>Only about 30% of human communication is language.</i>

326
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:30,706
<i>The other 70% is gathering information
from eye movements and other subtle gestures.</i>

327
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:36,550
<i>In other words, I can actually achieve 70% of
communication while remaining alone and silent.</i>

328
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,419
<i>Right? Never mind.</i>

329
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:40,917
Hm?

330
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,048
Good morning!

331
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:49,016
I want you to make miso soup for me every morning.

332
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,740
What? Why's that?

333
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,821
Uh, nothing. Ignore me. I was half asleep.

334
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:55,354
Did you want something?

335
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,187
Have you decided on your group for the work thing?

336
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,080
Have you?

337
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:00,257
Who me?

338
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,934
I, um, I've already decided. Yeah.

339
00:17:04,392 --> 00:17:07,543
<i>I figured. Totsuka's in the tennis club.</i>

340
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:11,656
<i>With all the connections he has there, it's
not surprising if he has friends in this class.</i>

341
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:13,553
<i>As for me, on the other hand...</i>

342
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:15,490
Now that I think about it...

343
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:19,296
Actually, scratch that, I don't even have to
think about it. I don't have any guy friends.

344
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:20,857
Um, really?

345
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,856
You know, I'm a boy, right, Hikigaya.

346
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,914
<i>Does he really think we can be called "friends"?</i>

347
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,150
<i>Friends are like, well, for instance...</i>

348
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,123
Did you decide where you were going yet?

349
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:37,298
Yeah, man. I think either media
or maybe foreign investments.

350
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:40,488
Damn, dude! You're really looking
ahead towards your future, huh?!

351
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,813
But I guess we should be at our age.

352
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,216
It seems I totally respect my parents nowadays.

353
00:17:45,241 --> 00:17:47,742
So gonna be serious from now on, are ya?

354
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:52,415
Whoa, dude! But we can't ever forget
our boyish hearts and devilish good looks!

355
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:57,143
<i>Maybe friendship is all about being able to
talk to each other about your youth like that.</i>

356
00:17:57,563 --> 00:18:00,000
<i>I could never do it, though. I'd burst out laughing.</i>

357
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:05,538
<i>They call each other by their first names, as if they're
saying this is proof that they're friends or something.</i>

358
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:07,614
Saika...

359
00:18:07,737 --> 00:18:08,241
Huh?

360
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:10,974
Uh, sorry... Forget I ever...

361
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,087
I'm so happy!

362
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,766
That's the first time you've called me by my first name.

363
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:17,943
<i>What the hell?</i>

364
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:21,209
Then can I perhaps call you "Hikki"?

365
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,583
That would be a no.

366
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,319
Well, then... Hachiman?

367
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:26,429
Oh. Say that three times.

368
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:27,930
Hachiman...

369
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:29,184
Hachiman?

370
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:30,601
Hachiman!

371
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,479
Are you even listening?!

372
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:33,563
Wait! What?

373
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,560
Oh! What were we talking about?

374
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,110
What is it?

375
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:41,354
Sorry... I just wondered if you'd found anything out.

376
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,393
Not yet.

377
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,578
Ah!

378
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:53,112
Something the matter?

379
00:18:54,494 --> 00:18:56,214
I've solved all the mysteries within.

380
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,479
Well? Did you figure something out?

381
00:19:01,097 --> 00:19:02,752
I don't know who the culprit is,

382
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,320
but I did figure out one thing about them.

383
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,259
That group of three is considered Hayama's group.

384
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:11,258
Huh? Why are you even saying that?

385
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:12,816
Uh... What do you mean?

386
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:14,724
Sorry, I said that all wrong.

387
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,434
I mean, they only hang out for Hayama's sake.

388
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,589
I don't think that's right...

389
00:19:20,318 --> 00:19:24,422
Hayama, tell me have you ever seen those
three hang out together without you being around?

390
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:26,322
Well, no, I haven't...

391
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:29,573
When it's just the three of them,
they don't really get along at all.

392
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:31,199
In simpler terms, then,

393
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:33,694
Hayama is the one considered to be their friend,

394
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,022
whereas the other three guys, they're
just seen as friends of a friend.

395
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,743
Oh, I totally get that now.

396
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,929
When the person who keeps the
conversation going isn't there, it's awkward.

397
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,471
You don't know what to do, so
you start messing with your phone.

398
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:48,330
Hm...

399
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:51,549
Let's just assume what you say is true on all accounts.

400
00:19:51,737 --> 00:19:54,730
It still only reinforces their motive to bring one down.

401
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:58,898
If we can't pin down the culprit,
the issue will never be fully resolved.

402
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:02,877
Hayama, if you want, I think I can
solve this mess you've gotten into.

403
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,329
I know a way those three can become friends...

404
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,131
and without searching for the culprit.

405
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:10,630
Not only that, but without anyone
having to resort to fighting each other.

406
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:12,436
Wanna know how?

407
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:21,549
Hm? By the way, like we were talking about before...

408
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:23,831
Can I sit here?

409
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,236
Hm?

410
00:20:25,346 --> 00:20:28,114
You settled it all so peacefully. I appreciate it.

411
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:30,395
It's not like I really had to do anything.

412
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,977
<i>The truth is, I didn't do a thing.</i>

413
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:36,367
<i>I just thought I'd drag Hayama
down the road to being alone.</i>

414
00:20:37,747 --> 00:20:39,808
<i>The reason those three looked like they wanted to fight...</i>

415
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:42,292
<i>was because they all wanted to be with Hayama.</i>

416
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:44,694
<i>So all you have to do is remove the cause.</i>

417
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:47,373
<i>In other words, take Hayama out of the picture.</i>

418
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:51,597
I tell you what, they sure were surprised
when I said I wouldn't team up with them.

419
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:57,439
But... I hope this will be a chance for
them to become friends and not depend on me.

420
00:20:57,722 --> 00:20:58,720
That'd be nice.

421
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:02,840
<i>Honestly, being this nice must
be some kind of demented illness.</i>

422
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:06,514
Hey, man, you don't have a group yet, right?

423
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:07,927
Want to team up?

424
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:10,300
<i>What is he, an American?</i>

425
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:11,988
O-okay.

426
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:14,992
<i>Damn it, that made me respond like an American...</i>

427
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:16,187
Ow, man...

428
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,457
Totsuka, what's with you?

429
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:20,363
What about me? Hachiman!

430
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:21,976
What? What do you mean?

431
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,268
But, uh, you said you already had your te-

432
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:28,407
I meant, I decided right from the start
that I was going to group up with you!

433
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,975
There. Thanks for that.

434
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,778
<i>At least you get my name right when you write it...</i>

435
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:35,609
Hachiman!

436
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,225
Huh?

437
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,371
What day should we go?

438
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:40,682
<i>Is this what other people call "friends"?</i>

439
00:21:41,724 --> 00:21:43,707
I'm gonna go wherever you go, Hayato.

440
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,509
No way! Hayama, you're going there?

441
00:21:45,534 --> 00:21:46,835
I think I'll go there, too!

442
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:49,244
Hayato, you're so awesome!

443
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:50,455
I'm going!

444
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:51,381
Me, too!

445
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:56,232
<i>Well... it's one of those things that
can disappear anywhere, and anytime.</i>

446
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:46,216
But it seems like Taishi's sister
has developed some bad behavior lately.

447
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:47,185
Are you stupid?

448
00:23:47,996 --> 00:23:48,723
Black lace?

449
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:52,528
In other words, she changed after
being put in the same class as Hikigaya?

450
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:54,874
Sorry to keep you waiting, Master.

451
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:57,715
I'm sorry, who were you again?

452
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:03,993
Meow. Meow!

453
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:06,391
Okay, none of that made sense.

454
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:11,245
Next time: "Once Again, He Turns
Back on the Path from Whence He Came."
