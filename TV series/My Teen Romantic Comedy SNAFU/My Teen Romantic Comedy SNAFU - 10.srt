1
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,943
The wind... It's really picking up out there.

2
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:31,059
Yeah.

3
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:33,737
Sure is.

4
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,520
What... the hell?

5
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:27,619
Are you confused about something here?

6
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:30,567
Since it's time for you to get to your next class,

7
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:33,660
and everyone was dragging their
feet on selecting committee members...

8
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,092
I just moved it along and picked you.

9
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:40,102
It's your own fault for sleeping so
soundly through your long homeroom period.

10
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,641
Yeah, but that's because, uh...

11
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,855
Move along. Can't start class with you up here.

12
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:46,393
You need to choose the rest after school.

13
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,800
So who wants to be the female representative?

14
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:52,037
Show of hands.

15
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,432
If this isn't decided, we'll use rock-paper-scissors...

16
00:02:58,474 --> 00:02:58,975
What?

17
00:03:00,715 --> 00:03:02,472
Is there a lot of hard work involved?

18
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:05,724
It's not usually a lot of hard
work if you do it right, but...

19
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:09,777
the female representative might
have it a bit tougher this time around.

20
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:12,207
<i>Sorry, I'm the male rep, four eyes.</i>

21
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,322
Hmm...

22
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:17,491
Honestly, it would be a big help if you decided to do it.

23
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:20,037
You're popular, after all. I think you'd be perfect.

24
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,192
Thanks for the compliment, but I'm not really all that...

25
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:25,334
Hey, Yui, I think you should do it.

26
00:03:25,858 --> 00:03:27,546
Sounds like a nice time to me.

27
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:31,172
Two good friends planning such
an event together sounds so fun!

28
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,232
Huh?!

29
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:39,002
Uh, I already told you it's not like that...

30
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:43,266
Well actually, Yui's supposed flag down
customers with me, so she can't be our rep.

31
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,979
Oh, isn't that convenient?

32
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:47,278
Flagging down customers is important, too.

33
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:50,268
That's right! Flagging down customers is important!

34
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,104
Wait, I'm flagging down customers?!

35
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:55,382
So, uh, what you're saying is
you want someone that's popular

36
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,091
but also has good leadership skills, is that correct?

37
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,288
I think Sagami should do it, then.

38
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,228
Yeah, that's a good idea.

39
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,081
I think Sagami would do a good job.

40
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:07,835
What? No way! Me? I don't think I could do it!

41
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:12,927
<i>Hey, now... You might fool them, but you
can't fool this first-rate refusal appraiser.</i>

42
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,333
<i>When a girl turns down something for real,</i>

43
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,625
<i>her eyes look colder and she's practically expressionless.</i>

44
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,911
Seriously, not in this lifetime.

45
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:23,244
<i>That's what they say.</i>

46
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:27,603
<i>They're so scary, you think your heart
will freeze solid, and you just want to die.</i>

47
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,483
Pretty please? Could you do it for us?

48
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:31,419
Uh...

49
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,545
Well, if nobody else wants to take
the role, then I guess I have to do it.

50
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,017
But really, you guys, me?

51
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:42,960
The cultural festival planning committee
is now called to its first session.

52
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:49,127
My name is Meguri Shiromeguri.

53
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,644
And I am your current student council president.

54
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:55,361
Okay, so let's get right to work by
first electing our committee chairman.

55
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,487
Does anyone want to run for the position?

56
00:05:03,614 --> 00:05:06,087
Um... You're Yukinoshita, aren't you?

57
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,231
Yes.

58
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:11,044
I knew it! You're Haru's sister, aren't you?

59
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,134
She was the planning committee chairman, too.

60
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,785
That festival was so great, it went
down in history as one of the best ever!

61
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,242
As Haru's sister, I bet you'd
be just as good she was, right?

62
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:23,619
I'll do my best as a committee member, thank you.

63
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,250
Ah...

64
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:26,080
Oh...

65
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:28,295
Uh...

66
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:28,899
Huh?

67
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:31,647
Ah...

68
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,380
If no one really wants to do it...

69
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,807
I could take on the chairmain's position.

70
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:39,467
Really?! You're, uh...

71
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:42,604
Minami Sagami from class 2-F.

72
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,827
I don't know just yet if I'll be
any good at being a leader, but...

73
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:48,653
I am kind of interested in that sort of thing...

74
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:53,139
I guess what I'm saying is I'd like to use
the cultural festival as an opportunity to grow.

75
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:54,150
That's great!

76
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:57,058
<i>And why do we get the pleasure of having to help you grow?</i>

77
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:01,665
So, if we have no other
candidates, are we okay with Sagami?

78
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,958
I just ended up becoming the committee chairman!

79
00:06:11,983 --> 00:06:13,169
You're fine.

80
00:06:13,211 --> 00:06:15,539
Don't worry, Sagami, I know you can do it.

81
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:16,378
And we'll help!

82
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:17,423
That's right, we will!

83
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:21,350
Thanks, guys, though I think I might
have said some really embarrassing stuff!

84
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,163
Oh, no way! You were great!

85
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:25,067
Huh?

86
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,978
You know, I was a little surprised
to hear you were on the committee team.

87
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,315
Well, I suppose... I can see why.

88
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:41,397
I would actually find it way more surprising if you
were the one who joined the planning committee, Yui.

89
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,866
That'd totally be out of character, right?!

90
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:44,748
Hey.

91
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,416
What about me? I was half forced into it.

92
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:49,082
I see.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,974
Huh?

94
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,581
So, doesn't the committee meet every day?

95
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,828
I guess that means I'll probably have to start
helping with the class projects from now on...

96
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:05,856
Yeah, I won't be able to come
to the club for a while, either.

97
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,204
This is perfect timing.

98
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:10,434
So I've been thinking...

99
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,062
and wanted us to discuss this issue today.

100
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:17,800
In my opinion, we should suspend club
activities until the cultural festival is over.

101
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,897
That makes sense to me.

102
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:23,322
Yeah, I guess... After all...

103
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,766
You should focus on the cultural festival until it's over.

104
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,259
Well then, I suppose we're done for today.

105
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,040
Okay.

106
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,585
We're sorry to interrupt you.

107
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,394
Ms. Hiratsuka told me before we came...

108
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,985
But I didn't know you guys were in the Service Club!

109
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,725
What a surprise this is!

110
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,509
Do you need something?

111
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:52,616
As you know, I took on the role
of planning committee chairman.

112
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,395
The problem is I'm not very confident...

113
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:58,312
So I would like your help to improve.

114
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,822
Your goal of personal growth...

115
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:05,390
I believe that your request for confidence
building somewhat deviates from your goal.

116
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:10,953
You're right about that, but I think the worst
thing to do would be to cause problems for everyone else.

117
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,541
I don't want to mess up, you know?

118
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:17,573
Besides, I think that working with someone
to achieve something is considered growth too.

119
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:23,782
So, to summarize, you're asking
me to help you, is that right?

120
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,106
Ah! That's it!

121
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,999
Oh? Then that sounds good to me.

122
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,578
Huh?

123
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,295
Since I'm on the planning committee as well.

124
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,889
I'll provide whatever help I can within that realm.

125
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:37,634
Wow, you will? Thank you so much!

126
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,587
All right!

127
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:50,290
I thought we were halting Service Club.

128
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,864
This is something I'm doing personally.

129
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:56,291
It's not something you two need to worry about.

130
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:57,430
But, usually...

131
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,739
This is how I do things.

132
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,483
Besides, I have a fair understanding of
the cultural festival planning committee.

133
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,787
It would just be more efficient
for me to do it this on my own.

134
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:10,300
Efficient, huh?

135
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,010
Well, I don't feel good about this at all!

136
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:36,520
Dammit, I just... I just...

137
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:40,016
Wait up. So what on Earth is wrong with you now?

138
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,081
I don't know! Gah!

139
00:09:45,934 --> 00:09:48,775
It's just, something feels off about this!

140
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:52,014
It's Yukinon. She usually isn't like that!

141
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:53,845
I guess you could be right.

142
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:55,446
Same goes for you!

143
00:09:56,366 --> 00:10:00,265
To be honest, I don't really feel
comfortable with what Sagami is doing either.

144
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,435
And then with Yukinon agreeing to her request...

145
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,474
and trying to be nice to her...

146
00:10:09,224 --> 00:10:11,444
I think I might actually like Yukinon

147
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,619
a whole lot more more than I thought.

148
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,429
Wow, did not know that you were a member of that team.

149
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:18,615
No! I didn't mean it that way!

150
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:22,932
You promised, remember? You said
you'd help Yukinon if there's trouble!

151
00:10:24,962 --> 00:10:26,533
Well, I will if I can...

152
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:30,052
You will? I already feel better.

153
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:33,322
<i>I'm not sure I like being trusted so unconditionally.</i>

154
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,708
Okay, I'm gonna head off to class now.

155
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:37,094
Good luck with everything!

156
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,436
Let's begin the meeting everyone.

157
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:44,016
Publicity, why don't you start
us all off with your report.

158
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:49,254
For the posters announcing the
festival, I'd say we're halfway done.

159
00:10:49,867 --> 00:10:52,191
Oh, really? Sounds like it's going well!

160
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:53,748
No, that's a bit slow.

161
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:54,994
Huh?

162
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:56,934
Do you know where you're gonna hang them?

163
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,616
What about the festival homepage, have you updated that?

164
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,160
Uh, not yet...

165
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,580
Okay. Well, please hurry. The posters can wait.

166
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:07,278
However, prospective students and their
parents check the school homepage regularly,

167
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:10,057
so it's important that it reflects current activities.

168
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,090
O-okay.

169
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:13,329
Sagami, moving on.

170
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:14,821
O-oh...

171
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:17,590
Okay then, volunteer coordinator go ahead.

172
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,745
Yes, uh... We currently have
ten volunteer groups participating.

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,055
Wow, it's gone up! Must be the Regional award.

174
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:26,101
Okay, next...

175
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:27,907
Is that within the school only?

176
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,931
Have you approached any locals yet?

177
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:35,869
As long as we're emphasizing our connection with local
residents, we must avoid a decline in their participation.

178
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:39,348
And please remember, submit a time table,

179
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,455
Summarizing the allotment of stage time

180
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:44,071
as well as staff assignments at the time of the opening.

181
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,770
Wow, you're so amazing!

182
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:51,813
Just what I expected from Haru's sister!

183
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:52,995
She's like a chairman.

184
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:55,387
Uh, no, don't confuse me with her...

185
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:57,107
I think she should just do it all.

186
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,951
Okay, up next is general records.

187
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,656
Be sure to submit the festival day schedule

188
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:06,831
as well as any equipment requests.

189
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,174
What... the hell?

190
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,411
Need an explanation?

191
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:23,397
Heh!

192
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,204
No way. I can't do it.

193
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,458
What?! Listen, if there was a Hayama
& Hachiman manga, it'd be a must-buy!

194
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,226
In fact, it's a must-gay!

195
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:35,141
<i>What the hell is she talking about?</i>

196
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,659
The scene opens with the prince making a move
on the sulky pilot with his warm innocent words...

197
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:43,028
Swoon!

198
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:45,239
Isn't that the whole appeal of this story?!

199
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,051
<i>It's not that kind of story.</i>

200
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,811
<i>You're gonna piss off the French.</i>

201
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,508
Well, I'm on the planning committee.

202
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:55,358
He's right. You need rehearsals
and stuff to put on a musical.

203
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,786
This really doesn't seem very realistic.

204
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:00,365
Oh, yeah... That's too bad...

205
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:02,172
Hey, how about this?

206
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,299
Maybe just take the whole thing and reconsider the story.

207
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,885
Like, who is the prince!

208
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,829
<i>So that was really his goal...</i>

209
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,199
Hmph!

210
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,025
It loses some of the sulky factor,

211
00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:17,931
but this should work nicely.

212
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,559
So you're saying I still have to be in this thing...

213
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,604
Oh! That sulky attitude is perfect!

214
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,674
{\an8}So, the only thing left to figure out are the costumes.

215
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:32,129
Ah, don't worry! We have Kawasaki!

216
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,056
Huh? You mean me?

217
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,504
I know about you!

218
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,817
You're the girl who's always altering
your uniforms and blazers, aren't you?

219
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,013
I can also tell your scrunchie's handmade!

220
00:13:41,038 --> 00:13:43,101
It's made by hand, by me...

221
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,158
I can also use a sewing machine too.

222
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:46,361
Welcome aboard!

223
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,695
This seems like it's going to be really hard for me...

224
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:52,332
Do you think I'm a good fit?

225
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:55,369
<i>I think you'll be perfect.</i>

226
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:57,475
Totsuka...

227
00:13:57,915 --> 00:13:59,981
Oh, well, see you later, Hachiman.

228
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:00,614
Sure.

229
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,356
<i>Guess I'll just have to do my part.</i>

230
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:06,883
That's too funny!

231
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:16,355
Sorry, I thought it was a good idea!

232
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:19,284
Especially since we don't have enough local volunteers,

233
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:21,301
I figured this was a good solution.

234
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:25,447
Did you know that in her third year,
your sister volunteered to play in a band?!

235
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:27,633
Ms. Hiratsuka was even a part of it!

236
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,803
It was so amazing...

237
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:31,664
I'm aware of that. I was watching.

238
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,015
Oh, stop the reminiscing, Meguri,
we were just having a bit of fun.

239
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,471
You don't mind this, do you, Yukino?

240
00:14:38,496 --> 00:14:42,826
I'm just wanting to make sure I do
everything I can for my adorable little sister.

241
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:43,479
Ah!

242
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,643
You can do whatever you want.

243
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:49,149
It's not my place to decide.

244
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,686
What do you mean?

245
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,114
I thought you were the planning committee's chairman.

246
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,731
Then who is the chairman?

247
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,742
Sorry I'm late!

248
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,787
I stopped in to check on my class and got delayed a bit!

249
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,289
Haruno, this is our current chairman.

250
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:05,295
Oh, hi! I'm Sagami.

251
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:08,476
Hmm...

252
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:14,466
The festival planning committee chairman was
late because she was checking on her class, hmm?

253
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,656
Uh, I was...

254
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,770
I think that is exactly how the chairman should be!

255
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,831
Someone who can really enjoy the cultural festival
to the fullest is best qualified to be the chairman.

256
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:29,017
Ah, thank you for saying that!

257
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:31,929
Sure! So I have a favor to ask of you, chairman.

258
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:35,604
I really want to participate as a festival volunteer.

259
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,874
But Yukino brushed me off...

260
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,853
That'd be great! We're actually short on volunteers.

261
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:46,176
Yay! Thanks so much!

262
00:15:46,784 --> 00:15:49,628
So does this take care of connecting with the locals?

263
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:54,061
Oh hey, it's Hikigaya!

264
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,453
Ya-hello there!

265
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,401
Well, I'm a little surprised. I didn't
think you were the type to join stuff like this.

266
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,762
Yeah... that's kinda what I thought too.

267
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:06,197
But speaking of surprises,

268
00:16:06,512 --> 00:16:09,029
wouldn't you say the same
thing might apply to your sister?

269
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:12,286
No, I expect her to do this sort of thing.

270
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:15,635
I mean, it must be hard for her to hang around the club

271
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,653
since I was the planning
committee chairman back in the day.

272
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,859
She has plenty of reasons for
wanting to be a part of this.

273
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,176
Hey, everyone, can I have your attention?

274
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,759
So, I've been giving this a lot of thought.

275
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:34,031
I believe a planning committee should
also be about enjoying the festival.

276
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:38,950
Like, we can't make other people have fun
if we're not having fun ourselves, right?

277
00:16:40,773 --> 00:16:43,132
I think we're making good progress with our plans,

278
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:45,558
and doing a good job keeping up in our classes.

279
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,827
With that, I think we should
slow down our work pace just a bit.

280
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,615
Sagami, I don't think you're
looking at this the right way.

281
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:54,293
We should be working ahead so we'll have a buffer-

282
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,191
Yeah, everyone worked too hard on their
parts back when I was the chairman, as well.

283
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:00,012
Yukinoshita...

284
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:03,176
I don't know what happened between you and your sister,

285
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,633
but shouldn't we learn from those who came before us?

286
00:17:05,873 --> 00:17:09,145
You should put your own feelings
aside and consider everyone else.

287
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:14,810
Wow, you sure seem to know what to say!

288
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:15,756
Right?

289
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:17,558
Hmph.

290
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:34,671
These, too, please.

291
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,541
Seems Sagami's suggestion was wrong.

292
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:45,255
I'm thinking I probably should've turned it down.

293
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:47,682
Sorry about this.

294
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,478
We're just going to have to share the work
amongst everyone or we won't finish in time.

295
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:53,812
Excuse me.

296
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,085
I'm here to submit a volunteer application.

297
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,358
Applications go in the back.

298
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:00,707
Okay, thanks.

299
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:01,875
Hm?

300
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:06,526
Do you have enough help here?

301
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,469
I'm not exactly sure where things stand overall.

302
00:18:09,873 --> 00:18:12,720
We already have our hands full
just managing our own posts.

303
00:18:13,462 --> 00:18:14,992
What do you mean your posts?

304
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,918
My post is general records.

305
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:18,720
Oh... Makes sense.

306
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:20,504
<i>Are you trying to pick a fight?</i>

307
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:22,437
But from what I can see here,

308
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,689
{\an8}it looks like Yukinoshita is doing most of the work.

309
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:30,488
It's just more efficient this way.

310
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,683
Yeah, but you're about to fall apart.

311
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:38,586
You should really rely on others before it comes to that.

312
00:18:42,198 --> 00:18:43,137
I'll want to help.

313
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:47,141
I can handle the volunteer coordination.

314
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,498
Just call me the volunteer representative. Sound good?

315
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,544
He's actually right, you know...

316
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,957
You've gotta be able to rely on others sometimes.

317
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,167
At times like this, even Haru would...

318
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:08,892
<i>Neither Hayama nor Meguri are incorrect,</i>

319
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:11,654
<i>but they're also not entirely correct in this situation.</i>

320
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:14,342
<i>They're great. I'm moved.</i>

321
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,628
<i>What heartwarming camaraderie.</i>

322
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:20,789
<i>But is doing things alone really a bad thing?</i>

323
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,055
<i>Collaboration isn't a guarantee.</i>

324
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:26,707
<i>So why should someone who's always
worked hard on their own be denied?</i>

325
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,950
<i>I can't allow that to happen here.</i>

326
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:37,122
I...

327
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:39,041
Maybe relying on others is important,

328
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,605
but relying on others is all you
people ever wanna do around here.

329
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:48,763
Oh! Well, more specifically I was talking about me, okay?

330
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:52,764
I mean like, people who come and just
feel they can dump all their work on me.

331
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,626
I don't get to relax, and I know that can't be helped...

332
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:56,621
Therefore...

333
00:19:57,503 --> 00:20:00,995
I don't think it'd be fair to let
anyone else here take it easy either.

334
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,131
Ok then, you're really terrible.

335
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:06,784
Hey, I can help you too.

336
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:14,084
It does look like a lot of the
record keeping has shifted to you.

337
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:17,159
I'll rethink the workload allocations.

338
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,825
As for relying on the help of others,

339
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,071
Shiromeguri has made her thoughts clear.

340
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,306
I gratefully accept it.

341
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,142
I'm sorry, everyone.

342
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,466
Great! We're almost there!

343
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,296
Push hard, and do our best!

344
00:20:36,729 --> 00:20:38,309
Sorry I'm late, everyone!

345
00:20:38,374 --> 00:20:41,681
Oh, hi, Hayama! What are you doing here?

346
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:44,899
Oh, hey there. So, were you off with the class just now?

347
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,143
Yeah, I was!

348
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,173
Sagami.

349
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:47,844
Ah?

350
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,717
These need your approval.

351
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,689
I've already gone through them
all and corrected the errors.

352
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:55,922
Okay. Thanks.

353
00:20:56,935 --> 00:21:00,710
Actually, I'll just give you
my seal, so you can stamp them.

354
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,997
I want to delegate this to you. Here.

355
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,077
Okay...

356
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:12,096
No problem. I'll go ahead and
do all the approving from now on.

357
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:16,216
The day goes by so fast when you're having so much fun!

358
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:18,757
Thanks for your hard work, everyone!

359
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:20,586
Yeah! Thank you, everyone!

360
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:42,264
Huh? That's not the normal noises I usually hear in there.

361
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:43,492
You actually sound tired.

362
00:21:54,887 --> 00:21:56,748
Hm? Hey, Hikigaya,

363
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,281
do you know where Yukinon is?

364
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,061
No.

365
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:06,295
Yukinoshita is out. She called in sick today.

366
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:07,596
Huh?

367
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,750
I didn't understand anything!

368
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:48,462
I shouldn't have been deceived by his words.

369
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,237
It's just that he smelled so
nice, and he was always shining.

370
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,150
You couldn't help it. You're still so young.

371
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,735
You just didn't know how to love him yet.

372
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:02,472
Buh! Gah!

373
00:24:03,906 --> 00:24:10,666
Next time: "And So the Curtain on Each Stage Rises,
and the Festival is Festivaling as Hard as It Can."
