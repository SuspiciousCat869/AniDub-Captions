1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,736
<i>One day...</i>

2
00:00:08,444 --> 00:00:09,781
<i>Two days...</i>

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,659
<i>Two months isn't nearly long enough!</i>

4
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:50,059
There's no way break's over. I must be counting wrong?

5
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:50,699
Huh?

6
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,990
Wow, your phones gotta be broken.

7
00:02:23,725 --> 00:02:26,908
There's no way. I haven't used
this phone nearly enough to break it.

8
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:28,628
Woof! Woof!

9
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,807
I guess that means you're the one who's broken.

10
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,865
Oh, maybe it's Yui! Coming!

11
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,358
Thanks so much!

12
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:42,413
He wasn't any trouble, was he?

13
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:46,132
Not at all! We had a ton of fun. He was no bother.

14
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:49,158
You and Sable should come over again sometime, okay?

15
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,506
Thanks, Komachi I'd love to come back and hang out!

16
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:54,154
That'd be great! Come when our parents are here.

17
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,469
You can bring some sweets and introduce yourself!

18
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:58,773
Sure, I can do that. I should come and meet your...

19
00:02:58,843 --> 00:02:59,889
What?! Uh...

20
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,660
Actually, thanks for the invite,
but I think I'll just pass on that!

21
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:05,539
Anyways, please come and visit us again, okay?

22
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,416
I'll be waiting for you guys!

23
00:03:07,466 --> 00:03:09,998
Okay, thanks again. See ya.

24
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:15,039
Hm?

25
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,702
So there's a fireworks show. Would you wanna go?

26
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,938
Consider it my way of thanking
you for watching Sable today!

27
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,408
There's a fireworks show?

28
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,667
Are you talking about the big one that's coming up?

29
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,066
Mm-hmm. Uh...

30
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,170
You heard her, Komachi. We should go.

31
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:33,107
Ah?

32
00:03:33,786 --> 00:03:37,208
Ugh... I swear, this is why you're the worst at life...

33
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:41,447
Ahh, I'm so happy you invited
me to join you for the show...

34
00:03:41,811 --> 00:03:44,475
but I'm supposed to be studying for entrance exams.

35
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,702
So as much as you want to thank
me, now might not be the best time.

36
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,190
Oh right. I forgot about those.

37
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,785
Yeah, I'm sorry... Hold on!

38
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:57,457
You know, there are a few things
I've been dying to go out and get!

39
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:01,403
But I just don't have time to
go by myself. What can I do?!

40
00:04:01,428 --> 00:04:05,577
And there are so many things on my list that I
don't think you could carry them all by yourself...

41
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:07,774
Ah... Yes, that's it! Hikki!

42
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:11,270
Let's go so I can buy what's on
Komachi's list and thank her properly.

43
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:13,930
And as I think about it, she's
done a lot for you, as well.

44
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,882
Oh... I... uh, well...

45
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,784
Boy, I sure would be worried if you
had to go to the fireworks show alone!

46
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,442
It's really such a dangerous world out there these days.

47
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,434
Oh, if only we knew a guy with some time on his hands!

48
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,648
You know? Huh?

49
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:38,219
Huh?

50
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:49,880
Oh!

51
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,469
Whoa! Whoa, Yui, are you okay?

52
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,603
I had so much to do, I didn't
realize I was running so late...

53
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:00,321
Don't worry about it. Honestly, it's no big deal at all.

54
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,061
So, um...

55
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,023
That yukata's nice.

56
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,647
Oh, uh, thanks, Hikki.

57
00:05:13,342 --> 00:05:14,826
Anyways, ready to go?

58
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,143
Yeah!

59
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,198
So, the fireworks show, huh...

60
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:26,816
Firewo...

61
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:30,967
I don't understand why we didn't meet at the venue.

62
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,294
There are just so many people there I
figured it'd be too hard to find each other.

63
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,446
You have a cell phone...

64
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,230
Sometimes it doesn't connect well.

65
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,282
Besides, there's just no spice in us meeting at the venue.

66
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:44,306
What the hell do you need "spice" for?

67
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,846
We're not seasoning seaweed.

68
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:48,681
What the heck does it matter? You got a problem here?

69
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:49,975
No, I don't.

70
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:51,761
Oh!

71
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:55,276
I'm sorry...

72
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,660
Well... it is crowded...

73
00:05:58,244 --> 00:05:59,362
<i>That was dangerous.</i>

74
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:01,361
<i>If I were a normal male,</i>

75
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,061
<i>I would've fallen in love with her right there.</i>

76
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:08,155
<i>Trying to find meaning in simple
coincidences and ordinary happenings</i>

77
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,023
<i>is something unpopular guys do way too often.</i>

78
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,220
<i>I don't believe in fate, destiny, or chance.</i>

79
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,661
So, the fireworks are starting at 7:30, right?

80
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,524
Looks like we've got time to kill.

81
00:06:32,651 --> 00:06:33,936
Should we just go home?

82
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:38,065
We're not going home! How the heck can
you say that with such a straight face?

83
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:41,418
Anyways, Komachi emailed me that list of stuff she wants.

84
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,936
Let's see, I've got it here.

85
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,568
<i>What's with that last one?</i>

86
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:49,773
<i>God, she's so embarrassing...</i>

87
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:54,214
'Kay, how about if we just walk around, then?

88
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:55,761
Sure!

89
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:12,866
<i>I can't believe how unnecessarily considerate Komachi is.</i>

90
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:17,198
<i>I'm not so dense that I can't see
that this is a very obvious step.</i>

91
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:19,636
<i>Actually, I'm quite perceptive...</i>

92
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:22,791
<i>oversensitive, and excessively responsive.</i>

93
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:29,488
<i>80% of guys in the world live with the thought,
"I think she likes me," constantly on their minds.</i>

94
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:33,893
<i>And that's exactly why a guy
needs to be able to caution himself,</i>

95
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:35,735
<i>and say, "No way that's possible."</i>

96
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,363
Hey! So what do you think we should eat first?

97
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:40,556
Cotton candy? Candy apples?

98
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,426
I'm pretty sure those weren't on her list.

99
00:07:42,451 --> 00:07:44,103
Then what do you think we should get first?

100
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,396
We should probably start with one.
That'll still be okay at room temperature.

101
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,936
Which definitely means the cotton ca...

102
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:50,049
Oh, what's that?!

103
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:58,612
Wow, look at all this! There's expensive stuff in here!

104
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:00,481
Yeah. You can't win those though.

105
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,815
Take it from me, I know.

106
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,276
What? But the strings are attached to them!

107
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:06,841
Huh, whadda ya know. You're right, they are.

108
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,156
But who knows what the other end is attached to?

109
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,082
Wow! I remember this stuff!

110
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:14,853
Hey, look, it's Yui!

111
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:17,079
Hi!

112
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:18,923
Hey! Sagamin!

113
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,548
Excuse me. I'll take one of these.

114
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:26,138
Oh, hey! It's been so long since I've seen you!

115
00:08:26,163 --> 00:08:26,791
I know, it feels like ages and ages!

116
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:30,531
<i>At times like this, it's best to
lay low and blend into the background.</i>

117
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,878
<i>Remember my part as a tree in the grade school play.</i>

118
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:36,158
<i>Put on my glass mask.</i>

119
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,690
So, are you here with someone?

120
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,562
Oh, yeah. Actually, I'm here
with Hikigaya, he's from our class.

121
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:44,757
Hey.

122
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,005
Meet Sagami Minami. She's from our class as well, Hikki.

123
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:49,025
Huh...

124
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:54,054
Oh, wow, look at you... So you two came here together?

125
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:56,944
I'm just here seeing the fireworks
with a bunch of girlfriends tonight.

126
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:59,721
You're so lucky! I wanna dive into a youthful romance!

127
00:08:59,746 --> 00:09:02,882
You're making it sound like you're
watching a swim meet or something.

128
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:05,473
Seriously, I promise you we're not
like that. We're just school friends!

129
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:07,249
<i>Wow, things just got awkward.</i>

130
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:11,385
<i>Looks like I've become the subject of
this impromptu lady's gossip session...</i>

131
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,880
<i>As the man who brought the girl,
you become a possible alpha male..</i>

132
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,763
<i>For example, if I had been Hayama,</i>

133
00:09:18,521 --> 00:09:20,724
<i>their reactions would have been completely different.</i>

134
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:24,270
<i>Yuigahama would be the one
called for tonight's hero interview.</i>

135
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:28,809
<i>However, I'm the kind of guy who would
be judged by default at a court-martial.</i>

136
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,306
Yui, I'm gonna run...

137
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,517
There's a line for yakisoba, so I'm gonna get in it.

138
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:34,463
Oh, I'll be right there.

139
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:36,664
Okay, here you go.

140
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,462
Be careful, young man, its very hot!

141
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:44,366
So sorry.

142
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:49,586
Candy apple.

143
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:50,538
Huh?

144
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,646
You wanted one, right?

145
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,782
Oh yeah! You're right! I totally want one!

146
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,815
Hey, I'll give you half of mine if you want.

147
00:09:59,046 --> 00:09:59,907
No thanks.

148
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:23,606
Seems like we made it to a spot where
there aren't as many people around,

149
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,453
but it's still pretty crowded here.

150
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:27,500
If I'd known it would be this crowded here,

151
00:10:27,525 --> 00:10:30,906
I would've brought along a blanket or
something like that so we could sit down.

152
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:31,750
Hm?

153
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:33,982
Hm? Why'd you stop?

154
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,996
I'm surprised, Hikki, you can be thoughtful.

155
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:40,330
Huh? Don't be such a moron! I'm super thoughtful.

156
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:45,247
Let me tell you something, I hang quietly in
corners not bothering anyone because I'm so thoughtful.

157
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:47,797
That's not what I meant at all.

158
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:52,633
Well, what I really mean is,
I suppose you're actually nice.

159
00:10:52,674 --> 00:10:54,435
Wow, so I see you've noticed.

160
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,545
That's right. I am quite nice considering

161
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:58,210
all of the things that've happened to me,

162
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,744
but I've been able to carry on without
taking revenge on anyone for anything.

163
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:03,859
You see, if I were just a normal person...

164
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:07,842
the world would have ended long ago, so
really I'm a bit of a savior, in a way.

165
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,586
Normal people don't have that much stuff happen to them...

166
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:18,130
Wow!

167
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,840
This is a paid admission area.

168
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,901
Hey there! Over here, Hikigaya!

169
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,714
Huh?

170
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:34,202
I'm just here representing my father,
and I got bored just saying hello to people.

171
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:37,396
I'm so glad you came out as well, Hikigaya.

172
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,262
Yeah...

173
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:41,378
They call this the VIP area.

174
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:43,176
Most people can't get in here.

175
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,580
So, you're famous...

176
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,940
Sure. It's because of my father.

177
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:49,666
His work has a lot of influence at these local events.

178
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:51,705
But that's not important.

179
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,173
Cheating isn't very nice, you know.

180
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:56,426
Yeah, I'm not out here cheating.

181
00:11:56,796 --> 00:11:58,106
Is this serious, then?

182
00:11:58,443 --> 00:12:00,247
Well, that's even more unforgivable, Hikki!

183
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:02,004
Let go! Let go! Ow!

184
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,424
Listen, it's not serious, okay?!

185
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:05,665
Uh, its not...

186
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,216
You're, um...

187
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,197
Oh, I know! You're something-gahama, right?

188
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,552
It's Yuigahama.

189
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,748
Oh, that's right, sorry.

190
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:16,718
Yukinon isn't with you today. Why's that?

191
00:12:16,851 --> 00:12:19,632
Oh, you know Yukino, she'd just rather stay at home.

192
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:22,638
As the older sister, it's my job to attend these events.

193
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,638
It's been our mother's policy forever.

194
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:28,210
Our mother can be really tough
and scary, so I don't say no.

195
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:30,660
Huh? More so than Yukinoshita?

196
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:33,024
What! You think Yukino is scary?

197
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:38,573
That's rude, Hikigaya!

198
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:41,062
You really feel that way about such a cute girl?

199
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,952
Our mother is much scarier than me.

200
00:12:45,257 --> 00:12:46,909
Is she actually even human?

201
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:51,441
She makes all the decisions and
then tries to force everyone to follow.

202
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:53,833
All I can do is compromise with her.

203
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:57,472
But Yukino isn't good at that kind of thing.

204
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,082
So, you guys were out on a date, huh?

205
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,826
I'm really sorry if I interrupted.

206
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:03,919
No, don't worry...

207
00:13:04,128 --> 00:13:06,172
You didn't at all. It's not like that...

208
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:08,922
That shy reaction makes me suspicious here.

209
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,759
And so, if this really was a date tonight...

210
00:13:12,937 --> 00:13:14,305
I'm afraid Yukino

211
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:16,544
has lost her chance to be chosen.

212
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:28,100
Uh...

213
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:29,994
Tell me, Yukinoshita...

214
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:32,859
Hm? If you're actually referring to me, call me Haruno.

215
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:35,619
Actually, "Big Sister" works too. Yes, call me that!

216
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,855
So, tell me, Yukinoshita...

217
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,666
You really are a stubborn one...

218
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,199
which is what makes you cute.

219
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:46,911
You graduated from our high school
not too long ago, isn't that right?

220
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:50,641
Yup, I'm three years older, so
it was before you guys got there.

221
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:54,031
And now I'm attending the science
university right here in town.

222
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:58,347
Wow, that's so cool you and Yukinon
are following the same career path.

223
00:13:59,250 --> 00:13:59,842
Hm?

224
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:06,816
Yes. Yukino wants to go study science at a public school.

225
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,100
Things haven't really changed at all...

226
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,634
Always matching... Always hand-me-downs.

227
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:18,582
So, um, not to be nosey, but do
you feel that you hate Yukinon?

228
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,085
Oh my goodness! Of course I don't. That's absurd!

229
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,429
I love Yukino. I could never hate her.

230
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:29,701
There's just no way I wouldn't adore my little
sister who's always chased after me her whole life.

231
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:32,553
But I want to hear what you have to say, Yuigahama?

232
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:34,069
Do you like Yukino?

233
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,622
I do, actually!

234
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,667
She's so amazing and honest, cool and reliable!

235
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:41,921
Sometimes she does these really
silly things, but they're cute!

236
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:45,546
I don't always understand her,
but she's very kind... and...

237
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:50,470
I'm really going way overboard, aren't I? Sorry!

238
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:52,958
No! I'm so glad to hear that.

239
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:56,170
Everyone says things like that about her at first.

240
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:59,649
But in the end, people always wind
up jealous of her and reject her.

241
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,095
It hurts every time.

242
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,906
I really hope it's different this time.

243
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:07,656
That's terrible. I'd never do that.

244
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:08,091
Oh!

245
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:11,354
And, what about you, Hikki?

246
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:13,465
You like my little sister, right?

247
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:16,905
Actually, my mom taught me not
to be picky about food or people.

248
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,701
Well, that's it. The fireworks are over.

249
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,671
I'm heading home now to beat the crowd.

250
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,420
Do you think we should head out too?

251
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:32,988
Sure. I guess so.

252
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:39,608
I can give you guys a ride if you guys want.

253
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,610
Uh... well, uh...

254
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:55,675
No matter how much you stare, there
aren't any scratches left or anything.

255
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,203
Uh... Oh, I'm guessing Yukino didn't tell you?

256
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:01,354
Oh no, maybe I shouldn't have said that...

257
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:03,388
So, it really was the...

258
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,005
But please, don't go and get the wrong idea!

259
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,258
It honestly wasn't Yukino's fault at all.

260
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:10,459
She was just a passenger on her way to school.

261
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,461
She wasn't doing anything wrong when it happened.

262
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:14,818
So, it's okay now, right, Hikigaya?

263
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,962
Uh? Yup, that's right!

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,981
There's no way that she could've possibly
caused that crash. I have no doubt she's innocent.

265
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:24,266
Besides, it's all over now.

266
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:27,078
I really try not to dwell on the past too much.

267
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:30,921
Plus, my life'd be pretty dark, if
I sat and dwelled on every bad thing.

268
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,368
So, I'm over it...

269
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,749
That's great. If it's over I
guess it doesn't matter anymore.

270
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,099
Well, we're gonna head on home now.

271
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:42,951
I'll see you guys later!

272
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,216
So, um...

273
00:16:56,273 --> 00:16:57,939
Yukinon tell you anything?

274
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:59,673
No, she said nothing.

275
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:00,781
Oh...

276
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,268
Was it okay for you to get off here?

277
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,796
It wouldn't have felt right if that's
where our conversation was cut off.

278
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,290
It felt kinda intentional? What sort of timing was that?

279
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:29,418
What?! Of course it wasn't intentional!

280
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:30,984
I just didn't know how to bring it up.

281
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,181
I'll walk you partway.

282
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:35,269
Thank you.

283
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:39,961
So did she say anything to you?

284
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,047
Mm-mm.

285
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:45,173
But I think there are some
things you don't know how to say.

286
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:48,094
And if you miss your chance, it's hard to get back.

287
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:50,167
I'm having the same problem.

288
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:53,343
I think it'd be better to just stay in the dark.

289
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,277
Huh?

290
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,305
You know, we shouldn't bring up stuff
that Yukinoshita doesn't want to talk about.

291
00:18:01,774 --> 00:18:04,361
Do you really think it is better to not know?

292
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:07,686
To be honest I don't think
not knowing is such a bad thing.

293
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:11,421
I feel like the more you know, the
more trouble tends to end up at your feet.

294
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:14,771
I know, but for me I just wanna know more.

295
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:18,544
I just wish I knew you better. I
really want us all to be closer.

296
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,968
If something's wrong I want us to help each other!

297
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:30,329
Hikki, if Yukinon is ever in any
trouble, will you please help her out?

298
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:32,757
Doubt it, I don't think that'll ever happen.

299
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:36,158
<i>Yukinoshita would neither get
into trouble nor ask for help.</i>

300
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,245
<i>And I wouldn't butt in, either.</i>

301
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,003
I'm sure you would help her.

302
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:43,350
Sorry, you don't actually know that.

303
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,525
Not true. You helped me out when I needed it, didn't you?

304
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:50,325
I already told you, I didn't help
you out knowing it was you, okay?

305
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:53,006
It just happened that way. Don't expect it.

306
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:57,159
Even without the accident, I think
you would have still helped me out.

307
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,938
And I believe we would've gone to
see the fireworks just like this.

308
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,402
Yeah, I doubt that.

309
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,369
I mean, what would I even help you with?

310
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,918
Oh... Remember what you said?

311
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:11,006
Even without the accident, you'd still have been alone.

312
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,392
And you know how I am, so...

313
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:16,789
I still would've been brought to
the Service Club with my problems.

314
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,359
And I still I would've met you.

315
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:25,005
And I'm pretty sure you would've come up with
one of your stupid, bizarre solutions and saved me.

316
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,679
At least I like to think that.

317
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:28,480
And then, I...

318
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:32,918
Well then, I...

319
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,382
I mean, I'm pretty sure that I'd...

320
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:42,634
What I mean is...

321
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:43,919
Maybe you better answer that?

322
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:50,729
It's just my mom checking on me.

323
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:51,759
Hi, Mom.

324
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:53,532
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

325
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:54,808
Yeah, I'm close to home.

326
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,101
Yeah.

327
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,491
What? You don't have to! I'll be home soon!

328
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,350
Bye!

329
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:05,149
Uh, my house is close, so I'll be fine from here.

330
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:06,678
Thanks for walking me though.

331
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:08,577
See ya later!

332
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:09,631
You sure?

333
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,841
Yeah. I had a great time tonight.

334
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,347
It feels like it's been ages!

335
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,951
Nah, you know how it is!

336
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,420
It was like a summer experience! You know, an adventure!

337
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:42,387
Well, long time no see.

338
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:50,016
Yeah, it's been a while.

339
00:20:51,382 --> 00:20:53,189
I hear you ran into my sister.

340
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:54,952
Yeah, by chance.

341
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:01,688
So, uh, are we starting the club back up today?

342
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,780
Y-yes, at least that was the plan.

343
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,745
Got it. See you later, then.

344
00:21:12,978 --> 00:21:14,071
<i>I like myself.</i>

345
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:17,152
<i>And have never once felt the need to hate myself.</i>

346
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:23,151
<i>My high grades, my half-decent looks,
my pessimistic, realist point of view...</i>

347
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,568
<i>I don't hate any of it at all.</i>

348
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,980
<i>But for the first time, I think I could hate myself.</i>

349
00:21:30,453 --> 00:21:32,306
<i>The Yukino I've seen all this time...</i>

350
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:37,147
<i>was always beautiful. So pure, and never told a lie.</i>

351
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:40,251
<i>She could stand on her own
feet even with nobody to lean on.</i>

352
00:21:40,723 --> 00:21:44,011
<i>I'm pretty sure I always admired her for those attributes.</i>

353
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:48,555
<i>I forced my own expectations and ideals on her,</i>

354
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,054
<i>let myself think I understood her,</i>

355
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,613
<i>and let myself be disappointed.</i>

356
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:55,963
<i>I've even cautioned myself against this...</i>

357
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,003
<i>but I still haven't gotten over it.</i>

358
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,757
<i>Even Yukino can tell lies.</i>

359
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:04,580
<i>I couldn't even accept such
an obvious fact, and for that...</i>

360
00:22:05,372 --> 00:22:06,029
<i>I...</i>

361
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:08,757
<i>hate myself.</i>

362
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,236
I think we should suspend club activities
until the cultural festival is over.

363
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:48,457
What? No way! Me, I don't think I could do it!

364
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:53,608
Someone who can really enjoy the cultural festival
to the fullest is best qualified to be the chairman.

365
00:23:53,827 --> 00:23:56,370
I might actually like Yukinon more than I thought.

366
00:23:56,674 --> 00:24:00,137
Okay, just a little more. Let's do our best!

367
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:04,429
Yukinoshita, you should put your own
feelings aside and consider everyone else..

368
00:24:04,802 --> 00:24:10,432
Next time: "The Distance Between Them Remains
Unchanged as the Festival is Becoming a Carnival."
