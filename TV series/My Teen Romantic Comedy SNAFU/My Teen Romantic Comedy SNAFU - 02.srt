1
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:06,361
<i>It is in the nature of animals to live in groups.</i>

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,909
Hm?

3
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,773
<i>Carnivores maintain a hierarchy.</i>

4
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:16,029
<i>Those who don't become the alpha must
shoulder that stress their entire lives.</i>

5
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:16,892
Heh.

6
00:00:17,132 --> 00:00:19,531
Whoa! For real? What is this?!

7
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:20,872
That is so cool, dude!

8
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:22,937
<i>And herbivores surely feel the dilemma of</i>

9
00:00:22,962 --> 00:00:27,364
<i>sacrificing their peers in order to
survive attacks from their natural enemies.</i>

10
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,301
This is totally awesome!

11
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,065
Can I borrow it for a sec?

12
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,988
Uh, yeah... Sure.

13
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:37,714
<i>This is why living in groups is
of no benefit to the individual.</i>

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,250
<i>As such, I choose to take the path of
the bear, which never lives in groups.</i>

15
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:48,453
<i>Bears are known for being solitary creatures
that feel no insecurity in having to living alone.</i>

16
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:52,221
<i>Better yet, they get to hibernate.</i>

17
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,142
<i>How awesome is that?</i>

18
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:58,715
<i>If I were to be reborn, I would
definitely want to be a bear.</i>

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,699
You gave some serious props to bears.

20
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:40,730
I thought you were supposed
to be a modern Japanese teacher.

21
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:43,177
I'm supposed to give you "life guidance."

22
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:46,116
That's why the biology teacher
told me to assign this theme.

23
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:49,850
So, which part of this is about
"the ecology of wild animals"?

24
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:53,516
It's a powerful antithesis on
the social habits of wild animals.

25
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:55,159
Seriously, cut the crap.

26
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:58,858
You make it sound like living
in groups is some sort of sin.

27
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,956
But you live alone yourself,
and are, in fact, single, so...

28
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:07,574
Anyway, did that request for help go well?

29
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:11,677
Yeah, well... she seemed satisfied with our services.

30
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,448
Um, speaking of...

31
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,313
What's with that showdown you talked about the other day?

32
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:17,922
Oh, that thing?

33
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,570
Don't you worry about it.

34
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,789
I'll be passing my own one-sided judgment on the outcome.

35
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,733
It's all locked up in here.

36
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:27,139
Oh, and by the way,

37
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:29,334
what's your opinion of Yukino?

38
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:29,872
Hm?

39
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,687
Don't like her.

40
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:33,171
I see.

41
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,094
She's a very bright student, if you ask me.

42
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,551
But, those who have more than others
carry their own burdens in their own way.

43
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,552
She's actually very sweet.

44
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,814
Sweet and sometimes, she's right.

45
00:03:46,669 --> 00:03:48,888
But the rest of the world is neither sweet nor right.

46
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,888
Must be hard for her.

47
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:53,972
You're both such troubling kids...

48
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,408
It just makes me worried that you'll
have trouble adapting to society.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,729
It makes me want to bring you together in one place.

50
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:02,613
What is that room, a sanatorium?

51
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,184
Yeah, maybe!

52
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:07,039
But I think you kids are fun to watch together.

53
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,111
So maybe I just want to keep you two close by.

54
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,736
<i>Normally, I have the best place to eat lunch
alone, without having to worry about people...</i>

55
00:04:23,123 --> 00:04:25,689
<i>But when it's raining like this, I have nowhere to go.</i>

56
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,406
Aww, Hayato...

57
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:31,091
I can't go today. I have my club.

58
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:33,273
Couldn't you skip just for one day?

59
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:36,701
There's a great deal on double
scoops at Forty-One Flavors today.

60
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,620
I want a chocolate and chocolat one.

61
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:40,438
Those are both chocolate!

62
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:41,732
Yeah, he's right.

63
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,797
They're totally different! And I'm really hungry!

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,942
Sorry, I'll have to pass.

65
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:50,173
Besides that, you'll live to
regret it if you eat too much.

66
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,969
Yeah, well I don't gain weight, no matter how much I eat.

67
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:55,842
Yeah, you totally look like a super model, Yumiko!

68
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:57,777
Your legs are gorgeous!

69
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,656
So anyway, I just, uh...

70
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,724
You think so?

71
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,936
But that Yukinoshita girl looks
even more amazing, doesn't she?

72
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:06,308
Yeah, that Yukinon sure is amazing...

73
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,255
"Yukinon"?

74
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,194
Oh, well, you're way more glamorous, Yumiko!

75
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:15,726
Oh, why not? I can go with you after my club.

76
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:18,773
Okay, Hayato. Send me a text.

77
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:22,308
<i>Damn, that looks really rough.</i>

78
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,436
<i>Are they a feudal society or what?</i>

79
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,218
<i>If you have to kiss up to
people that much to feel complete,</i>

80
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:29,337
<i>I'd rather fly solo forever.</i>

81
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:34,711
Well, I, uh...

82
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:37,142
I've got somewhere to go during lunch.

83
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:38,237
Yeah? Good.

84
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,605
Then could you pick up some of that lemon tea I like?

85
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:43,384
Silly me forgot to bring a drink today.

86
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:47,529
Uh, but the problem is I won't
be back here until fifth period...

87
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:51,431
I'll be gone for all of lunch, so I
don't know if I can possibly bring it...

88
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:52,386
Huh?

89
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,332
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,549
You know you haven't been very sociable lately, Yui.

91
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:02,485
Well, you might just have to say
it's kind of out of my hands for now...

92
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,538
I hate to let personal matters take me away, but...

93
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:07,351
That doesn't tell me anything. Just say it straight.

94
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:08,799
We're friends, aren't we?

95
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:09,952
Sorry.

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,751
I told you, "sorry" doesn't cut it.

97
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:14,893
There's something you want to say, isn't there?

98
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,561
<i>Idiotic.</i>

99
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:18,787
<i>Go ahead, tear down your own friend.</i>

100
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:26,734
<i>It's not like I have any desire to actually help her out,</i>

101
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:30,216
<i>but when I see a girl I know
looking like she's about to cry,</i>

102
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,627
<i>my stomach twists up and nothing tastes good.</i>

103
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:36,506
<i>Besides, it's my job to get attacked by people, not hers.</i>

104
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:39,534
<i>I can't just let her take crap like that.</i>

105
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:44,459
Hey, how about...

106
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,470
Back off!

107
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:50,971
H-how about I go and get myself
something cold to drink right now!

108
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,221
Or maybe I'll just sit down instead.

109
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:53,628
There.

110
00:06:54,444 --> 00:06:55,301
Oh, yeah?

111
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:57,338
Let me say this for your sake.

112
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:01,123
That indecisive attitude of
yours is really getting annoying.

113
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,545
Sorry...

114
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:03,831
That again?

115
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,016
All you've been doing is apologizing.

116
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,736
You're apologizing to the wrong person, Yuigahama.

117
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:13,633
Listen, Yuigahama...

118
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:17,003
If you're going to invite me yourself
and then not even bother to show,

119
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,047
I have to wonder what that says about you.

120
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:22,961
If you're going to be late, isn't it
common courtesy to at least text me?

121
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:24,168
Oh, sorry!

122
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,971
Please forgive me, but I don't have your cell number.

123
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:30,421
Oh, right. Then I guess it's not entirely your fault.

124
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:32,656
I'm sorry. I'll let it go this time around.

125
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,489
Hey, wait a minute!

126
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:36,757
You and I are not finished talking this out!

127
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:37,550
Talking?

128
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,876
You consider what you're doing having a conversation, wow.

129
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,244
It appeared to me like you were
just forcing your opinions on her.

130
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:44,811
Huh?!

131
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,821
I'm sorry I didn't understand.

132
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,149
I'm not well-versed in the
ecosystem you all seem to live in.

133
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,212
Sorry. I thought you were an ape trying to intimidate me.

134
00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:57,322
It's fine if you want to play king
of the mountain and try to look tough,

135
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,766
but please keep it confined to your own territory.

136
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:03,491
Your bluff will soon rub off, just like your cheap makeup.

137
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:07,000
Huh? What are you talking about? That makes no sense.

138
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,566
Okay, okay...

139
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:10,627
That's enough, Yukinoshita.

140
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:14,079
You, too, Yumiko.

141
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:15,868
Hmph!

142
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:21,741
I'll go on ahead, okay?

143
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,541
Ah?

144
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:25,991
Right! Thank you! I'm coming.

145
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:30,571
I'm gonna go get a drink.

146
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,176
Yeah, me, too! Later!

147
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:33,900
I think I'll go to the restroom...

148
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,852
Oh, I need to go take care of that!

149
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,024
<i>I'll have to ride this big wave, too.</i>

150
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:42,218
<i>If the mood gets any more serious
in here, I'll suffocate and die.</i>

151
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:44,995
Thank you for that, Hikki...

152
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:47,452
I mean, for standing up for me back there.

153
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,442
Huh?

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,552
Hm?

155
00:08:58,727 --> 00:09:00,959
I'm sorry. It's just...

156
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:03,445
I feel uneasy when I don't go along.

157
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:05,929
Like, I end up trying to read the room or something.

158
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,272
I've always been like that, you know?

159
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:11,145
When we played house, I wanted to be the mother,

160
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,809
but if someone else wanted to do it, I'd be the dog.

161
00:09:14,126 --> 00:09:16,725
It might be because I grew up in a housing complex.

162
00:09:17,106 --> 00:09:19,647
I have no idea what you're trying to babble on about.

163
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,738
You're right. I'm not really sure I know either...

164
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:26,471
But, um, watching Hikki and Yukinon made me think...

165
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:29,343
They say what they think and
pick up on each other's moods,

166
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,154
and they seem to have fun
without trying to match each other.

167
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:33,696
They just seem right.

168
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:42,413
So I thought, maybe I was wrong to try
so hard to get along with everyone else.

169
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:46,036
I mean, Hikki is totally reclusive, right?

170
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:50,568
He pretends to sleep during breaks and
laughs while he reads books, and it's so creepy.

171
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:52,648
Heh. I thought you only did that in the club.

172
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,492
Didn't know you did that weird laugh in class, too.

173
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:59,196
Well, that really is creepy, so you should probably stop.

174
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,115
If you'd noticed it, then say something.

175
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:04,509
No way. I don't want to talk to you
when you're being all creepy like that.

176
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:08,223
And, well... that's the whole story.

177
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,931
I mean it's not that I don't like you or anything, Yumiko.

178
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:14,486
So, um, do you think we can still try to be friends?

179
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,823
Well... Sure.

180
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:19,800
I guess we can.

181
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,611
Sorry. Thank you.

182
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,478
Perfect... she can actually say it.

183
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,666
What are you doing here, Hikki?

184
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:35,464
Were you listening?

185
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:37,004
L-listening to what?

186
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,075
You were!

187
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,822
Eavesdropper! Creepy! Stalker! Pervert! Super creepy!

188
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,795
You're seriously way too creepy for your own good!

189
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,486
Why don't you learn a little restraint.

190
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,105
Huh? Why should I show any restraint now?

191
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:50,120
Whose fault do you think it is, moron?

192
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,604
What does she mean, "whose fault"?

193
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:57,400
Obviously...

194
00:10:58,397 --> 00:10:59,845
It's Yukinoshita's, right?

195
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,276
Huh?

196
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:10,844
What are you doing?

197
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:13,231
Would you not sneak up on us like that?

198
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:14,899
Fine, sorry.

199
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:16,861
So, what are you doing?

200
00:11:19,402 --> 00:11:21,703
There's someone suspicious in the club room.

201
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:22,555
What?

202
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:33,921
Imagine finally meeting you here.

203
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,820
I've waited so long for this,

204
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,462
Hachiman Hikigaya!

205
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,280
Do you know this person?

206
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:48,051
No way. Even if I knew him, I wouldn't.

207
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,852
Don't tell me you've forgotten the face of your partner.

208
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,611
I'm disgusted with you, Hachiman!

209
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:56,844
He says he's your partner, Hikki.

210
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,283
That's right, partner!

211
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,884
I know you have to remember

212
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:03,762
all those hellish times we went through
and the suffering we endured together.

213
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,736
I might've been paired up with him in gym or something.

214
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:08,514
Hmph! A most evil custom, indeed.

215
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,465
Find someone to pair up with, they say?

216
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,487
I am a man who could perish at any time.

217
00:12:13,562 --> 00:12:16,001
I am not one to just make friends with!

218
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,544
What do you want, Zaimokuza?

219
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:21,530
Wait, so you do know this weirdo!

220
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:22,184
Well?

221
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:24,740
I am the Kengo Shogun,

222
00:12:24,861 --> 00:12:26,986
Yoshiteru Zaimokuza!

223
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:30,550
So this friend of yours wants
something from you, I take it?

224
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:32,686
I told you he's not my friend.

225
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,330
That's right. I have no friends in this place!

226
00:12:35,497 --> 00:12:37,574
Seriously. Not a one. None.

227
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,887
Anyway, Hachiman!

228
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:41,572
This is the Service Club, right?

229
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:42,088
Huh?

230
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:44,217
Yes, this is the Service Club.

231
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:47,159
I thought as much!

232
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,350
If the advice Ms. Hiratsuka gave me was correct, then,

233
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:53,829
you have a bound and sacred
duty to grant me my wish, Hachiman.

234
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:57,781
To think, after centuries, our bond
is still that of master and servant.

235
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,534
Could it be the guidance of Hachiman Daibosatsu?

236
00:13:00,568 --> 00:13:04,286
The Service Club wasn't put in place
for granting yours or anyone's wishes.

237
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,564
We are only here so we can help people.

238
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:11,614
Th-then, Hachiman, please lend me your assistance!

239
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:15,223
As I recall, our bond is that of pure equals.

240
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:19,408
Let us strive once more to conquer
this hedonistic world to our liking!

241
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:21,793
What happened to our master-servant relationship?

242
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:22,970
Ahem! Ahem!

243
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,318
Come now, such trivial things
matter not between you and me.

244
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:28,153
I shall... forgive...

245
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:32,974
Why are you looking at me?

246
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,940
Hikigaya, a moment.

247
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:37,670
What exactly does that guy mean by "Kengo Shogun"?

248
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,536
That's a delusion of grandeur.

249
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:40,755
"Delusion of grandeur"?

250
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,502
A delusion of grandeur is...

251
00:13:43,815 --> 00:13:45,992
So, he's not actually sick, per se.

252
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,165
I don't get it...

253
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:52,028
So, you're telling me he's basically just
acting out a setting he's created for himself?

254
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:54,743
That's about right... And...

255
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,793
Just because he happens to have the same name,

256
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:01,137
he's apparently convinced that
he's the thirteenth Muromachi shogun,

257
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,741
Ashikaga Yoshiteru.

258
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,189
So then why does he regard you as his partner?

259
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:09,661
Probably because my name is
the same as Hachiman Daibosatsu,

260
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:12,771
the Bodhisattva revered by Seiwa Genji.

261
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,081
I'm surprised. You're well-informed.

262
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:15,921
I guess.

263
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:21,377
Well, at least he's basing his setting on
actual history than on some fantasy in his head.

264
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,416
There are people worse than him?

265
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:23,888
Yep.

266
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,438
Purely for my own reference, what others are there?

267
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:31,267
If you don't know, the first seven gods of this world,

268
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,776
which includes the three creator deities:

269
00:14:34,036 --> 00:14:38,858
The emperor Galan, war goddess Methica,
and protector Heartia, as well as-

270
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:42,415
Uh, you're pretty smooth with leading
questions. It's kinda freaking me out.

271
00:14:42,457 --> 00:14:44,635
I almost went into way too much detail.

272
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,170
I wasn't trying to lead you into anything.

273
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:48,411
So creepy.

274
00:14:48,538 --> 00:14:49,453
Well, you know...

275
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:53,496
I may have been like that once before, but not anymore.

276
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,622
<i>I don't make up stupid fantasies anymore.</i>

277
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,163
<i>And I've graduated from cosplaying.</i>

278
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:04,802
<i>I'm not keeping spiritual world
diaries or government reports.</i>

279
00:15:05,255 --> 00:15:08,623
<i>The only thing I still write is a
list of people I'll never forgive.</i>

280
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:09,763
Yukinon, run!

281
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:11,634
I think I understand.

282
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:15,336
Your request is you want us to
heal this mental illness, right?

283
00:15:16,354 --> 00:15:21,806
You are gravely mistaken. I have come here to
request that you grant my wish, as per your agreement!

284
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:22,323
It is the most noble of-

285
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:24,766
I'm the one who is speaking to you right now.

286
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,884
You need turn and look at people when they speak to you.

287
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,493
Well, good heavens-

288
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:34,904
And stop talking like that.

289
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,167
You're awesome, Yukinon!

290
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:40,106
Anyway, you'd like us to cure you of this illness, right?

291
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,384
Uh, I really wouldn't call it an illness...

292
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,030
Hey, don't be so-Huh?

293
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:45,883
Is this...

294
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:51,075
A manuscript for a novel?

295
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,116
Indeed!

296
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,696
That is a manuscript for a light novel.

297
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:58,095
I am thinking of submitting it
to a certain newcomer contest,

298
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,466
but no friends, means no opinions.

299
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,729
Please read it.

300
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:03,691
That was dreadful.

301
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,206
He told us something really sad without a second thought.

302
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:08,594
Aren't there sites you can submit these to?

303
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,794
Just post it there.

304
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,505
I can't do that. Those people are ruthless!

305
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:15,300
I would die if they criticized it too harshly.

306
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,081
Your heart needs to toughen up.

307
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:18,356
But you know...

308
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:23,665
She would probably be way more ruthless
than any place you would find online.

309
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,814
The foundation of this story is spatial
rupture... that which they call Dimension Driver!

310
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,617
In the end, it grants the world
parliament access to the akashic records...

311
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,914
Hachiman. Hachiman!

312
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:51,958
Huh? Oh. Sounds lame.

313
00:16:52,146 --> 00:16:54,831
Now, hold on. Relax, Hachiman. Listen.

314
00:16:54,856 --> 00:16:59,446
The heroine also has the hammer of
the gods, Gungnir Hammer! And it...

315
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:28,801
Ah!

316
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,124
Good morning, Hikki!

317
00:17:30,434 --> 00:17:32,691
Hey, you're not very energetic today.

318
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,257
Hell, you know. After reading that thing...

319
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:39,521
Actually, I want to know why you're
so energetic after reading that.

320
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:42,054
Huh? Oh, y-you're so right!

321
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,301
Yeah, I'm starting to feel really sleepy...

322
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,321
You didn't bother to read it, did you?

323
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:52,202
Hm?

324
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:58,088
Good work.

325
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:01,832
Hm?

326
00:18:05,008 --> 00:18:05,486
Oh...

327
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm surprised.

328
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,542
When I look upon your face,
my sleepiness is gone instantly.

329
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,230
<i>I was too close to being deceived
by her looks and losing my mind there.</i>

330
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:21,419
<i>Wish I could put this woman to sleep forever.</i>

331
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:25,614
Now then, let me hear your thoughts about my novel.

332
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:30,168
I apologize, but I don't understand
this sort of thing very well.

333
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:34,053
No matter. I wanted to hear the opinions of ordinary folk!

334
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,700
Say whatever you need to.

335
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:36,486
Fine.

336
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:41,089
It was quite terrible. Reading it was actually painful.

337
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,642
It was unspeakably tedious.

338
00:18:46,512 --> 00:18:51,459
For my own reference, might I ask what part
of it you found to be so terrible and tedious?

339
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:54,247
First, the grammar is atrocious.

340
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:56,048
Why use inverse word order?

341
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:57,831
Do you not know how to use particles?

342
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,025
Did you not learn it in grade school?

343
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:04,140
I used a style that would
sound more familiar to readers...

344
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:07,694
Shouldn't you achieve a minimal mastery
of Japanese before you attempt that?

345
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,480
And the improper uses of furigana.

346
00:19:10,924 --> 00:19:13,806
"Chikara" is not a possible
alternate reading of "nouryoku."

347
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:15,515
Let me ask you this...

348
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,780
Where does the "nightmare" in this
"Bloody Nightmare Slasher" come from?

349
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:21,612
You've got it wrong!

350
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:25,087
In modern battles, the use of
furigana adds a unique touch to-

351
00:19:25,112 --> 00:19:27,604
Why does the heroine take off her clothes here?

352
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:29,994
There's no need for it at all. I'm not amused.

353
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:32,786
But without elements like that...

354
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:35,461
Could you not force others to
read a story that isn't complete?

355
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:39,503
Get some common sense before
attempting to show off literary talent.

356
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:43,881
Don't you think that's enough damage now?

357
00:19:44,045 --> 00:19:45,960
You don't want to criticize him all at once.

358
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm not finished just yet, but alright.

359
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,288
Well, I guess Yuigahama is next.

360
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:52,981
Yea... Oh, yeah...

361
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:58,010
So, you know a lot of... difficult kanji.

362
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,512
O-okay, Hikki!

363
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:04,735
H-Hachiman... You understand it, right?

364
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,109
So, what was that a ripoff of?

365
00:20:12,134 --> 00:20:14,097
What?! A ripoff?!

366
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,643
How could you say such a thing? I'm a true original!

367
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:18,873
You're a blithering idiot.

368
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,063
What the...

369
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:31,339
Well, what's important are the illustrations.

370
00:20:31,425 --> 00:20:33,469
Don't worry too much about the story for now.

371
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:35,170
Zaimokuza...

372
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,236
Will you read my work again?

373
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,545
Does he like pain?

374
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,890
After everything we said, you still want more?

375
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:47,269
Of course. Indeed, your criticism was harsh.

376
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,935
But it still made me happy.

377
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:55,112
Having someone else read the work I wrote for pleasure and
being able to hear their thoughts on it is a good thing.

378
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:56,638
I look forward to it.

379
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,208
Fine then. We'll read it again.

380
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,351
Farewell for now!

381
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,873
When I write something new, I'll bring it to you!

382
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:09,283
<i>Yeah.</i>

383
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,535
<i>What he has isn't just a delusion of grandeur.</i>

384
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:15,601
<i>He's got full-fledged writer's fever.</i>

385
00:21:16,814 --> 00:21:19,127
<i>He wants to write because he has something to write about.</i>

386
00:21:19,513 --> 00:21:22,692
<i>If he can move someone's heart
with that, then all the better.</i>

387
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:25,183
<i>That's what writer's fever is.</i>

388
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,022
<i>Zaimokuza doesn't need to change.</i>

389
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:33,860
Go!

390
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,342
Barrier!

391
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,996
<i>Except maybe for that creepy side of his.</i>

392
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:42,593
Good work.

393
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,171
My hip... my hip!

394
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,515
Hachiman...

395
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:53,861
What amazing artists are popular lately?

396
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:56,932
You're getting ahead of yourself.
Think about that after you win.

397
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,232
If it sells well, and gets
animated maybe I'll marry an actress?

398
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:03,551
Forget about that stuff right now. Just write, okay?

399
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,012
If it sells well, you think I
could have wild parties every night?

400
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:12,165
You're not gonna have wild parties!
Get your head out of the clouds!

401
00:23:42,878 --> 00:23:46,911
If you don't mind, Hikigaya...
would you join our tennis club?

402
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:52,134
I'd have them run until they die, then swing
until they die, then practice until they die, perhaps?

403
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,298
Sai! Are you okay?

404
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:57,019
Will you hurry up? I wanna play tennis already.

405
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,485
Our forces are too overwhelming!

406
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,100
Game!

407
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,719
Mow them down!

408
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:06,661
You got me. That really was a magic serve.

409
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:11,253
Next time: "Sometimes the God
of Rom-Coms Does Nice Things."
