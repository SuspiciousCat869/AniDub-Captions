1
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:05,313
What? No... Y-you've got it all wrong.

2
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:08,069
You've heard of flexible management attendance, right?

3
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:10,164
As a man who strives to become an elite, I was just...

4
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:12,837
You told me your goal was to be a stay-at-home-dad,

5
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:15,376
and that you prefer to "work smarter, not harder."

6
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,415
Ugh! W-well, you know...

7
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:20,380
the concept of lateness being
evil is wrong in the first place...

8
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,641
Oh? I'll hear you out before I hit you.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,793
The police don't mobilize until after an incident happens,

10
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,967
and it's standard for heroes to show up late.

11
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,045
But would anyone condemn them just for being late?

12
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,904
So, speaking paradoxically, lateness is justice...

13
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:37,324
Wait, please don't hit me, Miss! I was only kidding.

14
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:42,227
Oh?

15
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:44,215
I mean, for real...

16
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:47,536
There are just too many problem children in this class.

17
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:51,353
Are you practicing "flexible management
attendance," too, Miss Kawasaki?

18
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:54,963
Huh?

19
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:57,957
Black lace...

20
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,072
Are you stupid?

21
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:40,776
Hm?

22
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:46,644
Hmm...

23
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,828
Now it's Yukinon's turn to ask a question.

24
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,977
This one's a Japanese question.

25
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,158
They want you to complete the following idiom.

26
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:00,025
"When the wind blows..."

27
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:00,995
Hmm...

28
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,722
The Keio line stops running?

29
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,114
<i>What is this, Trans Chiba Ultra Quiz?</i>

30
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:09,394
<i>"Yuigahama, you're thinking of, "...these days,
more trains just move slower instead of stopping."</i>

31
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,957
Answer: "the carpenter gets rich."

32
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,605
Now for a geography question.

33
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,471
Two local specialties of Chiba.

34
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:18,423
Miso peanuts... Boiled peanuts?

35
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,073
You think peanuts are all this prefecture has to offer?

36
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,107
Oh, hey! Well, hello there, Hikki!

37
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,030
I thought it was some weirdo
just talking to me out of nowhere.

38
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,141
So you were invited to the study group, too?

39
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,349
Uh... <i>What's with that face of,</i>

40
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:32,342
<i>"Oh God, we totally didn't invite him"?</i>

41
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:34,878
Sorry, but you weren't invited to this study group.

42
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,918
Do you need something?

43
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:39,563
You shouldn't ask for answers in ways
that are only intended to hurt people.

44
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,511
Hm? What's that?

45
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:44,596
What? Oh, yeah. It's info on summer courses.

46
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:47,526
Whoa! You're already studying for exams, huh?

47
00:03:47,551 --> 00:03:51,436
Isn't everyone studying for their exams?
I mean, it's almost time for college.

48
00:03:52,142 --> 00:03:54,557
Plus, I'm trying to get a scholarship for a prep school.

49
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,129
"A scholar's hip"? He said "scholarship."

50
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,195
These days, prep schools are granting
tuition waivers for students with good grades.

51
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:05,749
If I get that, and get tuition money
from my parents, that money will be mine.

52
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,391
That's fraud. What a cheap trick to pull.

53
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:10,657
It's not hurting anyone. What's the problem?

54
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,637
Big Brother! Huh?

55
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:14,756
Komachi? What are you doing here?

56
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:17,091
My friend was asking me for some advice.

57
00:04:17,116 --> 00:04:17,571
Hm.

58
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,765
Nice to meetcha!

59
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:22,591
My name's Komachi.

60
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:24,951
Thanks for looking out for my brother.

61
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,107
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm his classmate, Totsuka.

62
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:31,518
Wow, you're really a cutie! Right, Brother?

63
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,483
Sure, except he's a guy.

64
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:36,353
Oh stop... You quit being such a silly billy!

65
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,251
Wait, really?

66
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:39,539
Y-yeah.

67
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:42,308
Promise.. I'm a real boy.

68
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:46,740
Oh, hi! Nice to meet you! I'm
Hikki's classmate, Yui Yuigahama.

69
00:04:46,765 --> 00:04:49,228
Oh, cool! Pleasure.

70
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,280
Are you finished?

71
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:56,501
Nice to meet you. I'm Yukinoshita.

72
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:59,825
I'm not Hikigaya's classmate, nor am I one of his friends.

73
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,346
I'm truly sorry to say, but...

74
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:04,103
I think I'm considered an acquaintance, maybe?

75
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,469
Why sorry, and why say it like a question?

76
00:05:06,944 --> 00:05:08,240
So, uh...

77
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:10,142
I'm Taishi Kawasaki.

78
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,456
I'm at the same cram school as Hikigaya,

79
00:05:12,823 --> 00:05:15,731
and like you guys, my sister
is a second year at Soubu High.

80
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,443
Her name is Saki Kawasaki.

81
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:18,896
Huh?

82
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:23,935
<i>Black lace?</i>

83
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,496
Oh! You mean Kawasaki?

84
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,001
She's kinda scary-looking.

85
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:29,598
Aren't you friends with her?

86
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:31,473
Well, I've talked with her, but...

87
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:35,718
You know, you really shouldn't ask a
girl that, it can be hard to answer.

88
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:40,574
In fact, I don't think I've actually ever seen Kawasaki
acting friendly with anyone in class.

89
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:45,133
Not only that, but it seems like Taishi's sister
has developed some bad behavior lately,

90
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,551
like coming home late and stuff,

91
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:50,472
so he brought me here for us to try and figure out
how to get his old sister back to him.

92
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,667
When did you notice all this starting for her?

93
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,021
Only recently. And after she got into Soubu High.

94
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:58,447
In middle school, she acted really serious...

95
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,747
and she was considerate.

96
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:00,622
I see...

97
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:03,999
So she changed after being put
in the same class as Hikigaya?

98
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:06,727
Why did you just say that like I'm the reason behind this?

99
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,304
Am I some kind of pathogen?

100
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:09,658
I didn't say that.

101
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,421
Aren't you being a bit paranoid, Hikigaya-coccus?

102
00:06:12,446 --> 00:06:14,829
You did say it. You just called me a germ.

103
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,996
I misspoke.

104
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,437
It's Hikigaya-coccus! Tag!

105
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,461
But I had a shield up this whole time!

106
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,913
Shields aren't able to keep out Hikigaya germs!

107
00:06:23,938 --> 00:06:27,676
<i>Hikigaya-cocci must be damn powerful
if they can go through shields.</i>

108
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,776
Wait, so how late does she come home, anyway?

109
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,900
I mean, I get home late, too.

110
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:35,564
Well... like, after 5 AM.

111
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:37,012
But that's basically morning.

112
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,352
Don't your parents say anything to her?

113
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:41,538
Both my parents work.

114
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:46,128
I also have a younger brother and sister,
but they don't really say anything to my big sis.

115
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,418
Family circumstances, then?

116
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,197
Every family does have their problems.

117
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:52,487
Huh?

118
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:54,575
I understand.

119
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,435
Are you planning to do something?

120
00:06:56,886 --> 00:07:00,417
Taishi is the brother of a
student at our school, Saki Kawasaki,

121
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,153
and since she is the one he has come seeking advice for,

122
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:06,128
I believe this falls within
the category of Service Club work.

123
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:07,244
Huh?

124
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:15,640
I've been thinking, and I believe
that, rather than coercing her,

125
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:18,895
it would be for the best if
Kawasaki fixed the problem herself.

126
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,099
You're probably right with that. So, what do we do, then?

127
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,587
Have you heard of animal therapy?

128
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,738
So, what are your intentions with my cat?

129
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,965
I think by having her interact with a cat

130
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,871
it will hopefully bring out Kawasaki's gentle side.

131
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:37,627
If her heart is moved, then she's sure to take him home.

132
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,374
She's not some old-school juvenile delinquent.

133
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,601
I went ahead and assigned roles for each of us.

134
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:44,231
Now everyone take your positions.

135
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,856
Meow. Meow.

136
00:07:58,642 --> 00:07:59,489
Meow.

137
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,010
What are you doing, weirdo?

138
00:08:04,915 --> 00:08:05,816
What do you mean?

139
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,568
Uh, you were just talking to
Kamakura like she was going...

140
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,072
More importantly, I believe I ordered you to stand by.

141
00:08:11,763 --> 00:08:13,953
Are you unable to do a task?

142
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:17,828
I thought I came up with something
finally appropriate to your low level,

143
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,998
but I didn't realize I'd have to stoop even lower.

144
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:23,406
<i>I can tell by the look in her eyes that
she'll kill me if I try to talk back...</i>

145
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,505
Komachi, what's up?

146
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,725
<i>Hi, Brother? This is Taishi. Hikigaya just told me...</i>

147
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,693
You have no right in calling me
your brother, like that. Understand?

148
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,786
<i>Hey, why'd you hang up?</i>

149
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:41,858
I'm busy. I'm waiting for your sister.

150
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:43,785
<i>Well, it's about that plan...</i>

151
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,848
<i>My, uh, my sister's allergic to cats.</i>

152
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,155
Even if she can't talk to her parents
because they're too close to her,

153
00:08:52,338 --> 00:08:54,486
maybe she can talk to another adult about it.

154
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:55,457
Right?

155
00:08:58,127 --> 00:08:59,035
Kawasaki.

156
00:08:59,162 --> 00:08:59,686
Hm?

157
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:03,233
Need me for something?

158
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:06,038
I hear you've been getting home late recently.

159
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,391
What are you doing, and where?

160
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,026
Who gave you that information?

161
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,958
I can't go revealing my clients' secrets.

162
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:14,273
Just answer my question.

163
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,737
What does it matter where I go?

164
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:18,992
It's not like I'm bothering anyone.

165
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,209
It might start to bother someone real soon.

166
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:24,086
You're only in high school right now.

167
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,385
Haven't you thought about how
your parents might feel about this?

168
00:09:29,455 --> 00:09:30,342
Wait a minute.

169
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,727
How would you even know? It's
not like you've ever been a parent.

170
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:34,527
Ah?

171
00:09:34,786 --> 00:09:36,047
Aren't you single?

172
00:09:37,013 --> 00:09:41,490
If I were you, I would be more worried about
your own future than trying to look into mine.

173
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:42,936
Like getting married.

174
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,911
Oh no... Poor Teacher.

175
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:47,918
I'm going home.

176
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,811
<i>Someone just marry her already. Seriously.</i>

177
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:56,661
If changing made her worse, then it'd make
sense that if she changes again, she'll get better.

178
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:58,926
Yeah, but how can we change her?

179
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,284
There's only one thing that
will always make a girl change!

180
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:03,553
You know?

181
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:04,953
Love...

182
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:07,854
O... 'Kay...

183
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:08,632
Long day?

184
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,691
You look tired. Do you have work now?

185
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,045
You know you shouldn't wear yourself out.

186
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,537
Thanks for all your concern.

187
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:17,435
You know...

188
00:10:18,042 --> 00:10:18,523
Hm?

189
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,182
You don't always have to act so tough around everyone.

190
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:25,101
Yeah, whatever you say, dude.

191
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:26,227
Uh...

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,676
I feel like I've been rejected...

193
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,320
Uh... No... Good job.

194
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,089
It's not nice to laugh at someone!

195
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,833
Oh no, it's okay. It doesn't bother me.

196
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,695
Hm?

197
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:42,580
I'm not your damn brother, all right?

198
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:45,158
What are you even talking about,
of course you're my big brother.

199
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,241
Anyway, Taishi said his sister just
got a phone call from some weird place!

200
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:50,333
Huh?

201
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:56,703
So, what he's saying is that she received a phone
call from the owner of a place called "Angel" something?

202
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:57,290
Yeah.

203
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:02,083
And when they searched around for stores in Chiba
city that are open till morning with "Angel" in the name,

204
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:03,728
they only came across two.

205
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,240
And one of those is this place?

206
00:11:06,313 --> 00:11:07,888
{\an8}I'm embarrassed to say...

207
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,570
but I don't know much about maid cafe.

208
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,789
What are they like?

209
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:16,721
I don't know much about them, either,
so I decided to invite someone who does.

210
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:17,854
Ahem!

211
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,084
My time has come at last to assist you!

212
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:23,586
Seriously?

213
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:26,553
It was you who invited me! Why are you making that face?!

214
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:29,217
I was just thinking it's gonna be a pain to deal with you.

215
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:31,088
Then just follow me quietly!

216
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:33,929
To where we can just sit back
and have the maids pamper us.

217
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:34,447
Huh?

218
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,387
They'll pamper us?

219
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:38,792
What's wrong with you?

220
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,535
You're starting to creep me out now.

221
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,891
Anyway, isn't this the kind of place that only guys go?

222
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:45,851
What are we supposed to do while in there?

223
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:49,401
It looks like women are welcome, too.

224
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,018
Meowlcome back, master! Arf!

225
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:57,032
Oh! Sorry to keep you waiting...

226
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,342
M-Master.

227
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,364
Well, does it look okay?

228
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,780
Wow! You look so cute, Yuigahama!

229
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:04,860
Right, Hachiman?

230
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:06,653
U-uh, yeah...

231
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,957
Really? You think so?

232
00:12:08,982 --> 00:12:12,659
Hah! You're only cosplaying as
a maid, your soul isn't into it!

233
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,261
I would rather see you...

234
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:15,389
Wh-what?

235
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:17,804
<i>Master!</i>

236
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:22,348
Whoa! Yukinon, no way!

237
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:25,460
That looks great on you! You look gorgeous!

238
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:30,298
Thank you. Now then, it appears Kawasaki isn't here.

239
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,536
You checked already?

240
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,406
Her name wasn't on the shift chart.

241
00:12:34,013 --> 00:12:38,407
Considering her employer called her at
home, I don't think she'd be using an alias.

242
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,448
That's odd...

243
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,353
What's odd?

244
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,830
A sullen girl like her working in secret...

245
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,588
"Meow, meow! Welcome back, master!"

246
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,742
"Hey, what are you doing here?!"

247
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:51,608
That's obviously how it's destined to turn out!

248
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,598
What? None of that made sense.

249
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,800
Let's just go to the second place.

250
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,463
The top floor of the Hotel Royal Ochre, "Angel Ladder."

251
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:01,668
A stairway to Heaven?

252
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,526
S-sorry for the wait.

253
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:12,894
Where are the other two?

254
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:15,234
Said they didn't have anything to meet the dress code.

255
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,357
I see.

256
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,837
Check these outfits!

257
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:22,009
Yukinon has lots of fancy dresses like
these in her closet, and she lives alone!

258
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,729
Seriously, who even are you?

259
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:28,161
You exaggerate. I only have clothes like
these because they're called for on occasion.

260
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,499
Most people never have those kinds of occasions.

261
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:34,950
Whoa!

262
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,608
You kiddin'? Is this for real? It's amazing.

263
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:44,727
Stop gawking like that. Stand up
straight and stick out your chest.

264
00:13:45,316 --> 00:13:46,253
Pull in your chin.

265
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,049
Hm?

266
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:52,241
Kawasaki?

267
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,787
Hm?

268
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,493
Sorry, sir, do I know you?

269
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,233
I don't believe we've met before.

270
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:01,934
Only you, Hikigaya, would be in the same
class as someone and them not know your face.

271
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:03,020
Yukinoshita?

272
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,395
H-hi!

273
00:14:04,872 --> 00:14:05,887
Yuigahama.

274
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:08,236
So he's from Soubu High, too?

275
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:09,690
Yeah.

276
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:12,374
Well? What are you doing here?

277
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:15,156
Don't tell me you're on a date with this guy.

278
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:20,386
Certainly not. If you're talking about the
object on my right, that's not even a funny joke.

279
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:25,053
Do you think you could possibly stop being so mean
to me when you're busy arguing with somebody else?

280
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:28,025
Your little brother's worried about you.

281
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:30,538
He says that you've been coming home late, recently.

282
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,579
I thought people had been fussing over me.

283
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:35,479
So it was because of you guys.

284
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:38,569
I don't know what Taishi told you,
but you don't have to worry about me.

285
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,209
Stay out of it.

286
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:44,139
Cinderella's spell wears off
right as the clock strikes midnight,

287
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:46,540
but I guess your spell wears off about now.

288
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,533
Hm?

289
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:53,790
If my spell's wearing off, doesn't that
only mean there's a happy ending for me?

290
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:56,132
I don't know if that's in the cards, Little Mermaid.

291
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:59,509
Unfortunately I believe a
terrible ending is waiting for you.

292
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,193
Hey, what exactly are they talking about?

293
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,557
People our age can't work past curfew.

294
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:09,027
So Yukinoshita's saying she suspects
Kawasaki is lying about her age.

295
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,090
Oh... Then why not say that instead?

296
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:13,930
You have no intention of quitting?

297
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,165
Hm? No.

298
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,906
That's just not right, Kawasaki...

299
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:23,476
I like to pull some part-time work when I'm short on
money, too, but I would never lie about my age to do it.

300
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:26,095
It's not... look, I just need money.

301
00:15:26,155 --> 00:15:28,576
Yeah, we get that, but you're pushing it...

302
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:32,211
Says the guy who says he wants
to "work smarter, not harder."

303
00:15:32,437 --> 00:15:37,829
You heard that? Life isn't so light. I'm not
working for money just to go spend and play around.

304
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:39,993
Don't lump me in with those idiots.

305
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,545
You guys all strut around and talk like your big,
but can you three help me out with any money?

306
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:48,788
I'd like to see you all try and shoulder
the debt that my parents can't pay off?

307
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,210
Well, if you really need it...

308
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:53,899
Stop right there, Yuigahama. If you
keep talking you'll only give in to her.

309
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:57,679
Hey... Yukino, isn't your father a prefectural member?

310
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:01,406
Someone who's got it as easy
as you could never understand me.

311
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,134
Hey now!

312
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,222
Yukinon's family has nothing
to do with any of this, ya hear?!

313
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,590
Then my family has nothing to do with this stuff, either.

314
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:15,031
M-maybe not, but what about... Yukinon's...

315
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:16,853
I only knocked over a glass is all.

316
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,386
It's nothing for you to worry about. Just let it go.

317
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,099
I think it's time for us to leave.

318
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:27,184
Kawasaki. I want to talk to you about Taishi.

319
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,809
Give me some time tomorrow.

320
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:30,942
5:30 at the WcD's.

321
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,131
Why?

322
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,205
I'll tell you "why" when I see you.

323
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:35,154
Later.

324
00:16:35,798 --> 00:16:36,486
Hold on!

325
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,735
There's not enough money here.

326
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,221
<i>They didn't cover my part of the bill?</i>

327
00:16:42,421 --> 00:16:43,148
<i>Son of a...</i>

328
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:48,257
Taishi...

329
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,341
What are you doing here at this hour?

330
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:52,514
I should be asking you that.

331
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:55,484
Tell me, what have you been doing out all night?

332
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,243
It's none of your business.

333
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:02,855
Kawasaki, let me take a guess why you're working
so much and the reason you need the extra money now.

334
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:07,018
Taishi, has anything changed
since you started back middle school?

335
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:09,506
Yeah, I started going to cram school as well.

336
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:12,554
I get it. She wanted to pay her brother's tuition...

337
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,160
Wrong.

338
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:13,725
What?

339
00:17:14,194 --> 00:17:16,524
When he started attending cram school in April,

340
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,258
the Kawasaki family had already
reached a solution regarding his tuition.

341
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:25,124
That sounds about right. After all, he's not the
only kid out there who has to pay tuition for school.

342
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:30,025
We go to a college prep school, so a lot of students
start thinking about college by their second year.

343
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:33,404
That's when they start giving serious
thought to taking summer courses.

344
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,094
Ah!

345
00:17:34,983 --> 00:17:35,982
Big Sis...

346
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:40,444
I told you, you didn't need to know where I was at night.

347
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:46,218
I want to go to college, and I don't
want to be a burden to you and our parents.

348
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:49,819
Um, can I say something?

349
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:54,071
So yeah, our parents both work
and aren't around a lot, too.

350
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:58,874
When I was little, I hated coming home
and finding nobody at home, so I ran away.

351
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:02,337
And it was my brother, not my parents, who came after me.

352
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:06,774
And, ever since then, he's been getting home
before I do so that I never have to be alone.

353
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:09,873
I'm eternally grateful to him for that.

354
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:14,079
I thought Hikigaya went home early
because he has no friends to hang out with.

355
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:15,522
Hey, how did you know?

356
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,277
What are you, Yukipedia?

357
00:18:17,424 --> 00:18:20,291
Oh, no, I mean I totally realize that, as well,

358
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:23,776
but I'd say my explanation is worth
more points, don't' you think? Huh?

359
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,048
So what are you trying to say with that?

360
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:30,534
I simply mean that just like you
don't want to be a burden to your family,

361
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,195
Taishi doesn't want to become a
burden to his big sister, either.

362
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:38,396
It'd make me happy as a fellow
younger sibling if you'd understand that.

363
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,710
Well, that's pretty much it.

364
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,299
So, um, Kawasaki...

365
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,297
Have you heard of scholarships?

366
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,233
Is that what it's like to have siblings?

367
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,349
Depends on the siblings you have.

368
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:01,294
You could also call them the
closest stranger in your life.

369
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,735
Oh, yes... I understand that all too well.

370
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,944
Oh, that's right. So you did get to meet her after all?

371
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:12,639
Huh? What are you on about?

372
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:15,791
You know, the girl with the desserts! Good for you!

373
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,575
To think you got to meet a cute girl
like Yui all because you broke a bone.

374
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,354
<i>What did she just say?</i>

375
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,125
<i>Yuigahama is the girl who brought the desserts?</i>

376
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,793
<i>The owner of the dog I saved on
the day of our entrance ceremony?</i>

377
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,677
What's the matter, Big Brother?

378
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,538
Nothing. Want to buy some bread on the way home?

379
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:34,446
Mm-hmm!

380
00:19:52,207 --> 00:19:55,677
This concludes our workplace observation. You may go now.

381
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,119
Hikki!

382
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,509
You're late! They all went to the restaurant already!

383
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:04,218
Well, aren't you going, as well?

384
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:07,306
Huh? Oh... No, I was waiting for you to come down.

385
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:09,662
I mean, I'd feel bad leaving you behind and all.

386
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,798
You're a really nice person, Yuigahama.

387
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:14,042
But listen, you don't have to worry about me anymore.

388
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:14,630
Huh?

389
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,453
It was a total fluke that I saved your dog, you know.

390
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:22,179
Even if I hadn't gotten into that accident,

391
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,867
I probably still would've been alone.

392
00:20:24,134 --> 00:20:25,709
You don't need to feel bad about that.

393
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,841
Sorry. I guess I made you worry about me.

394
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,835
But you don't have to anymore.

395
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,486
If that's why you're being nice...

396
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,832
then just stop it.

397
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:46,319
Oh, no... Well, I mean...

398
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:48,722
It's not really like that at all, Hikki...

399
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:52,594
<i>Yuigahama is as nice as they come.</i>

400
00:20:53,156 --> 00:20:54,939
<i>She'll probably stay that way to the end.</i>

401
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:56,876
Hm?

402
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,498
Ah... Hm.

403
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:05,331
Jerk.

404
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,864
<i>I hate nice girls.</i>

405
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:15,654
<i>If they so much as say hello, it stays on my mind.</i>

406
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:18,347
<i>If they return my texts, my heart races.</i>

407
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,058
<i>The day one calls me, I know I'll
look at my call history and grin.</i>

408
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:28,117
<i>But I know in my heart that's just them being nice.</i>

409
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:32,197
<i>People who are nice to me are also nice to everyone else.</i>

410
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:34,788
<i>I almost end up forgetting that.</i>

411
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:41,054
<i>If the truth is cruel, then lies must be kind.</i>

412
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,854
<i>That's why kindness is a lie.</i>

413
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:48,253
<i>I gave up on always expecting it, always mistaking it,</i>

414
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:50,772
<i>and even hoping for it.</i>

415
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,904
<i>Someone who's been alone for so long
doesn't fall for the same trick twice.</i>

416
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:57,310
<i>I'm a veteran.</i>

417
00:21:58,124 --> 00:22:00,034
<i>I'm the best there is when it comes to losing.</i>

418
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:03,966
<i>And that's why I'll always...</i>

419
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,050
<i>hate nice girls.</i>

420
00:23:41,674 --> 00:23:43,678
I did have some hope for that girl...

421
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,098
It's not as if Yuigahama has quit...

422
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:47,997
If she doesn't come, then it's the same thing.

423
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:51,807
I never found out what Yuigahama
likes, or even what her hobbies are.

424
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,269
What kind of friend am I?

425
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:56,657
Oh... Sorry. I guess I got a little carried away.

426
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,366
I want to tell you properly.

427
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:02,293
You don't have to concern yourself with me anymore.

428
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:03,568
So it's over now, right?

429
00:24:04,452 --> 00:24:05,041
Jerk...

430
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:09,846
Next time: "His Beginning With Her Finally Ends."
