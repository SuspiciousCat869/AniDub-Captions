1
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:04,925
Come on, wake up. Wake up, Hachiman.

2
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:09,771
Wha...? <i>What?!</i>

3
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:13,300
<i>Is this a "morning after"
scene? Is this the morning after?!</i>

4
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:14,430
You're finally awake.

5
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:14,865
<i>Morning af...</i>

6
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,249
Everyone else left already.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,522
You'd better hurry, or you'll miss breakfast.

8
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,819
Oh, yeah. I'm at that camp, aren't I?

9
00:00:23,878 --> 00:00:26,458
I'm betting you don't have a
regular routine in the summer.

10
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,606
Yeah, I don't...

11
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,706
You're also not getting any exercise, are you?

12
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:31,348
Let's play tennis sometime!

13
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,173
Yeah sure, okay. Just drop me
a line whenever you wanna play.

14
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:35,632
Great! I will...

15
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:37,486
So it looks to me like I'm gonna...

16
00:00:37,949 --> 00:00:40,087
need to get your phone number then, aren't I?

17
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:45,963
<i>I've only ever used my phone as an
alarm clock with built-in time killers,</i>

18
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:48,562
<i>and now it's finally going to
have Totsuka's phone number...</i>

19
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:50,884
Hey, Hachiman, why are you crying?

20
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,612
Let me send you a test message.

21
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:56,424
{\an8}<i>It's me, Saika.</i>

22
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:59,346
<i>Good morning, Hachiman! This is my first text to you.</i>

23
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:01,556
<i>Hope to hear from you soon!</i>

24
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:02,798
Hachiman?!

25
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:04,371
What's wrong? Are you okay?!

26
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:39,462
Listen up, today's plan...

27
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:43,010
Tonight, we've got a test of courage and a campfire party.

28
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:47,174
The kids have free time during the day,
so use that time to get everything ready.

29
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:48,702
Great, a campfire party.

30
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,317
That's where you do folk dances!

31
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:53,387
Like that alien-summoning "Bentora Bentora" dance!

32
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:56,132
I believe you're thinking of the "Oklahoma mixer."

33
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,184
How did you even mix those two words up?

34
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,961
I can see how it would happen.

35
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:02,630
The people doing it are basically aliens anyways.

36
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:04,824
Hachiman, that's a mean thing to say.

37
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:06,171
I didn't mean it that way.

38
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:08,301
I have my reasons for saying that.

39
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:12,018
<i>When I went to a campfire dance in grade school...</i>

40
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,762
We don't actually have to hold hands, do we?

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,714
<i>All the other girls did what she did,</i>

42
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,790
<i>so I was the only boy doing an air Oklahoma mixer.</i>

43
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:25,054
Hikigaya, your eyes look dead.

44
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:28,042
I'm thinking that makes you perfect to play a monster.

45
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:30,261
Scaring kids with the test of courage, huh?

46
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:33,269
There are some monster costumes laid out over there.

47
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,882
Divvy them up and get to it.

48
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,155
Okay.

49
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:37,995
Hyah!

50
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,907
<i>Stacking logs alone like this is like playing Jenga.</i>

51
00:03:48,112 --> 00:03:49,195
<i>But much better.</i>

52
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:52,063
Huh? You can play Jenga alone?

53
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,428
<i>What? You don't?</i>

54
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,391
That's finally done.

55
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:01,639
See? Stacking the blocks alone
is what makes Jenga fun, right?

56
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:03,290
Isn't that right?

57
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,722
It isn't, is it?

58
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:10,972
Hot...

59
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:13,077
Hot... Hm?

60
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,577
That looks refreshing.

61
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,265
That's cold!

62
00:04:18,953 --> 00:04:20,300
Oh, hey look who it is!

63
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,592
Yoo-hoo, Big Brother! Why don't you come join us?

64
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:23,079
Um... Hikki?

65
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,929
What are you guys doing out here?

66
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:26,965
And why are you in your swimsuits?

67
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:29,937
Ms. Hiratsuka said we could come
play in the river since it's so hot...

68
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:32,410
True, but more importantly, this is my new swimsuit!

69
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:33,256
Look!

70
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,322
Look!

71
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:35,817
Look!

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,841
Well? Tell me what you think of it!

73
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,861
Hmm? Let me think here for a minute...

74
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:41,696
It's the cutest in the world.

75
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:42,888
You didn't even try...

76
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:45,242
Okay, what do you think of Yui's, huh?

77
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:46,721
Komachi!

78
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:49,784
Uh, well, uh...

79
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,906
Well, you know, she...

80
00:04:52,506 --> 00:04:54,966
Looks really good. It suits you.

81
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,555
You think so? Th-thanks Hikki...

82
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:01,930
<i>Damn. My eyes are naturally drawn in her direction.</i>

83
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,675
{\an8}<i>Is this the unibreastal law of gravitation?</i>

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,035
{\an8}<i>Leave it to Sir Isaac Newtit.</i>

85
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:08,186
What's this? Apologizing to the river?

86
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:08,852
No...

87
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:19,089
What, you're down here, too, Hikigaya?

88
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:24,115
Ms. Hiratsuka... Wow, you do an excellent job of
passing for someone in their thirties when you really...

89
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:27,313
I'm still in my thirties, dammit!

90
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,915
Oh, so you don't go to Akihabara?

91
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,540
No, no! I go to Ikebukuro! Totally different!

92
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:35,926
For one, it's a completely different kind of place!

93
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:39,540
Akihabara is on the right side of
the Yamanote line... Making it uke!

94
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,355
I win...

95
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:46,123
Hey, so, considering your older sister, I believe
you can expect good things from those genes of yours.

96
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,108
What does my sister have to do with anything?

97
00:05:48,133 --> 00:05:49,850
You shouldn't worry about it, Yukino.

98
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,303
They're not what makes a girl special.

99
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:55,163
And besides, everyone's different,
so don't listen to him. I've got your back!

100
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,393
Right... Thanks, I guess.

101
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:01,789
Sister? My genes? Special?

102
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:02,930
I'm different?

103
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:04,822
Oh!

104
00:06:05,395 --> 00:06:08,372
Whatever, it's not like any of
that superficial stuff bothers me.

105
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:13,038
If certain outward characteristics determine a person's
worth, in my opinion, that should all be relative.

106
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,323
The overall balance should be considered, not just...

107
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,902
Yukinoshita, there's no need for you to give up just yet.

108
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:32,129
I wish I was out there splashing Saika...

109
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:35,176
Hey.

110
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,160
Why are you sitting alone?

111
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:44,160
I didn't know to bring my swimsuit. And you?

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,790
We apparently have free time today.

113
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:50,429
When I went back to my room after
breakfast there was no one around.

114
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:51,069
Hm...

115
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,614
Hey, Rumi, you wanna come hang out in the water with us?

116
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,102
Okay...

117
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,898
I have a question for you...

118
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:03,740
Ask away.

119
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,979
Do you have any friends you knew in grade school?

120
00:07:08,292 --> 00:07:10,993
I don't. And I don't really think anyone does.

121
00:07:11,234 --> 00:07:14,278
It's fine to let them be. Once they
graduate, you'll never see any of them again.

122
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:14,805
Huh?

123
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,696
That's just you, Hikki.

124
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,251
I haven't seen mine since then.

125
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,232
You know, Rumi, these two are a couple of special cases.

126
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:23,677
And tell me what's wrong with that?

127
00:07:23,807 --> 00:07:25,392
All it means is we're "special."

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,146
Makes us sound superior.

129
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:28,845
Here, it only means "weird."

130
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,679
Yuigahama...

131
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:30,243
Huh?

132
00:07:30,676 --> 00:07:33,605
How many of your friends from grade
school do you still hang out with?

133
00:07:34,066 --> 00:07:37,701
Uh... hmm, let's see, maybe one or two...

134
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,254
And how many kids were in your grade?

135
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,056
About thirty kids in three classes.

136
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,898
Ok then, so that means the percentage that
remained your friends five years after your graduation

137
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,644
is only three to six percent.

138
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:52,043
See there, even a beauty whose friends
with everyone has a low percentage.

139
00:07:52,068 --> 00:07:53,117
I'm a beauty?

140
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,982
Yuigahama, that wasn't exactly a compliment.

141
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,841
Look here. Most people aren't really
friends with everyone, usually just a few.

142
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:05,209
Split Yui's percentage by a
generous 25% and you barely have 1%.

143
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:08,432
No more than a typical margin
of error. It doesn't even count.

144
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:11,787
You know the saying, "Rounding
up only helps 5 and hurts 4."

145
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:16,048
Yes, but it might help to make
things easier if you think 1% is enough.

146
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:18,901
Being friends with everyone can be tiring, after all.

147
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,840
But my mom doesn't think that way.

148
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:25,296
She always asks me if I'm
getting along well with my friends.

149
00:08:25,403 --> 00:08:29,650
She even told me to take lots of pictures
at camp with this new camera she gave me.

150
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,254
I see...

151
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:35,473
And so, I feel like an insect that's
beneath everyone when they're busy ignoring me.

152
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,026
I know it kind of sucks.

153
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,056
I feel pathetic... but that's how it is...

154
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:42,050
So there's no changing it now.

155
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:43,197
Why's that?

156
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,810
I turned my back on them. So
we can't continue being friends.

157
00:08:47,984 --> 00:08:49,147
Even if I could...

158
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,986
Things might end up like this again at any moment.

159
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:54,733
So, I should leave things as they are...

160
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,775
<i>So that's it.</i>

161
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:58,235
<i>She's given up completely.</i>

162
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,685
<i>It's said that if you change, the world changes with you,</i>

163
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:02,952
<i>but that's not true.</i>

164
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,755
<i>When people judge others, it's with
prejudice and existing impressions.</i>

165
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:09,228
<i>People who are alone are pressured to stay alone.</i>

166
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:13,095
<i>If they work hard to stand out,
others only use that to hurt them.</i>

167
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:16,292
<i>It's lousy, but that's how kids operate.</i>

168
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,085
You don't wanna feel pathetic?

169
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,533
No.

170
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,515
Hope you have fun with the test of courage.

171
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:25,696
Huh? Ah!

172
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,506
Hikki, what's up? Hikki?

173
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,745
<i>Question:</i>

174
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,747
<i>The world does not change.</i>

175
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,555
<i>One can change oneself.</i>

176
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:38,517
<i>How, then, does one change?</i>

177
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:39,892
<i>Answer:</i>

178
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,673
<i>Become the god of a new world.</i>

179
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,707
She said we're to be monsters
for the test of courage, right?

180
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:51,455
What's with these cheap-looking costumes?

181
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,571
O, Gods who are up in heaven, I beg
you to send down your bridge to me!

182
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:56,553
That's needlessly realistic.

183
00:09:56,578 --> 00:09:59,372
I can do traditional Japanese folklore stuff, too!

184
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,197
Douman! Seiman!

185
00:10:01,222 --> 00:10:03,863
Do you think wizards can be counted as monsters?

186
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:06,435
I mean, I guess, in a broad sense.

187
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,525
But this isn't scary...

188
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,707
Oh, don't you worry about that, you're scary.

189
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,092
<i>Seriously scary.</i>

190
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,542
<i>I'm scared I'm going to end up
going straight down the Totsuka route.</i>

191
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:17,658
Hey, Big Brother, look at me!

192
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,079
Ta-da!

193
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,892
What are you, a cat monster?

194
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:25,544
I think... I'm not totally sure, but it's
super cute, so I figured I'd just go with it!

195
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,475
Why are you inspecting it?

196
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,217
It looks really good on you.

197
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,906
Yay! Thank you, Yukino!

198
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,991
Well you look ridiculously good in a kimono.

199
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,364
Just like the Yuki Onna.

200
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:40,466
And you look really good as a
zombie there, very realistic.

201
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:42,636
Those dead eyes of yours are worthy of Hollywood.

202
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,476
I'm not in makeup and I haven't changed yet, thank you.

203
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:48,725
So, you're looking awfully busy over there.

204
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,739
Huh... Oh hey, Hikki... Do I look okay? Scary?

205
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:55,563
So if it looked the slightest
bit terrible on you, I'd tell you.

206
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:58,001
In fact, I was even prepared to make fun of you, too.

207
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,745
And now I'm not even able to do that.

208
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:02,464
Huh? Um, so... Oh!

209
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:05,153
You could just give me an honest compliment, jerk!

210
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:07,550
My big brother is such a weirdo...

211
00:11:07,575 --> 00:11:09,392
I was just trying to pay you a compliment.

212
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,899
So, what should we do about the problem at hand?

213
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:15,248
I think Rumi might just have to go and talk to the others.

214
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:18,572
I honestly think they'll just keep
giving her a hard time if she does that.

215
00:11:18,597 --> 00:11:20,240
What if she talks to them individually?

216
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:24,543
It'll be the same... Even if they're nice to her
face, they'll start doing it behind her back again.

217
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:27,534
You need to know that girls are
scarier than you think, Hayato.

218
00:11:27,594 --> 00:11:29,626
Seriously? Talk about scary.

219
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,044
Hey, I have an idea that just might work.

220
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,596
So that means probably not much of one.

221
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,725
Just hear me out.

222
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:39,225
We're gonna be running a test of courage,
so we've gotta use it to our advantage.

223
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,494
Use it how, though?

224
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,395
If you've got problems with human relationships,

225
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:46,917
if you destroy the relationships
themselves, the problems are gone.

226
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,995
Nobody will fight or argue if they're out there all alone.

227
00:11:58,362 --> 00:12:01,590
Okay, so you guys get to go next!

228
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:09,852
So you need to go out and find the talisman
at the shrine deep in these scary woods.

229
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:19,134
Grr! I'm going to eat you!

230
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,479
I feel really stupid doing this...

231
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,020
It's just about time.

232
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:29,353
Hm? Ah...

233
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,662
Whoa, uh, it's just me.

234
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:37,634
Huh?

235
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:40,110
Oh hey, it's... you?

236
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,238
Your eyes looked so dead, I thought you were a ghost.

237
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,444
Is that so, huh?

238
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:46,810
So, how is the plan going?

239
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,812
{\an8}That's the starting signal.

240
00:12:49,296 --> 00:12:52,580
Okay, at last, it's finally your turn now!

241
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,330
Oh, it's Hikka's friends.

242
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,996
Look at them out here dressed all normal.

243
00:13:06,038 --> 00:13:07,372
So lame!

244
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:09,834
This stupid test of courage isn't scary at all.

245
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,322
You guys sure are dumb for high schoolers!

246
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,385
Huh? What's with the lack of respect, girls?

247
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:18,158
Aren't you brats getting a little full of yourselves?

248
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:22,728
It's not like we're actually your friends
or anything, so you can't talk to us that way.

249
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:26,825
Now, didn't one of you just totally make fun of us?

250
00:13:27,418 --> 00:13:28,820
Who's responsible?

251
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,355
We're really sorry...

252
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:33,649
I asked you who said it, didn't I?

253
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,177
Are you looking down on us? Little girls!

254
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:37,674
I say we take 'em out now.

255
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:41,229
I mean, isn't it our job to teach
these entitled brats manners after all?

256
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:44,375
Hey, Hayama, would you mind
terribly if I took these brats out?

257
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,875
How 'bout this? Half of you are free to leave now.

258
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,443
However, the other half are gonna stay right here.

259
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,780
You can decide amongst yourselves who's gonna stay.

260
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:00,818
We're so sorry!

261
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,038
I didn't ask you to apologize.

262
00:14:03,063 --> 00:14:05,046
I said half of you will stay here.

263
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,348
So choose.

264
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,381
Well did you not hear Hayama or are you
gonna pretend he didn't ask you a question?

265
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,160
Then I guess you better make
it quick! So are you gonna stay?!

266
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,067
Tsurumi... You stay behind.

267
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,663
Yeah, stay.

268
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,480
Yeah.

269
00:14:25,763 --> 00:14:27,911
What happens next is what you're after, right?

270
00:14:28,154 --> 00:14:28,789
Yeah.

271
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,436
We start to destroy the relationships around Rumi Tsurumi.

272
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:37,477
When humans feel truly scared,
they can't think about anyone else.

273
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,354
They try to save themselves, even
if it means sacrificing someone else.

274
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:45,026
Once that ugly truth is exposed,
they can't be friends again.

275
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,389
We just have to break up their
little group in a certain way.

276
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:51,448
But you don't think that's really
going to solve the actual problem, do you?

277
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,158
No, I don't. But it should cancel it out, right?

278
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,835
<i>Only strong people think it's bad to run away from things.</i>

279
00:14:59,728 --> 00:15:01,534
<i>It's not always your own fault, though.</i>

280
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:05,322
<i>The world, our society, people around us...</i>

281
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,916
<i>There are plenty of times when someone else is to blame.</i>

282
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:11,338
<i>Saying "I can change myself" is just admitting defeat,</i>

283
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:15,921
<i>it's only done so one can adapt to this
cold, cruel world and become its slave.</i>

284
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:20,327
<i>That phrase is no more than a pretty way to
dress up the fact that you're deceiving yourself.</i>

285
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,190
So that's how you think about things...

286
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,258
I think I'm beginning to understand
why she worries about you so much.

287
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:27,029
<i>"She"...?</i>

288
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:29,235
Okay, let's go with that.

289
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:34,587
But I'm betting on the possibility that
they'll all band together to solve it themselves.

290
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,628
I think they're good kids at heart.

291
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:42,733
'Kay, we need two more. Make it quick.

292
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,517
It was Yuka that said those bad things...

293
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,092
It's her fault! Yuka started it!

294
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:51,231
I did not! Hitomi started it!

295
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:54,614
I didn't say anything! It's not my fault!

296
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,373
Mori's attitude was the problem!

297
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:57,080
What?!

298
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,712
You always do that. Even to our Teacher.

299
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,756
That has absolutely nothing to do with this!

300
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,642
Everyone, stop, let's apologize so we can move on!

301
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:08,361
What I hate the most are girls who think
they can cry their way out of a situation.

302
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,056
We'll give you thirty seconds

303
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,513
to choose the other two.

304
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:14,506
And you know what'll happen if you tattle!

305
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,652
I'll remember who all of you all are!

306
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:18,918
You're down to twenty seconds.

307
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,251
I think Yuka should stay!

308
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:21,358
I agree! Yuka, you stay!

309
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,651
I'm with them, too!

310
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:23,383
Huh?!

311
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:25,855
Go on, go!

312
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,880
Hey! Don't push me!

313
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,922
Yuka!

314
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,910
I'm sorry, but we have no choice!

315
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:36,806
Okay, one more.

316
00:16:38,021 --> 00:16:40,820
Ten... nine... eight...

317
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:44,830
<i>Now, all we have to do is jump out and say "Gotcha!"</i>

318
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,190
Wait!

319
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:48,529
Why'd you do that?

320
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,220
Is that... Huh?

321
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,891
Four... three... two... one...

322
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:54,558
Hey!

323
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:55,395
Hm?

324
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,993
This way! Hurry!

325
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,569
M-my eyes...

326
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,010
What the hell was that?

327
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:09,302
Was that a camera flash?

328
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:13,314
Wait a minute, does that mean
Rumi actually saved all of them?

329
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,185
I suppose deep down they were friends after all...

330
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,146
If you're not able to get along without putting someone
else down in the process, it can't be real friendship.

331
00:17:21,512 --> 00:17:23,640
You're right. I guess it can't.

332
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:24,640
But then...

333
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,434
If she knew it was fake,

334
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:29,578
and still wanted to reach out to them,

335
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:33,063
then I guess her friendship must be real.

336
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:40,009
That was a dangerous bridge you crossed.

337
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,499
One misstep, and there could've been a big problem here.

338
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:46,041
Yeah... Sorry about that.

339
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:47,613
I'm not accusing you.

340
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:50,566
In fact, I think you did well for the short time you had.

341
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:52,878
Even though my methods were pretty terrible?

342
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:55,513
True. You kind of are a pretty terrible person.

343
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,650
I was talking about my methods here.

344
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,825
Why must you feel the need to criticize me?

345
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,429
Well, you're terrible for
coming up with a method like that.

346
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:08,269
But maybe... it's because you're so terrible, that
you can get close to people who've hit rock bottom.

347
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,111
It's a good trait to have.

348
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,841
Well, that was a lousy compliment.

349
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,393
No "thank you" for you, I see.

350
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:34,783
Hm? Well, it's not like I
really did anything good tonight.

351
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:37,625
Getting rid of that clique will make her life much easier.

352
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,830
They won't be able to gang up on her.

353
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,270
Regardless of your horrible method,

354
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:44,492
it seems your plan actually worked.

355
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,003
Shocker.

356
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,253
So...

357
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,132
Even if nobody thanks you for it,

358
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:53,901
I think it's alright if something
good happens from this whole experience.

359
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,029
Sorry for the wait!

360
00:18:56,447 --> 00:18:58,215
Here! Sparklers!

361
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:02,142
Yukinon! Look!

362
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:04,044
Hey, watch it with those things.

363
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:04,906
Yay!

364
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:06,436
Hm?

365
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,318
Sorry I made you play such a rough part out there.

366
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:14,239
I actually didn't mind.

367
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,474
In fact, I don't really feel bad about it.

368
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:18,310
Except...

369
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,629
It made me remember something from a while ago...

370
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:24,898
when I saw something similar happening

371
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:26,429
and didn't do anything about it.

372
00:19:30,117 --> 00:19:35,251
Hey, what do you think it would've been
like if we'd gone to the same grade school?

373
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:38,310
Well, I'm guessing your school
would've just had one more lonely kid.

374
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:42,810
Personally, I think a lot of
things would've ended up differently.

375
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,326
But still, I don't think...

376
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,591
we could've actually been friend's way back then.

377
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:52,016
I'm just kidding.

378
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,069
Good work, everyone.

379
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:01,180
Camp isn't over until you're home safe!

380
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,666
Be careful on your way back.

381
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,452
Okay, dismissed!

382
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:07,158
Komachi, let's do some shopping on the way home.

383
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:08,425
Aye aye, sir.

384
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,392
Hey, Yukino, why don't you come with us?

385
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:10,904
Hm?

386
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,178
Hey! What's up, Lil Sis?

387
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,573
What the...

388
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:23,649
You've been away from home far too long, Yukino!

389
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:26,126
I was worried about you so I came to get you myself.

390
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,275
Oh hey, it's Hikigaya!

391
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,647
Was this a date? Oh, I bet it was, you silly boy!

392
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,315
I told you, we're not like that!

393
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:33,768
Hey, you're making Hikki uncomfortable!

394
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:38,366
Wait, are you Hikigaya's girlfriend?

395
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:42,148
No! No way! I'm his classmate, Yui Yuigahama.

396
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,215
Classmate?

397
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:46,105
Yep! Oh, thank goodness!

398
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,635
I was starting to think of what I should
do if you were getting in Yukino's way!

399
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,923
You better not lay a hand on
Hikigaya. He belongs only to Yukino!

400
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,271
No, I do not. No, he does not.

401
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,881
See? They're in perfect sync!

402
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,223
Haruno, don't you think that's enough now?

403
00:20:58,397 --> 00:20:59,963
Good to see you, Shizu.

404
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:01,980
I've told you not to call me that.

405
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:04,246
Teacher, you know Haruno?

406
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:05,844
She used to be my student.

407
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,437
So, you mean...

408
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,204
Well, Yukino, let's get going.

409
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:12,523
You know mom is waiting for us.

410
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:13,068
Huh?

411
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,417
Sorry, I must decline your invitation.

412
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:20,061
I can't go with you.

413
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,018
What? Okay...

414
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:25,544
Goodbye.

415
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:29,796
Hey, I'll see you later, Hikigaya!

416
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:33,095
Tsuzuki, we can go now.

417
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,242
Hey, was that car the...

418
00:21:40,662 --> 00:21:45,112
Eh, who knows? Big fancy black cars
all look the same to someone like me.

419
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,702
I was too focused on the pain.

420
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:49,804
Plus, I can't be bothered to
remember every car that I see.

421
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:54,616
<i>I said that even though I knew better.</i>

422
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,376
<i>The truth is, I recognized it the moment I saw it.</i>

423
00:21:59,347 --> 00:22:04,914
<i>I didn't get to see Yukino Yukinoshita
again for the rest of summer break.</i>

424
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:45,461
It just happened that way. Don't expect it.

425
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:49,616
I know, but for me I just wanna know more.

426
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:51,646
I just wish I knew you better.

427
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:53,741
I really want us all to be closer.

428
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:56,727
If something's wrong I want us to help each other!

429
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:57,896
And then...

430
00:23:59,344 --> 00:23:59,955
Then...

431
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:03,892
I mean, I'm pretty sure that I'd...

432
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:09,779
Next time: "For the Third Time, He Turns
Back on the Path from Whence He Came."
