00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:35,625
[HINAMI] The CCG's white
reaper, Kisho Arima.

2
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,125
I'm going to die here.

3
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,750
Hold on, Arima.

4
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,541
She's not fighting.

5
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,458
So, if it's okay,

6
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,916
would you allow me
to take her into custody?

[AKIRA]
November 11th.

8
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,250
On this day,

9
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:57,250
the CCG planned and successfully
carried out two missions.

10
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,583
The auction raid,

11
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,375
and the quinque steel
transport escort mission.

12
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,041
[AKIRA] We received a tip
that Aogiri Tree

13
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,166
was plotting to hijack
a shipment of quinque steel.

14
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,916
So we used it as bait
and ambushed them.

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,375
The mission was carried
out by the S3 Squad,

16
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:16,500
with Special Investigator
Marude presiding.

17
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,791
After the auction raid
mission commenced,

18
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,541
Aogiri Tree ghouls attacked
our transports, as we expected.

19
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,125
The S3 Squad dispatched
them with relative ease.

20
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,791
Their initial mission completed,

21
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,750
the S3 Squad rushed
to the auction house.

22
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,958
[UTA]
It's time we left.

23
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,458
Fine.

00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,666
[MIZA]
Scatter and retreat! Now!

25
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,125
[AYATO]
No! Hinami's still in there!

26
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,458
We're outnumbered.
There's nothing we can do!

27
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,291
[NAKI]
We have to run!

28
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,416
[TORSO]

Matsumae.

30
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,250
We'll have to seek out a proper
meal through other means.

31
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,958
Right, Master Mirumo.

Mado.

37
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,916
[AKIRA] The Quinx Squad
determined the time and location

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,625
of the auction,
then infiltrated it,

39
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,000
slew the S-rated
ghoul, Nutcracker,

40
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:33,375
and supported Suzuya Squad
in eliminating Big Madam.

41
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,166
Quinx Squad played a key
role in this mission.

42
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,541
And their reputation has
greatly improved, as a result.

43
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,708
A number of Aogiri Tree
members were killed

44
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:45,458
by an unknown party
as they fled the scene.

45
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:49,000
Many of the bodies found
were partially consumed.

46
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:55,083
[AKIRA] If Takizawa really
is alive, then perhaps...

47
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,791
No. That's expecting too much.

Ginshi Shirazu.
Saiko Yonebayashi.

I appoint you first
class investigators.

I appoint you associate

Juzo Suzuya. Matsuri Washu.

64
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,250
I appoint you
special investigators.

65
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,916
[SHIRAZU] So you and Urie
are first class now.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,416
That's the same rank Mr. Sass
was not too long ago.

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,916
To be honest, it hasn't
quite sunk in for me yet.

00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,250
[TAKEOMI]
Urie, congratulations.

69
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,625
Yeah.

70
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,500
[URIE] So you killed a ghoul
with your bare hands.

71
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,500
Think I'm impressed?
Just stay out of my sight.

00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,166
[AKIRA]
Outstanding work.

76
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,250
You've already made
senior investigator.

[HAISE]
Thank you very much,

79
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,375
Stop that. You'll make me blush.

80
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:04,291
By the way,
any word on Fueguchi?

81
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,666
She's still undergoing
questioning for the time being.

82
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,833
She'll certainly prove to be

83
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,166
a valuable source
of information.

84
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,250
But do mind the
appropriate custody period.

85
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,041
[HAISE] I heard that
Fueguchi was involved

86
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,666
in the death of Akira's father.

87
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,583
And I effectively
saved her life.

88
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,333
Could Akira be okay with that?

89
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:31,083
Or is it like I've poured
fuel onto a smoldering fire?

[SATOMI]
Senior Investigator.

00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,833
As of today, I've been assigned
to the Shimoguchi Squad.

00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,833
I'm First Class

00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,416
Save it for the brass.

Nothing good is
gonna come to you

from becoming part of my squad.

102

[SATOMI]
We know, sir.

103
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,791
Suit yourselves, then.

104
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,166
Your "Nutcracker."
will be completed

105
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,750
in just a moment.

00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,625
You should be
looking forward to it.

107

an excellent quinque.

[URIE grunting]

109

[URIE]
More... More!

110
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,916
I can't let Kuroiwa beat me!

111
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,041
[JUZO] You want two going up
while the third one falls.

112
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,583
Catch it and cut.

113
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,625
And if you throw 'em
all up at once,

114
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,541
you'll have time to grab more!

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,958
[MUTSUKI]
Not sure I can do all that.

116
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,250
Honestly, I think two
might be my limit.

117
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,875
[JUZO] Aw, are you sure?
From everything I've seen,

118
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,500
you're really good
at fighting with knives.

119
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,750
Hey, Suzuya.

120
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,291
Do you ever get worried

121
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,916
that you'll hurt yourself
with your own knife?

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's never crossed my mind.

123
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,000
Me and pain don't really talk.

124
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,125
Is that what you're
scared of, Toru?

125
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,916
[JUZO]
In battle,

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,875
it's those who have tamed
their weaknesses that win.

127
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,958
[MUTSUKI]
"Tamed their weaknesses."

128
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,208
I like that expression.

129
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,458
I didn't come up with it.

130
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,166
I stole it from my teacher.

Thanks for coming by.

136

Having an active-duty
investigator come and lecture

137
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,791
always goes a long way
to motivate the students.

138

Well, feel free to
call on me anytime.

139
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,875
[TOKAGE] So their stupidity
hasn't worn you down yet?

140
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,125
Not at all.

141
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,541
I thought they were
pleasant and cheerful.

142
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,875
[TOKAGE] A few of them already
have criminal records.

143
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:17,916
Which reminds me,

144
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,875
how has young
Mutsuki been doing?

145
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,458
He was always a problem student.

146
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,750
Was he really?

147
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, he's earnest
and hardworking now.

148
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,958
Special investigator Suzuya's
been coaching him lately.

149
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,500
Ah, Suzuya.

150
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,708
Well, I'll see you around.

151

[MUTSUKI]
Shirazu!

152
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,083
[SHIRAZU]
Huh?

153
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,625
I get that, but custody
of a ghoul always

154
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,083
goes to the investigator who
defeated it, and that's you.

155
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,541
And I bet that Nutcracker
will make a strong quinque.

156
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,458
[MUTSUKI]
With a more powerful weapon,

157
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,750
you'll be able to stand up
against more powerful ghouls.

158
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,583
[SHIRAZU]
Yeah. Guess you're right.

159
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,833
[HAISE]
Welcome home, you two!

160
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,166
Did you have a good day?
Was it fun?

161
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,541
You're not hurt, are you?

162
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,833
[SHIRAZU]
No, we're fine.

163
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,291
Good.

164
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,208
Then come along, hurry up,
wash your hands and change!

165
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,208
I've invited some very special
guests to come over tonight.

166
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,708
So let's try to impress 'em!

167
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,916
You sure are enjoying
yourself, Teach.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,333
[HAISE] Of course I am,
it's a celebratory dinner party!

169
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,458
Come back and help me
when you're done, okay?

170
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,458
Sure thing!

171
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,375
Ugh. All right, I'll do it.

172
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,416
[SHIRAZU, MUTSUKI, SAIKO]
Ooh...

173
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
[SHIRAZU yelping]

174
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,500
[HAISE]
Shirazu, be careful!

175
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,875
Saiko, it's burning!

176
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,375
[SAIKO]
That's why they call it flambé!

177
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,416
[MUTSUKI]
Urie. What'cha doin'?

178
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,791
Gonna go work out.

179
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,666
[URIE]
I won't let Kuroiwa beat me.

180
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,416
[MUTSUKI] You can't!
We've got guests coming.

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,458
You can count me out.

182
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,000
[MUTSUKI firmly]
Urie.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,416
You're helping us.
Get this stuff.

184
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,833
[thud]

185
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,875
[URIE panting]

186
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,250
[HAISE] Urie, I'm so sorry.
That must've been heavy.

187
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,416
[URIE]
No.

188
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,750
By the way, someone
sent you a package.

189
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,583
Wonder who?

190
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,166
[SHIRAZU] I told you to cut it
out with the flambé, Saiko!

191
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,500
[SAIKO]
I've got it this time!

192
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,625
[SHIRAZU]
No. No! Gimme that bottle!

193
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,833
[MUTSUKI]
Hey, Teach?

194
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,416
Coming!

195
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,833
[SHIRAZU, MUTSUKI, URIE]
Ooh!

196
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,583
Thanks, guys.

197
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,458
You were all a huge
help with this.

198
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,416
[doorbell rings]

199
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,416
Whatever you've made,
it smells delicious.

200
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,041
Hope we're not too early.

201
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,583
Hello, welcome home!

202
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,916
Or, I should say,
welcome to our home.

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,666
I'm glad you two
could make it tonight.

204
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,291
--[SHIRAZU] Oh! Yum!
--[MUTSUKI] This is delicious!

205
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,541
[SAIKO]
Amazing.

206
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:34,791
The food is even better
than usual tonight.

207
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,291
[HAISE]
Akira, we made spicy curry, too.

208
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,875
[AKIRA]
Oh, thank you.

209
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,333
I've never made it
quite like this,

210
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,041
so let me know what you think.

211
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,791
It's an exact reproduction
of the Mado family recipe!

212
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:49,291
Ah. Delicious.
It reminds me of home.

213
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,916
You don't mind if
I sneak a bite--

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,333
[ARIMA]
Wait.

215
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,666
I suggest that you refrain.

216
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,375
The Mado family
spicy curry is SS-rated.

217
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,625
Are you okay?

218
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,791
He doesn't look it.
Hang in there, man!

219
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,333
--[AKIRA] He can take it.
--[MUTSUKI] Give him some water!

220
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,000
--Or do we have any milk?
--[SAIKO] I think he's dead.

221
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,083
[SHIRAZU]
Did you really beat a ghoul

222
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,708
with an umbrella once?

223
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,125
[ARIMA] Well, I didn't have
my quinque close at hand.

224
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,208
And this umbrella
was quite durable.

225
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,916
[AKIRA] Yeah, I've heard
more stories like that

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,208
about Arima than I can count.

227
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,583
[HAISE]
Juzo told me one that I always

228
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,125
wanted to ask you about.

229
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,916
Didn't you fight in
your sleep once?

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,500
[SHIRAZU]
Uh! You're kidding me!

231
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,833
[MUTSUKI]
No way is that one true.

232
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,333
[ARIMA]
I was sleepy...

233
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,750
[SHIRAZU]
Like how sleepy?

234
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,333
[MUTSUKI]
Were your eyes closed?

235
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,625
[SHIRAZU]
Whew. Man, that was good.

236
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,458
[MUTSUKI]
I'm completely stuffed.

237
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,583
[SAIKO]
There's always room for dessert.

238
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,791
[URIE]
How do you do it?

239
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,000
I brought coffee,

240
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,250
and I also got some
presents for all of you.

241
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,000
[SHIRAZU, MUTSUKI]
Huh?

242
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,958
[SAIKO]
Uh...

243
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,750
[SHIRAZU]
Really?

244
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah. To celebrate
your promotion.

245
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,583
Whoa. Thank you, I love it!

246
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,250
[gasps]

247
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,291
Nice. Thanks.

248
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,083
[HAISE] This one's for you,
Akira. You got promoted, too.

249
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,625
Thanks, I appreciate it, Haise.

250
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,583
[QUINX SQUAD chattering]

251
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,708
You are truly like
a father to them.

252
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,500
You really think so?

253
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,166
This isn't much, but here.

254
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,791
But I wasn't promoted.

255
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,416
It's to thank you
for helping me out.

256
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,000
From my name. Thank you.

257
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,375
[HAISE]
That takes care of that.

258
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,916
Hey, Urie. What's up?

259
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,291
Got training to do.

260
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,375
Seems kinda late for that.

261
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,958
Well, don't overdo it, okay?

262
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,291
[URIE]
Who are you, my mom?

263
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,250
Now that I've been
promoted and all,

264
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,250
I expect the ghouls
I get pitted against

265
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,250
will be a lot more powerful.

266
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,125
I need to be prepared for that.

267
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,250
Well, I can't argue
with you on that point.

268
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,791
But try to remember that you
aren't alone in this, okay?

269
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,875
There's a reason
why we're a team.

270
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,791
It's so that we can cover
each other's weak points.

271
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,041
[URIE]
Right.

272
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,958
[URIE]
How pretentious.

273
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,541
[URIE]
Although... He has a point.

274
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,916
[HAISE]
A mask.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,708
Was this the eyepatch ghoul's?

276
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:53,833
Ken Kaneki. I wonder
how that's written.

277
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,333
If I knew the
characters, I could--

278
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,166
[HAISE]
Sen Takatsuki.

279
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,583
"To Ken Kaneki."

280
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:17,333
[HAISE] A novel by Sen
Takatsuki, and a mask.

281
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,333
Who could've sent them?

282
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,416
There's no way that they
were sent to me by accident.

283
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,541
The package had
a return address.

284
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,666
It must've come from
someone who knew Kaneki.

285
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,833
Maybe I should try to find them.

286
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,750
Oh. Thanks a lot.

287
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:50,833
[HAISE] This aroma.
Why's it so familiar?

288
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,125
[sighs]

289
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,166
[OROCHI]
Hey, gimme a refill.

290
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,583
[TOUKA]
Brew it yourself, ya bum.

291
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,250
Uta.

292
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,166
Tell me, do the clowns see
him as a problem or what?

293
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,958
Do you have any idea
what they plan to do?

294
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:22,625
No. The boss has yet to
let me in on her thinking.

295
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,000
[YOMO]
Hm.

296
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,708
[UTA]
What about all of you?

297
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:28,208
Still waiting for Kaneki?

298
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,375
--Or perhaps you--
--[TOUKA] Uta.

299
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,000
Huh?

300
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,375
For my part,

301
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,875
I'll just keep doing what
I made up my mind to.

302
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,375
[OROCHI]
Hm.

303
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:43,291
Right. Thank you for the coffee.

304
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,833
Yours really is
the best to be had.

305
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:52,458
[UTA] And Touka. Even after
all that's happened,

306
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,750
Ken is still a special
customer to me.

307
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,416
[door bell chimes]

308
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:02,375
[SHIBA] Hm. Well, your
levels seem to be stable.

309
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,583
[URIE]
Is that right?

310
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,375
I was told you lost
control on a mission.

311
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,333
[URIE]
Who the hell ratted me out?

312
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,416
[SHIBA]
How'd you manage to recover?

313
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,958
I focused my attention,
just like I was trained to.

314
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,458
So that was enough.

315
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:24,458
Hey, Doctor? About Mutsuki.

316
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,666
What is it?

317
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,958
I can't discuss any
personal information.

318
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:31,666
It's fine. Forget about it.

319
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,583
[URIE]
There's no way he doesn't know.

320
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,291
Please excuse me.

321
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,375
[URIE]
Shirazu?

322
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,833
[SHIRAZU]
Guess what, Haru?

323
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,416
Your big bro's been promoted.

324
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,291
I'm a second class
investigator now.

325
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,666
They even raised my pay a bit.

326
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,708
So hang tight.

327
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,083
I'm gonna be rakin'
it in before long,

328
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,125
then we'll get ya fixed up.

329
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,208
And don't worry.

330
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,375
I'm not in over
my head or anything.

331
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:03,041
If I do run into trouble,
I've got my friends.

332
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,708
They're all super awesome.

333
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:08,916
Urie and Toru just became
first class investigators.

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,166
Yeah. They're all great people.

335
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,166
I'll introduce ya
to them someday.

336
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,208
Everything's goin' good.

337
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,125
You look pretty,
you know that, Haru?

338
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,750
[HAISE] The CCG didn't
have much material

339
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,791
on Ken Kaneki,
which strikes me as odd.

340
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,458
There was an article saying
he got hit by a steel beam

341
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,916
at a construction site.

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,083
And then there was his
missing person's report.

343
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:08,250
He went to Kamii University
and he had no family.

344
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,208
I wonder if he had any friends.

345
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,166
This place...

346
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:50,791
[MEN panting]

347
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,708
[BOTH yelp]

348
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,666
[MEN scream]

349
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,125
[KANAE]
Master Shu.

350
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:10,416
[TSUKIYAMA]
It hurts. I'm so very hungry.

351
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,750
Isn't there something?
Anything I can eat?

352
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,750
[KANAE] Master Shu.
This is heartbreaking.

353
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,041
So heartbreaking.

354
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:58,666
[clock ticking]

355
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,125
[TATARA]
Impossible.

356
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,250
[UI] I'm Kori Ui, captain
of the S1. Greetings.

357
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,625
[CHIE]
Not at all.

358
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,625
[YORIKO] Always wanted
to work at a coffee shop...

359
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,333
[MATSURI] I'd like to use
everything I learned in Germany

360
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,166
to take down..

361
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,833
[CHIE]
That's most of it.

362
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,708
[MATSUMAE]
A trap?

363
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:12,583
[TSUKIYAMA]
I am a gourmet.

364
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,833
