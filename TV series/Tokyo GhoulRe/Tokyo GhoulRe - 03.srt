1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:11,791
[KANAE]
Master Shu. Here.

2
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:15,541
[KANAE]
Tell me.

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:18,458
Can you smell anything, Master?

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,208
[sniffs]

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:21,541
[TSUKIYAMA]
No, I can't.

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,000
[gasps]

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,625
[TSUKIYAMA]
However...

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,125
There's something
familiar about them.

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:35,708
At any rate, I'm very
fond of the design.

10
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,958
[gasps]

11
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,458
[KANAE]
Master Shu...

12
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,791
[KANAE]
This is heartbreaking.

13
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,958
[URIE]
I'm not sure what to expect.

14
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:35,750
I don't feel any
different. Not yet.

15
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,541
Sir, I have a request.

16
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,541
I'd like to raise
my Frame level.

17
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,458
And may I ask why?

18
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,333
Are you hoping you can
avenge your father's death?

19
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,958
[URIE] Would you quit
prying and just give me

20
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,208
your approval already?

21
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,083
[knocking]

22
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,625
[URIE]
Huh. Kisho Arima?

23
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,791
Kisho.

24
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,625
Urie here says he
would like to undergo

25
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,583
Frame release surgery.
Your opinion?

26
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,000
[URIE]
Why the hell is he asking Arima?

27
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,750
Tell me.

28
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,166
Do you understand the risk
involved with this procedure?

29
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,416
[URIE]
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,041
And you have your
mentor's consent?

31
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,583
[URIE]
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,083
[ARIMA]
Hm. Well, in that case,

33
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,208
I have no problem with it.

34
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,708
[ARIMA]
I'm confident Urie can handle

35
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,958
the increase in power.

36
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:36,041
[URIE]
Kisho Arima acknowledged me.

37
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,375
I'm the only one
who can do this.

38
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,041
I won't lose
control like Sasaki.

39
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,500
[door opens]

40
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,875
[SHIRAZU]
Ah! Look who's here!

41
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,541
Glad to see ya back
from the hospital.

42
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,083
[URIE]
I'm not 100 percent yet.

43
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,333
So, I've gotta relax and
take it easy for a while.

44
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,750
[SHIRAZU]
Those doctor's orders?

45
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,541
Or are you tryin' to get
outta workin' with me

46
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,000
'cause you're pissed
I'm captain?

47
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,333
--C'mon, no hard feelin's, man.
--[URIE] You're not funny.

48
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,666
--[laughs]
--Now get your hands off of me.

49
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:16,916
Huh?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,291
[yelps]

51
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,208
So, what'll we do?

52
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,166
I dunno.

53
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,708
I have no clue how
we should proceed.

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,458
What's wrong, Third Class?

55
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,333
Seems like the squad
we're gonna be workin' with

56
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,750
has pinpointed
Nutcracker's location.

57
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,458
I've got a feelin' that things
are gonna get hairy, ya know?

58
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,041
We're supposed to
start a joint operation

59
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,000
with Suzuya Squad tomorrow.

60
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,000
It'll be dangerous,
so we need everyone's help,

61
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,500
including you-know-who upstairs.

62
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,375
[URIE]
Juzo Suzuya's squad?

63
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,375
Then let's go have
a chat with Saiko.

64
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,958
What? Uh, you think
she'll open the door?

65
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,083
[SAIKO] Woohoo! I finally
got the new lion head.

66
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,333
Oh, wow, and it's made
of titanium, too. Awesome!

67
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,833
Somebody's coming this way.

68
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,125
Two of them.

69
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,083
No. Three of 'em.

70
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,166
--[knocking]
--[SHIRAZU] Open up, Saiko!

71
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,250
We know you're in there!
Open the door...!

72
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,875
[SAIKO]
I'm a crustacean.

73
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,416
A mussel hiding in its shell.

74
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,416
[MUTSUKI sighs]
It's no use.

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,166
Then we don't have a choice.

76
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,666
No, I guess not.

77
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,916
[URIE]
Let's go.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,250
[gasps]

79
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:33,541
[SAIKO] Wha--?! You used Kagunes
to break down my door?!

80
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,333
Don't tell me that
you guys are Quinxes!

81
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,666
[SHIRAZU]
You are, too!

82
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,333
[yelps]

83
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,916
[SHIRAZU grumbles] Look,
we've got a mission, okay?

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,625
You gonna help or not?

85
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,125
Nah. I don't really wanna.

86
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,750
Captain Urie gets to me.

87
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,291
[SHIRAZU]
I'm the captain now.

88
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,541
Wha--? They finally fired Urie?

89
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,583
Bet he did something
indecent, didn't he?

90
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,125
[URIE]
Shut up, you troll.

91
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,000
Can we get back on topic?

92
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,375
You're workin' with us
on this investigation.

93
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,791
Captain's orders.

94
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,000
Why? Come on!

95
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,208
What kinda horrible
human being would force me

96
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,166
to give up my slacker lifestyle?

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,166
[SHIRAZU]
You're cool with bein'

98
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,333
a good-for-nothin'
couch potato?

99
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:11,208
I'm goin' back to my cocoon!

100
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,208
Come out and face the music,
ya little bagworm!

101
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,166
[SAIKO]
Stop it! Don't skin me!

102
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,000
Bagworms are precious!
Everyone likes silk!

103
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,166
Yonebayashi.

104
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,416
[SAIKO]
Yeah, what's up?

105
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,916
You haven't heard the news?

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,333
Rumor has it that the higher ups
are currently discussing

107
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,375
whether to fire you.

108
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,125
Whoa, for real?

109
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,708
[URIE] Did you think
they wouldn't notice?

110
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,500
The CCG is well aware that
you've been collecting a salary

111
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,666
while living a life of leisure.

112
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,000
They're examining spending
and attempting to cut waste,

113
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,666
which puts you at risk.

114
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,458
It'd be difficult for you
to get by in regular society,

115
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,208
what with your "physical
condition" and all.

116
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:48,875
Oh, yeah. That would
suck, all right.

117
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,000
[URIE] Idiot. Read your
consent form again.

118
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,791
As a precaution, Quinxes are
guaranteed financial support,

119
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,125
even after they retire.

120
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,000
So, how do I save my job?

121
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,916
Go to work and
carry out your duties.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,875
You might impress them before
they decide to fire you.

123
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,125
That's your only hope.

124
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,958
Go to work. Carry out duties.

125
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,375
Impress them.

126
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,833
I'll take this
damn thing, and--!

127
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,833
[SAIKO]
And log out of it for a while.

128
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,583
'Kay, Captain Shirazu!

129
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:24,666
Saiko Yonebayashi is
ready to get to work!

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,333
Seriously? Good to hear.

131
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,250
It took ya long enough.

132
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,291
We're gonna be heading out

133
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,500
bright and early
tomorrow at 7:30 am.

134
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,125
--Don't oversleep, okay?
--[SAIKO] Aye, aye, sir!

135
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,125
In that case, I'm gonna
go to bed right now!

136
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,083
I'll see you gentlemen
in the morning!

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,375
[SHIRAZU]
Urie.

138
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,125
I just wanna thank you
for convincing her to help.

139
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,250
You may get on my nerves,

140
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,500
but I guess you're
not such a bad guy.

141
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:50,875
That was impressive.

142
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,875
Yeah, I wasn't
expecting that tactic.

143
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,833
But, I've got one
question for ya.

144
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,125
Where was that motivation
when you were the captain?

145
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,000
I've had some time to
think about what I've done.

146
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,291
[URIE] And I've learned there's
a better way to go about it.

147
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,083
We've waited long enough
for the others to arrive.

148
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,916
Shall we get started?

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,208
[URIE] Just as I suspected,
threatening Saiko

150
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,541
didn't change a thing.

151
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,708
Her time management skills
are completely lacking.

152
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,833
She's a gear that simply
doesn't mesh with our machine.

153
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,416
[JUZO]
Whoop-oop-oop!

154
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
[URIE] If we try to force her
to do her job, and do it well,

155
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,416
"Shirazu Squad" will
implode from within.

156
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,041
And if that happens,

157
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,833
then the captain's
position will be--

158
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:50,125
Sorry I'm late, everybody!

159
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,375
[SUZUYA SQUAD]
Investigator Suzuya!

160
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,208
Good morning to you, sir!

161
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,583
Morning!

162
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,250
Good to see ya, Juzo!

163
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,041
[JUZO]
Haise!

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,750
[JUZO] Oh! You always
come through for me!

165
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,666
[SHIRAZU]
Hey! We're here!

166
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,000
Sorry we're late!

167
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,125
[panting]

168
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,458
[HAISE]
Shirazu! And Saiko?

169
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,708
Sorry, Mr. Sass!

170
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:24,333
I tried so hard to be on time!

171
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,500
It's perfectly fine.

172
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,041
I know Saiko can be a handful,

173
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,583
so thanks for bringing
her along with you.

174
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,125
[HANBEI] Now, if you'll
please refer to the handout.

175
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,166
What you see before you is a
list of orders for "ingredients"

176
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,458
that were confiscated
from Nutcracker's home.

177
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,250
These are ingredients?

178
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,625
[HANBEI] Yes, we believe
Nutcracker is abducting people

179
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,958
to fulfill these orders.

180
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,708
She's gathering them as
goods to be auctioned off.

181
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,708
So, like human trafficking?

182
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,583
Yes, exactly, but they're
being sold to ghouls.

183
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:56,333
Whoa, wait, does that mean
the highest bidder eats them?

184
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,583
Yeah.

185
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,416
Sometimes they choose
to keep them, like pets.

186
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,375
Well, that's disturbing.

187
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,250
I ask that you approach
this mission with caution.

188
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:11,125
The SS-rated ghoul,
Big Madam, may be involved.

189
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,375
As a result, there's a
possibility that this

190
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:17,333
will become a joint
operation with Division II.

191
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,666
[SHIRAZU]
Holy crap.

192
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,416
This investigation's even
bigger than I expected.

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
No kidding. I was shocked
when he said we might

194
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,208
be working with Division II.

195
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,541
[URIE]
Excuse me, Sasaki?

196
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,291
That's right, you have
a checkup today.

197
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,000
Best of luck to you.

198
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,500
[URIE]
I'll see you later.

199
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,875
Aw, man.

200
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,625
Do you think he's
gonna be all right?

201
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,625
Yeah, he says his
Rc levels are unstable.

202
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,208
[SHIRAZU] Guess he's more
delicate than I thought.

203
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,958
[DONATO]
So, Torso got away from you.

204
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:02,958
Yes, but your insight
helped immensely.

205
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,541
So, thank you for that.

206
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,708
No problem.

207
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,625
I couldn't care less
what happens to him.

208
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,958
It makes no difference to me.

209
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:10,958
Anyway.

210
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,666
What'd you wanna talk about?

211
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
[DONATO]
Well, Haise.

212
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,208
I wanted to ask you how you
feel about your memories,

213
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,208
or lack thereof.

214
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,083
I can tell that
you're being tormented

215
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,416
by conflicting thoughts.
One moment you think

216
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,083
"I don't miss my memories,"

217
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:29,958
and the next you can't help
but wonder who you truly are.

218
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,958
Let me ask you something.

219
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,583
What would you do
if there was a way

220
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,708
to get them back?

221
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,916
Would you choose to
regain your memories?

222
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,833
[OROCHI]
Doesn't matter how hard you try,

223
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,833
you're irredeemable.

224
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,375
What brought this on?

225
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,333
Why're you asking me about this?

226
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,916
Why now? Well.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,708
There's another ghoul who
has a personal interest.

228
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,333
[HAISE]
Another ghoul? Really?

229
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,041
That's right.

230
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,916
If you decide you want
to unlock your memories,

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,625
he holds one of the keys
that will help you do so.

232
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,541
His name is...

233
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,750
[HAISE]
All right, guys.

234
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,000
For this mission,
we become women!

235
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,250
[SHIRAZU]
Hm?

236
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,208
[KANAE] Master Shu says that
he doesn't smell anything.

237
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,583
Really? Nothing?

238
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,833
'Fraid not.

239
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,750
We've no need for these
dingy shorts anymore.

240
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,291
Get rid of them.

241
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,291
Are you sure?

242
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,291
<i>Hartnackig</i> ! Roses do not lie!

243
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,583
Incidentally, may I
ask who those

244
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,500
undergarments belong to, Chie?

245
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,583
[CHIE]
A ghoul investigator.

246
00:12:58,666 --> 00:12:59,833
What's his name?

247
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,916
[CHIE]
Haise Sasaki.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,208
[KANAE]
The Guinea pig!

249
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,250
I know you were a
schoolmate of Master Shu,

250
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,875
but that means nothing to me.

251
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,583
You're just a lowly human.

252
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,666
Better tread carefully,

253
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,625
because I can kill
you at any time.

254
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:25,083
[CHIE] Shu Tsukiyama, huh?
He seems interesting.

255
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,666
I would like to invite you
to dinner and a show

256
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,166
tomorrow night.

257
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,083
[TSUKIYAMA]
I won't ask again!

258
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:36,750
I demand that you answer me.
What do I see in your eyes?

259
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,000
Dear Hori. You won't
believe this.

260
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,291
I've stumbled upon an
incredibly rare ingredient.

261
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:43,708
Once I've tasted it,

262
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,833
I'll give you my thoughts,

263
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,500
even if it takes
all night to explain.

264
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,875
[TSUKIYAMA] Hori, would you
tell me something?

265
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,458
What is a "Gourmet," anyway?

266
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,041
[CHIE] Life is boring
without you, Tsukiyama.

267
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,083
So get well soon.

268
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,791
[SHIRAZU]
Whoa. You kiddin' me?

269
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,166
No way. I ain't dancin', brah!

270
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,291
You're off your nut!

271
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,875
Now watch your language, Shi!

272
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,333
That wasn't ladylike.

273
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,666
[SHIRAZU] How can I be
a better lady, Mr. Sass?

274
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,375
Just try to be more feminine.

275
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,041
[SHIRAZU]
Same for you, Toru!

276
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,375
Uh, yeah, well.

277
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:32,375
[SHIRAZU]
And, Saiko... Never mind.

278
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,416
Hey!

279
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,166
I know this seems strange,

280
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,708
but you saw the Nutcracker's
ingredients list yourself.

281
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,916
Apparently she's on
the hunt for young women.

282
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,250
We had no choice
but to go undercover.

283
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,750
[SHIRAZU] Ugh, there's
gotta be another way.

284
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,083
Look. Against the wall.

285
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,125
Yeah, that's her, all right.

286
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,041
[SAIKO]
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

287
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,208
[SHIRAZU]
Hey, big boy. You're a cutie.

288
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,416
You wanna dance with me?

289
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,541
I suck at this.

290
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,333
[laughs]

291
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,708
I need to try and
catch Nutcracker's eye.

292
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,708
But how do I do that?

293
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:10,791
[gasps]

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,166
[MUTSUKI]
Don't look at me.

295
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,958
Don't look, don't look,
don't look, don't look.

296
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,875
Don't look, don't
look, don't look--

297
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,916
[gasps]

298
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,208
[MUTSUKI]
Oh, hey, Teach.

299
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,458
Calm down, Toru.
You look fantastic.

300
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,750
Uh. Thanks a lot.

301
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,166
[MUTSUKI] That's not what
has me worried, though.

302
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,000
I've gotta find a way
to calm my nerves.

303
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,583
[SAIKO]
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

304
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,250
Whoa! Down girl!

305
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,125
[chuckles]

306
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,250
[NICO]
Look, Roma.

307
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,750
There's a familiar
face in the crowd.

308
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,375
You're right, I see him, Nico!

309
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,958
Is that the "Haise" we've
heard so much about?

310
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,375
It's kinda hard to tell
since he's dressed

311
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,625
like a woman right now,

312
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,208
but he sure does look
like Kaneki, doesn't he?

313
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,083
Definitely.

314
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,208
[ROMA]
I don't know about you,

315
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,375
but just looking at
him pisses me off.

316
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,208
I mean, why's he
smiling like that?

317
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,708
[NICO]
Maybe he's happy?

318
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,708
[ROMA] Yeah, that's the
problem! I don't like it.

319
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,166
I wanna see him writhing
around in agony!

320
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,916
Kaneki's most beautiful
when he's drowning

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,208
in a swamp of tragedy!

322
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,458
Jeez.

323
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,833
You really are all about
yourself, aren't you?

324
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,125
I want the old Kaneki back.

325
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,000
He was such a handsome,
angsty, tortured soul.

326
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,250
But...

327
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,833
I guess this Haise guy
would have to die first.

328
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,333
Indeed, Roma.

329
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,333
Ever watched someone
spill a glass of wine?

330
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,750
It's beautiful, isn't it?

331
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,708
[DONATO] What would you do
if there was a way

332
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,333
to get them back?

333
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,291
Would you choose to
regain your memories?

334
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:41,833
[HAISE] If I was given
the choice. I guess...

335
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:42,708
[SHIRAZU]
Mr. Sass.

336
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,125
[HAISE gasps]

337
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,541
Uh, I dunno, lady.

338
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,000
That sounds kind of
sketch to me.

339
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,583
[NUTCRACKER]
There'll be some top-notch VIP's

340
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,750
at this party. You could
make a lot of money.

341
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,916
Yeah?

342
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,375
[MUTSUKI laughing]
Check it out! We match!

343
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,375
Mine's an eyepatch,
but that's close...

344
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,958
[SHIRAZU] What the hell
does he think he's doing?

345
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,458
I overheard you offer
that chick a job.

346
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,833
[SAIKO]
Maman!

347
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,916
I think that Mutsie might've
had a little too much

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,916
to drink tonight.

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,833
[gasps]

350
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:14,416
[MUTSUKI]
Hey, Teach!

351
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,541
Believe it or not,

352
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,083
the Nutcracker just
offered me a job.

353
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,666
Thanks to me, our undercover
investigation is go!

354
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,750
Awesome! Way to go, Toru!

355
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,833
[MUTSUKI] Oh man, I'm feelin'
so good right now!

356
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,750
I'm gonna go do a victory dance!

357
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,166
[SAIKO] Hang on, Mutsie,
I'm comin' with ya!

358
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,458
[SHIRAZU] Hey, what about me?
I wanna dance, too!

359
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,291
[HAISE]
Good grief.

360
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,000
[HAISE] If I ever get
my memories back,

361
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:40,041
and suddenly I'm not
Haise Sasaki anymore,

362
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:44,791
my only hope is that
I'll still remember you.

363
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,250
[HAISE] Associate Special
Investigator Matsuri Washu,

364
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,125
the brains of S2.

365
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,208
He's a rationalist,
through-and-through,

366
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,083
who'll do whatever
it takes to win,

367
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,083
even sacrifice his own men.

368
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,041
It's widely known that he's
not fond of the Quinx project.

369
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,083
[MATSURI]
When is this auction being held?

370
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,708
[gasps] The 11th
of November, sir.

371
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,750
Then let's have
Investigator Mutsuki go in.

372
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,833
On his own.

373
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,833
You want him
to infiltrate alone?

374
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:17,500
Do you have a
problem with that?

375
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,125
We can't risk taking quinques in

376
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,916
because they might
do a pat-down.

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,791
Therefore, it's the
perfect job for a Quinx.

378
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,500
But, sir. Mutsuki's
never been on a--

379
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:29,333
[MATSURI] That's enough!
I don't want your excuses.

380
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,458
I've given you an order.

381
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,791
[JUZO]
Excuse me, I've got a question!

382
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,958
Do you, think I could maybe
infiltrate the auction, too?

383
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,791
[HAISE] Are you sure
you wanna do that?

384
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,583
If we're gonna go in
there and stir things up,

385
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,375
it'd be best to have
at least one more person

386
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,125
working on the inside.

387
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,791
[MATSURI sighs]
Very well.

388
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,041
I promise you won't
regret it, sir.

389
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,291
[knocking]

390
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,875
Yes, come in.

391
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,250
[MATSURI] For this mission,
the S2 and Suzuya Squads

392
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,875
will be working alongside
Investigators Hirako,

393
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,458
Mado, and Shimoguchi.

394
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,958
Each of whom will be heading
up their own squadron.

395
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,291
Now, allow me to brief you

396
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,125
about the Auction
Search-and-Destroy Operation.

397
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,166
[HAISE]
Investigator Shimoguchi!

398
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,875
It's good to see you out of
the hospital. Feeling better?

399
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,416
[SHIMOGUCHI]
I don't need your sarcasm.

400
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,666
Let him be, Haise.

401
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,958
It's the most considerate
thing you can do right now.

402
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,875
In this line of work,
everyone will lose

403
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,666
a superior or subordinate
at some point.

404
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,541
The CCG's an assemblage of
those who've lost others.

405
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,458
Build strength and kill ghouls.

406
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,750
That should be your focus--
do you understand?

407
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,250
It's those who have
the least to lose

408
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:54,000
that're the ones who
wield the most power.

409
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,958
[HAISE] I have to take from
others or they'll take from me.

410
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:02,333
Like it or not, that's just
the way the world works.

411
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:11,458
[ETO] You like looking down
from above, don't you?

412
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,833
[AYATO]
Eto?

413
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,458
[ETO] I have a message
for you from Tatara, Ayato.

414
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,583
He wants you to be
Big Madam's bodyguard

415
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,750
during the upcoming auction.

416
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,250
[AYATO]
What's the breakdown?

417
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:25,041
[ETO] Like, I said, your job
is to protect Big Madam.

418
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,875
You can bring Naki
and Miza, if you like.

419
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,708
Consider it done.

420
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,041
[ETO]
Thank you.

[TORSO]
Hm?

423
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,375
You need all of the experience
you can get right now.

424
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,750
From here on out, the job's
only gonna get riskier.

425
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,333
Uh. If you say so.

426
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,000
I'll do what I can.

Toru. Toru.

How I long for your

Don't just stand there,

Damn it!

Don't let go of your weapon!

Talk about pathetic!

Remember, the ghouls aren't
gonna hold back in battle!

00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,833
Let's try again!
