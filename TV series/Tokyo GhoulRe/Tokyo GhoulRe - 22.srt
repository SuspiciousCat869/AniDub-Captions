[KANEKI]
This place.

Where is everyone?

00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,125
[KANEKI]
I have to hurry.

00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,791
I have to help her.

I have to go.

[RIZE]
What's your hurry, killer?

13
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,833
Stay for a while.

14
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,875
[KANEKI]
I have to find the others.

15
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,875
They need my help.

16
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,125
[MALE VICTIM A]
Help.

00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,500
Somebody help!

No, please!

[FEMALE VICTIM A]
I'm sorry!

20
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,958
Make it stop. Make it stop!

00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,500
[MALE VICTIM B] I don't
wanna die! Not like this!

Please, not my baby.

[MALE VICTIM C]
Why me? What did I do?

25
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,125
Those voices...

00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,125
[RIZE]
Yes.

27
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:41,041
All the innocent
people you killed.

28
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,541
I didn't mean to.

29
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,000
[RIZE]
To protect everyone?

30
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,250
Or to create a world

31
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,875
where ghouls and humans
understand each other?

32
00:04:54,958 --> 00:05:01,791
[laughs]

33
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:05,208
Those people died
because you took action.

34
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,541
The world would be
better off right now

35
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,791
if you had done nothing.

36
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Look there.

37
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,166
The people we killed
are filling the sea.

38
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,083
Changing its color.

39
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,708
[RIZE]
Not that you'd care,

40
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:42,916
since the lives of others
never really meant much to you.

41
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
But I didn't realize,

42
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,708
and there's no way
that I could have.

43
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,083
[RIZE]
So it's okay to kill people,

44
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,250
as long as you're
not conscious of it?

45
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,208
[KANEKI]
Course not.

46
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,583
[RIZE] Then what
justification is left to you?

47
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,208
Did you mean to be cruel?

48
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,500
[KANEKI]
Never.

49
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:07,416
[RIZE]
Did you try to be a good man?

50
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,375
I don't think so.

51
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,708
[RIZE]
So... a bad man?

52
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,291
[KANEKI]
I don't know.

53
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,791
[RIZE] You mean you fought
without knowing what for?

54
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,625
I guess...

55
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,291
...I just wanted
somebody to need me.

56
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,083
[KANEKI]
Ever since I turned...

57
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,750
Since Yoshimura
gave me coffee at Anteiku.

58
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,166
My world has gotten bigger.

59
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:42,416
I made more friends
than I'd ever had.

60
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,541
Even after Haise.

61
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:51,875
I felt like Arima and Eto
had somehow chosen me.

62
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,958
And Touka.

63
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,916
She chose me, too.

64
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:05,208
I felt like I was sought after.
Like I mattered.

65
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,333
I liked that.

66
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,833
At the time,

67
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:16,958
I honestly believed that
I had a place in both worlds.

68
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,416
So yeah. You're right.

69
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,791
I never really
cared about others.

70
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:27,000
My objective,
it could've been anything.

71
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:30,291
I thought that
if I kept fighting,

72
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,625
then people would
keep on wanting me.

73
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,291
[RIZE]
Hm.

74
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,708
You said you didn't
hate me once.

75
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,583
Do you remember that?

76
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,833
[RIZE] Well, you should
know that I do hate you.

77
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,125
If I had never run into you,

78
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,083
this wouldn't have
happened to me.

79
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,375
I always found it strange that
you never had that thought.

80
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,375
Or have you by now?

81
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,166
Have you learned to hate me?

82
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,708
[KANEKI]
It's been hard,

83
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:07,000
but I think this was something
I needed to go through.

84
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,208
All of it.

85
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,916
The suffering,
the close calls with death.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,833
I needed to see what I've seen.

87
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,791
Meet the people I've met.

88
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,958
I'm better for it somehow.

89
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,166
[KANEKI]
I got what I wanted, after all.

90
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,416
People who are glad they met me.

91
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,291
Who want me around.

92
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:32,041
So no, not even now.

93
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:36,166
There's no part of me
that could hate you.

00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,250
We're good.

00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:51,333
[KANEKI]
I-I was happy.

00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,250
So what's the plan?

Pretend that blood
is just water?

100

Ignore the weight of your sins?

He's unresponsive,

You're always
charging off on your own,

Do you think he'll be okay?

Such a dreary setting.

I'm glad I brought flowers.

Oh, Maman.

He's still unconscious.

His room is crowded with

120

It makes sense.

He has a way with people.

You wanna go?

00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,791
See his face at least?

Do it anyway.

Tell him what you did,

127

Yeah. But Urie.

Look.

There's a hell of a lot in this

00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,625
Especially not on our own.

132
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,500
Speaking for myself.

I'm helpless alone.

Can't guess how
often I've been saved.

We all take too
much upon ourselves.

And fall.

137

[ITO] So whaddaya think'll end
up happening with the ghouls?

138
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,541
You have an opinion?

That question will be the least
of our concerns before long.

141
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,541
Arima told me
that once our conflict

142

with the ghouls had ended, there
would be a revolution of sorts.

[HIRAKO] Arima told me
something else, too.

148

Every human in

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,791
It isn't just the two of them.

166
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,541
As of this moment, at least.

167
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:46,708
Goat and the Doves are working
together to defend Tokyo.

168
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,791
[KANEKI]
The CCG is working with ghouls?

169
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,041
How'd that happen?

170
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,541
Nagachika brought them together

171
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,875
in order to stop that
monster and to save your life.

172
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,541
It was all him.

173
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,500
Hold on.

174
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:08,875
Are you saying
that Hide's alive?

175
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,458
Hey, um.

176
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,625
Could I go and look at the city?

177
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,000
Please.

178
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,541
[TOUKA]
Mm.

179
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,250
[TOUKA]
Just don't overdo it.

180
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,708
All right if I go with?

181
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,541
[KANEKI]
Urie.

182
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,166
[URIE] You may as well speak
what's on your mind, Sasaki.

183
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,541
[KANEKI]
Huh?

184
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:53,458
[URIE] I can at least listen
to you sound things out.

185
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,916
You won't come to
any decent conclusions

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,541
thinking on your own.

187
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,916
[KANEKI]
Thank you, Urie.

188
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,250
[gasps]

189
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,250
What's up, you hear something?

190
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,750
Yeah, over that way.

191
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,041
[URIE]
Hm?

192
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,041
[URIE]
It's a ghoul.

193
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,625
[RUIZAWA gasps]
No. Don't hurt me.

194
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,958
Please. I'm sorry. Forgive me.

195
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,583
I was so hungry I couldn't stop.

196
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,625
Please. I'm begging you.

197
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,666
Let me go.

198
00:15:34,208 --> 00:15:36,958
Captain. That ghoul was...

199
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,291
...once human.

200
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,333
I knew her.

201
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,333
We worked at
the same branch office.

202
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,125
20th Ward.

203
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,083
[FURUTA] Ahem. I do hope
I'm coming in loud and clear.

204
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,458
Chaos in the streets.

205
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,958
Monsters devouring
people left and right!

206
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:57,875
One has to wonder if the
apocalypse has come at last!

207
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,125
This reporter will now attempt
an on-the-spot interview

208
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,666
with that monster.

209
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,375
So what's your name?

210
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:04,416
He's a bit ill-tempered.

211
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,666
But look at this.

212
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,500
It seems the self-defense
force has arrived!

213
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,958
[FURUTA] I think
they're having an effect!

214
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,416
The beasts are
exploding en masse!

215
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,083
What the hell is this...?

216
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
Hey. Are you all right?

217
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,833
[FURUTA] It appears that
something sketchy's in the air.

218
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,916
Why, this could
start an epidemic.

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,708
So what'cha gonna do to stop it?

220
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,708
[MARUDE] How is that
bastard broadcasting?

221
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,458
[MABUCHI]
It's not from a network station.

222
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,625
Must be a
custom-made transmitter.

223
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,000
[URIE]
This is Urie.

224
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:43,916
I'm near his location.

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,416
Going in now.

226
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Keep him in place.

227
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,583
I'll send backup
there as fast as I can.

228
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:50,500
[HIDE]
Marude.

229
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,791
What is it?

230
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:55,125
[HIDE]
The mist from their bodies.

231
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,833
I think it's even
worse than it seems.

232
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,250
Where are the soldiers?

233
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,208
[FURUTA]
Oooh, look at this!

234
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,875
One of the soldiers
who succumbed

235
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,833
to those emissions moments ago,

236
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:12,083
now has a strange protuberance
jutting from his chest!

237
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,750
This is recorded.

238
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,833
Furuta's long gone by now.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,125
[FURUTA] This is what happens
when the human body is exposed

240
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,250
to a massive volume of RC cells.

241
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,541
Upon inhaling the toxins that
were inside of these monsters,

242
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,416
any human being will soon find
their body turning ghoulish!

243
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,791
My...

244
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,791
If this keeps up, then what
will become of mankind?

245
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,041
Good luck! You have fun!

246
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,958
[URIE]
Damn it!

247
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,666
Bastard.

248
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,916
[gasps]

249
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,750
Huh?

250
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,375
Did you inhale that stuff?

251
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,583
[URIE gasps]

252
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,166
[URIE]
Sasaki!

253
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,500
I'll clear a path.

254
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,833
You get her back to HQ.

255
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,500
[KANEKI] But they explode
when you kill them.

256
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,083
You'll end up breathing
that stuff in, too.

257
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,083
Shut up and go!

258
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,875
[SAIKO] You're the ones
who need to escape.

259
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,625
No, we're getting you help.

260
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,250
[SAIKO]
Don't be an idiot.

261
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,333
I'm the one who
inhaled that stuff.

262
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,375
Let me hold them off.

263
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,041
You'll have a way better
chance without me...

264
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,791
[KANEKI]
I could destroy these things.

265
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,500
But if I use my power,

266
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:51,833
there's a chance that I'll
lose control like last time.

267
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,041
I only made it back
because of them.

268
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,000
They all waited for me.

269
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,875
I-I don't want to cause
them any more pain.

270
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,958
[KANEKI]
But if I don't do something,

271
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,958
Urie and Saiko will...

272
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,708
[KANEKI]
What should I do?

273
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,958
What can I do?

274
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,958
[KANEKI]
I have the ability,

275
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,666
so I have to do something.

276
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,083
[KANEKI]
I'll fight!

277
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:45,000
[pants]

278
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,500
[URIE]
Sasaki!

279
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,625
[KANEKI]
Huh?

280
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,416
Let's go!

281
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,250
[KANEKI]
Mm.

282
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,041
How is she?

283
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,125
What'll happen to her?

284
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,750
Her RC count is
well over a thousand.

285
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,458
That classifies
her as a ghoul now.

286
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:10,541
It looks like your former
chief's broadcast was accurate.

287
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,666
If this keeps up, she might--

288
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,791
I'll analyze her symptoms,
and let you know what I find.

289
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,000
Please take care of her.

290
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,208
[HIDE]
Yo.

291
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,458
[KANEKI]
Hey.

292
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,208
[HIDE]
You're looking well.

293
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,583
[KANEKI]
I guess.

294
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,791
[KANEKI]
Hide.

295
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,416
[HIDE]
Hmm?

296
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,416
[KANEKI]
Would you let me see your face?

297
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,750
[HIDE] Oh, I would, but I forgot
to put on my makeup today!

298
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,375
[chuckles]
I'd be embarrassed.

299
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,250
Please let me see.

300
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,500
Show me what I've done.

301
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,833
[HIDE]
Good grief.

302
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,666
Thanks, Hide.

303
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,500
[KANEKI]
Ever since we were kids,

304
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:40,416
you'd hide the things
that I couldn't bear to see.

305
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,250
Hide.

306
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:46,666
You... You protected me.

307
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,458
[HIDE sighs]
Yeah. That's right.

308
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,416
Looks like you get who I am.

309
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:59,500
[KANEKI] I think, these
are things I need to face.

310
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,500
[KANEKI]
This city I ruined.

311
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,416
The scars I gave you.

312
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,583
I want to see it all through

313
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,750
with everyone else's help.

314
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,166
[KANEKI]
I know I'm able,

315
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,791
so I have to do something.
