Don't be ridiculous.

I'm the one who
smoked this ghoul out.

Yeah, okay,

47

but it's all about the
degree of contribution.

You were just following me.

I don't see how
that's contributing.

[SHIRAZU] Let's get real.
If it weren't for me,

would've happened.

It turns out the ghoul

00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,541
that Second Class Investigator
Urie from Mado Squad

56
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,875
came upon yesterday
was not Torso.

57
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,583
Speaking of, may I remind
you that Torso is our case.

58
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,250
I think it would be
best for Mado Squad

59
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,500
to focus on other
investigations.

60
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,750
While we're on the subject,

61
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,583
correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't your squad

62
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,208
recently spend several days
investigating reports

63
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,125
of a ghoul howling only to find
out it was just a stray dog?

64
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,000
[HAISE]
Yes, sir. That was rough.

65
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,666
Talk about a letdown, huh?

66
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,083
[SHIMOGUCHI] It's nothing
to laugh about, Sasaki.

67
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,250
[SHIMOGUCHI] These men of
yours, the "Quinx" bunch,

68
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,291
have done nothing but
eat through their budget.

69
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,500
And they've done so
without showing

70
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,916
any signs of improvement.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,125
[HAISE]
Well, they're trying--

72
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,125
[SHIMOGUCHI]
It's bad enough that your kind

73
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,166
are involved in
our investigations

74
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,250
in the first place.

75
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,666
I mean, are you human?
Are you ghouls?

76
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,708
Who knows?

77
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,250
Would you care to explain

78
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,375
why you neglected to finish off
that taxi driver yesterday?

79
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,708
There was no reason for you

80
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,750
to let a good-for-nothing
ghoul like that live.

81
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,208
But, sir.

82
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,541
[SHIMOGUCHI] Don't tell me
that you're starting to feel

83
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,250
sympathetic toward them?
I shouldn't be surprised.

84
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,291
I mean, when it comes
down to it, you yourself--

85
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,916
Investigator Shimoguchi.

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,708
Let's not forget, it's my
duty to train this squad.

87
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,083
Therefore, I will be
the one to reprimand them.

88
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,541
[SHIMOGUCHI]
Fine.

89
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,291
But I find your "training"
lacking, Investigator Mado.

90
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,375
It concerns me because
I'm heading the Torso case.

91
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,750
Yes, I know,

92
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,458
and your investigation
is moving at a snail's pace.

93
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,083
I assumed you were
smart enough to realize

94
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,500
that they were throwing
you a lifeline.

95
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,208
How dare you insult me!

96

[HIRAKO]
That's enough, Shimoguchi.

97
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:40,291
You too, Mado.
Let's get back on topic.

98
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,666
Now, regarding Torso,
I'd like the Shimoguchi

99
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,875
and Mado Squads to conduct
the investigation

100
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:47,416
as a joint operation.

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,083
Meanwhile, the Hirako Squad

102
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,375
will continue our
pursuit of Orochi.

103
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,208
This concludes our meeting.

when you're fighting.

If you're not careful,

107
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,875
your kindness will
be the death of you.

108
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,000
Remember, you're their mentor--
they look to you for guidance.

109
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:10,125
Your leniency is starting
to influence the Quinxes.

110
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,916
Stop protecting the ghouls.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,125
Do it again, and you'll get
another Mado Punch to the gut.

112
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,750
I'll keep that in mind.

113
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,958
In any case,

114
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,625
we'll catch Torso before
Shimoguchi's squad.

115
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,166
And perhaps Orochi.

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,875
Special Investigator Arima
expects a lot from you.

117

they're calling me?

to know a ghoul named Torso?

What? No, I don't! I swear!

off Mr. Sass, do ya?

makes me sick.

159
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,708
[SHIBA] Have you been able
to produce your kagune?

160
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,583
I've tried. No luck.

161
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,291
[SHIBA] I see. So,
how's the Quinx Squad?

162
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,625
Same as always.

163
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,291
Everybody's doin'
their own thing.

164
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,833
I figured as much.

165
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,125
No one bothers to come in
for their regular check-ups

166
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,791
except you and Urie.

167
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,500
I'll do my best to
persuade the others.

168
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,041
[SHIBA]
I appreciate it.

169
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,916
It doesn't matter what I say.
They're not gonna listen to me.

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,208
[URIE]
Miss Chie Hori. You're 24?

171
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,583
[CHIE] Mm-hm! I take
pictures and sell 'em,

172
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,458
then I trade in the
information I gather.

173
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,208
Pretty smart, huh?

174
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,458
Yeah, I guess.

175
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,666
What kind of information
do you have on Torso?

176
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,916
[CHIE] A pic from the site
of one of his predations.

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,458
It's not free though.

178
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,291
[URIE]
How much do you want for it?

179
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,083
[CHIE]
One million.

180
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,500
What?

181
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,291
[CHIE] Or... a personal
item from Haise Sasaki.

182
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,208
[URIE] She won't give us
the rest of the information

183
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,833
until we deliver her payment.

184
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,166
[SHIRAZU] Let's tell Mr. Sass
and ask him for his underwear.

185
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,833
No? But why not?

186
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,208
Let me put it this way.

187
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,333
You're desperate for money,
aren't you, Third Class?

188
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,541
What's that got to do with it?

189
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,625
I know Investigator
Sasaki's our mentor,

190
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,000
but if we report to him,

191
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,625
he's going to make catching
Torso a squad mission.

192
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,791
And if we're successful,

193
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,416
everyone will get
the glory for our work.

194
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,000
[SHIRAZU] Don't'cha think
you might be overreacting--

195
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,500
You don't get it, do you?

196
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,083
It'd be really easy for
Sasaki to take full credit.

197
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,708
It all just depends
on how he chooses

198
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,333
to report back
to the higher-ups.

199
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,791
[gasps] What the hell?
That's not fair!

200
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
[URIE]
You're damn right it's not fair.

201
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,791
You wanna make
more money, right?

202
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,791
Well, the fastest way is
to get promoted quickly.

203
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,500
And to move up, you need
to distinguish yourself.

204
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,208
Okay, but how do I do that?

205
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,791
[URIE]
By working alone.

206
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,208
Show the higher ups you're
not just a member of a squad--

207
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,916
you're damn good on your own.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The sooner you do that, the
closer you'll get to your goal.

209
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,250
Fine, I'll do it.

210
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,125
If that's what it takes.

211
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm not gonna let Mr. Sass--
I mean, Sasaki--stand in my way!

212
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,083
Terrific.

213
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,125
[URIE]
That was almost too easy. Idiot!

214
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,416
[HAISE]
Where are Urie and Shirazu?

215
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,291
[MUTSUKI] Uh... They went
looking for Torso.

216
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,375
[HAISE] Out acting on
their own again, huh?

217
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,875
What about Saiko?

218
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,416
[MUTSUKI] She's in her room,
probably playing some game.

219
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,458
[HAISE]
Jeez.

220
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,958
Hey, Saiko! Dinner's ready!

221
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,083
[SAIKO]
Okay.

222
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,500
Thanks for cooking for us.

223
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,833
[HAISE]
No problem. Dig in.

224
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,833
[MUTSUKI]
It's delicious.

225
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,083
I'm glad to hear it.

226
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,708
[door opens]

227
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,333
[HAISE] Welcome back.
Dinner's ready if you--

228
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,333
I don't want any.

229
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,583
Uh...

230
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:40,333
Uh. Urie? Listen,
about the investigation...

231
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,916
[URIE]
Don't concern yourself.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,875
We're perfectly capable
of handling the Torso case.

233
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,125
All I need you to do is
reimburse those receipts.

234
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,583
[door slams]

235
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,166
[sighs]

236
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,583
[HAISE] They're gonna insist
on solo investigations

237
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,083
to the bitter end.

238
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,083
Okay, fine.

239
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,708
Looks like I need to
teach them a lesson

240
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:04,625
and show them Haise
Sasaki means business.

241
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,250
Are you okay?

242
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,625
Let's do it, Mutsuki!

243
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,583
We're gonna find Torso
and rein him in!

244
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,500
We'll beat Urie and
Shirazu to him!

245
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,708
Uh. Yes, sir!

246
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,791
[HAISE] I'll show those
young pups how it's done!

247
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,291
And Senior Investigator
Shimoguchi, too!

248
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,041
And then he'll never
underestimate me again!

249
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,750
[MUTSUKI]
Donato Porpora.

250
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,500
Commonly known as "the priest."

251
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,125
SS-rated.

252
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,375
If I remember correctly,

253
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,916
he's the one who fed on
the orphans in his care.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,333
[DONATO]
I see you've brought a newcomer

255
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,083
with you today, Haise.

256
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,791
Well, aren't you a
tasty-looking treat?

257
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,375
This is the first time
I've ever met a Quinx.

258
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,458
If I got my hands on you,
I'd slice your belly wide open.

259
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:52,416
Then I'd take out all the guts
that come spilling out of you

260
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,291
and stuff them into my mouth.

261
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,958
But enough of that.

262
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,708
May I ask what brings you here?

263
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,916
I need your help.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,125
We're looking for a
ghoul called "Torso."

265
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,041
His predation sites are
spread out over a wide area.

266
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,291
His victims have
all been female.

267
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,375
As his name implies,

268
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,708
he only takes the torsos
of his victims.

269
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,041
Fascinating.

270
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,458
He certainly knows what
he likes, doesn't he?

271
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,458
He's fed all over the city.

272
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:19,208
He must be using a car
to perpetrate his crimes.

273
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,458
Yes.

274
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,166
I can't help but wonder
why his predation sites

275
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,583
are so spread out.

276
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,208
Perhaps he's attempting
to keep himself

277
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,000
from being identified.

278
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,125
If so, he's probably incognito
and doing whatever he can

279
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,208
to blend in with human society.

280
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:33,375
To cover so much ground,

281
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,916
he must be quite familiar
with the roads.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,916
Like a taxi driver.

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,333
[BOTH gasp]

284
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,833
[HAISE]
Urie had figured that out.

285
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,916
[HINAMI] I have a message
from Aogiri Tree, Mr. Torso.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,958
[TORSO]
And what is it?

287
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,708
You're eating too much.

288
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,333
The doves have noticed, and
they have their eyes on you.

289
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,958
The CCG, huh?

290
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,541
I don't suppose
that you're familiar

291
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,208
with the term "Quinx," are you?

292
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,750
No, why?

293
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,708
[HINAMI] You need to be aware
of the danger you're facing.

294
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,958
Quinx are humans who've been
given the powers of ghouls.

295
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,916
You should be extra careful.

296
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,916
[HINAMI]
"Quinx," huh?

297
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,666
The way they're described
reminds me of Big Brother.

298
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,000
[SHIRAZU]
Mr. Sass's underpants!

299
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:20,833
[CHIE]
Sniff, sniff.

300
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,375
Don't worry, they're clean.

301
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,083
I made sure to grab you a
pair fresh from the laundry.

302
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,666
[CHIE]
Thanks! In return, here's this.

303
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,666
[SHIRAZU]
What is it?

304
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,708
[CHIE]
It's a photo that was left

305
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,250
near one of the crime scenes.

306
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,791
It shows the victim, see?

307
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,083
I've got a feeling this
Torso guy took it.

308
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,291
Hear me out.

309
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,625
That film's special.

310
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,458
It comes from overseas and
there are only a handful

311
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,916
of places you can
get it around here.

312
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,583
And this is the
face of a customer

313
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,791
who buys that kind
of film in bulk.

314
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,375
He's Karao Saeki.

315
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,833
Guess what he does?

316
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,375
[sighs]

317
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,083
[HAISE] Some had appendectomies,
others C-sections,

318
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,208
others suffered
various injuries.

319
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,750
One thing our victims
have in common

320
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,208
is that they all have
scars on their torsos.

321
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,333
Very interesting, but he
had no way of knowing

322
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,500
that about the women
before he attacked them.

323
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,916
[HAISE]
Look at this.

324
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,416
[HAISE] Torso's predation
sites center on the hospitals

325
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,083
his victims visited, and then
radiate outward from there.

326
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,958
I think we should split up
and check the hospitals.

327
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,166
But promise me that if
you see anyone suspicious,

328
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,125
you won't make a move
until I get there.

329
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,458
[MUTSUKI] Guess I've gotta
do this the hard way.

I'm in a hurry.

[SHIRAZU] Man, it's wall-to-wall
taxis in the city!

333
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,958
Yeah.

334
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,083
[URIE] Shut up and keep
your eyes peeled, dumbass.

--[phone rings]

336
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,958
[URIE] Whoa, Mutsuki's
made contact with Torso?

337
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,791
Huh? Where is he?

338
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,333
Make a U-turn!

339
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,416
[TORSO]
Pardon me.

340
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:16,875
[TORSO] I don't mean to pry.
But which are you?

341
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,500
Step on it, Shirazu!

342
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,583
Any faster and I'll
be breakin' the law!

343
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,000
[URIE]
Just do it!

344
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,666
[groans] Idiot! You think
you can attack me?

345
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,041
You're a dove!

346
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,666
[yelps]

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,750
[TORSO] What the hell's
wrong with you? Fight back!

348
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,750
You're too nice
for your own good!

That's the right cab number.

351
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,666
No doubt about it! It's Torso!

352
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,666
Get back here!

353
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,666
Why the hell is this
happening to me?

354
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,416
And why today, damn it?

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,083
I don't even have
my mask with me!

356

[URIE] Your kagune! Use it
to blow out his tires!

357
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,000
[SHIRAZU]
Fine, but if I miss,

358
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,291
I don't want any grief from you!

359
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,958
[URIE]
You suck at this.

360
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,666
What'd I tell you?
I can't hit 'em!

361
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,500
I should kick you off.

[POLICEMAN A] You, on the
motorbike, pull over, now!

They're in pursuit of a ghoul?

Then let's help them out!

[INVESTIGATOR A]
So, those are the Quinx guys.

376
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,666
They look more like
ghouls than humans.

377
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,375
I doubt they have
any humanity left in them.

I have to help them fight.

I need you right now, kagune!

I can't do it.

They've mastered their kagunes,
but I can't even unleash mine.

Yeah, just keep attacking.

I've heard about you.

You're called "Quinxes," right?

391
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,583
And you use kagunes?

Damn doves.

but you won't get
any mercy from me.

was that? A popgun?

nothing but pale imitations.

[MUTSUKI] Urie and Shirazu
can't take him on their own.

I'm sorry, Kuki.

retreat, so the S3 Squad

back on a friend.
