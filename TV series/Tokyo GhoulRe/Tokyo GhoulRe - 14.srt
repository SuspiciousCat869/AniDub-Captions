Huh?!

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,541
Thanks, Ayato!

4
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,625
[AYATO]
I'll draw the doves' attention.

5
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,666
You go and get those cells open.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,416
[GHOULS]
Right!

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,708
[BANJO] Why'd the
entrance just open for us?

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,750
[AYATO]
Not sure.

9
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,875
But I'm guessing
he must've done it.

10
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,666
The half-ass.

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,375
Banjo, you're up.

12
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,041
[BANJO]
Right.

13
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:56,625
Sorry about the wait.

[HINAMI]
Why?

15
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,541
I'm so happy...

16
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,166
Why did you come here?

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,291
Even more though,
I'm sad, because...

18
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:21,125
You're an
investigator now, right?

19
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:25,375
He's doing the
same thing, all over.

[KANEKI]
Not anymore.

00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,583
This'll be my last job.

22
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:33,791
Once I've rescued Hinami,
I'll fight Arima

23
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,041
and die...

Kisho Arima.

No. Not here.

She's just as cute

Touka.

Up you go!

00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,041
[AYATO]
I wanna try it!

35
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,291
Lift me, mom!

00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,916

Not right now, Ayato.

Do it again! Do it again!

[ARATA cries]

00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,458
I couldn't protect her.

00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,583
I was too weak.

42
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,041
Now she's gone forever.

43
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,916
Because I...

44
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,750
Does that make it easier?

45
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,916
Taking all the blame, yourself?

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,291
It should've been you.

47
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,291
You should've died
to save your family!

48
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,583
Wait, it looks like...

49
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,833
...this guy's eating
another ghoul.

Huh?

52
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,541
[YOMO] Kirishima would
never have left my sister,

53
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:42,291
except to protect
Touka and Ayato.

54
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:44,125
I knew that,

55
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,458
but blaming him actually
did make things easier.

56
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,666
Least for me.

57
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,791
And now,

There are few things

60
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,916
as difficult as
protecting someone else.

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,375
It's far more typical for us

62
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:06,958
to try to protect someone
and lose them regardless.

63
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,291
[YOSHIMURA]
That said,

64
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:15,791
there is still something
you can do to help Kirishima.

65
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,250
You can honor his desire to
keep his precious children safe.

[YOMO]
While I live...

67

...they are safe.

This has to be a joke.

It's a joke.

70
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,875
You're joking.

71
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,375
So? What's the punchline?

72
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,583
Stay back.

73
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,833

I hate to be a bother.

74
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,041
But as you know,

75
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't just let you pass.

76
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,750
Why're you here?

77
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,916
Why do you think?

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,166
We wanna rescue Hinami,
just like you do.

Stop worrying about me.

Go and look after Hinami.

apart, you know that?

What a sad thing it is.

To think that I've seen

of Investigator Sasaki
for the last time!

Ahh...!

No.

102

Not them, too.

103
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:09,916
[YOMO] Do you plan to take
everything from me, Arima?

104
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,750
Including my sister and my hope?

105
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,333
[YOMO] I'm sick of this endless
cycle of taking and losing.

106
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:27,666
[YOMO] My only wish
is to leave something.

107
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,333
I want to believe that
the choices I made,

108
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,375
that my time in this world...

109
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,041
...had meaning.

110
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,041
[YOMO]
I've fallen short so many times.

111
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,708
But this time...

112
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,583
...I'll protect them!

113
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,416
Argh!

[TOUKA]
Yomo!

115
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,708
I've got this.

116
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,625
Right.

117
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,791
Hey, Kaneki.

118
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,750
I'll see you soon.

119
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,791
[KANEKI]
That stings, Touka.

120
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,750
[KANEKI]
You'll "see me soon"?

121
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,500
[AYATO]
Hinami!

122
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,708
Hey, Ayato.

Let's go.

124
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,041
So, um...

125
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,125
You're such a screw-up.

126
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,083
Sorry, Touka.

127
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,583
[KANEKI]
I don't sense any reluctance

128
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,208
or hesitation from you.

129

130
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,125
We were friends.

131
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,625
I don't want to fight you.

132
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,375
[KANEKI]
Is it just me?

133
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,791
[KANEKI] We fought countless
times when you trained me.

134
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,416
But not in earnest.

135
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,583
Not like this.

136
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,041
It's subtle, but.

137
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,708
[KANEKI]
You tend towards the defensive.

138
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,666
[KANEKI]
You attack from the left...

139
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,541
...because of your eye!

140
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,625
[KANEKI]
And with the time I just bought.

141
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,500
I should be able to--

142
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,625
[ARIMA]
Fight like you mean it.

143
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,333

Whoa.

[JIRO] This place
friggin' reeks of blood.

145
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,583
[BANJO] I've activated
the emergency shut down.

146
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,000
We can slip out through here.

147
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,500
Are you sure?

148
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,958
About leaving without Kaneki?

149
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,125
[TOUKA]
If we tried to help,

150
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,500
he'd just have to
fight and protect us.

151
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,250
He'll be fine.

152
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm sure.

[motor whirring]

154
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,500
Huh?

155
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,833
Who turned this thing off?

156
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,583
[ARIMA]
Make a choice.

157
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:15,333
Will you die yet again?

158
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:18,083
Six hundred and forty-five.

159
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,875
That's the number of times
I could've struck a fatal blow.

160
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,708
Which means,

161
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,791
that it's also the number
of times I let you live.

162
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,125
[ARIMA]
Tell me:

163
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,791
What have you chosen?

164
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
I can't win,

165
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,541
but I can keep you occupied
while my friends escape.

166
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,166
[ARIMA]
Enough.

167
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,750
It would appear all the time
I spent on you was wasted.

168
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,583
I'll see you soon.

169
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,750
[ARIMA] You finally
got some fight in you.

170
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,125
Send me the quinque.

171
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,083
I'm in the basement.

172
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,708
[ARIMA] This quinque
was made from the Owl.

173
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,083
You'll be the first enemy
I use it against.

174
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,583
Here I come, Kaneki.

175
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,125
Oh my goodness.

176
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,916
You're really putting it out
there, aren't you, young man?

177
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,416
Well, if you're
making all that effort,

178
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,791
I might as well pitch in.

179
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,500
For sweet little
Hina's sake, too.

180
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,791
Soo gross!

181
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:41,333
Although, for me at least,
it's also extremely amusing.

182
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,000
Are we enjoying
the show, gentlemen?

183
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,833
[FURUTA shrieks]

184
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,125
[ETO]
Thanks for the paté.

185
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,583
It was delectable.

186
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,541
How the hell
did Eto get down here?

187
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,291
Keep moving!

188
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,958
[KANEKI]
From below?

189
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,666
[KANEKI]
I wonder.

190
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,250
Did Touka and
the others get away?

191
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,666
Yeah.

192
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,041
They must've.

193
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,833
[KANEKI]
It's fine then.

194
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,625
[HIDE]
Hey!

195
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,208
Hang on a minute.

196
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,833
[KANEKI]
Hide?

197
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,666
[HIDE]
So...

198
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,458
You think you managed
to buy them enough time,

199
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,875
which means
it's okay to give up.

200
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,291
Man, you really
haven't changed much.

201
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,833
[KANEKI]
But I can't...

202
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,500
[HIDE]
You can't beat him?

203
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,375
[HIDE]
I say you can.

204
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,208
You really think so?

205
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,916
Yeah, of course I do.

206
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,791
Hide.

207
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,791
Yeah, what's up?

208
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,625
[KANEKI]
I... I...

209
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:34,333
It's been kinda hard
not having you around.

210
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,375
You better not
die of loneliness.

211
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,625
Look.

212
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,833
You haven't found
your purpose in life yet.

213
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,333
[HIDE]
But you will before too long.

214
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,333
'Kay? Now go.

215
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,708
You barely escaped
with your life.

216
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,625
Don't waste it.

217
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,500
Oh, and Kaneki.

218
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:01,458
[HIDE] Given the circumstances,
I don't regret what I did.

219
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,666
Not a bit.

220
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,208
But still,

221
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,625
I wanted to live at your side.

222
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,583
I won't shut up
till you hear me.

223
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,166
Even if you're a mess...

224
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,541
...live.

225
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:21,208
[KANEKI] My head keeps
playing reruns of past mistakes

226
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,416
with the same words on repeat.

227
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,666
Dorky.

228
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,958
Lame.

229
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,166
Worthless.

230
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,625
Indecisive.

231
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,166
Weak.

232
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,875
But still,

233
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:36,333
that's just... who I am!

234
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,833
[FURUTA screams]

235
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,125
You wiped out V's
most elite troops with ease!

236
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,041
Say, why don't we
just talk this out?

237
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,666
I think you may
be a bit confused

238
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,333
about where
the prison's exit is.

239
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,125
Why don't I point you
in the right way,

240
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,250
and we'll call it even?

241
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,916
[ETO]
No, I'm good.

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,416
Diplomacy failed!

243
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,958
Shrug off the past!
It's Nimura dash time!

244
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,125
[ETO]
Don't you wanna play?

245
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,750
No, I'm fine!

246
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:02,791
[FURUTA]
It's a dead end.

247
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,000
[ETO laughs]

248
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
I'll say it is.

249
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,958
[FURUTA]
I really dislike conflict, okay?

250
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,750
As such...

251
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,750
I'd like to end this peacefully.

252
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,458
What do you say?

253
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,416
[KANEKI] Beating you
will be no easy task.

254
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:35,708
[KANEKI]
Which means...

255
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,041
[KANEKI]
I win!

256
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,083
[FURUTA]
Aw...

257
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,333
Looks like you ate
your old friend for nothing.

258
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,625
[FURUTA]
I feel great!

259
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,875
Thank you, Dr. Kanou!
You changed my life!

260
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,208
That kagune... Is it Rize's?

261
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,416
[FURUTA]
Yes.

262
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,666
Kaneki and I have a matched set.

263
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,208
It's rather beautiful,
don't you agree?

264
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,375
Well, it is from her.

265
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,375
[ETO]
Nimura Furuta.

266
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,458
You don't seem to care
about your family or V,

267
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:31,041
so what is it you want?

268
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,375
I want super-peace.

269
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,333
Is that so much to ask for?

270
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,916
No! It's not!

271
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,333
Please feel free to kick the
bucket at your leisure, okay?

272
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:41,125
Duh-die! Duh-Die!

273
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,333
What the hell's with him?

274
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,875
[KANEKI]
It's over.

275
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,375
Your weapon's destroyed.

276
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,000
The fight goes on,

277
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,666
until you have dispatched
your opponent.

278
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,541
[KANEKI]
Of course you'd say that.

279
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,666
[gasps]

280
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,083
[KANEKI]
This fight is already over.

281
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:28,875
Keeping this up,
would be meaningless.

282
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,083
[ARIMA]
Then...

283
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,416
You have no
intention of killing me?

284
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,083
No.

285
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,541
[ARIMA]
So this is defeat.

286
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,833
I've been fighting ghouls and
killing them for 18 years.

287
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,916
But this is the first time
that I've faced an opponent.

288
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,791
And run out of options.

289
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:55,541
[ARIMA] I'll ask you
one last time, Kaneki.

290
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:59,666
Is it truly your intention
to leave me alive?

291
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,750
[KANEKI]
That's the choice I've made.

292
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,208
So be it.

293
00:23:56,375 --> 00:23:58,500
[TAKIZAWA]
Hey, Amon.

294
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,833
I really, really...

295
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,208
[HOJI]
You remind me of your brother.

296
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,041
[HANBEI]
I won't abandon my men!

297
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,583
You can take that
resentment to your grave.

298
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,333
This is where you
will meet your end.
