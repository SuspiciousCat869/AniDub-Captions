Monsieur Naki.

enough to save her?

I didn't mean to--

168
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,541
Leave him alone!

169
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,916
I won't let you
kill any of my friends!

170
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,208
It was you, right?

171
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,000
Why'd you do it?

172
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:54,791
If you're a ghoul
then why did you save me?

173
00:12:56,916 --> 00:13:02,000
Because I thought
it was the right thing to do.

174
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,291
[gasps]

175
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,250
[AMON]
Yonebayashi, right?

176
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,041
The world is askew.

177
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,750
It's hard to see

178
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,958
what path is truly right.

179
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,500
But if you always
just do as you're told,

180
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,250
then your eyes will
learn to lie to you.

181
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,708
And so...

182
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:23,916
With every new step we take,

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,666
we have to ask ourselves
if we're on the right path.

184
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,916
[gasps]

185
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,458
Maru.

186
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,625
What is the meaning of this?

187
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,750
Some kind of joke?

188
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:56,166
[MARUDE] I conducted a private
investigation of the Washu clan.

189
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,958
[YOSHITOKI]
Your findings?

190
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,708
The One-Eyed Owl's
book seems to imply

191
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:03,666
that the Washu clan
are ghoul collaborators.

192
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,958
The book is wrong.

193
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,916
The Washu clan isn't
collaborating with ghouls.

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,875
It's comprised of ghouls.

195
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,666
You have no conclusive
proof of this,

196
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,250
and yet you have the conviction
to point a gun at my face.

197
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,625
To quote an old,
dead, buddy of mine.

198
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:28,833
A human's instincts
are nothing to sneeze at.

199
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,125
And mine say I'm right.

200
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,833
Prove me wrong.

201
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:48,291
Please just let
this be a common murder.

202
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,041
[YOSHITOKI]
You disappoint me.

203
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,041
[MARUDE gasps]

204
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,750
Marude!

205
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,958
[HAISAKI]
Idiots.

206
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,291
You think I'll
just let you escape?

207
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,041
Cochlea will never fall.

208
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,583
Never again!

209
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,416
It seems you failed

210
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,166
to notice the SS clown
cells were opened.

211
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,125
For you.

212
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,708
We had best be off.

213
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,916
It's time we found the king.

214
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,041
[ARIMA]
I've been waiting, Kaneki.

215
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,791
For a long time.

216
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:12,625
I've been waiting for more time
than I thought I would get.

217
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,500
So this isn't
such a tragic thing.

218
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,833
What do you mean?

219
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:21,416
[ARIMA] There are some
things I need you to know.

220
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:29,583
[ARIMA]
Myself, Hairu, and Furuta too.

221
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,375
We were raised
to be investigators,

222
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,083
in a place called
the Sunlit Garden.

223
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,250
We aren't human.

224
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:43,125
We're more like...
misbegotten half-breeds.

225
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,458
Bred and raised
to serve as tools.

226
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,208
I'm sure you've noticed,

227
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,791
the sight in my right eye
isn't what it was.

228
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:59,416
Actually, it barely picks up
anything at this point.

229
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,833
It's glaucoma.

230
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,583
A relatively common ailment.

231
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,916
For the elderly, at least.

232
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,375
[KANEKI]
But you're...

233
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:16,166
What happens when a human
and a ghoul conceive a child?

234
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,875
What does that union create?

235
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:21,333
A one-eyed ghoul will be born.

236
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,541
A hybrid between both races.

237
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,958
[ARIMA]
Not usually, no.

238
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,458
Huh?

239
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,625
[ARIMA] More typically,
the children born

240
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,750
are all-but identical
to human beings.

241
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,250
All that's different,

242
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,416
is that their bodies are
somewhat physically stronger,

243
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,583
and their lifespans are
drastically shortened.

244
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:54,208
Cases such as that of the One-
Eyed Owl are incredibly rare.

245
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:59,333
We're stronger than humans,
but we burn out faster.

246
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:05,250
Even my left eye is beginning
to flicker out on me now.

247
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:12,208
Before this fight, my remaining
lifespan was all but spent.

248
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:15,958
[sobs]
Papa!

249
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,625
So then, who made you like this?

250
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,041
And why?

251
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,000
[ARIMA]
The Washus.

252
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,625
And I don't know.

253
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:34,541
[ARIMA] But I wonder if
maybe some part of them

254
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:39,541
was hoping to become human.

255
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,083
[KANEKI]
The Washu clan.

256
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,625
The leaders of the CCG.

257
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,458
They're ghouls?

258
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,583
[ARIMA] Ask Take to
fill you in on the details.

259
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,416
He'll help you.

260
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,041
I've told him all I know.

261
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,750
[KANEKI]
I don't understand.

262
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,583
Is there something
you want me to do?

263
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:14,750
Yeah, I want
you to kill someone.

264
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,250
The One-Eyed King.

265
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,708
[gasps]

266
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,916
I want the world
to know it was you

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,708
who brought my life to an end.

268
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:34,291
So you're telling me that
the One-Eyed King is you?

269
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,416
[ARIMA] If word gets
out that Kisho Arima

270
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,541
was killed by a ghoul,

271
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:47,291
that ghoul will become
a beacon of hope to all others.

272
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,125
At least that's
what Eto believed.

273
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:58,625
[ARIMA] The One-Eyed
King is just an idea

274
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,333
that she and I came up with.

275
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,416
Please do this.

276
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,500
[ARIMA]
You're the only one.

277
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,583
[ARIMA]
There's no one else who can.

278
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,208
[KANEKI sighs]

279
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,333
Fine, I'll do it.

280
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,875
I'll be the ghoul
who killed you.

281
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,208
Thank you, Ken.

282
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,458
[ARIMA]
I've always despised myself.

283
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:31,791
[ARIMA] For only ever
taking from others.

284
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,208
[ARIMA]
At last...

285
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:51,208
I feel like I've
left something behind.

286
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,833
[KANEKI]
We can coexist with humans.

287
00:24:01,416 --> 00:24:03,208
Pleasure to meet you.

288
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,500
[TAKIZAWA] No, there has
to be something you can do!

289
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,416
The name of our group...

290
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,875
It's been a while.
