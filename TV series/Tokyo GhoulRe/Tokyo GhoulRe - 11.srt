A shame that Miss Hairu

166
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,458
had to meet with
such an early end.

167
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,166
Farewell, sweet beauty.

168
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,541
Fear not, for I'll avenge you.

169
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,416
I think I'll give you
a taste of this as well.

170
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,833
This tool of mine,
which carved Yuma

171
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,250
and the talkative
Aliza to mincemeat.

[KIJIMA]
Huh?

174
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,833
[MAIRO] Don't underestimate
the tenacity...

175
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,291
...of a loyal butler.

176
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,125
Kijima, look out!

00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,125
[KIJIMA yelps]

181
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,958
Mr. Kijima.

182
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,833
[KIJIMA]
Cheese! I want some cheese!

[MATSUMAE]
Yuma. Aliza. Mairo.

186
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,958
You have been avenged.

187
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,708
[MATSUMAE] Master Shu.
I'll rejoin you soon.

188
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,750
I'll take point now.

189
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,541
You stand by at
the rear, Furuta.

190
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,041
[FURUTA]
Sure.

191
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:13,541
What just happened?

192
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,333
[INVESTIGATOR B]
Investigator Furuta!

193
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,625
What have you done?

194
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,041
What do you mean?

195
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,875
I was standing by at the rear.

196
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,166
You'd use one of
your own as a shield?

197
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,458
Shameful. Have you
no honor at all?

198
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,291
Pardon? You're confused.

199
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,083
It wasn't I who killed him.

200
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,958
That was clearly your doing.

201
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,083
[MATSUMAE]
My eyes.

202
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,916
[FURUTA] Interesting that you
think you're in a place

203
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
to cast judgement.

204
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,708
Considering that you're
all murderous man-eaters.

205
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,166
[FURUTA] I mean, that's fine.
To each their own.

206
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,833
But perhaps you shouldn't...
be quite so proud.

207
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,333
Oh, that isn't where I am, dear.

208
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,166
Sorry about this.

209
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,916
[HAISE]
There's no point in resisting.

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,083
How do you think you're gonna
get out of this net by yourself?

211
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,000
Choosing to fight...

212
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,666
...is suicide!

213
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,250
That's not for you to ponder.

214
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,166
It's your duty to stop me.

215
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,750
And it is mine to
defeat you and escape!

216
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,666
[HAISE]
Right. A left feint.

217
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,958
A kick as he waits
for an opening.

218
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:34,708
Then, with his kagune
coiled, a thrust!

219
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,708
I've more or less
got him pegged.

220
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,375
Next, a lateral slice.

221
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,041
[TSUKIYAMA] Strange. You still
know Kaneki's moves.

222
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,500
[panting]

223
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,208
[chuckles] You're quite
strong. Even now.

224
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,583
What's wrong, Haise Sasaki?

225
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,125
Just kill me.

226
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,916
[KANEKI]
Don't do this.

227
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:29,458
[HAISE screams]

228
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:33,250
[KANAE] Stop your squealing,
<i>Du dreckschwein</i> .

229
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:41,625
Kanae? Is that you?

230
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,375
[KANAE]
Ja.

231
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:47,541
[MICHIBATA] You'll be fine,
Kuramoto. Just hang in there!

232
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,708
[URIE grunts]

233
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,333
Damn it!

234
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,541
No matter how much we cut him,
he just grows back.

235
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:55,958
Unless we stop
that regeneration,

236
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,250
we're done for.

237
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,041
But none of us has a
strong enough quinque.

238
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,250
[SHIRAZU]
No. I have one.

239
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,750
Take this!

240
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,250
Just stay the hell
down this time.

241
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,541
I'm begging you.

242
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,625
[MICHIBATA screams]

243
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,208
[KANAE] Do you know why
roses are beautiful?

244
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,291
It's simple. You pick
them before they wither.

245
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,625
[KANAE] May you become
a beautiful memory

246
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,083
for Master Shu, in death.

247
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,208
[ARIMA]
Haise. Once again.

248
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:44,583
[HAISE]
No. I can't. Please, Arima.

249
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:49,416
On your feet, at once.
Do your job, Haise.

250
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,333
Kill. Like I do.
You are my quinque now.

251
00:18:55,416 --> 00:19:00,083
That is, unless...
you'd prefer to die again.

252
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,791
[HAISE gasps]

253
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:14,250
[KANAE] I blacked out for
a moment. What was that?

254
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,500
[HAISE]
No, no! It isn't for you.

255
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,208
It's my body, it belongs to me!

256
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,541
So get the hell away
from it, don't touch me!

257
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,333
[KANAE] I won't have the
likes of you near my master!

258
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,666
Master Shu. You are my pride.

259
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,666
You are my light. You are my--

260
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,750
[KANAE'S FATHER]
Emma, see to the children.

261
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,083
[EMMA]
Right.

262
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:45,250
[KANAE'S FATHER]
Nathanael. Arnold. Karren.

263
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,458
Please, do not let the
Rosewald name die here.

264
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,875
[KANAE] Soon after leaving
the house, we lost Mutter.

265
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,666
Arnold gave his life
to protect us,

266
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,500
and then Nathanael
gave his to save me.

267
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,000
When I reached
the Tsukiyama family.

268
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,791
I conducted myself so as
to take my brother's place.

269
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:17,583
To fulfill my father's wish.
I called myself his son.

270
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,291
[KANAE]
Could we train more tomorrow?

271
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,416
[MATSUMAE]
Sure.

272
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,083
[KANAE groans]

273
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,916
[MATSUMAE]
Kanae!

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,666
I'll be fine. It's the usual.

275
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,166
How long will you
keep it a secret?

276
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,375
You may be fine now,
but your physique will change.

277
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:39,458
[KANAE] I know that.
Regardless. There's no choice.

278
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,666
This is to honor my late family.
If I just keep training...

279
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,541
[MATSUMAE]
The servants have all caught on.

280
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:50,625
About the only person
who hasn't is Master Shu.

281
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,166
[KANAE]
Master Shu.

282
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,916
My heart is trapped
in that forest of roses.

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,541
Even now.

Death.

Inevitable.

Sleep.

00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,250
[KANAE]
A soft bed. Please let me sleep.

[KANAE]
What kind of question is that?

309
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,875
Of course I wanted to be loved.

Get away from him.

00:21:56,875 --> 00:22:03,291
[HAISE] I was seized by
such sadness, but then,

314
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,166
I remembered a familiar phrase.

315
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:13,083
[HAISE]
"Lost one, whom I hold dear.

This isn't your fault.

It's your parents who failed

to raise you."
