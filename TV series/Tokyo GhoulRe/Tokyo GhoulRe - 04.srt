Where am I?

[MUTSUKI] The last thing
I remember is getting

00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,000
into Nutcracker's car
with Investigator Juzo.

Mutsuki reporting.
Do you read me?

00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,833

It's no use.

21
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:19,666
[UTA] Good evening,
Ladies and gentlemen.

22
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,541
I would like to thank you
for your patience.

23
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,416
The moment you've all
been waiting for,

24
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,875
the auction, is about to begin.

25
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,416
[UTA] We'll need
a master of ceremonies

26
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,041
and auctioneers for this event.

27
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,791
Who better to do
the job than us?

28
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,250
The Clowns!

29
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:41,791
Sit back, relax, and enjoy
to your heart's content!

[applause]

[UTA]
And now, allow me to present

32
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,250
the first item of the night.

33
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,625
An actor who was very popular
in his time, Mr. Yoshiki Okura!

34
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,916
Stop! Don't do this!

35
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,166
[UTA] Let's begin the
bidding at 10,000,000.

36
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,333
[BIDDER 4A]
Ten million!

37
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,583
[BIDDER 4B]
Eleven, no, 12,000,000!

38
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,083
I don't understand why
they'd start the bidding

39
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,125
so high for a washed-up actor.

40
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,375
They know their
audience is willing

41
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,041
to pay more because
of his celebrity status.

42
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,750
I couldn't care less
about his "status,"

43
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,708
it's in poor taste.

44
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,666
[BIDDER B]
Twenty-one million!

45
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,916
[BIDDER E]
Twenty-two million!

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,458
[BIDDER I] Twenty-three!
Twenty-three million!

47
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,416
[BIDDER A]
Twenty-four million!

48
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,083
[BIDDER C]
Twenty-five million!

49
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,041
Thirty million yen.

50
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:22,458
[UTA]
Well, well.

51
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,291
It appears we have
a one-on-one battle

52
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,833
between bidders 33 and one.

53
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,333
Thirty-one million yen!

54
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:33,333
I'll bid 32,000,000.

55
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,708
Thirty-two-point-five
million on the actor!

56
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,833
Make it 35,000,000.

57
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,791
[BIG MADAM growls]

58
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,916
[UTA] And the winner
is bidder number 33!

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,041
Congratulations!

60
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,791
[applause]

61
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,000
[TORSO]
Who is that man?

62
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,125
[AYATO]
They call him "Croque Monsieur."

63
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,916
He's in a different
conglomerate than Big Madam,

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,541
but he's another
billionaire ghoul.

65
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,000
[TORSO]
Is this normal?

66
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean, are humans always
sold at such high prices?

67
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:09,000
[AYATO] No, the price varies
depending on the human.

68
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,291
But deep down, they must think
their lives are worthless.

69
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,041
That's why they're able
to put prices on them.

70
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,375
[TORSO]
If I had that kind of money...

71
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,208
[bang]

72
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,708
[TORSO]
Toru?

73
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
[UTA] We'll start the bidding
at 1,000,000 yen.

74
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:35,291
Excuse me, I stand corrected.

75
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,291
[UTA]
This item's special.

76
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,791
It has quite an unusual scent.

77
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,291
[AUDIENCE gasps]

78
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,833
[BIDDER F]
Wait, is that--?

79
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,166
No, it can't be! Can it?

80
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:55,625
[UTA]
I present, a one-eyed ghoul!

81
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,833
[BIG MADAM]
Hm...

82
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,375
I must have it!

83
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,250
It's the only thing that might
help invigorate Master Shu!

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,916
[AYATO]
A one-eyed ghoul?

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,166
[TORSO]
I need to bid!

86
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,166
Please, Ayato, tell me
how to join the auction!

87
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,000
That's Toru!

88
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,875
I have to bid until I win!

89
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,041
[AYATO] What the hell
are you blabbering about?

90
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,125
[TORSO]
Toru.

91
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,458
[UTA] This is a rarity,
ladies and gentlemen.

92
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,458
It's far too precious for
a measly 1,000,000 yen.

93
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,666
Let's start the
bidding at 10,000,000!

94
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,500
[BIDDER A]

[MUTSUKI]
What now?

99
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,500
Someone tell me what to do.

100
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,208
How do I handle this?
I'm scared.

101
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,416
I don't have a strategy.

102
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,083
Do I stand up and fight?

103
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,500
Or is this where I...?

104
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,666
Save me, Teach!

105
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,208

[AUDIENCE]
Ooh!

113
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,666
Don't even think about it.

114
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not gonna let something
this rare slip away from me.

115
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,500
One-hundred-and-twenty million!

Big Madam isn't backing down!

117
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,916
One-hundred-and-forty million!

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,333

However, neither is bidder 110!

119

[UTA] The winner is bidder
number one: Big Madam!

126
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,166
No. Master.

127
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,875
[UTA] Your merchandise
will be delivered

128
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,416
after the auction.

129
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,333
Amazing! Two hundred million!

130
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,041
Ah!

131
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,958
You deserve a kiss!

132
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,583
[NUTCRACKER]
Two-hundred million!

133
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,125
I can't believe it!

134
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,291
[UTA] Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's keep the excitement

135
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:14,125
going by introducing our
next item up for auction.

136
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,041
Presenting another exceptionally
beautiful young lady,

137
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,208
who I suspect will fetch
an equally high price.

138
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,000
[BIDDER G]
Oh! Look at that fair skin

139
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,375
and those big eyes!

140
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,083
She almost looks like
a porcelain doll!

141
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,708
That one's perfect, Madam!

142
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,125
If you had a girl like
that, then you could--

[AIDE A]
Madam?

144
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,416

our starting bid will--

145
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,166
[JUZO]
You don't need one.

147
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:03,083
[AYATO] It's Suzuya!
The doves are out to get us!

Oh, wow...

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,541
[AIDE B]
Let's get out of here, Madam!

153
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,583
What is Juzo doing here?

154
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,333
[MADAM A]
It's the doves.

155
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,625
[MATSURI]
Move in.

156
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,166
[MATSURI]
Attention, all personnel.

157
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,041
Mission 1 is to exterminate
the ghouls in the building.

158
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:06,166
Big Madam, in particular,
must be eliminated at any cost.

159
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,500
We anticipate intervention
from Aogiri Tree.

160
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:11,083
But we can't let this
opportunity pass us by.

00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:51,291
You dare to defy me?
Who do you think you are?

321
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,000
[KANAE]
<i>Scheisse</i> ! Damn you!

322
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,208
Why did you have to go
and get in my way?

323
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,083
If I don't catch her,
I'll be back to kill you.

324
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,125
Might as well just
lie there and wait.

325
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:08,125
[TORSO]
Toru. My Toru!

326
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:22,708
[KANOU] Hm. It would appear the
battle is in full swing now.

327
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,916
I wonder what'll happen
if we drop the Owl

328
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,458
into the mix.
What do you think, Eto?

329
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,250
Good idea.

330
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,000
Time to go. Ready, Takizawa?

331
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,125
I'm so hungry.

332
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,416
[INVESTIGATOR O groans]

333
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,625
Whoa, thanks for the save,
Investigator Ato, sir!

334
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,083
You've got my back,
I've got yours.

335
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,791
[ATO] The fact that
Sasaki and his squad

336
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,083
were ordered to go ahead.

337
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,958
Means that their combat
rating is higher than ours.

338
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,375
Honestly, it's a
hard pill to swallow.

339
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,541
[ATO] There's no denying
they're amazing.

340
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,458
Their potential is limitless.

341
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,708
All of their newfangled
techniques and abilities

342
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,125
are leaving old fogies
like me in the dust.

343
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,291
Have you completely
lost your mind, Marude?

344
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,916
You can't do this--
he's just a child!

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,791
I'm not crazy.
This boy's different.

346
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,583
[ATO] It doesn't matter whether
you're religious or not,

347
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,791
everyone comes into
contact with God.

348
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,916
It's the moment when
you come face-to-face

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,916
with overwhelming talent.

350
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,583
I know, because...

351
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,083
I have seen God.

352
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,291
I have seen the
unfairness of God.

353
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,583
[ATO]
I may be an ordinary man,

354
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,666
ignored by both gods and devils.

355
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,750
But with enough experience.

356
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:53,458
I can still amount
to something decent!

357
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,416
Damn you!

358
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:19,875
Kinda reminds me of a
freshly-picked pineapple.

359
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,916
[clock ticking]

360
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,458
[KANAE]
Your wound is already healed?

361
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,791
[SEIDO]
Ahhh...

362
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:02,666
[gasps]

363
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,291
A delicious human nugget. Hehe.

364
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,208
Like jam.

365
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:10,750
[screams]

366
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:12,000
[SEIDO]
Oh wow! Nice block!

367
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,083
[HAISE]
I can't hold him!

368
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,083
[silence]

369
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,000
