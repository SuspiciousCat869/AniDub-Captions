The CCG isn't good anymore.

326
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,442
It's just a bunch
of murderers now.

327
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:06,942
And I don't want any part of it!

328
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,317
[URIE]
Saiko.

329
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,483
I know there's nothing
we can do to save Yoriko.

330
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:22,483
Uri.

331
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,025
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:27,400
It's true that the
CCG's been perverted.

333
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:31,108
We've lost sight of
what we used to fight for.

334
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:34,358
We've grown numb to it,
but years from now,

335
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,775
people might look
at what we're doing.

336
00:20:37,858 --> 00:20:39,775
And see us as criminals.

337
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:42,858
Unless we raise our voices
and make it stop.

338
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,025
How are we gonna do it?

339
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,067
We'll have to find a way.

340
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,192
[SAIKO]
And what if we can't?

341
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:50,608
If we can't...

342
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,858
...then we'll both
become terrorists.

343
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,608
[CROWD]
Congratulations!

Let's dance till morning, Nishi!

346
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,025
[NISHIO]
Hey! Gimme back my drink!

347
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:24,358
[TOUKA]
Pretty amazing.

348
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:28,025
I never thought they'd do
a whole reception for us.

349
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:30,567
Tsukiyama said it
would be good for morale.

350
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,942
I think he just wanted
to throw a party.

351
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,275
The man does know
how to plan a celebration.

352
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:37,525
I'll give him that.

353
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,150
So tell me.

354
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,358
Is this what you wanted?

355
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:58,442

356

Kaneki.

[JUZO]
I always liked you, Haise.

358
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:06,442
But I'll kill you the
same as anyone else.
