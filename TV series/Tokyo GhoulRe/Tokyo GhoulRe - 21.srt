1
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:44,233
[FURUTA]
I'm grateful to you, Mutsuki.

2
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:49,900
[FURUTA] Under your leadership,
the Oggais were able to provide

3
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,317
the nourishment needed
to make Kaneki like this.

4
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:56,650
Allow me to thank you
for finding your way to him,

5
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,358
just as I knew you would.

6
00:00:58,442 --> 00:00:59,858
[laughs]

7
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:02,442
Isn't love amazing?

8
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,733
So tell me, how does it feel?

9
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:07,025
Knowing your beloved
is a monster now,

10
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,608
and it's all because of you.

11
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:10,233
[gasps]

12
00:01:10,317 --> 00:01:11,650
[FURUTA giggles]

13
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:12,900
Is it a boy?

14
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:14,275
Is it a girl?

15
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,733
No! It's a monster!

16
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,233
[MAN]
Hey. What the--?

17
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,900
[screaming]

18
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,900
As we've all just witnessed.

19
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:30,567
The monster has already
inflicted tremendous damage

20
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,442
and catastrophic casualties.

21
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:35,233
Its body stretches
throughout the city.

22
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,608
You found me
faster than expected.

23
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,275
[KANOU] Hoped I'd have time
for a quiet gravesite visit.

24
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:11,192
It would appear Furuta's made
a fine account of himself.

25
00:04:11,275 --> 00:04:14,358
Information about ghouls once
suppressed by the Washu clan

26
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:17,275
will finally see
the light of day.

27
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:22,442
[KANOU] Ghoul research
will at last move forward.

28
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:26,775
Modern medicine will now
advance by leaps and bounds.

29
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:30,192
If only it had come sooner.

30
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:32,233
[hisses]

31
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:35,775
You think that can placate me?

32
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,358
Make amends by dying.

33
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:42,025
I'm not interested
in making amends.

34
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,983
Seeing as I've no regrets.

35
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,942
I envy you, though.

36
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,692
I'm not so good-natured
that I can nurse a hatred.

37
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,400
Kurona.

38
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,400
Let me apologize.

39
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:56,817
[gasps]

40
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,733
[gunshot]

41
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:14,108
[KANOU]
So this is death.

42
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,775
How fascinating.

43
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,025
[MARUDE]
We've located Kanou.

44
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,942
Or, his corpse, I should say.

45
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:23,567
[MABUCHI] He was the
last source of decent intel

46
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,650
we could've hoped to get.

47
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:29,942
So I would've thought,
but I'm told we have a backup.

48
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,942
[MABUCHI] Hold on,
what're you talking about?

49
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:33,067
[MARUDE]
Don't know.

50
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,983
Ask Nagachika.

51
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:35,858
[door opens]

52
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,025
Huh?

53
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:40,983
[MARUDE]
Who are you?

54
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,817
I was Dr. Kanou's assistant.

55
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,817
My name is Nishino.

56
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
[HIDE]
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

57
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:50,275
Cool. It's working.

58
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,317
[AMON]
So, you can speak again?

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,317
[HIDE]
Yeah.

60
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,567
Thanks to Dr. Chigyo.

61
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,692
What were you doing
in that weird outfit?

62
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,317
[HIDE]
I was sizing things up.

63
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,983
Looking for people who might
be willing to help Kaneki.

64
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,692
If I had played
my cards a little better.

65
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:13,192
Kaneki might not
have ended up like this.

66
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:16,567
I failed him,
but I won't fail him again.

67
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,317
For me to pull this off,
I'm gonna need some help.

68
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,858
[AMON] You're asking for our
help as former investigators,

69
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:24,233
I take it.

70
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,442
[HIDE]
Yes.

71
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,608
I can guess what you need.

72
00:06:27,692 --> 00:06:28,858
Damn it all.

73
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:32,233
Bet my father's turning
in his grave already.

74
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:35,275
[HIDE chuckles] Your instincts
are as sharp as ever.

75
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:37,358
[AMON]
Nagachika.

76
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:41,483
Why would you go this far
to rescue Ken Kaneki?

77
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,942
[HIDE]
Why?

78
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:46,400
[HIDE]
Well,

79
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,692
I guess it's
'cause I like the guy.

80
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:51,483
Do I need more reason than that?

81
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,442
[AMON]
No.

82
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:56,775
Let's go.

83
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,275
You'll give your kid a cold.

84
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,442
Wish this would let up.

85
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:08,900
The rain, too.

86
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:12,358
[ITORI]
Hi, Touka!

87
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,525
[TOUKA]
Itori, hey.

88
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:14,275
Look at you.

89
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,567
You're a woman now.

90
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,317
What's the plan for Uta's group?

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,733
[ITORI]
Nothing's changed.

92
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:23,733
They plan to clown around,
as they always have.

93
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:27,858
I thought I'd ask the same thing
about your little flock here.

94
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:31,150
It might be best if
you made a run for it.

95
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,317
[TOUKA]
No, we...

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,317
[ITORI] You're resistant
to that, are you?

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,358
Then why not see him through?

98
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:38,608
[TOUKA]
How do you mean?

99
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,858
You know.

100
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,108
Kaneki only got this way

101
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,817
because he was trying
to help you, right?

102
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,983
A lot of people died...

103
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,067
Don't listen.

104
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,067
[ITORI]
...or were killed, I should say.

105
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,442
Kaneki crushed the
kind and the wicked alike.

106
00:07:52,525 --> 00:07:56,608
Because all were complicit in
the persecution of ghouls.

107
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:59,817
Seems to me that
he did this for your sakes.

108
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,942
[MALE GHOUL A]
She's right.

109
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:02,358
The king did it for us.

110
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,817
[FEMALE GHOUL A] They needed
to suffer like we did.

111
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,358
[MALE GHOUL B]
He killed them like the doves

112
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,692
killed my brothers.

113
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,233
[FEMALE GHOUL B]
They killed my baby.

114
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:12,192
[MALE GHOUL A] The king saw
our pain and took his vengeance!

115
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:12,942
[FEMALE GHOUL A]
Yes.

116
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,317
He avenged our fallen.

117
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,525
[MALE GHOUL B]
Yeah!

118
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,025
And now it's our duty
to see him through!

119
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,817
That's not true!

120
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,108
So shut up.

121
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,400
He was always thinking
about humans.

122
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,317
Helping them.

123
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,317
Ghouls too.

124
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,317
It was all he ever did!

125
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,775
You want to "see him through"?
You think that's what's best?

126
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:38,317
Well, I think you're wrong.

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,192
Does no one want him
to find happiness but me?

128
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,692
He can't read books
like he loves to.

129
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,233
Or enjoy a cup of coffee.

130
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:52,608
Or chat with his friends,
and the people he loves.

131
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:56,983
He'll never even get
to hold his own child!

132
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:58,775
I don't want to see
him through like this.

133
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:00,817
I want to get him back
the way he was!

134
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,650
I want to watch him as
he leads us into the future.

135
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,858
And then!

136
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,108
With any luck I'll take
a bite of them both!

137
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,692
A father and child set!

138
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,317
Easy.

139
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,525
I've still got some old
gripes to bring up to him.

140
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:16,192
I just want a chance
to fully earn his trust.

141
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:17,525
I feel like

142
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,400
I never really thanked
him for saving me.

143
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,650
[TOUKA]
I need him to name our child.

144
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:27,025
My language skills are lacking.

145
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,650
[TSUKIYAMA]
That's beautiful!

146
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:29,858
I'll be thinking of names too,

147
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,775
so just let me know
if you want suggestions.

148
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,192
[TOUKA]
Nah, I'm good.

149
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:36,025
[NISHIO] So... what do
you think we should do now?

150
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:39,525
[HIDE]
Touka! How goes it?

151
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:40,692
[TOUKA]
Hide?

152
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:44,025
[KIMI] When the monster
becomes active again,

153
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:47,858
it'll go on a feeding frenzy in
order to replenish its strength.

154
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,358
[MARUDE]
How do we fight it?

155
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,067
That monster is a kakuja,

156
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,317
which means it was
formed by a ghoul.

157
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,275
That ghoul's body
is somewhere inside.

158
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,817
If we can remove it,
the rest should disintegrate.

159
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,192
Good luck though.

160
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:02,025
It's like a needle in a
haystack in a burning barn.

161
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:03,233
[MARUDE]
Is that our only chance,

162
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:04,817
or do we have
some kind of fallback?

163
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,233
We could always
just let it die on its own.

164
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:09,358
And how long do you
think that would take?

165
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,775
If I had to guess,
two hundred years.

166
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:13,942
Damn.

167
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,025
We'll just have to
find the real body then.

168
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:18,192
[MABUCHI]
You should see this, sir!

169
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,400
Huh?

170
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,108
What's all of this
commotion about?

171
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,400
[gasps]

172
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,900
Nagachika?

173
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:26,858
And Investigator Mado?

174
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:29,233
Amon, you're alive?

175
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:30,067
Wait.

176
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,692
What the hell is this?

177
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,567
[HIDE] I thought we
could use some backup.

178
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,400
Huh?

179
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:39,275
[HIDE] Our only chance is to
dig out the main body, right?

180
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:41,775
But humans alone
can only do so much.

181
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:44,233
We're gonna need
some mobility to pull this off.

182
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:45,942
You can't be serious.

183
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:47,442
Come on.

184
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,567
Are you suggesting that we
work side-by-side with ghouls?

185
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,317
[HIDE]
Yeah.

186
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,942
[MARUDE]
Are you joking?

187
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,067
[HIDE] These ghouls
could've run away easily,

188
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,692
but they're willing to help
you destroy that monster.

189
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:00,025
Because Ken Kaneki's inside it.

190
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,900
Ken Kaneki?

191
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,067
[MALE INVESTIGATOR A]
So the One-Eyed King,

192
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,900
turned into that thing?

193
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,192
Maman?

194
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:08,733
[MALE INVESTIGATOR C]
How could this have happened?

195
00:11:08,817 --> 00:11:10,567
Where the hell's
the chief right now?

196
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,983
What does he have
to say about all this?

197
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,483
[UI] The chief has resigned,
in a sense.

198
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:16,858
The creation of that monster

199
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,233
was his true objective
from the beginning.

200
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:24,567
He played every person in the
CCG for a fool and succeeded.

201
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,900
You there.

202
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:28,233
Do you really believe that
investigators and ghouls

203
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,317
can work together?

204
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,525
Why don't you take a good
look at the faces of everyone

205
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,733
in front of you,
and think again.

206
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:38,858

will be dispatched.

[AMON]
Investigator Ui.

208
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:45,067
As an investigator, what is
your first and foremost duty?

209
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,483
It's to hunt down and
fight against ghouls.

210
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:49,692
[AMON]
You're wrong.

211
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,233
Yes, it's our duty to fight.

212
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,692
But it's peace we fight for.

213
00:11:54,775 --> 00:11:56,775
You should fight for it now.

214
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:59,067
Even with ghouls at your side.

215
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,150
[SAIKO]
I'll fight!

216
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,775
I'll fight at their side!

217
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:03,567
These ghouls may have
been our enemy in the past,

218
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,067
but that isn't what
matters right now!

219

[MALE INVESTIGATOR A]
I won't do it!

220

It goes against
all that we stand for!

[MALE INVESTIGATOR C]
They're the real enemy here!

Okay, then let's take
this thing on together.

It oughtta be a
piece of cake that way.

Ah...

237
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,900
Guess I'll have to suck it up.

238
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,025
I hope that you're
right about this.

239
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:32,942
[MARUDE] The CCG accepts
your offer of assistance.

240
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,983
[KIMI] We need a definitive
way to locate the main body.

241

If we could distinguish
some separate substance

I don't mean to
bother you, but...

Well...

246
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:57,150
I looked all over for you.

247
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:00,900
Why'd you run off
with Dr. Kanou?

248
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:04,025
Because I needed
to gain his knowledge.

249
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:06,442
And what were you
hoping to do with it?

Make my dream come true.

How long have you
been in love with him?

C'mon, you can tell me.

259
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:33,733
[TOUKA]
Hmm...

260
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:37,067
I had gone off the rails and
fought the doves alone.

261
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,275
Then Kaneki told me he would've
been crushed if I had died.

262
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,442
And that was all it took.

263
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,483
[HIDE]
So that was it?

264
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,525
Well, it does sound
like something

00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,733
that screwball would say.

00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:52,983
[TOUKA] He's always so ready
to sacrifice himself to help me.

267
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:55,817
Hope I can help him this time.

00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,733
[HIDE]
Let's try.

269
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,900
So... How'd the wedding go?

00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,858

Uh... It was fine.

Come on, spill the beans!

Did you have time
for a honeymoon?

274
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,150
Ooh, did he give you a ring?

00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,150
[TOUKA]
Yeah, well...

276
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,483
Actually, I gave him one.

[gasps]

278
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:16,567
That's how we can find him.

279
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,483
[HIDE]
Hmm?

280
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:19,858
Come with me!

281
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:22,400
[MARUDE]
A ring, you say?

282
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:23,900
[TOUKA]
Yes.

283
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,400
He'll be wearing a ring exactly
like the one I'm holding.

284
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:28,650
So with metal detectors--

285
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:29,817
Good plan.

286
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,525
As long as we get
enough metal detectors,

287
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:33,483
we can focus on
searching for the ring.

288
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,858
Which'll mean
finding Kaneki himself.

289
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:38,317
Still, that kakuja's
beyond massive,

290
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,483
and it's spread
throughout the city.

291
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,400
Which means we won't
have nearly enough detectors.

292
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,692
[MIRUMO]
Evening, Shu.

[MARUDE] You got this many
of them, and in so little time?

300
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:06,817
How is that possible?

301
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,192
I asked the
prime minister for help.

302
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,108
If the media found out
they'd have a field day.

303
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:14,567
I'll leave the rest
to you, gentlemen.

304
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,483
You have our thanks.

305

Ghoul or not,
we're all Japanese.

Please continue operations.

If he's allowed to
become fully active again,

310
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,733
his body will grow dozens
of times its current size

00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:01,692
Pardon, sir.

314
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,108

It's... It's spawning something.

317
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:17,525
How do the numbers look?

318
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,358
I'd estimate that
we're outnumbered

a hundred to one, sir.

320

[MARUDE]
In that case,

00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:24,275
we can take these things.

00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:28,442
Continue the operation!

324
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,567
Office staff, deal with
those periodontal bastards!

325
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,233
Retreat is not an option!

326
00:17:34,317 --> 00:17:35,692
Ghouls and Quinxes,

327
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:38,483
continue the search
and be quick about it!

328
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,733
[URIE]
Mutsuki!

329
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:52,608
You think he's okay?

330
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:00,900
[URIE]
Don't do this, Mutsuki.

331
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:02,775
What's going on with you?

332
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:06,233
There's no reason for us
to be fighting, is there?

333
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,692
Yonebayashi!

334
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:17,150
[MUTSUKI]
This is all my fault.

335
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:22,317
I... I'm the one who
turned Teach into a monster.

336
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,025
Look, that doesn't matter.

337
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:26,192
Huh?!

338
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:36,983
[gasps]

339
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:41,650
[SAIKO]
Mutsie.

340
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,525
The captain and the
rest of us at the chateau

341
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:46,233
have all been worried
sick about you.

342
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:50,192
I'm glad you're alive,
but I don't get it.

343
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,233
What do you want right now?

344
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:55,108
Just tell us how
so we can help you.

345
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,817
Mutsie.

346
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,233
We're ready
to talk when you are.

347
00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:01,650
[MUTSUKI]
He knew.

348
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:05,025
From the moment I first met him,
he knew I was a woman.

349
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:06,525
[gasps]

350
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:10,317
Anyone else would've asked
what my problem was, but...

351
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,900
He pretended with me.

352
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:15,650
He protected my lie
as if it was his own.

353
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:19,400
Because all he cared
about was protecting me.

354
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,317
And how did I repay him?

355
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:25,858
[MUTSUKI]
By turning him into that thing!

356
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:26,942
I'm done!

357
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:29,525
If you want to stop me,
then kill me!

358
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:30,858
[shrieks]

359
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,192
Uri!

360
00:19:37,942 --> 00:19:39,817
Not a chance.

361
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:41,692
[MUTSUKI]
Take all the hits you want.

362
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:44,358
I won't change my mind.

363
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:47,817
I've made my choice,
just accept it!

364
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,275
Mutsie, if this is
really how you want it to end.

365
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,233
Then why do you look
like you're hurting so bad?

366
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,150
[MUTSUKI] I... I wish
I'd just died before.

367
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,275
When Torso took me to the cave.

368
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,900
Or when I underwent
the Quinx surgery.

369
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:14,150
Or when I first
picked up a knife.

370
00:20:14,233 --> 00:20:15,733
It's just...

371
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:20,233
Life at the chateau helped to
hold me together for a while.

372
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:23,233
It was the first place
I ever felt safe in my life.

373
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,150
[MUTSUKI]
I just wanted that back.

374
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,442
Oh well.

375
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:34,858
Doesn't matter now.

376
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:39,858
[MUTSUKI] I don't want
to hurt you two anymore.

377
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:43,233
And it's time I stopped
fooling myself.

378
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:46,942
I should've died
a long time ago.

379
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,775
I'm sorry about all the trouble.

380
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,983
[gasps]

381
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:06,900
[SAIKO] You really
think you should've died?

382
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:08,858
To hell with that!

383
00:21:08,942 --> 00:21:10,817
What about...

384
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,858
What about me?

385
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:18,858
Did you ever stop to think
how I would feel if you died?

386
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:21,858
I love you, you jerk.

387
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:25,275
[URIE]
She's not the only one.

388
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:30,108
I feel the same,
and so did... Shirazu.

389
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:31,692
[gasps]

390
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:38,067
I know it hurts,
but stay alive for us.

391
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,817
If you still plan to die,

392
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I want you to know that
we will stop you every time.

393
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:48,067
There's still
a lot of things to do...

394
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,608
[URIE] ...and I need
your help to do them.

395
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:55,733
Urie, I... I'm...

396
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:02,108
[SAIKO sobs]
Mutsie!

397
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:04,358
[MUTSUKI]
Sorry, Saiko.

398
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,442
[URIE]
You left some big shoes to fill,

399
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:12,858
but I'm getting' there, right?

400
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:15,233
Captain Shirazu.

401
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:57,567
[clock ticking]

402
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:07,775
[RIZE laughs]

403
00:24:07,858 --> 00:24:10,108
What's you hurry, kiiler?

404
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:12,233
Stay for a while.

405
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,400
Oh.
