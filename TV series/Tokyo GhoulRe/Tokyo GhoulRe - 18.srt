00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:19,275
[FURUTA laughs]

2
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,900
My name's Haise Sasaki.

3
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:54,942
Hi there. Nice to meet you.

4
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,983
[HAISE]
Morning.

5
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:01,233
I hope you're hungry.
I made breakfast.

6
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,442
You read?

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,525
[MUTSUKI]
I love him.

8
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,775
I love him.
I love him. I love him.

9
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,108
I love Teach.

10
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,067
I love Haise!

11
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,400
[MUTSUKI]
Even now,

12
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:39,608
I'm still just a
helpless, little girl.

13
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,192
How come?

14
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:59,108
Why didn't you come
save me, Teach?

15
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,150
I waited.

16
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,942
Where were you?

17
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,275
Huh?

18
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,858
[KUROIWA]
About this One-Eyed King.

19
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:35,608
What are your thoughts?

20
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:39,108
[JUZO chuckles]
He seems pretty strong.

21
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,983
Can you kill him?

22
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,942
Haise is a dear friend of mine.

23
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,733
He would always
give me good candy.

24
00:03:45,817 --> 00:03:47,400
And last year,
he even bothered to cook

25
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:50,858
some delicious pudding
for me on my birthday.

26
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:53,025
But still,

27
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:56,358
there are a few things even
more important than friendship.

28
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:02,317
You talk to Mutsie?

29
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,442
[SAIKO]
Uri.

30
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,942
About Maman.

31
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,025
Do you think he did it?

32
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:15,067
Everyone's saying that he was
the one who killed Kisho Arima.

33
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,525
[URIE]
Don't make it personal.

34
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,983
[SIAKO]
Hmm?

35
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:35,650
[UTA] Think it's time we
Clowns made an appearance.

36
00:04:40,775 --> 00:04:42,400
[UI] We've reviewed his will,
and found that,

37
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:45,442
Tsuneyoshi Washu recommended
you, Souta Furuta,

38
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:49,483
of the Washu cadet branch,
to be the next chief.

39
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,108
That said...

40
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,317
The Clowns.

41
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,317
They'll be coming for HQ now.

42
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,692
[MOGAN]
Hmm.

43
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,983
Then perhaps that's where we
should concentrate our defenses.

44
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,358
No.

45
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,650
We'd effectively be yielding
the city if we did that.

46
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,150
Then what is it that you
would suggest we do?

47
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,025
This isn't a first for us.

48
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,192
The CCG has been
put into a similar position

49
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,358
by the Clowns before.

50
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:15,067
Investigators Kuroiwa
and Tanakamaru.

51
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,692
I'm sure the two of you remember
how the matter was resolved.

52
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,483
We left each ward as it was,

53
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:26,233
and ordered our strongest
investigator to guard HQ.

54
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,400
That was Kisho Arima.

55
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:31,900
You do recall
that he's dead, right?

56
00:05:31,983 --> 00:05:33,442
[FURUTA]
This is true.

57
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,608
And it's my belief that
we need someone to replace him.

58
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:39,608
And I daresay
I know exactly who.

59
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,650
Special Investigator Suzuya.

60
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:43,192
Yes, sir?

61
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:47,400
FURUTA] I want you to be
the CCG's new Kisho Arima.

62
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,108
[JUZO]
Hmph.

63
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,775
Give me your orders.

64
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:55,983
And I'll see that they get done.

65
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:04,358
[UI] For a moment, Furuta
looked like a new Yoshitoki.

66
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,942
[ITO]
Hey, Ui.

67
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:08,483
Huh?

68
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:11,567
Have you heard anything new
about where Take might've gone?

69
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,983
[UI]
No.

70
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:15,400
Oh. That's too bad.

71
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,567
Look, Ito.

72
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,483
You should set
your feelings aside.

73
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,108
If you can't, you'll just end up
losing something precious.

74
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,025
[UI]
That was cryptic of me.

75
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:31,150
What really
qualifies as precious?

76
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,108
[UI]
The teacher I respected?

77
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:39,942
The senior investigator that
I thought understood me?

78
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,150
The colleague that
I carefully mentored?

79
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,942
[UI]
I've lost them all now.

80
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:51,025
Every last one.

81
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:10,400
[FURUTA laughs]

82
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,775
Huh?

83
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,400
[sceaming]

84
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:32,692
Huh?

85
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,608
We're with the CCG!

86
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,525
Please make way!

87
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:42,900
Ito Squad, 9th Ward.

88
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,983
The enemy's using explosives!

89
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,442
[MOGAN]
Higher Mind!

90
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:00,567
The 18th Ward
has been cleared of hostiles.

91
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:11,942
[SAIKO]
Show off.

92
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,650
Hsiao would go
for a sexy battle suit.

93
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,317
No doubt about that.

94
00:08:19,983 --> 00:08:22,025
[URIE]
Hope HQ is all right.

95
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,942
[UI]
Maybe Furuta was right.

96
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:32,942
[UI]
Suzuya.

97
00:08:33,025 --> 00:08:34,567
HQ is yours.

98
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,567
You be safe out there.

99
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:39,567
S1 Squad.

100
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,525
Form three teams
and assist the wards.

101
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:42,900
Sir!

102
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,567
What's our situation
on the ground?

103
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,817
Ito reporting in.

104
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,817
The 9th Ward is
in a state of panic.

105
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,025
We're still attempting
to stabilize.

106
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,567
[MOGAN]
18th Ward, Tanakamaru.

107
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,317
We're just about finished here.

108
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,358
We'll be assisting
HQ soon, boys.

109
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,567
This is Urie.

110
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,817
2nd Ward's burning.

111
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,942
We need time to respond.

112
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:06,650
Ui, 19th Ward.

113
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,900
We're about to engage the foe.

114
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,983
[STAFFER A]
Wait! Look there!

115
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:15,442
[STAFFER B] Numerous hostiles
advancing on the bridge!

116
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,775
[STAFFER C]
How are there this many?

117
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,942
You're up, Suzuya.

118
00:09:22,025 --> 00:09:25,817
If they get past that bridge,
they will breach HQ.

119
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,025
Please hold
the line to the last.

120
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,608
Strange wording.

121
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,942
Unless by "to the last," you
meant the last of these ghouls.

122
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,567
Yes, quite.

123
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,233
You kill every last one
of those monsters, okay?

124
00:09:46,775 --> 00:09:49,150
[CLOWN A]
Yeah!

125
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,442
Call me Captain Molotov!

126
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,025
[URIE]
They're too coordinated.

127
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:58,650
Someone has to be
calling the shots here.

128
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:00,692
Huh?

129
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,358
I'll leave this to you.

130
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:05,775
--[SAIKO] On it.
--[HSIAO] Sir.

131
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,108
[DONATO]
Meow.

132
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,733
[DONATO] I think
this kitten must be lost.

133
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,317
[URIE]
Donato Porpora?

134
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,025
[DONATO]
Keep your guard up

135
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:51,150
or you will die, Kuki Urie.

136
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,108
[DONATO]
Pretty keen for a kitten.

137
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:59,108
It seems I'll need to
use more than bits of yarn.

138
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,108
[URIE]
He can't be that strong.

139
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,150
He's already been captured once.

140
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,025
I'll send him
right back to Cochlea.

141
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:06,692
[gasps]

142
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,608
[DONATO]
How's the view from up there,

143
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:17,733
young Urie?

144
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:21,150
[MIZURO]
There's a hell of a lot of them.

145
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:22,942
[HANBEI]
But they fall so easily.

146
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:24,192
It's strange.

147
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:27,233
Something
isn't right about this.

148
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,150
Figure it out yet?

149
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,442
Hey, Suzuya,
have you noticed?

150
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,983
Yeah.

151
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:38,400
You're human,

152
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:40,025
aren't you?

153
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:50,442
[UTA] Greetings,
puppet with no strings.

154
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,650
Shall we play a game?

155
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,442
I would love that.

156
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:57,275
Why don't I carve out
a face for you?

157
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,150
Why aren't you fighting back?

158
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,525
[UTA]
Juzo.

159
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,192
How could you?

160
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:19,233
[gasps]

161
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:22,192
What have you done?

162
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:28,692
Shinohara.

163
00:12:28,775 --> 00:12:30,317
You...

164
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,567
[UTA]
It's all right.

165
00:12:36,858 --> 00:12:37,983
Listen.

166
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,650
We're gonna be okay.

167
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,775
[JUZO]
Shinohara, I missed you.

168
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,150
That's not your friend.

169
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,858
He's a foul imposter.

170
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,025
Suzuya, you aren't alone.

171
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:02,067
We're no replacement for your
old mentor, but we're here.

172
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,233
I'm sorry, guys.

173
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,233
I should've known better.

174
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,233
It was just so good
to see him awake.

175
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,525
[JUZO]
Nakarai.

176
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:13,150
There are innocent humans
mixed in with the Clowns!

177
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,442
Only attack the
Clowns that strike first,

178
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:17,608
but proceed with caution!

179
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:18,817
[MIZURO]
They kidnapped these people

180
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,358
and marched them
to their deaths.

181
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:26,108
And demoralized us by staining
our hands with innocent blood.

182
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:29,650
What kind of sick bastard
could've thought this up?

183
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:30,858
Well then,

184
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:33,692
I'd better go
and pick someone up.

185
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:40,650
I don't suppose you know

186
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,400
the name of the investigator
who captured me.

187
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,942
It's Mikito Urie.

188
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:49,192
He was your father, I believe.

189
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,567
[URIE]
Daddy!

190
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,942
When I grow up and get strong.

191
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:57,775
I wanna be an investigator,
just like you!

192
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:00,525
[MIKITO] I look forward to
working at your side someday,

193
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:01,900
Kuki.

194
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:05,567
[URIE]
It's not over.

195
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,567
My father already
caught you once.

196
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,733
I won't let his
work be for nothing.

197
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:16,567
Oh my.

198
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,775
Still fighting.

199
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:29,025
[DONATO] You may not win, but
at least you've put on a show.

200
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,858
[DONATO]
You poor child.

201
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:39,442
You've suffered so much, and
it's all because of your father.

202
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,067
You're wrong!

203
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,733
[URIE]
I wanted this.

204
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,275
I chose to be an investigator!

205
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:52,483
[DONATO] What you wanted,
was to be recognized.

206
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:56,317
You wanted praise,
and a pat on the head.

207
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,817
No matter how much you have
to show for your efforts,

208
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,608
you will never feel fulfilled.

209
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:06,275
Just shut up.

210
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:08,775
[gasps]

211
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,317
[DONATO]
The strongest feeling you have

212
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,608
for your father is resentment.

213
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:22,025
[DONATO] You blame him
for leaving you all alone.

214
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:26,858
You think he was weak,
and you fear you're the same.

215
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,108
[URIE]
No.

216
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:31,983
You're wrong. You're wrong.

217
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,817
You're wrong! You're wrong!

218
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,442
You're wrong!

219
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,483
[DONATO]
My...

220
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,317
I guess I struck a nerve.

221
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,108
And it only cost me a finger.

222
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,608
[URIE]
Help me.

223
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,400
[URIE]
Shit.

224
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,900
I can't control it.

225
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,650
[SAIKO]
Uri!

226
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,608
No. Uri.

227
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:12,900
If you don't
calm down, you'll...

228
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:15,400
[SAIKO]
So Uri,

229
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:17,525
what'll happen
if we go out of control?

230
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,817
You'll be considered
an S-Rated ghoul

231
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,817
and killed on sight.

232
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,817
[sighs]
Seriously?

233
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,983
After all we've done,

234
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:28,650
we could end up getting
killed by our own?

235
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,483
That's rough.

236
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,108
[URIE] Our Frames exist
to stop that from happening.

237
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,192
Unless we push
ourselves too far.

238
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:37,608
Framing out shouldn't
become an issue.

239
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,775
But I may as well tell you.

240
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:44,900
If it does happen to one of you,
I won't hesitate.

241
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,942
We have superhuman strength now.

242
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,483
So if one of us loses it,

243
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,150
it's important that
we disappear quickly.

244
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,608
[SAIKO]
I'm sorry, Uri.

245
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,275
But...

246
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:03,067
...I'm not willing to lose
any more friends, either!

247
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,775
Here comes your wake-up call.

248
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,608
What?

249
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:16,483
Come on!

250
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,733
[gasps]

251
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:21,317
Can't you see
I'm trying to help you?

252
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,275
You big, overgrown dope!

253
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,483
Kagune Cancel!

254
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:33,442
What now?

255
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,025
Think you can
get out of this one?

256
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,733
Go ahead and try it,
you big brute.

257
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,317
This is what happens when you
train and don't take breaks!

258
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,483
Your head gets all screwed up.

259
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,775
And your friend
has to beat your ass!

260
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,025
[SAIKO] I don't wanna
have to hurt you, Urie!

261
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:06,192
Come back to your senses!

262
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:10,025
[URIE]
Damn you.

263
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:16,775
[URIE]
Dropping everything into my lap.

264
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:19,525
Damn Sasaki.

265
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,442
[URIE]
Why'd you leave?

266
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,108
[SAIKO]
Don't take it out on me!

267
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,608
I don't need you.

268
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:35,442
I'm strong now.
Stronger than you.

269
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,358
Don't turn away.

270
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:41,692
Look at me. Look at me!

271
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,400
[SAIKO]
Shut up.

272
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,692
Stupid boy.

273
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,608
[SAIKO]
I am looking at you.

274
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:14,775
I really am.

275
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,525
I'm right here.

276
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:18,400
I love you, Uri.

277
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:36,483
Uri's starting to
become really strong.

278
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:38,942
But he's like Maman.

279
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:42,358
They both take too
much upon themselves.

280
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,483
And it gets them hurt.

281
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:50,192
[knock, knock]

282
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,608
[ITO]
This can't be right.

283
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,525
What've we done?

284
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,525
[MOGAN]
Ui, boy.

285
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,192
[UI]
We slew

286
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,483
our own kind.

287
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:30,650
And when word gets out,
that's it for us.

288
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,358
[UI] We fought back the Clowns,
but suffered heavy casualties.

289
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:39,817
There will now be
an announcement

290
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,067
from our newly appointed chief.

291
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,067
Please listen closely.

292
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,442
Good morning, my comrades.

293
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:51,192
[UI] Furuta, what's
the meaning of this?

294
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,150
We're having a party.

295
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:54,692
Hi.

296
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:56,067
So I'm the boss now.

297
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,108
And I've decided to
introduce a new fighting force

298
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,442
to the CCG today!

299
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:08,817
[URIE]
Mutsuki?

300
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,900
[FURUTA] Henceforth, this team
will be known as the "Oggais."

301
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,192
And they're our
newest Quinx squad.

302
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:16,650
[URIE]
Did he say Quinx?

303
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,900
Bring out the Clowns.

304
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:21,858
Peace through death!

305
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:26,775
[FURUTA] Through
the deaths of our foes

306
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:29,442
we shall achieve true peace!

307
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:36,150
[FURUTA] The Clowns turned
our righteousness against us

308
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,275
by mixing people
through their ranks.

309
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:40,650
This was an unforgivable tactic.

310
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,150
[FURUTA]
Now we of the CCG.

311
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,108
Must bring our
full strength to bear

312
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:48,775
and dispatch every Clown
that's still standing.

313
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:50,483
Our objective is this:

314
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,358
We shall take back Tokyo!

315
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:56,150
And exterminate
every last ghoul!

316
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,983
[FURUTA] I'll need each of
you to lend me your strength.

317
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:04,942
Now, it's time
to start the party!

318
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:22,067
[cheering]

319
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:57,442
[clock ticking]

320
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:00,650
[FURUTA] We'll suffer their
presence among us no more.

321
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,692
I'll remove every obstacle.

322
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,858
None will stand in your way.

323
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:10,275
[TOUKA] So tell me,
is this what you wanted, right?
