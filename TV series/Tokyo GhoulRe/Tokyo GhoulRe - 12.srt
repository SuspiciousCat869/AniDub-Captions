So when it happened...
I was happy.

Yep. I sure did.

That's why this time,
before I die,

I wanna do something
really special,

So you think

77
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,750
that this could be
your salvation?

Mm-hm.

something for myself.

00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,416
Shirazu!

168
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,625
Shirazu!

169
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,625
[URIE] Shirazu! C'mon,
man! Hang in there.

170
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:10,208
Shirazu!

171
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:15,958
[SHIRAZU] Bagged myself
a big one this time, huh?

172
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,750
[URIE] His guts are destroyed.
Can he heal from that?

173
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,916
[SHIRAZU]
Where's Mr. Sass?

174
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,958
I wanna see him. Where is he?

175
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,916
The senior investigator's
on his way. Just relax.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,166
And breathe.

177
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,666
Shirazu, we need to
get you to a hospital.

178
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,708
[URIE] Given our
recuperative abilities,

179
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,666
this wound is no big deal.

180
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,291
With proper treatment
and plenty of rest,

181
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,083
you'll be as good
as new in no time.

182
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,750
Don't worry.

183
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,916
What if... I end up
dying from this?

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,250
Then who will--?

185
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,416
Don't even talk like that!

186
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,291
You'll be just fine.

187
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,666
[URIE] Look, you're healing
already, just... hang on!

188
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,458
[URIE]
Shit! Where are the damn medics?

189
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,875
[SHIRAZU]
Red-bean soup...

190
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,083
[URIE]
Hm? Say what?

191
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,833
When I gave you
that red bean soup,

192
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:08,541
I knew you hated the flavor.

193
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,791
[SHIRAZU chuckles]

194
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,208
I'm gonna get you back for that.

195
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,000
Now stop wasting
your breath, buzz cut.

196
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,875
Haru...

197
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,166
Your sister?

198
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,333
That's right.
Your sister needs you.

199
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,333
She's waiting for you.

200
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,416
[SHIRAZU]
Urie... Saiko...

201
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,875
Mutsuki...

202
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,083
You here?

203
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,250
Why aren't any of you
saying anything?

204
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,333
[inaudible]

205
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,791
We're here. We--

206
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,375
[SHIRAZU]
Guys, where'd you go?

207
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,250
C'mon, say something.

208
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,750
[URIE]
Shirazu!

209
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,000
Are you there?

210
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,958
Where is everyone? It's...

211
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,958
[MUTSUKI]
You're not alone, Shirazu!

212
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,958
We're right here!

213
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,166
[SHIRAZU]
It's gotten so quiet...

214
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,708
Don't die!

215
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,833
[SHIRAZU]
So, this is what dying's like.

216
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,041
Shirazu!

217
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,666
[SHIRAZU]
I'm scared.

218
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,375
I'm scared. I'm scared.

219
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,833
Don't be afraid.
We're all right here.

220
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,916
Yonebayashi, and Mutsuki,
and me. We're with you!

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,291
[SHIRAZU]
Haru...

222
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,166
[gasps]

223
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,458
Who's gonna take care of her?

224
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,416
[inaudible]

225
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,250
[URIE]
Yeah, think about her.

226
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,208
You have to keep raising money
to get her cured, don't you?

227
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,375
So what's the point
of checking out now?

228
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,000
You just put down an SS-rated.

229
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,833
I bet that bounty'll
be more than 10--

230
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,666
No, more like 20 mil!

231
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,375
And the credit--

232
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:43,125
The credit's all yours, Shirazu!

233
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,250
So, please!

234
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,125
[URIE]
Shirazu...?

235
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,458
No, don't go!

236
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,375
[wails]

237
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:05,875
[URIE] You son of a bitch,
you can't die!

238
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,583
Why did you come here?

239
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,875
To impede? Destroy?

240
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,875
To kill time?

241
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,041
[ETO]
The last one, I suppose.

242
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:17,208
I was curious about who would
kill whom between Tsukiyama,

243
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,708
Kanae, and the ghoul
that once went by "Kaneki."

244
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,416
I wanted to see in person.

245
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,958
[KANEKI]
Yoshimura.

246
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,208
Kuzen, your father.

247
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,458
He told me about you.

248
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,791
He wanted me to try
and save you.

249
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,791
[ETO laughs] What made him
think I need saving?

250
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,500
Perhaps you're not so
cold-blooded after all, Kaneki.

251
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,250
Is that pity I see in your eyes?

252
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,458
[KANEKI grunts]

253
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,500
I missed her.

254
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,083
You punk.

255
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,416
[KANEKI] I'll admit that
I liked the old man.

256
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,541
But, that's hardly enough
of a reason to save you.

257
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,666
You're really just
a piece of trash.

258
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,750
That was so rude!

259
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,708
You're a prideful little
idiot, you know that?!

260
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,083
I'll devour you!

261
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,708
[ETO]
Everything is swirling...

262
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,916
Once I get like this,
there's no stopping me!

263
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,708
[ETO growls]

264
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,375
[ETO grunting]
Kaneki!

265
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:40,250
[ETO] Hey! Come back and I'll
raise you as my own!

266
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,208
[ETO]
Hey!

267
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,333
[ETO]
Why are you running from me?

268
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,125
[ETO]
Uh?

269
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,958
[ETO yells]

270
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,291
[ETO yelps]

271
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,166
[ETO] You know, I've come
to really like you.

272
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,208
We are birds of a
feather, after all.

273
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,875
[ETO laughs]
How thrilling.

274
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,250
[laughs]

275
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,250
I love you, Ken Kaneki.

276
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,041
What an honor,

277
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,125
Miss Takatsuki.

278
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,291
[INVESTIGATOR F]
Can we even call this a win?

279
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,833
[INVESTIGATOR G]
Dunno.

280
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,666
[footsteps]

281
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,583
[INVESTIGATOR F]
Special Investigator Washu,

282
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,750
why are you on the front line?

283
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,208
[MATSURI]
If there's anyone among you

284
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,041
still capable of fighting,

285
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,166
then come with me to the roof.

286
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,291
The One-Eyed Owl's here.

287
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,458
Takeomi Kuroiwa.

288
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,916
Also,

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,541
Kuki Urie.

290
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,083
Can you fight?

291
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,916
[MATSURI]
Urie, did you hear me?

292
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,875
[URIE]
You don't feel a thing, do you?

293
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,916
About what?

294
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,541
[URIE]
The dead men lying at your feet.

295
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,250
Do they not mean
anything to you?!

296
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:45,916
No. It's always surprising
to see who cracks in battle.

297
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,791
First Class Urie,

298
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,958
I actually thought you
showed some promise.

299
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:01,208
Wait a second.

300
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,666
I hear a ghoul feeding.

301
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,916
[UI]
S-Senior Investigator Sasaki?

302
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,416
Is that you?

303
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,750
[KANEKI]
Excuse me.

304
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,750
I took a lot of hits while
I was fighting the Owl.

305
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,750
I needed to replenish.

306
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,125
Wait, so--

307
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,500
Are you saying, you dispatched
the Owl by yourself?

308
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,250
Not quite.

309
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,916
I came pretty close,
but then it ran away.

310
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,958
It's probably still alive.

311
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,250
I see.

312
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,500
[KANEKI] Looks like Rose and
Aogiri Tree were connected.

313
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,708
Just as we suspected.

314
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,958
[KANEKI] The wounded you
see are Tsukiyama's men.

315
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,375
I didn't have time
to finish them.

316
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,416
Until now.

317
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,208
[TSUKIYAMA groans]

318
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,166
Should I go ahead
and dispatch him?

319
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,583
Yeah, and I'll dispose
of the other one.

320
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:14,375
[TSUKIYAMA] Kaneki, is this
truly the path you're choosing?

321
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,791
No...

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,916
[KANAE]
Master Shu.

329
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let me go, Kanae.

330
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,791
I want you to live.

331
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.

332
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:04,458
This body of mine is broken.
I'll die soon.

333
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,666
But, I will still protect you.

334
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,916
You are everything to me.

335
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,666
But, if... I could just
ask one indulgence...

336
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,625
Here, at the end.

337
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:20,708
I wish only to hear my name,
my true name, from your lips.

338
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,416
Master Shu.

339
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,958
How I have dreamed

340
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:28,666
that one day I might hold
you to my bosom like this.

341
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,625
Father, Mutter,
Nathanael and Arnold.

342
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,083
I beg your forgiveness.

343
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,041
I beg for yours
as well, Master Shu.

344
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,750
I've shamed you.

345
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:42,708
I fell in love with you,
and I never had the right.

346
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,791
It's not shameful.

347
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:50,333
And no one will
chasten you for it...

348
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,041
...Karren.

349
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,125
[KANAE whimpers]

350
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,708
[KANAE]
This life is cruel.

351
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:06,625
For I was unable
to live as myself.

352
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,208
This life is wondrous.

353
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,916
For I was able to die as myself.

354
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,208
Ah. Is it fair

355
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,666
for me to be this happy?

356
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,250
[SAIKO cries]

357
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,875
[URIE]
Now you show.

358
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,083
Shirazu asked for you,
but you weren't here.

359
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,791
Where were you?

360
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,375
You weren't here,
and now he's dead!

361
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,000
So, this is my fault?

362
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,458
[gasps]

363
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,666
His life wasn't mine
to defend in this fight.

364
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,958
It was yours.

365
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,666
"All the detriment in this world

366
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,625
stems from a lack of
individual ability."

367
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:01,916
Don't blame me.

368
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,708
Blame your own incompetence.

369
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,916
[URIE cries]

370
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:15,125
[cries]

371
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:20,958
[crying continues]

372
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,166
[INVESTIGATORS scream]

373
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,541
[KANEKI]
Arima, are you angry?

374
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:04,375
Or are you just... sad?

375
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,041
[KANEKI]
Right up to the end,

376
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:11,166
I never understood you.
