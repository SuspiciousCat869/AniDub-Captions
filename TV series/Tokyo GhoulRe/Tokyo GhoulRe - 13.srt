They blend into the crowd.

And feed on human flesh.

00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:24,775
While they may
have human forms,

any more different.

[YOSHITOKI] We have located
Aogiri Tree's main base.

00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:48,692
It's on the island of
Rushima, in Tokyo Bay.

10
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,692
Much blood will be spilt,

11

and more than a few of us
will lose our lives.

[TATARA]
Yes.

28
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:01,775
Our base at the 23rd ward
is falling just as swiftly.

29
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:04,233
So the doves are finally
getting serious.

There's something
I have to attend to.

[TATARA] As always,
I do exactly as I please.

You're free to do the same.

34
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,983
I'll send Ayato with you.

That's certainly kind
of you, Tatara.

Okay. I suppose I'll
see you later, then.

Yeah. I'll see you.

If Sen Takatsuki is a ghoul,

and you knew this,
but kept it secret...

43

of the Anti-Ghoul Act.

You could face some
time in prison.

Of course.

Well...

I don't think it likely that
this will lead to her capture.

I doubt you can catch
an owl with a shrimp.

Well aren't you diligent?

But there's no way
she'll actually show.

That girl. Hinami, was it?

I hear that they're
planning to dispose of her

for someone so young.

quite first-rate.

But I certainly
became an author,

happened if not for you.

to promote her books.

she has much more
to lose than to gain.

But... we've asked the
press to bury this a bit.

161
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,942
I expect things
to calm down soon.

162
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:46,150
So, this book of hers.
<i>Bileygr the King</i> .

163
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,067
I went through it last night.

164
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,025
"The one who lacks an eye,"
that's what <i>Bileygr</i> means.

165
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:54,442
Given that Takatsuki's
a ghoul, I'd guess

166
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:58,025
it's a reference
to the One-Eyed King.

167
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,733
What has me concerned
is the way she describes

168
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,400
the book's "human" characters.

169
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:08,775
It's fairly obvious they're
modeled on the Washu family.

170
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:13,108
And heavily implies that they're
not on the side of mankind.

171
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,025
It's only fiction.

172
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:24,275
[KAIKO]
Nimura. You're late.

173
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:26,942
Sorry, I got caught up
talking with the kid.

174
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:29,317
[KAIKO] I've been informed that
he was the one who brought

175
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,567
the One-Eyed Owl into custody.

176
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,942
Yes.

177
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:35,733
[KAIKO]
Is Takatsuki the One-Eyed King?

178
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:37,775
[ARIMA]
That is a strong possibility.

179
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,692
[KAIKO]
Then proceed with caution.

180
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:43,317
Kisho. We've identified
Shachi's location.

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,192
We'll leave him to you.

182
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,775
He'll know where Rize is.

183
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,442
Make him talk.

184
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,275
[KANEKI]
So, about your latest book.

185
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:03,400
[ETO]
It's true. All of it.

186
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:06,692
The Washu family aren't
what they claim to be.

187
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,192
Are you aware of an
organization called V?

188
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:10,817
"V"?

189
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,942
It's a group of people
operating under the shared

190
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,567
delusion that the world
is their personal property.

191
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,692
And the Washu clan
is in this group?

192
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:20,192
That's right.

193
00:13:20,275 --> 00:13:21,858
I think you're lying.

194
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,775
But are you sure?

195
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:29,775
And the RC gates?

196
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:32,025
Why didn't they go off
when I walked through?

197
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:34,317
Well, that's because

198
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,983
you're only a half ghoul,
through your father.

199
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:42,067
[ETO] That's not it.
We both have lots of RC cells.

200
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,150
The truth is that the RC gates
have been deliberately set up,

201
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:48,942
so they won't respond to ghouls
with certain cell patterns.

202
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:50,483
[KANEKI]
Such as?

203
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,442
Ghouls associated with V.

204
00:13:52,525 --> 00:13:54,817
[gasps]

205
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,192
[ETO]
The members of the Washu clan.

206
00:13:57,275 --> 00:14:00,817
My father, Kuzen,
who was once a member of V.

207
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,983
Me, Kuzen's daughter.

208
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:07,233
And also, Rize Kamishiro.

209
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:10,067
The woman who's guts
you have inside you.

210
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,275
She was a ghoul
who ran away from V.

211
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:13,650
[gasps]

212
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:24,192
[SHACHI]
Rize.

213
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,192
[RIZE whimpering]

214
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:30,025
[dog barking]

215
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,942
[SHACHI]
Little girl. What are you doing?

216
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:38,692
I have to run. Or else--

217
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,150
Then move.

218
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,192
Get up. You can't
just lie there.

219
00:14:42,275 --> 00:14:44,358
[stomach growls]

220
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:47,442
[RIZE]
I'm so hungry.

221
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:49,192
[SHACHI sighs]

222
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:53,275
[SHACHI]
What's your name? Tell me.

223
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:59,733
Rize. And... who are you?

224
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,317
Shachi.

225
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:09,775
So, uh... Tell me.

226
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:12,192
Can I say you're my father?

227
00:15:21,483 --> 00:15:24,983
We've found our target.
Dispatch him.

228
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,442
[SHACHI]
White Reaper.

229
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:30,942
You're nothing more
than a Washu puppet!

230
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,733
I'll crush you!

231
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:45,900
[SHACHI]
Foolish runt!

232
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:49,150
[SHACHI]
Such uncanny speed.

233
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,567
[SHACHI] No human's that
fast. Could it be...?

234
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,358
Is he a--?

235
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:58,858
Where's Rize?

236
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:04,358
[SHACHI] It's a father's duty
to protect his children,

237
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:06,150
White Reaper.

238
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:11,858
[SHACHI]
You are a worthy adversary!

239
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:19,233
[SHACHI]
I knew it. It's in your eyes!

240
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,567
Take.

241
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:23,400
[groans]

242
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,192
[groans]

243
00:16:28,942 --> 00:16:32,358
[screams]

244
00:16:32,442 --> 00:16:36,650
[SHACHI]
Rize. You have to run.

245
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,150
Damn, if she wrote this
for the average ghoul,

246
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:46,483
she should've dumbed
it down some.

247
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,358
[ICHIMI] You're actually
reading that, Banjo?

248
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,233
Are you nuts?

249
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,108
Huh?

250
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,358
[JIRO]
I know why!

251
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,483
It's 'cause, Rize was
super into her books.

252
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,192
This isn't about that.

253
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,733
[SANTE] You know, I read it
myself. Pretty good read.

254
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:01,400
I think just about any
ghoul would be moved by it.

255
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,150
Hold on, how do ya mean?

256
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:06,775
[AYATO] She wants the
One-Eyed King to appear.

257
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,025
[BANJO]
Who's there?

258
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,817
Don't take that tone with me.

259
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,150
Ayato?

260
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:17,608
Ayato "sir" to you.

261
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,067
What're ya doin' here?

262
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,358
I thought Aogiri Tree
was fighting the CCG

263
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:24,233
on Rushima Island right now.

264
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,983
I came to ask for your
help with something.

265
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,275
Huh?

266
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,525
I have to say,
you look even lovelier

267
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:38,150
than in your photos,
Ms. Takatsuki.

268
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,358
Shut up, you silly clown.

269
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:43,483
You really do know
everything, don't you, Eto?

270
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:45,067
Anyway,

271
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,317
was there something you wanted?

272
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,233
First, I thought I'd ask if
you're the One-Eyed King.

273
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:52,150
[ETO]
Huh.

274
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,150
"Since times of old.

275
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,150
It's said that, whenever the
world would fall into disarray,

276
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:59,275
with a crown of hope and
a scepter of change,

277
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:02,525
the One-Eyed King would appear."

278
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,650
Controlling the masses is
no simple task, I'm afraid.

279
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:08,900
But those with power
do have their methods.

280
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:11,233
First, drum up a
suitable boogeyman,

281
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:13,817
then have the CCG put it down.

282
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,650
You know, like they did
with the Tsukiyama family.

283
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,650
The target could be
a politician, a performer,

284
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,275
a journalist, a terrorist.
Whoever they'd like.

285
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:26,192
The key is to focus
people's attention

286
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,150
on a single point.

287
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,733
You need the public
to believe that there's

288
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,317
always a clear-cut enemy.

289
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,067
So, as you can see,

290
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,775
an irregular foe, such as this
One-Eyed King of legend,

291
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,775
could prove to be something
of an inconvenience.

292
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,108
Well, that's a relief.

293
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,317
If you're worried enough
to ask me about them,

294
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,025
then I doubt you have
anything on them yourself.

295
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:54,275
[sighs] Shiono seemed
to be a fine editor.

296
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,983
Were you close?

297
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,775
I made a paté out of him.

298
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:01,233
Forgive my man-in-the-
kitchen cookin'.

299
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,858
Please enjoy.

300
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:10,483
[ETO]
Thanks.

301
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,067
It was my pleasure.

302
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,900
[ETO]
Hey, Washu.

303
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:21,650
There truly is a king, and he's
right inside your bellies.

304
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,442
I feel so bad for you.

305
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:27,525
Having a father who
won't acknowledge you.

306
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,900
Die. Die. Die. Die.
Die. Die. Die. Die.

307
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:35,233
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.

308
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:37,233
Scary.

309
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:41,192
[BANJO]
Ayato. Is this enough?

310
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,858
Should be. I owe you, Banjo.

311
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:47,358
[BANJO]
To Cochlea then. Lead the way.

312
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:49,317
[FURUTA] The key is to
focus people's attention

313
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,233
on a single point.

314
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,275
You need the public to
believe that there's always

315
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,858
a clear-cut enemy.

316
00:19:54,942 --> 00:19:57,150
So, as you can see,

317
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,442
an irregular foe,
such as this One-Eyed--

318
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,858
This relationship would
go a lot more smoothly

319
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:05,025
if you had faith in me, too.

320
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:09,983
So, no? That's fine.

321
00:20:10,067 --> 00:20:11,692
[KANEKI]
I'm curious.

322
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,067
[ETO]
About what?

323
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,275
[KANEKI] You've put your life
on the line to do this,

324
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:19,025
but it looks like
it'll be for nothing.

325
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:20,900
The information will
be manipulated,

326
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:23,317
and ghouls and humans
will keep fighting

327
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,608
like they always have.

328
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:28,942
I don't quite believe
it'll all be "for nothing."

329
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:31,108
But is it enough of a trade-off?

330
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:33,442
Is it actually worth your life?

331
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,942
[ETO]
That, I don't know.

332
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,025
At the end of the day,

333
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:39,942
I only did this
because I wanted to.

334
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:41,442
Is it worth my life?

335
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:44,400
I didn't bother
with the calculus.

336
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:48,442
It's an irrational thing,
but you've seen others do it.

337
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:57,942
[ETO] Bet you're about to do
something reckless yourself.

338
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,692
Would you like my help?

339
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,192
Are you saying you know
what I'm planning to do?

340
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:04,192
Or that you'd
help me regardless?

341
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:05,775
[ETO]
Yes.

342
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:10,108
Although, afterwards, there is
something I'd like in return.

343
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,608
The One-Eyed King is alive.

344
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:14,608
Kill them for me.

345
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,483
[SANTE]
So that's Cochlea prison.

346
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,983
[JIRO] I've never seen it
from up close before.

347
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,150
[ICHIMI]
Kinda scary.

348
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,317
So, do you have a
plan for getting past

349
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,275
this level of security?

350
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:30,108
Figured we'd bust
straight through.

351
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:31,733
[sirens blaring]

352
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:33,525
[BANJO]
What's with the alarms?

353
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,358
[ICHIMI]
Look there!

354
00:21:35,442 --> 00:21:37,108
Ayato! Damn it all.

355
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,858
I guess we're chargin' in!

356
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:48,317
[HAISAKI] All personnel
to action stations.

357
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,817
This is not a drill.
Repeat, this is not a drill.

358
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,275
[PERSONNEL B]
Every last ghoul! Run!

359
00:21:59,108 --> 00:22:01,608
Well, now. I guess it's begun.

360
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,775
[gasps]

361
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:14,983
Kaneki. You--

362
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:20,942
Sorry about the wait.
Let's get out of here.

363
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,858
[clock ticking]

364
00:23:57,942 --> 00:23:58,608
You ready?

365
00:23:58,692 --> 00:23:59,900
Yeah.

366
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:02,400
[FURUTA screaming]

367
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,692
[HINAMI]
Even more though... I'm sad.

368
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,067
[KANEKI]
Am I the only one?

369
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,233
[laughs]

370
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,817
You think so?

371
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,192
[high-pitched static]

372
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:18,233
[static]
