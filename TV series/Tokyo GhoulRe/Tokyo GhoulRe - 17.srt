1
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:21,416
[TOUKA]
Hey, Ken.

2
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,916
Huh?

3
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:27,416
Good morning. Coffee?

4
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:05,791
[SHIO] S, A, A, S, S
plus, SS, S plus, and S!

5
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,083
I could make special
investigator in no time.

6
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,166
[YUSA] Stop tallying up
their potential credit.

7
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,375
[HOGURO]
Whoa, what is this?

8
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,750
What the hell are
these doves doing here?

9
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,541
We're here to protect Kaneki,
not to start a fight.

10
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,666
We won't make trouble.

11
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,250
We came to fulfill
Kisho's dying wish.

12
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,833
They aren't our enemies.

13
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,958
[NAKI]
They might not be yours.

14
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,708
[KURONA]
What kind of meeting is this?

15
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,083
What business does the
staff of a coffee shop have

16
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,166
with the remnants
of Aogiri Tree?

17
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,500
Whatever.

18
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,000
As long as I get to kill
Dr. Kanou, I'll help you.

19
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,541
Look, Kaneki.

20
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:50,083
When Rushima fell, your people
came and they saved my life.

21
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,291
[MIZU]
So, I'll hear you out, at least.

22
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,416
What is it you're after?

23
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,083
My goal is aligned
with the wishes

24
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,958
of the last One-Eyed King.

25
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,625
I want ghouls and humans
to come to an understanding.

26
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
[laughs]

27
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,833
I expected something foolish,
yet I'm still surprised.

28
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,125
So, how do you plan

29
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,625
to bring about peace
between humans and ghouls?

30
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,125
We'll talk it out.

31
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,333
[KURONA]
Are you out of your mind?

32
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,791
The reason that
we've been killing

33
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,708
each other for so long

34
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,083
is because no one's
tried to compromise.

35
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,958
Our peoples can coexist.

36
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:33,958
As a ghoul who was once
human, I'm living proof.

37
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,125
The key is that
we start a dialogue.

38
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,416
But I doubt they'll come
to the table just like that.

39
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,333
So we'll force them
into a situation

40
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,000
where they have to negotiate.

41
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,625
Right here, I declare the
founding of an organization.

42
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,958
One dedicated to this cause.

43
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,750
As for this group's name,
I'll call it Goat.

44
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,875
Tch!

45
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,458
Ridiculous.

46
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,791
Take Hirako,

47
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,166
I fought your boss.

48
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,958
He killed my sister.

49
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,833
She's Touka and Ayato's mom.

50
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,458
They loved her as I did.

51
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:31,083
I'm being told now that
he was sympathetic to ghouls.

52
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:34,750
Yet if he were
standing in front of me,

53
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,250
I'm sure I would
still want to kill him.

54
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,208
[HIRAKO] Everyone around
that guy worked their butts off

55
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:47,625
in the hopes that he might toss
a callous compliment their way.

56
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,041
That happens to be
the reason I'm here now.

57
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,291
I've wanted him to
acknowledge me for a long time.

58
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,416
Kisho Arima is dead.

59
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,458
You're free to hold
onto your grudge,

60
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,541
but you'll never get
another chance to act on it,

61
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,916
and doing so wouldn't bring
your sister back, Renji Yomo.

62
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,541
We believe in the successor
Kisho chose for himself.

63
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,083
And you believe in a
person called Ken Kaneki.

64
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,250
Isn't that enough for now?

65
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,833
Remember the goal here,

66
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,333
we can reach an understanding
without having to agree.

67
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,583
Not on everything.

68
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:30,333
Well in that case,
it's doable.

69
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,666
Take!

70
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,583
Turn on the TV!

71
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,541
[NEWSCASTER] This is live
footage from the 22nd Ward.

72
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,500
The local CCG headquarters
is billowing with smoke,

73
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,791
after reports of an attack
from an unknown group.

74
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,291
Similar reports are coming in
from neighboring wards, as well!

75
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,500
Will it look like we did it?

76
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,666
[HIRAKO]
First they killed the Washus,

77
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,041
now they're after the bureaus.

78
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,875
It looks like they aim to clean
out the whole organization

79
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,208
in conjunction with the
appearance of the One-Eyed King.

80
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,791
I see.

81
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,166
So this is how our enemy works.

82
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,875
[NISHIO]
She has a hell of a fever.

83
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,875
Wound might get infected.

84
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,875
No. I just...

85
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,625
And she's barely been conscious.

86
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,333
If this keeps up, she'll--

87
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,166
There has to be some
way you can help her!

88
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,208
Well, I can't help at all
if you choke me to death!

89
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,041
[NICO]
Oh hi, Banjo.

90
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,041
You look well.

91
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,416
Long time, huh?

92
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,750
[BANJO]
Nico? How'd you get here?

93
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,041
[chuckles]

94
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,541
[NICO]
When imprisoning a clown,

95
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,791
you need to shut everything up
just as tight as you can.

96
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:37,250
Roma sent out a little
SOS and I picked it up.

97
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,041
Check it out.

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,250
A kagune worm.

99
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,583
Did you come here to save Roma?

100
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,208
Oh, I'm sure
she'll be all right.

101
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,833
I just thought I would stop by
and make eyes at your new king.

102
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,250
[BANJO]
All right.

103
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:52,750
[NICO]
So about this woman,

104
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,833
do you want her to die, or...?

105
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,750
Are you implying that you
could help us fix her up?

106
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,916
[NICO]
Not a chance.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That said, I do know of a way.

108
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,250
[NISHIO]
A way?

109
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,166
Yeah, and it's very simple!

110
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,625
You should take
her to see a doctor.

111
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,625
[KANEKI]
Hi, Naki.

112
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,041
Hey, Naki! Cut it out!

113
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,500
[NAKI]
Aw, shut up!

114
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,541
I have to make this bastard pay.

115
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,458
You see I just found out
that you're the one

116
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,666
who murdered Boss Yamori!

117
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll avenge him. Right here!

118
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,708
So I take it that
you're not interested

119
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,125
in becoming part of Goat then?

120
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,291
[NAKI]
You think we'd team up

121
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,541
with the shitsack
that killed our boss?

122
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,333
Sorry to disappoint,
but that ain't our style!

123
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,000
Naki.

124
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,750
What will it take
for you to follow me?

125
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,291
The way we do it in
the 13th Ward is simple.

126
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,083
Whoever's strongest,
is at the top.

127
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,000
Give me your best shot.

128
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,625
Interfering would be
an insult to the boss.

129
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,333
Just watch.

130
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,291
You're not even in the
same league as Yamori.

131
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,125
Of course not, he was a god!

132
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,458
You won't get away from me!

133
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,625
Doesn't it hurt
when you do that?

134
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,125
It does.

135
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,541
[NAKI]
That's the boss' Kagune.

136
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,291
Would you like to continue?

137
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:50,583
[NAKI]
As promised,

138
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,958
from this day forward, you're
the leader of the White Suits.

139
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,375
[KANEKI]
Naki.

140
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,708
The White Suits are strong
because of your leadership.

141
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,166
I don't want them without you.

142
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,708
Fight for me, and I'll
fight for your sakes too.

143
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,875
[NAKI] Keeping our word once
it's given, that is our style.

144
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,041
[NISHIO]
The Great Wheel Act.

145
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,208
Word is, they're an
underground human outfit

146
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,208
that supports ghouls.

147
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,583
When pigs fly, right?

148
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,458
I don't think it's
that inconceivable.

149
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,541
Huh?

150
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:30,916
Seems your flying pigs
have arrived.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,958
Nice to meet you.

152
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:36,375
My name is Ogura,
I'm part of the Great Wheel Act.

153
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Ogura, what's the
Great Wheel Act really?

154
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,625
It was originally comprised

155
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:54,666
of a large group
of student activists.

156
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,333
So it all started
at a college, I guess?

157
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,750
[OGURA]
Yes.

158
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,041
The bulk of the group's
first leaders were students

159
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,208
from Kamii University.

160
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,333
But the faculty clamped down
on them and forced many to quit.

161
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,458
In terms of the
group's membership,

162
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,291
it's undergone drastic changes,

163
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,125
but the principles it was
founded on still remain.

164
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,875
What principles?

165
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,250
The first is that no one
chooses to be born as they are.

166
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,500
That premise naturally
applies to humans and ghouls.

167
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,916
As the world stands,
one's fate as citizen or pariah,

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,208
predator or prey,
is decided from birth.

169
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,458
But if we can
dispel that standard,

170
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,500
perhaps both sides will
realize they have a choice.

171
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,875
Such a paradigm shift is
our group's objective.

172
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,125
These ideas were first put
forth by a medical student.

173
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,125
One who's since turned
her attention towards

174
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,791
the treatment of ghouls.

175
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,166
From what I've been told,

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,833
this woman was once
in love with a ghoul.

177
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,875
[gasps]

178
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,791
Huh?

179
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,500
[OGURA]
We will continue to assist

180
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,208
what ghouls we can in secret.

181
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,875
Just as we'll continue
to hope that ghoul's rights

182
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,125
are established in this society.

183
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:14,750
So count us as allies of
Goat and of the One-Eyed King.

184
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,333
I don't wanna pry,

185
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,625
but is their group's
founder who it sounds like?

186
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,125
I want some coffee.

187
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,583
Catch you, later.

188
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,958
Huh?

189
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,208
Where am I?

190
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,916
I'm so glad you're okay!

191
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,541
And who in the hell are you?

192
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,791
[AKIRA]
So I was asleep without a care

193
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:47,833
while all of this was
going on around me?

194
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,291
You were wounded.

195
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,333
Huh?

196
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,541
[AKIRA] Sorry, but could
you leave me alone for now?

197
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,291
[AMON]
Have time to talk?

198
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,500
Yeah.

199
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,000
[AMON]
It's a strange thing.

200
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,041
All these people who've
been trying their damnedest

201
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,458
to kill each other are
now standing as allies.

202
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,500
That's true for most of us.

203
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,958
But when it comes
to you at least,

204
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,041
I never felt like you
wanted me dead.

205
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,208
What you did really
came as a shock to me.

206
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,375
I was completely at your mercy,
and you spared my life.

207
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,875
[AMON]
Eyepatch.

208
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,500
This world has an
understanding of ghouls.

209
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,416
They eat humans,
so they're monsters.

210
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,875
To most people,
it's as simple as that.

211
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,916
That's exactly
what I want to change.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,125
And while I have
the strength to fight,

213
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,333
I will.

214
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,416
You were once human yourself,

215
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,125
so why would you go to such
lengths to protect ghouls?

216
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,666
[KANEKI]
Cause I'm like them.

217
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,125
Always have been.

218
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,375
Isolated from society.

219
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,666
Limited in what we could enjoy.

220
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,583
Well, not completely.

221
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,500
There were some people
dear to me who were human.

222
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,125
But when it came
to most people I met,

223
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,416
I could take them or leave them.

224
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,041
I'm not interested in fighting
for some faceless stranger.

225
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,625
I wanna help the
people I'm close to.

226
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,208
And it just so happens that
in my case, most are ghouls.

227
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,333
It's a pretty selfish
motivation, huh?

228
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:30,958
Maybe, but it's
one I can relate to.

229
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,625
[KANEKI]
So, Amon,

230
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,458
what do you plan
to do after this?

231
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,791
[AMON]
I don't know,

232
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,208
but some part of me will
always be an investigator.

233
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,250
I'll do whatever
I judge to be right.

234
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,375
[KANEKI]
Akira's regained consciousness.

235
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,875
Why don't you come
down and say hello?

236
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,583
[AMON]
Tell me,

237
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,958
If a friend or an acquaintance,
who you thought you'd lost,

238
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,750
were to suddenly
come back in your life,

239
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,250
how do you think you would feel?

240
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,166
[KANEKI]
If it were me,

241
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,125
I think I'd be scared.

242
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,083
Scared of what?

243
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,958
I'd be scared that
they might go away again.

244
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,833
Actually,
you might have a point.

245
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,458

Hey.

It's been a while.

You brought my cat?

Yeah, it has been a while.

00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,750
So how'd you get
in my apartment?

253
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,458
Didn't give you a key.

Through the window.

255

[AKIRA]
So, breaking and entering?

256
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,250
How far you've fallen.

257
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,000
To think that an
upright investigator--

258

Wait, that's former for us both.

First off,

261

please allow me to apologize.

262
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,625
I couldn't tell you.

[AKIRA] Thanks for
bringing Maris Stella.

It's been years.

265
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,666
I was finally coming to terms

266
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,250
with the fact that
you were dead.

267
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,166
So what am I supposed
to say at this point?

268
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,208
I don't need your apologies.

269
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,458
I'm not happy with you,
but I'm not upset either.

270
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,291
What I am, is very confused.

Sorry, Former Investigator Amon.

Don't be. It's fine.

320
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,625
That they were.

321
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:56,375
[AKIRA] What'd you think
you'd gain by showing me this?

322
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,541
Did'ja think I'd
get all sympathetic?

323
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,333
I don't need any
sympathy from you.

324
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,833
But I do have some
sympathy for you.

325
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,041
Is that so?

326
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,208
My dad was very kind.

327
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,416
That was especially true

328
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,791
when it came to how
he treated his children.

329
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,291
He was always smiling.

330
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,458
Endlessly patient.

331
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,875
But he also killed
a lot of people

332
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,458
in cold blood
behind our backs.

333
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,166
Not for eating either,

334
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,458
he did it to avenge our mother.

335
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,708
Now, he's gone,

336
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,125
and if you ask me,
he was a perfect idiot!

337
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,125
I thought my father was
a useless waste of a parent,

338
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:40,541
for turning his
kids into orphans

339
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,500
over something as
pointless as that!

340
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,166
And I also felt worthless.

341
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,541
'Cause my brother and I couldn't
make living worth it for him.

342
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,916
If he'd just
let us see his pain,

343
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,916
maybe I'd have realized

344
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,333
that it was him who took
her death the hardest.

345
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,916
If I could,

346
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,375
I'd go back in time
and scream his head off.

347
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,333
Then I'd hug him.

348
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,000
And tell him how
we could've lived.

349
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,500
[BOY B]
Hey, Touka!

350
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,791
You okay up there?

351
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,166
Yeah, I'll be down in a second.

352
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,083
You coming?

353
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,041
[AKIRA]
Huh?

354
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,416
[TOUKA]
Just do it.

355
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,208
[AKIRA]
Whoa. Wait!

356
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,291
[TOUKA]
Last thing I'll say,

357
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,250
I've known Hinami
for a long time now,

358
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,625
and she has never held any kind
of grudge against your father.

359
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,583
It's true.

360
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,750
Come here,
you little devils.

361
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,000
[BOY B]
Get her!

362
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,416
[BOY A]
Hi, Touka!

363
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,333
[GIRL]
Where were you?

364
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,375
[BOY B]
You smell like coffee!

365
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,541
Hey listen, kids.

366
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,416
Why don't'cha give this lady
here a big squeeze too?

367
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,583
Yeah, sure.

368
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,708
Do you mind?

369
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,916
Knock yourselves out.

370
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,875
[BOY B]
She smells good.

371
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,916
[BOY A]
Mm-hmm!

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,833
[GIRL]
Hey, do you wanna play, too?

373
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:08,791
[TOUKA]
Hinami.

374
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,416
Huh?

375
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,666
[AKIRA]
She's so warm.

376
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,666
[AKIRA] Who was
I supposed to hate again?

377
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,458
Who am I supposed to hate?
