00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,458
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Chief!

2
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,625
Cochlea's under attack.

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,208
How much of Rushima's
been cleared?

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,500
[INVESTIGATOR B]
About 56 percent, sir.

5
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:19,125
[YOSHITOKI]
Hmm...

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,666
This information stays here.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,625
Do not inform the assault teams.

8
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,000
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,625

[TAKIZAWA chuckles]

12
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,875
[HACHIKAWA]
Ugh... This isn't like me.

13
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,500
Sorry Hachikawa, you missed!

14
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,208
[SHIKORAE]
Roundhouse kick!

15
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,375
[SHIKORAE]
Skewer!

16
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,208
[HOGI gasps]

17
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,541
[HACHIKAWA] You think your
freckles are ugly, huh?

18
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,625
That why you wear
your hair like a mop?

19
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,708
To cover up your face?

20
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,916
Look at mine.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,083
[gasps]

22
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,916
You might not like
those freckles you got,

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,791
but I would rather have
shit smeared on my face

24
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,000
than look like this.

25
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,583
[HOGI]
Hachi...

26
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,958
[HACHIKAWA]
This isn't like me.

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,875
Ya think we should eat him now?

28
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,208
Why not?

29
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,166
Where's Saeki?

30
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:45,333
[TAKIZAWA]
Oh...

31
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,583
I take it no one's injured?

32
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,791
[URIE] These low-level ghouls
won't be nearly enough.

33
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,833
I need way more credit to
become a Special Investigator.

34
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,083
[beeping]

35
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,666
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Hachikawa Squad has gone quiet.

36
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,250
Huh?

37
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,333
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Last we heard,

38
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,458
they'd encountered
the SS-rated Owl.

39
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:09,333
Hachikawa...?
But Mutsie's with them!

40
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,041
[URIE]
I know.

41
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,000
But exterminating
Aogiri is our top priority.

42
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,041
Let's go.

43
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,791
[URIE]
Just be okay, Mutsuki.

44
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,125
[TORSO]
Toru...

45
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,833
[MITSUSHITA]
Were you hurt?

46
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,791
[MIZA]
I'll be all right.

47
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,291
Have to say.

48
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,041
That Suzuya kid
is a real monster.

49
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,000
[MITSUSHITA grunts]

50
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:52,791
Huh?

51
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,416
[MITSUSHITA moans]

52
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,291
Your death will
bring my squad pride.

53
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,791
For Suzuya!

54
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,875
[MIZA]
They already found us?

55
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,666
[HANBEI]
It's stuck in the wall.

56
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,875
[HANBEI]
Come on.

57
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,833
Silver Skull!

58
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,958
I'd expected no less from you.

59
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,208
You almost finished
me off, Three Blades.

60
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,208
Huh?

61
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:39,541
Excuse me, but are you
one of Suzuya's men?

62
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,875
[HOJI] In the fight to
dispatch his older brother,

63
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,583
we suffered more than
a hundred casualties.

64
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,875
And from what we've seen,

65
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:54,291
the younger brother poses
an even greater threat.

66
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,750
Listen, Mado.

67
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,625
I want you to go into this
battle under the assumption

68
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,166
that I am going to be killed.

69
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,250
[HANBEI]
She's got me on the defensive.

70
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,541
I have no chance
of winning like this.

71
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,708
[KURONA]
Nice reflexes.

72
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,708
Your technique's good, too.

73
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,250
You know, back in the day.

74
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,250
[KURONA] We counted
skill with the quinque

75
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,750
as our greatest asset.

76
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,333
Huh?

77
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,416
Let's play a game.

78
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,625
[HANBEI]
I must be fearless!

79
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,708
[HANBEI]
I'm outmatched.

80
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,000
She'll overpower me with ease!

81
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,791
[KURONA chuckles]

82
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,125
[HANBEI]
Come on, Abara.

83
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,250
You can't let this be the end!

84
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,291
Can't even brace myself.

85
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,208
[screams]

86
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,333
[KURONA]
I don't follow.

87
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,875
Why are you so loyal to Suzuya?

88
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,875
[HANBEI]
My leg.

89
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,041
[KURONA]
You must know that

90
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,416
he doesn't give a
damn about your life.

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,791
I mean, he did
abandon you, after all.

92
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,916
[HANBEI] I will correct
you on three points.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,666
First off, it is only right
that I should be loyal

94
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,208
to my superior investigator.

95
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,625
Second: Putting duty aside,

96
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:41,166
Special Investigator Suzuya
has earned my undying loyalty.

97
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,541
And third, the leader of my
squad, does not abandon his men!

98
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,833
You know, I was hoping
I'd run into you, Rei.

99
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,583
You get a little more monstrous
every time I see you.

100
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,041
Eh, Kurona?

101
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,000
Got time for one
last class reunion?

102
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,625
[TATARA]
I'm glad you made it, Hoji.

103
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,708
We have a lot to work through.

104
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,916
My sorrow for my brother.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,500
My resentment towards you.

106
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,000
And towards Aogiri Tree.

107
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,166
[HOJI]
Yes.

108
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,625
It'll all be settled.

109
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,375
Because you're going
to die here and now.

110
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:29,833
[TATARA] I despise you
with every fiber of my being.

111
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,291
[AKIRA]
A kakuja.

112
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,000
[HOJI] You remind me
of your brother, Tatara.

113
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,250
Huh?

114
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,666
More of your squad?

115
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,958
[KURONA]
This is delightful.

116
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,166
I'll kill them in front of you

117
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,625
and show your agonized
expression to Shiro.

118
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,000
[JUZO]
Shiro?

119
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,750
You mean she actually
recovered from those wounds?

120
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,541
Huuuh? Of course Shiro's alive.

121
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,000
She's here with me!

122
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:05,875
You're just ignoring her!

123
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,833
Oh, that's seriously nasty.

124
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:09,916
[KURONA]
All this time.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,750
I've kept Shiro
alive within my body.

126
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,000
But soon, I'm gonna
have Papa fix her up right.

127
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,833
[JUZO]
I doubt that's possible.

128
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,958
[KURONA]
I don't want to hear it.

129
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:23,208
Shut your mouth, Suzuya!

130
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,375
[TATARA]
Burn!

131
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,541
[screaming]

132
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,291
[HOJI] The fuel that
stokes that flame...

133
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,625
...is your hatred for me.

134
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,291
[HOJI]
Huh?

135
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,833
[grunts]

136
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,208
[groans]

137
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,666
[TATARA]
It's over.

138
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,458
Hi.

139
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,958
We're going to finish
what Juzo started.

140
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,416
[JUZO]
Excellent coordination, team!

141
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,125
[KURONA]
He's dead.

142
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,708
I killed him.

143
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,208
I killed Rei.

144
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,041
Did you see, Shiro?

145
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,500
[KURONA laughs]

146
00:10:56,583 --> 00:11:00,000
You're jumping the
gun a bit, aren't you?

147
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,166
[KURONA]
Huh?

148
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:07,041
But I... I thought
you were dead.

149
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:13,708
[JUZO] I hope you
won't think ill of me for this.

150
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,375
[KURONA]
Huh?

151
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,416
[screams]

152
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:29,208
[JUZO]
Wow.

153
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,833
You dodged that?

154
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,500
Is it okay to let her go?

155
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,083
[JUZO]
Yeah.

156
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,625
If you have to run from
the same opponent twice,

157
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,000
you'll never beat them.

158
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,333
[gasps]

159
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,916
Takizawa.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,375
Remember when
you hurt me, Tatara?

161
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,291
I've decided it's my turn.

162
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,708
I'm gonna kill you.

163
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,833
[TATARA]
Back off.

Hot! Hot!

But, but, but, but, but,
but, but... I'm not done.

169
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,875
That was toasty!

00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,000
[TAKIZAWA] You know,
it hurt back then, too.

Tryin' to remember
just how much.

Oh yeah.

00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,833
This much!

[TATARA]
E... To.

175
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,208
[TAKIZAWA]
Is something wrong?

176
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,458
[TAKIZAWA]
I took down the bad guy see?

Aren't you proud?

[TAKIZAWA]
Hoji, I... I missed you--

All troops,
the SS-rated Owl is here.

Prepare to dispatch it.

[TAKIZAWA]
Why? Why? Why? Why?

182
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,125
I'm still alive?

But I... I was done for.

00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,416
I'm sure of it.

Huh?

187
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,375
Investigator Takizawa,

188
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,041
I trust you're feeling well?

189
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,083
[TAKIZAWA]
Yeah, but...

190

Who are you?

191
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,375
And how the heck
am I alive right now?

192

[KANOU]
First things first.

Take a look at your new body.

[TAKIZAWA shrieks]

195
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,666
I worked on 63
wounded investigators

196
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,791
after the battle in
the twentieth ward.

197
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,291
Only you survived the procedure.

00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,375
What've you done?

199
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,791
You're familiar with creatures
that can regrow lost body parts,

200
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,291
aren't you?

201
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:17,583
Takizawa, I have
successfully made you a ghoul.

Oh look.

204
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,166
Your stomach is now rejecting
what it once considered edible.

205
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,166
That's a good sign.

206

[TAKIZAWA screams]

207
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,750
No more!

208

Just make it stop!

209
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,791
I can't take any more.

[KANOU]
But I can't stop just yet.

211
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,083
I have to find a surefire
way to make a Kaneki, first.

[TAKIZAWA]
Please! Stop it!

[TAKIZAWA]
I used my power to kill Tatara.

216
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,625
I saved the CCG.

217
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,458
Or I was going to save them.

218
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,875
I wanted to.

That's all I wanted.

I wanted you to see me.
To take notice.

What brings you here?

It's my sister.

I want you to help Shiro.

I can bring back the dead.

Shiro is alive!

She still breathes
and eats sometimes.

Though I think I know the cause.

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,375
That sound is gas.

[KANOU]
Yes.

Gas is trapped in the
fissures on your abdomen,

247
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:24,666
the sound comes when it escapes.

So what will you do now?

249
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:29,041
It's a fact that your
sister's deceased.

250
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,166
If you can't help,

251
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,583
then I'll see to it
that you die here.

Very well, then.

This is my latest Quinx.

of my creations is superior.

00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,916
[TAKIZAWA] Interesting
that you didn't turn up

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,458
until Mado was in trouble.

257
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:56,291
Did you really just sit there
and watch me murder Hoji?

258
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,708
And now, it looks like
you're about to join him.

259
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,291
Is something the matter, Amon?

260
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,625
Come and kill me.

I came to try to save you.

Well, that's certainly
sweet of you,

265
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,833
even if it's also
a bit condescending.

00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,875
[TAKIZAWA]
How are you going to save me?

267

All you ever do is slink
about in the shadows.

268
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,708
That's not to say
you shouldn't try.

269
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:35,541
Because I'd love to see
you try, Kotaro Amon.

270

We're ghouls now, Amon.

00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,333
So come on.

Let's act like it!

[TAKIZAWA]
You're just too weak.

274
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,875
You're a failed experiment.

275
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,250
Every bit as useless
as Kanou said you were.

276
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:05,625
[AMON] So this is how you manage
to keep deceiving yourself?

277
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,833
I see your weakness.

278
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,375
I know it's the
same as your strength.

00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,333
[AMON]
Takizawa.

280
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,958
You're not really a ghoul.

281
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,750
No. You'll be an
investigator until you die!

282
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,916
You hear me?

283
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,041
Shut up!

you have me do?

286
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,750
[URIE]
You should withdraw, Mado.

287
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,333
The SS-rated Owl
is too powerful.

288
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,291
Leave him to the Quinx Squad.

289
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,958
Now fan out.

Right.

00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,333
Let's proceed.

Hey, Naki.

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,708
What's wrong?

Greetings, Three Blades.

Regardless of how well you
fight back, you will die here.

304
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,958
So kill yourself.

[MIZA]
Not a chance, bob cut.

306
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,458
Until my last breath has
been torn from my throat,

307
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,708
I will fight proudly!

308
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,500
How are you standing?

309
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,958
I thought you were dead!

310
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,041
I'm fine.

311
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,083
I just needed to
take a quick breaker.

[SHOSEI]
Hey Boss.

313

Huh?

I'm pretty sure the word you're
looking for is "breather."

[NAKI] As the leader
of the White Suits.

316

I want to meet death in a way
that my boss can be proud of.

317

[KURONA]
There's too many.

318

[OKAHIRA]
No hard feelings.

319
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:28,250
I don't have a choice.

You're not right.

You're touched in the head.

323
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,166
You turned us into
monsters without a thought!
