Mm.

[URIE] What made you agree
to help me with this?

[KUROIWA]
I heard you were a friend.

[URIE]
A friend?

18
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,317
[KUROIWA]
My boy would always say to me.

"Urie's a good rival,
and a good friend, too."

Furthermore, you
remind me of your father,

and I had a lot
of respect for Mikito.

Is this some sort of inquest?

This is becoming an
especially busy day for me.

You're free to

that fact will be recorded.

[FURUTA] So what exactly is
it that you want me to prove?

27
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,400
Is it the clarity of my mind
or just my loyalty?

Cram it.

For me to prove
myself beyond dispute.

What do you think
would be required?

Why did he entrust his last
mission to you, but not to me?

till the day he drew
his final breath.

He had faith that I'd fight
for his sake no matter what.

And he had faith that
no matter the circumstance,

you would fight
for what was right.

I found out he was gone.

you know that?

166
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:03,608
[URIE]
Kuroiwa!

167
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,192
My! This blade
sure has a fine edge.

168
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:09,275
You piece of shit!

169
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,233
[FURUTA]
Don't be so dramatic.

170
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:14,567
If you liked him so much,
then why'd you let him die?

171
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:25,025
[URIE]
Special Investigator Marude.

172
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,483
[MARUDE]
You look like hell, Iwa.

173
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:36,025
Marude.

174
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,358
You're not alone.

175
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,233
I'm right beside you.

176
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:42,442
And I'm not going
anywhere, understand?

177
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:46,025
I'm with you to the end.

178
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,400
[URIE]
Special Investigator.

179
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:57,567
You mind explaining
what the hell's going on?

180
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,983
Huh?

181
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:00,942
Hmm?

182
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:03,233
Who's your friend?

183
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,483
Touka didn't escape?

184
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:53,150
[KANEKI]
Touka...

185
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:03,442
Get away from Touka.

186
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,317
Kaneki!

187
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:09,608
Ken Kaneki.

188
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:10,192
He's the one.

189
00:18:10,275 --> 00:18:11,525
Leave her alone.

190
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:12,858
Ken Kaneki.

191
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:14,858
Head of the beast.

192
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,733
You have to die.

193
00:18:18,817 --> 00:18:20,108
He must die!

194
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,192
Can't let him live.

195
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:22,150
Tear him apart.

196
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:22,900
Kill him now!

197
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,275
You have to die!

198
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:36,442
No, stop. What are you doing?

199
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,483
Kaneki.

200
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,483
Don't you die on me!

201
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:53,400
[KANEKI]
Touka.

202
00:19:00,608 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm here, Touka.

203
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,567
[KANEKI]
Touka. Touka.

204
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,358
Touka.

205
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:39,025
[KANEKI]
I'm completely powerless.

206
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:42,233
But your head's
still attached, right?

207
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,067
Can you still breathe?

208
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,442
Yeah.

209
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:48,608
Do you still have the
strength to bite someone?

210
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:49,983
Uh-huh.

211
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,150
And the strength to crawl?

212
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,525
Yeah.

213
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:55,233
Then nothing's changed.

214
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,817
We should keep doing
what we've always done.

215
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,733
We move forward.

216
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,567
No matter what.

217
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,525
Just like a centipede.

218
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:07,608
Touka.

219
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:12,525
Touka. Touka. Touka!

220
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:21,108
[gasps]

221
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:27,942
[KANEKI]
Touka. Touka. Touka.

222
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:31,150
Touka. Touka!

223
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,275
Touka!

224
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,233
I'm right here, Kaneki!

225
00:20:43,817 --> 00:20:45,358
[MUTSUKI]
Why's it just her?

226
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,608
Why's she the one
you care about?

227
00:20:47,692 --> 00:20:50,775
Why aren't you
calling out my name, too?

228
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,567
[KANEKI]
Touka! Touka!

229
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,817
Touka!

230
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,192
Teach, I... I just...

231
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:01,233
Kaneki.

232
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:05,817
[KANEKI]
Touka. Touka. Touka.

233
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
[FURUTA]
Huh?

234
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:34,733
[laughs]

235
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,900
Sounds like I win!

236
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:40,025
I want you to clean
your plate like a good boy.

237
00:21:40,108 --> 00:21:42,108
Okay, Kaneki?

238
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:22,942
Your daddy is so very proud
of you, my adorable dragon!

239
00:23:53,775 --> 00:24:03,358
[clock ticking]

240
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,192
Let me apologize.

241
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,150
[gasps]

242
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:11,942
[FURUTA] Does no one want
him to find happiness but me?
