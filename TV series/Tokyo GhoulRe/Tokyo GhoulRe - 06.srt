Mama.

When I was still your boy,
the only things

168
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:48,541
I ever got from you were scars.

Let me tell you something.

The only reason I kept you

176
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,208
was because you happened
to have a nice shape,

between first and

The difference
