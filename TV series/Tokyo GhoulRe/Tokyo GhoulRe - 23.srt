1
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:56,483
[KIMI] The dragon's vitals are
starting to become active again.

2
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,983
[HIDE]
And those creatures it spawns

3
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,817
are still turning
humans into ghouls.

4
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,608
[NISHIO]
We dug Kaneki out of it,

5
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,608
shouldn't it have at least
slowed down by now?

6
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:10,233
[KIMI] That was my theory,
but look at this.

7
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:12,650
It has another core.

8
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,775
[HIDE]
It has more than one?

9
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:17,358
We've got our work
cut out for us, then.

10
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:18,733
Then we should get to it.

11
00:02:18,817 --> 00:02:21,108
Let's send a few scouts,
get an idea of what--

12
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:23,317
[KIMI]
We don't have time for that.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,900
[HIDE]
How much do we have?

14
00:02:24,983 --> 00:02:28,858
[KIMI] Based on the limited
analysis I've been able to do,

15
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:32,900
I'd have to say
twelve hours at best.

16
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:36,358
[HIDE] And if the monster
does become active again.

17
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:40,650
[NISHIO] Every human in
Tokyo will become a ghoul.

18
00:02:40,733 --> 00:02:42,733
[TSUKIYAMA] Then we'll
just have to charge in blind.

19
00:02:42,817 --> 00:02:45,025
[KIMI] But the underground
route to the core is dense

20
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:48,817
with the same gases produced
by the dragon's spawn.

21
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,900
That wouldn't be a problem
for a ghoul, right?

22
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:54,775
It's less of one,
but you still have a limit.

23
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:58,608
Exceed a certain threshold, and
it'll affect your RC cell count.

24
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,775
Then I should
be the one to go in.

25
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,150
[gasps]

26
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,275
With my RC count,
I doubt the gas'll affect me.

27
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:10,317
[KIMI]
Fair point.

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,233
Your RC levels
are abnormally high,

29
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,233
but not much higher
than they were before.

30
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,317
It's risky though.

31
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:28,317
Can't catch a break.

32
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,733
There are quite a few of them.

33
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,775
Guess they plan
to put us down for good.

34
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:35,150
[KANEKI]
We need to move.

35
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:37,692
I'll head to the core right now.

36
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:39,900
Kimi, I'm counting
on your support.

37
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:45,317
As for you, please stay
here and help the CCG.

38
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,525
I'll go too.

39
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:51,233
[KANEKI]
Ayato?

40
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,900
Where have you been?

41
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,775
I've been out
scouting underground,

42
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:57,150
watching that monster grow.

43
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:59,483
[TOUKA]
Ayato, Kaneki.

44
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:03,650
You two be sure to make it back.

45
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,692
Till then.

46
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,358
[MARUDE]
Attention all personnel.

47
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:07,400
Beat them.

48
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:09,400
That's an order.

49
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:12,275
[ITORI] Looks like they still
have some fight in them.

50
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:14,567
[UTA]
More than expected, I'd say.

51
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,817
We need to buy some time.

52
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,942
[DONATO]
You are quite correct.

53
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,983
Let's bring it out.

54
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,317
[TSUKIYAMA]
Die! Die, die, die!

55
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,275
Kaneki can't, so je vais
couper vous in his stead!

56
00:05:28,358 --> 00:05:30,650
What'll it take to shut him up?

57
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,733
[chuckles]

58
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,692
Good luck, Teach.

59
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:55,817
[whistling sound]

60
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,775
Can't be sure, but I think
that was the last of them.

61
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,400
[URIE]
Something's off.

62
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:05,108
The numbers don't add up.

63
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:07,025
But I didn't see
them retreat, so...

64
00:06:07,108 --> 00:06:07,608
[whistling sound]

65
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:08,775
Huh?

66
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,233
That sound.

67
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,025
You know what's causing it?

68
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:13,525
Couldn't say.

69
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:24,942
Huh? What's that?

70
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,983
[gasps]

71
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:45,775
Where the hell
did that thing come from?

72
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,483
Another Owl?

73
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:54,108
How?

74
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,192
[KAIKO]
You're Kisho's man.

75
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:10,192
I consider this quite fitting.

76
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:13,650
Since I never got to exact
my revenge on that traitor,

77
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,858
it's only fair that the
first human I taste

78
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:19,442
should be his
most faithful acolyte.

79
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:21,900
You let those
monsters infect you?

80
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,567
[KAIKO]
Infect?

81
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,067
Oh, no.

82
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,233
This is a blessing.

83
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,817
I was once a
wretched half-breed,

84
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,817
but the dragon gave me
new life as a ghoul.

85
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,858
I've never felt such perfect
harmony with my body.

86
00:07:36,942 --> 00:07:42,400
The dragon that you cower
in fear of, is the ark of life.

87
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:46,858
Damn it all!

88
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,400
Ukaku squad!

89
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,358
You give me a constant barrage!

90
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,317
Don't stop shooting!

91
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,233
You're up, Suzuya!

92
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,567
Nicely done, Suzuya.

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,442
Now!

94
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,525
My turn!

95
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,150
Did it work?

96
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:20,108
Got it.

97
00:08:20,192 --> 00:08:21,275
[HIDE]
Not yet.

98
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,233
It survived.

99
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,358
Not bad.
Feels like I was born with it.

100
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,400
[JUZO]
Oh, wow.

101
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:48,692
I don't know how
to kill this one.

102
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,692
[KIMI] There's a huge group of
those creatures straight ahead.

103
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:17,317
It looks like this must be
where they incubate.

104
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,067
Regardless, you're closing
in on the second core.

105
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,650
It's further down.

106
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,442
[KANEKI]
Strange.

107
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,942
I can't get her out of my head.

108
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,025
[crackling sounds]

109
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,775
[KANEKI]
Huh?

110
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:50,275
[AYATO]
Bastards are hatching.

111
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:51,775
Get down!

112
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,150
[AYATO]
More coming out every second.

113
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,150
Kaneki!

114
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,400
Go on ahead.

115
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:27,108
I'll stop them.

116
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,567
There's no one who can
take your place, Kaneki.

117
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,525
You need to save your
strength for the real fight.

118
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,567
So go!

119
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,525
[AYATO]
Best of luck,

120
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,358
ya damn in-law.

121
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,900
[MARUDE]
That monster isn't letting up.

122
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,025
How many of us can still move?

123
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,400
[INTEL]
Checking that now, sir.

124
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,900
[NISHIO]
Nagachika, you read me?

125
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:00,483
[HIDE]
Uh. Yeah!

126
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:04,025
There was a weird noise
right before this thing showed.

127
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,650
It was like a whistling sound.

128
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,692
Do you think there
could be a connection?

129
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,400
[HIDE]
It's possible.

130
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:13,108
[gasps]

131
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:15,692
Put on the map please.

132
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,400
The Owl's headless.

133
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:20,192
What if it's being
controlled remotely?

134
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:23,400
[HIDE]
Hinami!

135
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,192
Probe to the south, please.

136
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:26,775
About seven o'clock.

137
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,358
I'm on it.

138
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:36,233
[HINAMI]
The rumble of engines, close.

139
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:39,817
Shouting, further off.

140
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Hurried footsteps.

141
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:44,525
The last breaths of a dying man.

142
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:49,067
Vibrations in the air,
displaced by the Owl.

143
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,483
But beyond that, even further.

144
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:56,108
I can just make out
something else.

145
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,358
I found them!

146
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,150
They're on the roof of
a building three blocks

147
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,317
to the south.

148
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:06,358
[ITORI] Oh my, it sounds
like they're onto us.

149
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,442
[DONATO]
Then we should relocate.

150
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:11,733
[DONATO]
Go on ahead.

151
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,775
[UTA]
Good luck, Crown.

152
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:31,358
It's been a good while,
hasn't it, Kotaro?

153
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,108
[DONATO]
That was a fine attempt.

154
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:58,858
You're strong.

155
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,608
However.

156
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:03,650
It looks like
experience will triumph.

157
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,608
[UTA] I can't tell you
how long I've dreamt

158
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:55,442
this moment would come.

159
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,400
Or how I've imagined the
sweet warmth of your blood,

160
00:13:58,483 --> 00:14:01,400
as I grasp at
your beating heart.

161
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,567
Let's have some fun.

162
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:07,983
[YOMO]
This isn't fun for me, Uta.

163
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:14,275
It's painful, and I don't
mean the hole in my stomach.

164
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,733
Even now, you're a friend.

165
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:17,942
Huh?

166
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,733
[YOMO]
I won't kill you.

167
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,983
And I won't have
you killing me, either.

168
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:30,525
[laughs]

169
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:34,025
I'm so glad to have
you as my friend.

170
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,692
Renji dear.

171
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,733
Always the straight-shooter.

172
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:40,025
Not a bit of guile in you.

173
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:44,858
Even with the world as it is,
you, I can always trust.

174
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,817
[laughs]

175
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,775
Don't you see?

176
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:51,983
I have always wanted to eat you.

177
00:14:54,192 --> 00:15:04,192
[UTA] Make me feel
like I'm alive, Renji.

178
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:11,858
[UTA] Make me feel
like I'm alive, Renji.

179
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:14,858
[UTA]
Now you're all mine.

180
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:35,858
[UTA] Come on, Renji, how
can this not be fun for you?

181
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:40,025
[pants]

182
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,567
[YOMO]
Uta.

183
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,233
We grew up a long time ago.

184
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,567
We can't keep playing
games forever.

185
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:18,400
[UTA] We would have such fun,
playing together.

186
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,400
Why'd you stop?

187
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,400
[UTA]
Hey.

188
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:30,358
You remember that fight?

189
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:34,275
The one we came out of without
a working leg between us?

190
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,650
And Itori took us
home on her back.

191
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:40,400
No matter what was destroyed,

192
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:43,817
or how much blood
the two of us spilled.

193
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,942
In those days,
none of it mattered.

194
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:50,858
But that's over now, isn't it?

195
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:55,858
[UTA]
The world changed around us.

196
00:16:55,942 --> 00:17:00,067
You adapted,
while I stayed the same.

197
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,108
[YOMO] If you want
to eat me, then try again.

198
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,233
[gasps]

199
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:08,817
I mean, that's not
to say I'll let you,

200
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,400
but I wouldn't mind you
causing me trouble.

201
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:16,567
After all, we're friends.

202
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,692
[UTA]
I see.

203
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:20,817
That's quite mature.

204
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,567
Hold on.

205
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,983
You can't carry me like this.

206
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,650
[YOMO]
Watch me.

207
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,900
[MUTSUKI]
Huh?

208
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:35,025
[AMON]
In all these years,

209
00:18:35,108 --> 00:18:39,733
I never harbored any
feeling but hatred for you.

210
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:43,317
But some part of me knew.

211
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,525
A truth that refused to be
ignored or pushed aside.

212
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:55,608
[AMON] This world
can be terribly cruel.

213
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:58,108
And you made it worse.

214
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,108
[AMON]
You're as twisted as they come.

215
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,817
[AMON]
But so am I.

216
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,942
[AMON]
Because...

217
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,233
[AMON]
...I loved you.

218
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:43,775
[DONATO chuckles]

219
00:19:43,858 --> 00:19:46,317
Here lies Donato Porpora,

220
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,025
who was every bit the
villain you knew him to be.

221
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:53,983
I'm sure this looks like the
carnage of the apocalypse.

222
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,150
But man is cunning.

223
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,192
All shall be renewed.

224
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:01,067
I've but helped
to till the field.

225
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,900
[chuckles]

226
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:05,483
This is a fitting death,
I think.

227
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,233
After all the reaping I've done,

228
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:10,775
it's only fair that I should
miss the harvest to come.

229
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:14,192
And it's also fitting that
a paragon of justice like you

230
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,692
should be the one to--

231
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:20,525
[AMON] You used to make us
donuts for breakfast, by hand.

232
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:25,108
When we got cold at night,
you'd bring us extra blankets.

233
00:20:25,192 --> 00:20:28,608
When the dog we used
to keep passed away,

234
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,650
you dug it a grave
in the mountains.

235
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,775
When you say "we,"
you speak of yourself

236
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,317
and the children I dined
on in the shadows.

237
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,108
Are those days
still nostalgic for you?

238
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:43,525
[AMON]
Yes, they are.

239
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:46,192
As much as
I've tried to hate you.

240
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:49,275
As hard as I've tried to forget.

241
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,192
I can't do it.

242
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,942
I can't help but treasure
every moment I spent

243
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,358
at that orphanage.

244
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:03,567
Is it so wrong for a son
to love his father?

245
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:11,067
[laughs]

246
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:14,942
After everything,
you call me father.

247
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:23,192
[laughs]

248
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,942
Looks like this is round two.

249
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,358
[FURUTA]
What are you doing here?

250
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:50,067
Oh goodness.

251
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,608
Don't tell me you
wanna do something crazy.

252
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,858
Like bringing all of
this to a premature end.

253
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:05,525
Well, if that's
how it has to be.

254
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:07,358
Then do your worst.

255
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:10,400
I should warn you,
I'm surprisingly strong.

256
00:23:53,817 --> 00:24:03,775
[clock ticking]

257
00:24:03,858 --> 00:24:14,233
[clock ticking]

258
00:24:14,317 --> 00:24:15,692
[KANEKI]
Thank you.
