00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:12,333
[KANEKI]
Do it. Accept me as part of you.

2
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,333
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon--

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,708
[HAISE]
I won't let you swallow me up.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,208
[BOTH gasp]

[HAISE yells]

7
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,000
He destroyed Orochi's kagune!

8
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,958
[URIE] Don't get your
hopes up. It'll be back.

9
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,166
[HAISE]
You're stronger than I expected.

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,458
--[gasps]
--[OROCHI] Why, thank you.

11
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,708
So awesome!

12
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,625
He's using his kagune
and his quinque!

13
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,833
[OROCHI]
That's cheating!

14
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,208
[OROCHI]
How ya like this?

15
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,083
[groans]

16
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,041
Mr. Sass!

17
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:24,833
[HAISE] What'll I do?
I can't regenerate in time.

18
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,541
[KANEKI]
Haise.

19
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:28,291
Haise!

20
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,208
[HAISE gasps]

21
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,000
You okay?

22
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,333
Stand down.

23
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,791
But, Teach.

24
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,041
You heard the order. Follow it.

25
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,083
[MUTSUKI]
What's with him?

26
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,541
It's like he's
a different person.

27
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,000
You're not getting
past me, Orochi.

28
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,000
[OROCHI]
Oh, really?

29
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,125
You're a lot tougher
than those delinquents

30
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,708
I've been fighting.
What's your story?

31
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:02,416
[laughs] I should warn you,
you're much better off

32
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,666
not knowing anything about me.

33
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,125
[OROCHI]
This guy... He reminds me of--

34
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,791
[OROCHI groans, sputters]

35
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,875
[grunting, groaning]

36
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,791
Now it's payback time!

37
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:42,958
[OROCHI] If you keep this up,
you're gonna kill me.

38
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,458
Jeez. What is it with you?

39
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:51,250
Doesn't matter how hard you
try, you're irredeemable.

40
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,750
Kaneki.

41
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,291
It was you. Nishiki.

42
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,916
[HAISE grunts]

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,208
[HAISE]
What's going on?

44
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:08,083
Who the hell is Nishiki?
I can't think straight!

45
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,583
What am I saying?

46
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,125
[groaning]

47
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,083
[screams]

48
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,000
[OROCHI] Sorry,
old friend. But time's up.

49
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,875
I realize we came here
in pursuit of Orochi.

50
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,791
But now we've got an
SS-rated ghoul on our hands.

51
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,916
Prepare to restrain Haise.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,458
[screams]

53
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,041
[MUTSUKI]
An SS-rated ghoul?

54
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,041
Kuramoto. Takeomi.

55
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:42,666
Yes, sir!

56
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,875
Ready!

57
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,291
[URIE]
Kuroiwa.

58
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,541
[groans]

59
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:54,916
Akira.

60
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,625
Yeah. He's in in my sights.

61
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,791
Time for a little nap, Haise.

62
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:14,291
So, our attempt to secure
Torso and Orochi failed.

63
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,541
I see.

64
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,333
[AKIRA]
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

65
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,708
No matter.

66
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,708
Now, tell me what
happened to Sasaki.

67
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,541
[AKIRA] He lost control
while fighting Orochi.

68
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,833
Thanks to Senior
Investigator Hirako,

69
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,208
we were able to restrain
him successfully.

70
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,000
I suppose it's possible

71
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:34,958
that contact with Orochi
triggered his breakdown.

72
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,791
Well, good work,
Senior Investigator Mado.

73
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,791
Please continue to look
after the Quinx Squad

74
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,333
and First Class Sasaki.

75
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,958
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,791
[AKIRA] The Quinx project
is Chief Washu's doing.

77
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,291
He initiated the
project himself.

78
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,375
And he's the one who selected
a half-ghoul, Haise Sasaki,

79
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,750
to act as the
Quinx Squad's mentor.

80
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,375
The question is: What
are his true motives?

81
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,250
[KIJIMA]
Investigator Mado.

82
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,833
Is something the matter, dear?

83
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,500
You have such a serious
look on your face.

84
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,625
[AKIRA]
I'm fine, Investigator Kijima.

85
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,916
Heard your last
mission was eventful.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,750
Trouble with Sasaki?

87
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,083
Yes.

88
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,000
Luckily, we were able
to get him under control

89
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,583
without incident.

90
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,416
I find the Quinx Squad
utterly fascinating.

91
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,125
The half-ghoul--
First Class Sasaki--

92
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,083
and his team of investigators
with built-in quinques,

93
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:34,375
scouring the streets
for top-rated ghouls.

94
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,583
I would love to talk more,
but I must hurry along.

95
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,416
I have a guest coming
in from Germany

96
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,625
and must prepare
for their arrival.

97
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,125
It was a pleasure
to run into you.

98
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:47,416
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Let's get going, Furuta.

99
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,333
[AKIRA]
Item.

100
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,291
Haise Sasaki is to be
treated as a human.

101
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,791
However, if he loses control,

102
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,208
investigators are required
to treat him as a ghoul

103
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,958
and he must be... exterminated.

104
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,291
[AKIRA] What a cruel
set of instructions.

105
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,958
[SAIKO]
O-Ooh! Ha, ha...

106
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,375
As an investigator,
if a foe threatens your life,

107
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,958
you run!

108
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,416
Does that really justify
a slap in the face?

109
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,625
[HAISE]
You're the captain!

110
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,708
You never should've
exposed them to danger.

111
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,833
Isn't it even more dangerous
to turn your back on the enemy?

112
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:38,041
If I hadn't shown up when I did,
you would all be dead.

113
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:40,291
Do you understand
the finality of death?

114
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,041
As long as you're breathing,
you've still got another chance.

115
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,833
But once you're gone,
there's no bringing you back.

116
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,250
Urie. I can't risk
this happening again.

117
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,083
You're relieved
as squad captain.

118
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,791
[BOTH gasp]

119
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:56,750
[URIE]
I find that hard to accept.

120
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,833
[HAISE]
Superior's orders.

121
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,750
You're just a ghoul to me.

122
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,875
[HAISE gasps]

123
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,458
[SHIRAZU]
Urie!

124
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,541
Mr. Sass risked his
life to save us,

125
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,708
you ungrateful bastard!

126
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,083
You're much worse than
any ghoul I've come across.

127
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,416
I should kill you right here
while I've got the chance!

128
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,625
I'd like to see you try.

129
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:27,458
[MUTSUKI] Urie. Don't
do this. Just apologize

130
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,166
[URIE]
Good for nothing hypocrites.

131
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,416
[HAISE]
C'mon, let him go, Shirazu.

132
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,958
[HAISE]
Urie can say whatever he wants--

133
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,916
it's not going
to change my mind.

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,958
Besides, I've already
decided on a replacement.

135
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,000
Quinx Squad's new captain

136
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,916
is Investigator Ginshi Shirazu.

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,541
Huh?

138
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:47,375
[gasps]

139
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:48,041
Huh?

140
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,958
[SHIRAZU]
Who, me?

141
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,541
Uh. But... I...

142
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,375
Hang on, are you sure, Mr. Sass?

143
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,791
That's a job for
someone with smarts.

144
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,166
I ain't got the chops!

145
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,125
You may not be the
sharpest tool in the shed,

146
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,083
but you'll look out for
the team. I trust you.

147
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,083
If you get too defiant,
I'll have no choice.

148
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,666
I'll devour you.

149
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,333
Y'know, since I'm
just a ghoul and all.

150
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:14,916
Hey, listen, Urie.

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,791
[SAIKO shrieks]

152
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,208
[bang]

153
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:25,083
[SAIKO whines]
Stupid score cap!

154
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,791
[ARIMA]
You chose Ginshi Shirazu?

155
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:31,833
[HAISE]
Yes.

156
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,458
Appearances notwithstanding,

157
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,458
he is considerate
of those around him.

158
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:39,333
There's no doubt that Urie
is outstanding, but...

159
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:42,916
[ARIMA] An interesting choice
of direction, Haise.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,166
It's just like you.

161
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,291
I only hope that Urie...
sees this as an...

162
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,916
...opportunity to work
on his attitude.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,291
You sound like a parent.

164
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,583
You care about them, don't you?

165
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,916
Yeah, I do.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,666
They're like my high-maintenance
children, y'know?

167
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,875
Okay, I surrender.

168
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,250
You're getting
stronger. Not bad.

169
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,125
Arima. Mind if we talk?

170
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,500
Let me guess,
it's the voice again?

171
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,083
Yes, sir.

172
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:22,166
I tried to fight him off, but
he kept whispering in my ear.

173
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,916
Somehow, I just know
that's my former self.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,291
I don't remember anything

175
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,541
about the first 20
years of my life.

176
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,666
It was hard. Realizing
that I'd lost so much.

177
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,208
But it doesn't matter.
I'm happy where I am.

178
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,916
If my former self resurfaces
and takes control.

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,500
I risk losing everything
I've worked so hard

180
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:50,291
to build over the last two
years, and that frightens me.

181
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,916
I understand, but what
about the friends and family

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,791
from your past that
you left behind?

183
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,791
I'm not concerned with them.

184
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,708
I have a family.

185
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,333
I'll be sure to stop by
the Chateau sometime soon.

186
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,666
I would like to
borrow another book.

187
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,000
[HAISE] You don't have
to go to all that trouble.

188
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:15,458
I can always just
bring it to you.

189
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,791
That's okay.

190
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,250
It'd be nice to see
my "grandkids," too.

191
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,583
[gasps]

192
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,458
[HAISE] If there comes a time
that I lose control,

193
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,291
and I can't go back to normal...

194
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,875
I hope Arima knows.
I'm sure he does.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,791
[OROCHI]
You're irredeemable.

196
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:43,000
[HAISE] You're wrong.
I've been redeemed.

197
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,375
The only reason
I'm here is 'cause...

198
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,041
[HAISE]
I've found my place.

199
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,583
Even though it's
not a real family.

200
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:56,083
[SHIMOGUCHI grunting]

201
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,583
[SHIMOGUCHI]
Calling CCG HQ.

202
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:03,583
While Shimoguchi Squad
was investigating Torso...

203
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,458
We were attacked by
a ghoul from Aogiri.

204
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:09,750
[SHIMOGUCHI] Rabbit has left
my squadron incapacitated.

205
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,041
I repeat.

206
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,625
We were attacked
by the SS-rated ghoul

207
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,208
Rabbit.

208
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,333
[TAKEOMI]
Urie.

209
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:33,916
[URIE]
Yes, Kuroiwa?

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,708
How's Investigator Sasaki doing?

211
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,041
There's no need to worry.

212
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,458
Our squad's mentor is
tougher than you'd think.

213
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,875
[TAKEOMI]
Apparently. Well, good.

214
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,500
[URIE] No, it's not.
Nothing is "good," Kuroiwa.

215
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,375
You're the spawn of
that despicable man

216
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,875
who left my father to die.
There's no excuse.

217
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,416
Why didn't he fight
alongside him?

218
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,208
[URIE]
You don't know how it feels.

219
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,625
The pain of knowing that what
little remains of your dad

220
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,000
is lying inside a coffin.

221
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,291
You've still got your father.

222
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,000
You're a lucky bastard,
Takeomi Kuroiwa.

223
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,125
[TAKEOMI]
Well, let me know

224
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,375
when it'd be a good
time to stop by.

225
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,916
Take care of yourself.

226
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,208
[URIE] You, too. Don't work
yourself too hard.

227
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,791
[URIE] I hope he
works himself to death.

228
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,041
[AKIRA]
Thank you for seeing us.

229
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,916
I'm sorry to hear about
your men, Investigator.

230
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,916
I know it's hard,
but I need you to tell us

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,791
what happened that day.

232
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,875
You're telling me you want
your kagune beefed-up?

233
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,000
[URIE]
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,250
And you think doing
that will make you

235
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,958
more like Sasaki?

236
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,375
[SHIBA] You don't seem to
understand how this works.

237
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,875
I'll go over the science
with you one more time.

238
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,375
The idea to create
Quinxes, like you,

239
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,125
came about thanks to Sasaki's
unique half-ghoul state.

240
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,458
A kakuho was taken from a ghoul
and implanted within your body.

241
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,708
Then five stages of
Frames were set up.

242
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,083
You started at Frame 1,

243
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,291
but you've already
increased to Frame 2.

244
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,666
Your kakuho's currently
operating at 40% capacity.

245
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,750
[URIE]
I get it.

246
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,916
So, if I wanna use
a stronger kagune,

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,791
all we have to do is
raise my Frame level

248
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,750
and I'll be good
to go, right, Doc?

249
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,625
[SHIBA] Yes, but I
wouldn't recommend it.

250
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,458
[URIE]
Too late--my mind's made up.

251
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,833
[URIE] I wanna go through
with it, Dr. Shiba.

252
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,250
[SHIBA sighs]

253
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,833
[SHIBA] I'll need you
to get both the chief

254
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,708
and your mentor's
permission, please.

255
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:47,083
[URIE] Don't go playing
the moralist now, old man.

256
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,291
[HAISE]
The attacker goes by "Rabbit"?

257
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,666
Yeah.

258
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,500
The same ghoul who
teamed up with Fueguchi

259
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,666
to kill my father.

260
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,041
The infamous Kureo Mado.

261
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,541
Arima's told me all about him.

262
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:00,541
He said he was an
excellent investigator.

263
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,791
He also said

264
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,916
he learned how to handle
a quinque thanks to him.

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,916
I suspect Torso is
affiliated with Aogiri.

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,541
If that's true, it's a matter
of time before we lose the case.

267
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:16,083
HQ will want it taken over
by someone in S1 through S3.

268
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,291
[HAISE] Do you think
Shimoguchi's gonna be okay?

269
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,291
[AKIRA] I hope so, but he
was the only one to survive.

270
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,916
And that's a bitter pill.

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,125
Huh?

272
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
It's painful to lose
those who you've spent

273
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,083
so much of your time with.

274
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,500
[AYATO]
Know that, once you join Aogiri,

275
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,208
it won't be easy
for you to leave.

276
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,041
Think long and hard
before you make a decision.

277
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,583
[TORSO]
I don't have any choice,

278
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,416
I've got nowhere else to go.

279
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,208
But Aogiri?

280
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,250
How did it come to this?

281
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,625
[TORSO]
Hang on.

282
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,708
[TORSO] If I make use
of Aogiri, then maybe...

283
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,125
[AYATO]
Hey, Saeki.

284
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,750
Yeah? And you are?

285
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,041
[AYATO]
The name's Ayato.

286
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,625
What'd you wanna ask me?

287
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,958
[AYATO]
Rumor has it you went up against

288
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,833
the Quinx Squad.

289
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,833
Was there a guy named
Haise Sasaki among them?

290
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208
This sucks!

291
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,833
We worked our tails off,
and for nothin'!

292
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,208
[URIE]
I'm back, what's up?

293
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,000
We just found out
that HQ decided

294
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,333
to pull us off the
Torso investigation.

295
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,583
Ugh. I'm more than
a little pissed off,

296
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,000
but they're sayin' they
have reason to believe

297
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,333
he's a member of Aogiri Tree.

298
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,208
Then there's nothing we can do.

299
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,458
S1 through S3 are in charge
of Aogiri matters, remember?

300
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,875
Yeah, but it blows
'cause I feel like

301
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,458
we almost had him, y'know?

302
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,500
I know how you feel,

303
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,458
but we can't get
mixed up with them.

304
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,958
Do you have any idea how
many casualties there were

305
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,708
in the war against
Aogiri Tree two years ago?

306
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,250
Well? Do you?

307
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,375
I dunno.

308
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,791
[door opens]

309
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,291
[SHIRAZU]
What're you doin', Saiko?

310
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,958
[SAIKO sighs]

311
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,666
[SHIRAZU] No way.
Don't even think about it.

312
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,250
You seriously gonna eat
that whole ham by yourself?

313
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,166
[yells]

314
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,375
[SAIKO]
