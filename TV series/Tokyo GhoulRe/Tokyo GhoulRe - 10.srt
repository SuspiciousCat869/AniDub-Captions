00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,958
Without proper knowledge
of the enemy's strength,

162
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,333
expanding the scope
of this investigation

163
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,708
would be a fool's gambit.

164
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,791
Then finding out should
be our first priority.

165
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,541
Special Investigator Ui.

166
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,375
Would you reconsider the
mission I proposed before?

167
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,458
[UI sighs]

168
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,500
[UI] Very well.
Please fill in the others.

169
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,625
Yes, sir.

170
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,041
[SHIRAZU] You really look
the part, Mister Sass.

171
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,750
[HAISE] Oh, yeah?
So, we get any useful intel?

172
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,583
[SHIRAZU] Yeah. We went
undercover in the 18th ward.

173
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,250
Apparently, it's run
by someone called

174
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,166
"Three Blades Miza."

175
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,833
If our luck holds up,
then I think

176
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,833
we might be able to find
a member of Aogiri tree.

177
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,166
[HAISE]
You don't say.

178
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,416
Urie? How 'bout you?

179
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,750
We carried out our investigation
in the sixth ward.

180
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,833
All the ghouls we came
in contact with there

181
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,333
had their guards up.

182
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,000
Further investigation
may be needed.

183
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,333
They're probably acting
a bit warier these days

184
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,541
on account of what's
happened with Rose.

185
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,000
[HAISE] I can see how
that would make them

186
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,625
more cautious around outsiders.

187
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,875
[HAISE sighs]

188
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,583
[SHIRAZU] So how'd it go
for you, Mister Sass?

189
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,541
[HAISE]
O-Oh.

190
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,541
[GHOULS gasp]

191
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,166
[GHOUL B]
Oh, no, it's Eyepatch!

192
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,875
[GHOULS pant, yelp]

193
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,416
[HAISE]
This mask.

194
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,208
It seems that it's
known amongst ghouls.

195
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,541
[HAISE] I need to learn more
about the Eyepatch Ghoul.

196
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:21,166
[HAISE] Kotaro Amon was killed
in the line of duty.

197
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,500
Strange, it doesn't
give any details.

198
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,083
[HAISE] Is that information
being concealed?

199
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,083
Maybe it's the same
with the Eyepatch ghoul.

200
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,708
But why?

201
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,333
[grunts]

202
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,416
[KANEKI]
It... It was me.

203
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,625
[gasps]

204
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,208
[KANEKI]
He's dead because...

205
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,500
Because I...

206
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,333
I killed him.

207
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,625
[TSUKIYAMA]
Aliza.

208
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,750
[gasps] Master Shu.

209
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,375
I'm so sorry.

210
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,708
Yuma was captured because of me.

211
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,333
[ALIZA] That's all right.
Don't blame yourself.

212
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,625
[ALIZA]
I just wanna see him again.

213
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,833
[TSUKIYAMA]
I give you my word.

214
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,166
I'll do everything in my
power to bring him back.

215
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:29,625
[TSUKIYAMA] Bon jour.
I'd hoped I might run into you.

216
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:33,083
Actually, I wanted
to see you, too.

217
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,208
[TSUKIYAMA]
Then this is doubly fortunate.

218
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:41,458
Sorry. But are you a ghoul?

219
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,708
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]

220
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,375
Let me rephrase that.

221
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:49,500
Are you someone
who knew Ken Kaneki?

222
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,833
[TSUKIYAMA] Can I tell him
the truth? I don't know.

223
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,750
Before now, I tried
to avoid my past,

224
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,000
to bury my former self.

225
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,625
But... I need to
find out who he was.

226
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,791
So that I can become
his redemption.

227
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,500
First, tell me this.

228
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,208
Does it bother you
that, in doing so,

229
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,625
you may be forsaking that self?

230
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,750
[inhales]

231
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,208
That's fine.

232
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,791
[TSUKIYAMA gasps]

233
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,666
[HAISE] I want to be human,
even with this body.

234
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,500
Kaneki was someone
who was dreaded

235
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,833
even by his fellow ghouls.

236
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,625
That isn't who I want to be.

237
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,666
I want my life to stay
like it is forever.

238
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,583
But someday, I know that
I'll have to remember.

239
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:39,916
I guess, it's something
like my destiny.

240
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,875
So I'm asking.

241
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,791
Please, if you know
anything about me,

242
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,666
then say it.

243
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,958
I'm sorry, but I
no longer know...

244
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,333
[TSUKIYAMA] ...what it is
I should say to you.

245
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,833
Would you ever die for
your ingredients, Tsukiyama?

246
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,875
[TSUKIYAMA]
Hori. You knew, didn't you?

247
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,791
That I couldn't
allow myself to die.

248
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,208
There are too many people
I hold precious in this world,

249
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,875
for me to leave it.

250
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,875
[TSUKIYAMA] But, I certainly
did enjoy those days.

251
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:35,875
When I could simply
gaze upon my delicacies.

252
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,750
Truly. It's something
I shall miss.

253
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,458
[ALIZA whimpering]

254
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,625
[KIJIMA] You must've known
that I only let word

255
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,083
of my whereabouts spread
because I was hoping

256
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,375
that someone would
come after me.

257
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,833
I must admit, this is
quite touching to see.

258
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,500
You attacked me all by yourself

259
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,708
in the hopes of
saving your friend.

260
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,583
He's already dead of course,
but the thought was there.

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,625
[KIJIMA] Ah, what a tug
on the heartstrings.

262
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,708
However, I must admit
that I'm concerned

263
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,416
about how loose those
lips of yours are.

264
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,125
Everybody knows
that a good servant

265
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,291
should always be discreet.

266
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,541
[KIJIMA] You truly were
a brave young woman.

267
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,791
May all your comrades
be the same.

268
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,250
[UI] The Tsukiyama group
has been influential

269
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
for more than 100 years.

270
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,250
Their company has assets in
a wide variety of industries

271
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,416
with over 20 subsidiaries.

272
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,166
If the truth were
to become public,

273
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,458
we'd surely face pressure
from all quarters,

274
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,166
which would hinder
our investigation.

275
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,250
Please request an
information blackout

276
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,875
and a full investigation into

277
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,041
the Tsukiyama company
and its affiliates.

278
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,666
Very well.

279
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,916
Captain of the S1 Squad,
Senior Investigator Kori Ui.

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,708
You are hereby
commanded to carry out

281
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,416
"Operation Dispatch Tsukiyama."

282
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,833
Yes, sir!

283
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:16,041
[UI] Special Investigator
Washuu. Need something?

284
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,083
[MATSURI]
S2 will be supporting you.

285
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,791
This is a courtesy call.

286
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,333
I'll be presiding
over this mission,

287
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,791
and I'm glad to
have you onboard.

288
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:27,416
And I look forward
to seeing you in action.

289
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,875
[UI] That damn hyena's just
hoping he can claim more credit.

290
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,958
[MATSURI] He's just
a punk from Arima's cult.

291
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,416
[AKIRA]
Someone's hard at work.

292
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,833
[HAISE]
Akira.

293
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,625
So what are you
snooping around in?

294
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:48,833
I was just... just
reading some old files.

295
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,291
[AKIRA]
Reading up on Kotaro Amon?

296
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,625
Yes.

297
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,541
Well then, you're in luck.
I knew him personally.

298
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:58,541
He died in battle, during the
Owl Extermination Mission.

299
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,833
Was there anything else
you wanted to know?

300
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,791
[HAISE]
About the Eyepatch Ghoul.

301
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,250
That's a name you should forget.

302
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,166
[HAISE]
Sorry, I can't do that!

303
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,333
[gasps]

304
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,125
Why don't you want me
to know that name?

305
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,125
Is it because I'm
the Eyepatch Ghoul?

306
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,583
Is it because I'm the
one who... murdered Amon?

307
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,333
You don't get it.

308
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:24,250
The terror of waking up each day
and not knowing anything.

309
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,708
I'm trying my best to trust
in what I've been told,

310
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,625
but it just isn't enough.

311
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,333
Uh...

312
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,541
[HAISE sobs]
Where...

313
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:34,375
Where did I come from? Who am I?

314
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,041
Hais--

315
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:38,000
My name isn't Haise!

316
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:41,833
I... I...

317
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:50,041
Haise. You're you.

318
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,791
Regardless of your
name. You're you.

319
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:03,833
[TSUKIYAMA]
Yuma. Kaneki. Kanae.

320
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,125
Could I have--?

321
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,375
[knocking]

322
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,250
[MIRUMO]
Hello, Shu.

323
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,625
Huh? Papa.

324
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,833
I brewed a cup
of coffee for you.

325
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,291
[TSUKIYAMA]
Thank you.

326
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,583
It's unhealthy to dwell
on things for too long.

327
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,750
Leave it to your coffee, Papa.

328
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,041
It's woken me back... up...

329
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,000
[MIRUMO]
Matsumae.

330
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,708
[MATSUMAE]
Sir?

331
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,000
Please take my son to safety.

332
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,500
[UI]
Mirumo Tsukiyama?

333
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,333
[MIRUMO]
Oui.

334
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,916
[UI]
Don't move.

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,041
I have no intention of fighting
or attempting to run from you.

336
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,083
This is a house of gentlemen.

337
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,958
[UI] This ghoul's trying
to play for sympathy.

338
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,041
My servants are all
in their rooms.

339
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,000
They are ghouls, the same as I.

340
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,333
But up to now, we have
lived as humans would.

341
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,833
Please allow us to do so
until the very end.

342
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,041
[INVESTIGATOR A] Mirumo
Tsukiyama has been secured.

343
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,416
Repeat! Tsukiyama
has been secured!

344
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,916
[SAIKO]
Sweet, let's go home.

345
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,125
[URIE] The mission's
already accomplished?

346
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,916
Screw that, Rose.
Put up a fight.

347
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,791
Let me increase my kill count.

348
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,791
[HAISE] Something about
this doesn't smell right.

349
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,125
[MATSURI]
It's a distraction.

350
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:46,833
Whose escape would the master
secure by giving himself up?

351
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,125
A wife or child maybe?

352
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,125
We've set up a perimeter
around the estate.

353
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:55,250
He should know that
they won't get far.

354
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,000
Give me a list of
all buildings owned

355
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,791
by the Tsukiyama family.

356
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:00,958
[INVESTIGATOR B]
Yes, sir.

357
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,291
[MATSURI]
Crafty little worms.

358
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,333
[MATSUMAE]
Master Shu. You're awake.

359
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,958
Matsumae, where--?

360
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,083
Where are we? What's going on?

361
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,416
[MATSUMAE]
We're out for a drive.

362
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,083
Look me in the eye when
you answer this question.

363
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,541
Papa. Where is he?

364
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,458
Master Mirumo chose
to remain at his estate.

365
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,333
The other servants
are with him as well.

366
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,916
As of seven PM today,

367
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,875
the Tsukiyama family's social
privilege no longer exists.

368
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:39,333
[gasps] Hold on.
Are you saying that--?

369
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,125
[MATSUMAE] The family
secret has been exposed.

370
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,791
The CCG is closing
their net as we speak.

371
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,916
Master Mirumo has elected
to allow them to capture him.

372
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,250
So that we... will have a
better chance of escaping.

373
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,708
It's happening again.

374
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,583
Matsumae! You have
to take me back!

375
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,875
[MATSUMAE]
I can't do that.

376
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:02,333
[TSUKIYAMA] Please,
I have to save my father!

377
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,000
[MATSUMAE]
You can't.

378
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,708
[TSUKIYAMA]
Matsumae!

379
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,416
It's over now.

380
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,083
Due to my failure, the annals
of the Tsukiyama family

381
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,333
have come to a close.

382
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,333
But, Master Shu.
While you survive,

383
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,291
your bloodline and
history can continue

384
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,125
in another form.

385
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,958
You're saying that I must

386
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,250
take all their lives
upon myself now.

387
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,041
[MATSUMAE]
It's the duty of a family head.

388
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,708
[TSUKIYAMA]
So that's what this feeling is.

389
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,875
No wonder I can't stop it.

390
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,041
[TSUKIYAMA]
All right.

391
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,958
[MATSUMAE]
Time is running short.

392
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,875
I have to speed up a bit.

393
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,833
[MATSUMAE]
Master.

394
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,125
These are all ghouls
of the Tsukiyama group.

395
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,041
[ASADA] When we heard
you were in trouble,

396
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,125
we all came as
quickly as we could.

397
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,500
[KUREI] It'll be some time
before the helicopter arrives.

398
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,791
Until you're able
to make your escape,

399
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,458
it will be our honor
to defend you.

400
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,625
[TSUKIYAMA] So many people
answered his call.

401
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,750
I'm impressed anew by
my father's greatness.

402
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,625
Yes.

403
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,458
This is what your family
built for our kind.

404
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,500
[ASADA] Wow, I hadn't seen
Master Shu since he was a kid.

405
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,666
He's grown into
a real looker, huh?

406
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,708
That he has.

407
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,166
I'm glad we got
the chance to see.

408
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,625
Yeah. He should've done
some modeling for us.

409
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,666
I bet that look would've
been a real hit.

410
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,958
Our very own ghoul poster boy.

411
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,583
Would've been great.

412
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,250
[ASADA] We owe everything
we have to Master Mirumo.

413
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,750
To his family.

414
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,500
Yes, I know.

415
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,541
Now we can repay that
debt with our lives.

416
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,333
I suppose we'd better make
these doves earn their pay.

417
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,583
[KUREI] We don't even have
time to get sentimental.

418
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,875
Commence the extermination.

421
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,083
If you want to be
treasured by someone,

422
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:09,000
you must first remove the
one they treasure already.

423
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,333
I'm going to share
another bone with you now.

424
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,458
It'll be okay.

425
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,208
You'll be loved
for sure this time.

426
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,041
I mean,

427
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,041
just look how adorable you are.
