us to go undercover.

[SHIRAZU] First, you made us
dress like chicks, and now this?

We already have

we can wear their uniforms.

00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,375
It's quite popular. The number
of views has been climbing.

161
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,416
When they see you torturing
their man, Rose will retaliate.

162
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,583
What were you thinking,
egging them on like that?

163
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,375
Do you have any idea of the
danger you've put yourself in?

164
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,875
I'm well aware I've
jeopardized my safety.

165
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,625
The thing is,
I'm not afraid of dying,

166
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,791
so I honestly
couldn't care less.

167
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,416
You're violating the
anti-ghoul act, Kijima.

168
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah.

169
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,416
Anyway, I have a meeting with
the board of inquiry in a bit.

170
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,125
So, if you'll excuse me,
I must be going.

171
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:49,291
I'll see you later, unless I end
up getting kicked off the team.

172
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,166
Crazy bastard.

173
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,875
[SHIRAZU]
Mr. Sass.

174
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,791
Have you seen the video?

175
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,208
Yeah, it was hard to watch.

176
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,916
I don't care who he is,
that's too cruel.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,583
It's just...

178
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,666
There has to be some other way.

179
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,541
Maybe...

180
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,916
But in the end,
they'll still be killed.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,041
What?

182
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,291
[SHIRAZU]
It's nothin'.

183
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,625
[TSUKIYAMA] I feel as though I'm
responsible for Yuma's capture.

184
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,875
I can tell that Aliza is
pretty broken up about it.

185
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,708
You've been working so hard.

186
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,625
Diligently harvesting
day after day,

187
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,000
simply to procure
sustenance for me.

188
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,875
Master. Please forgive
me if I'm out of line,

189
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,333
but you didn't force
us to do so,

190
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,375
we did it of our own volition.

191
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,083
The only reason that
Yuma was captured

192
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,333
is because we botched
the mission.

193
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,375
By no means should you feel
responsible, Master Shu.

194
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,208
Matsumae. Mairo.

195
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,083
I need your help.

196
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,750
There must be a way for us
to get Aliza's smile back.

197
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,125
[KANAE] You've come up
with a rescue plan?

198
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,375
Yes. And the key man
will be Ken Kaneki.

199
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,125
I haven't quite worked out
all of the details as of yet.

200
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,125
However, we can use
his investigator status

201
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,500
to our favor.

202
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,166
I don't know, Master.

203
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,500
Are you sure he'll listen
to what you have to say?

204
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,208
What if he refuses to help?

205
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,375
[TSUKIYAMA]
If it were anyone else,

206
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,375
it would be difficult
to convince them.

207
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,041
But with Kaneki,
it'll be <i>pas de problème</i> .

208
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,583
I've no doubt he
will gladly accept

209
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,458
my request for assistance.

210
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,833
As long as we can get his
memories back, all is well.

211
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,375
<i>Tout va bien</i> !

212
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,166
My dearest Kaneki.

213
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,666
He probably doesn't even want
to be a ghoul investigator.

214
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,500
[KANAE] I'm glad to see
Master Shu so optimistic.

215
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:40,750
Nevertheless, it worries me.

216
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,750
[CHIE] Oh, I see. Yeah, I
figured that might happen.

217
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,916
Okay, then.

218
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,416
Here's what I'm gonna
need you to do,

219
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,416
go ahead and give him
the second photograph.

220
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,041
All right, then.

221
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,750
[KANAE] I don't need that little
<i>mauschen</i> barking orders at me.

222
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,083
Master Shu always come first.

His wish is my <i>gebot</i> .

Hello there.

00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,375
Huh?

00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,833
[HAISE]
Oh. Feeling better?

230
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,583
Yes, I am, thanks for asking.

[TSUKIYAMA]
Ah, my sweet Kaneki.

[HAISE] You look much
healthier than before.

I am. May I?

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,125
[HAISE]
Sure, be my guest.

235
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,583
[TSUKIYAMA]
Oh, Kaneki.

236
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,958
I can't believe you
don't remember me.

237
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,416
After everything we've
been through.

238
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,041
Do you enjoy reading?

239
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,291
[HAISE]
Uh, yeah.

240
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,166
That's usually how I
spend my free time,

241
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,625
with my nose in a book.

242
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,291
[TSUKIYAMA]
That's it!

243
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,166
[TSUKIYAMA]
I enjoy reading, as well.

244
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,333
Have you ever read any
of Sen Takatsuki's works?

245

I think you'd enjoy them.

[HAISE]
Yeah.

[TSUKIYAMA]
My dearest Kaneki...

00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,041
I know you better than you
even know yourself right now.

249
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,541
I've read her work.

250
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,875
She's a talented author,
but her books aren't for me.

251
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,041
Really?

252
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,041
I get attached to
characters when I read,

253
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,666
but in her novels, she'll kill
off anyone, even the main.

254
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,541
It's just too painful.

Here's a question for you.

Would you ever die for your

I can't help but wonder
what happened to the others.

[URIE] This is my chance

Are they the ones we're after?

Look at 'em, Shosei!

They're nothin'
but a bunch of kids.

It's the White Suits.

Man, what a letdown.

Hoguro.

This is an incredibly
important job for us.

In this case, it's better
to be safe than sorry.

[HOGURO] True. We'll get
this job done in no time.

[HOGURO]
Hang on.

00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,458
I can't remember
whether this guy

So, what's the job?

346
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,583
[KANAE] I need you to get rid of
some investigators for me.

347
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,625
Your targets are in this photo.

Can you do that?

You want us to off four doves?

00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,916

I'll pay you upfront.

And for each one of
them that you kill,

00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,791
I'll pay you double that amount.

Screw it! I can't remember.

Don't worry, Saiko,
he's gonna be fine.

[SHIKORAE]
Ouch!

477
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,333
[SAIKO]
Uh.

478
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,333
Thank you, Mister.

479
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,875
Uh...

Saiko!

You okay?

[SAIKO]
Maman.

484
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,166
That big man in black saved me.

[MIRUMO] Please allow us to
do so until the very end.

489
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,916
[KIJIMA] I must admit.
This is quite touching to see.

[SHIRAZU] Investigator
Sasaki said that, too.

491

[ASADA] We all came
as quickly as we could.
