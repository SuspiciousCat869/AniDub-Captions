My poor Shu.

00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:18,583
[KANAE] Master Mirumo,
I have news.

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,583
Master Shu has begun
eating indiscriminately,

4
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,708
and he has lost control
of his kagune.

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,875
If this goes on, I fear that...

6
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,000
[MIRUMO]
That he'll come apart?

7
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,583
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:39,041
[MIRUMO yells]

9
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:40,916
[KANAE]
Master Mirumo?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,333
Please forgive me.

11
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,791
I lost my composure
for a moment there.

12
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,416
Master Shu.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,833
[KANAE sniffling]

14
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:59,958
[TSUKIYAMA] Hello. You're
Kanae von Rosewald, yes?

15
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,875
I'm Shu Tsukiyama.

16
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,625
I heard that we'd
taken on a new servant.

17
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:09,875
Welcome to the family.
Have you settled in?

18
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,916
Uh... Yeah.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,250
[TSUKIYAMA]
Rosewald.

20
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:19,125
It means "rose forest,"
correct? Come, young man.

21
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,833
I can show you
a forest of roses.

22
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:32,500
Look there. The <i>duftwolke</i> .

23
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,000
A noble German rose.

24
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,333
Kanae, we are distant brothers,

25
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,125
bound by blood.

26
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,458
So you need not cry alone.

27
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,375
Instead, live proudly
and beautifully.

28
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,666
Such that you rival this rose.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,791
That is the duty of all
members of our family.

30
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,833
[ALIZA]
Kanae!

31
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,041
Um. You should see this.

I have no choice.

Damn you.

What do you worthless
fools take me for?

40
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,875
I am a gourmet.

41
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,208
[TSUKIYAMA]
Bring me my epicurean delights.

wrestle with their quarry!

[TSUKIYAMA] Kanae. What
are you doing in here?

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,791
I was tidying up
your room, Master.

50
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,833
Apologies if I
disturbed your sleep.

Not at all.

Thank you.

have to see me like this.

No. It's not your fault.

56
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,958
[TSUKIYAMA]
You will watch over

the Tsukiyama family
for me. Won't you?

Yes.

Hey.

[TATARA] Impossible.
Cochlea will not fall again.

00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,000
How many times must you ask?

70
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,541
Hinami's abilities are
indispensable to Aogiri.

71
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:41,958
[TATARA] Since when were you
one of my advisors, Ayato?

00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,041
I'll judge who's
dispensable for myself.

[AYATO]
Something funny, Takizawa?

75
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,250
Oh, I just think the way
ghouls care about each other

76
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,291
is kinda kooky,
and kooky kinda sounds

77
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,416
like cookie, and cookies
are good, don't'cha think?

Don't.

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,333
You and Fueguchi knew the risks
when you decided to act alone.

We'll simply recruit

What is Aogiri to you?

86
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,041
Just a bunch of interchangeable
pawns in your game?

[TATARA] That's right.
And you are just a stray dog.

This might help.

[HAISE] Lots of people get sick
when they first see a quinque.

Especially when it's from
a ghoul they killed.

The bounty I got for
taking out the Nutcracker.

A little bit. I'm sorry.

Whenever I was feeling down,

126
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:54,083
you'd always bring me books,
same as you are now.

127

It's strange.

128
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,041
I have no idea how I'm
supposed to treat you.

129
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:03,000
But I guess a lot of us
are feeling that way now.

130
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:06,458
You had friends.
You know that, right?

[HAISE] Why am I pretending
I'm on this ghoul's side?

135
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,916
When the time comes, she'll be--

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,208
Do I want to save her?

137
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,750
[HAISE]
What am I thinking? Who am I?

138
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,833
Oh! How's it going?

139
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,875
I, uh, definitely wasn't
trying to hide or anything.

140
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:53,041
[KIJIMA] I was wondering where
you'd run off to. Furuta.

141
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:55,500
Oh, why hello there.

00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,666
I'm Kijima, nice to meet you.

143
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,333
And you as well. I'm Sasaki.

Yes, I'm well aware.

I believe this Rose

working closely together.
When the time comes,

I hope you'll take it easy
on me so I don't fall behind.

00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,041
Well, I'm afraid
we must be going.

150
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,666
Do come along, Furuta.

151
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,708
It was nice to meet you.

[KANAE]
Tell me, Mauschen.

153
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,000
What exactly is it
that makes you feel

154
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,041
so partial to Master Shu?

155
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,583
Huh.

Well, he's fun to be around.

157
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:38,875
Wouldn't you agree?
That's most of it.

158
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,291
[KANAE gasps]

159
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,875
[KANAE]
You say you can help him.

then tell me how, Mauschen.

00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,958
[CHIE]
Here!

162
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,833
[INVESTIGATOR A]
Are you Chie Hori?

163
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,000
[gasps]

164
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,333
You're suspected of
assisting in ghoul predation.

165
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,166
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

166
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,625
[INVESTIGATORS]
Uh--

167
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:08,750
[BOTH gasp]

168
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:10,208
[INVESTIGATOR B]
Hold it!

169
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,750
[CHIE]
I try to act brave, Tsukiyama,

170
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,166
but the idea of dying
really terrifies me.

171
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,375
So if I can't avoid it,

172
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,500
at the very least,
I don't want it to happen

173
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:27,333
until I feel like I've really
lived. And because of that,

174
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,208
I'd like to spend as much time
as I can enjoying my life.

175
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,375
[SHIRAZU]
Hey, Saiko. Wake up, will ya?

176
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,625
[SAIKO]
First you forced me out of bed,

177
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,916
then you made me skip breakfast.

178
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,166
[SHIRAZU] That's what
happens when you sleep

179
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,250
until the last minute!

180
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,875
--[stomach growls]
--[SAIKO groans]

181
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,375
[SHIRAZU]
Oh, boy.

182
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,666
I'm Kori Ui, captain
of S1. Greetings.

183
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,458
My squad will take the
lead in this operation.

184
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,583
We look forward
to working with you.

185
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,416
[UI] These are largely
mass abductions,

186
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,000
and there's been no sign
of predation at the scene.

187
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,083
This leads us to believe
that Rose consists of

188
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,791
organized and
well-trained ghouls.

189
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,083
Since they leave very
little evidence behind,

190
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,583
we'll need to pull
on a lot of threads

191
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,250
if we're to track them down.

192
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,208
That means coming up
with effective methods

193
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:32,750
of investigating outside
the box. And quickly.

194
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,708
[SHIRAZU] So he wants us to
think outside the box, huh?

195
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,041
[MUTSUKI]
And with practically no leads...

196
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,625
[IHEI]
Excuse me.

197
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,958
You're the members of the
Quinx Squad, is that right?

198
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,166
Uh. Yeah, that's right.

199
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,083
I'm the squad captain.
What's up?

200
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,583
Hey, Captain.
You seem a little tense.

201
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,833
Shut up, I'm totally relaxed!

202
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,583
He's the captain of love.

203
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,541
Well, uh. Hello there.
My name is Hairu Ihei,

204
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,166
and I'm Special Investigator
Ui's partner.

205
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:03,041
As it turns out, I'm pretty sure
I'm the same age as all of you.

206
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,333
Seeing as we were all
part of the same class,

207
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,833
I was just hoping that
we might become friends.

208
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,916
We're the same age?

209
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,458
[URIE]
Strange.

210
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,958
How did someone from our
class advance so quickly?

211
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,166
We're leaving.
Senior Investigator Ihei.

212
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,916
Ah. Yes, sir!

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,583
She's that high ranked?

214
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,541
She used to be part
of Arima's Squad.

215
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,791
And she took part in the
Owl Extermination Mission.

216
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,958
[URIE] She fought on the
frontline of that battle?

217
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,083
This dimwitted girl?

218
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,375
[TAKEOMI] Investigator Ihei
joined during Term 74.

219
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,583
So, in a sense, she's
three years ahead of us.

220
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,166
[SHIRAZU] Huh. No wonder
I haven't seen her before.

221
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,000
[thud]

222
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,875
[stomach growls]

223
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,000
[SAIKO] Captain, please.
Don't let me starve.

224
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,333
I've heard there's a
delicious bakery over there.

225
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,708
Let's try it out.

226
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,208
[SHIRAZU] Huh? C'mon,
we were just about to start

227
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,375
canvassing the area.

228
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,708
[whines]

229
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,458
All right. Fine.

230
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,916
You did skip
breakfast, after all.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,583
Kuroiwa. Wanna join us?

232
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,500
Ah!

233
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,000
[SAIKO]
Ooh! It smells like heaven.

234
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,916
[SHIRAZU]
Whoa, those sure look tasty.

235
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,500
[YORIKO]
Hello, welcome to--

236
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,750
Hey, Kuroiwa. How ya been?

237
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,083
A friend of yours?

238
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,583
Kosaka.

239
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,083
[YORIKO]
Here. Hope you enjoy.

240
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,625
[SHIRAZU] I know I will.
Man, this bread is just amazing.

241
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,958
Thank you very much.
So, Kuroiwa,

242
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,916
you're a ghoul investigator now?

243
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,125
That's right.

244
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,083
[YORIKO]
Guess you wanted to follow

245
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,083
in your father's footsteps?

246
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:48,458
[TAKEOMI]
Yeah.

247
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,166
I wonder, has Kuroiwa always
been the serious type?

248
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,166
Oh, yeah. He never
says that much,

249
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,458
but he still has a
really strong presence.

250
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,041
And he's always been
an outstanding athlete.

251
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,291
And what about you?
Like your job?

252
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,208
Yeah. Always wanted
to work at a coffee shop,

253
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,791
but a bakery with
coffee is just fine.

254
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,041
Oh, I feel that.

255
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,791
 Uh-oh, we should
prob'ly get goin' now.

256
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:15,041
Not that we have anything
to report to our bosses, heh.

257
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,208
I plan to report that
we located the whereabouts

258
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,958
of a delicious bakery.

259
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:25,125
[TAKEOMI] Kosaka. Thanks.
It was great bread.

260
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,833
Uh...

261
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,583
Sure! No problem. Come anytime.

262
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:35,250
[FURUTA] Stupid boss.
Who does he think he is?

263
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,541
[FURUTA] He can take his synergy
'n blow it out his ear.

264
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,833
[GROUP gasps]

265
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,791
[KIJIMA]
Well done, Furuta,

266
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,625
it's like you were destined
to play ghoul bait.

267
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,583
I'm not at all pleased
to hear that, sir.

268
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:53,333
[chuckles] They may not
leave any traces,

269
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:57,208
but we can still predict where
they're likely to strike.

270
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,250
So this was a trap?

271
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,625
[FURA]
A wall?

272
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,250
The detachable kind.

273
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,750
[MATSUMAE]
We should leave.

274
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,958
Oh, I disagree.

275
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,833
[knocking]

276
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,000
[door opens]

277
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,375
Good evening, sir.

278
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,625
Is the shop open right now?

279
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,000
Of course. Come on in.

280
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,416
[HAISE]
Amazing.

281
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,750
[UTA] Anything special
you were looking for?

282
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,125
Uh. Yeah, there, is.

283
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,625
[HAISE]
I'm here about this.

284
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,666
It was delivered to my place.

285
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,416
And it said it came
from your shop, so...

286
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,625
I see. Well, I remember
sending it out.

287
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,083
How strange. Perhaps I
got the address wrong.

288
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,208
Oh, I guess that
would explain it.

289
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,083
By the way.

290
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,583
Did you happen to send
this book along with it?

291
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:59,458
Afraid not. Just the mask.

292
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,208
That sure is strange.

293
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,750
Well, thanks for your time.

294
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,583
Say, if you don't
mind my asking.

295
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,833
Your eyes.

296
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,833
Oh, yes. These are just tattoos.

297
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,916
Ink is injected into
the sclera via needle.

298
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,833
It does fade every
few years, though.

299
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,291
Oh... yeah?

300
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,208
[HAISE]
That sounds painful.

301
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,583
Oh. I guess I should return
your mask to you, huh?

302
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,583
[UTA] No, that's
all right. You keep it.

303
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,833
Uh?

304
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,833
After all, it was
fate that you and I

305
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,291
should meet in this way.

306
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:37,541
[HAISE] Um, well then,
thank you for the gift.

307
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,791
Hey.

308
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,958
[UTA]
Yes?

309
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:42,291
You don't just buy
and sell masks, do you?

310
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,833
You create them.

311
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,333
I do.

312
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,958
[MATSUMAE]
That was quite the performance.

313
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,500
Well, in that case.

314
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,666
Ah! Heh. More tricks?

315
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,916
[IHEI giggles] I've dealt with
ghouls like you before.

316
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,708
My hands should be nice
and warmed up now.

317
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,208
[MATSUMAE]
Who the hell is this girl?

318
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,833
[MATSUMAE] She can even
dodge at this range?

319
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,000
[grunts]

320
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,500
Gotta be quick.

321
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,666
Are you all right?!

322
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,958
Yuma!

323
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,791
[KIJIMA] Excellent work
diverting their focus.

324
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,458
I'm quite impressed,
Investigator Ihei.

325
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,791
Huh?

326
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,375
Aw...

327
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:46,541
[MARUDE]
So, S One is on the Rose case?

328
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:50,083
[MATSURI] Yes. Apparently,
they've already caught one.

329
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,458
You don't say.

330
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,291
[MATSURI] I'm a special
investigator too, now.

331
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,250
[MATSURI] I'd like to use
everything I learned in Germany

332
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,666
to take down Aogiri Tree.

333
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,958
[MATSURI]
Under our current chief,

334
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,208
we won't be able to beat them.

335
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,250
Not under our <i>current</i> chief.

336
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,583
[MARUDE]
What you learned in Germany

337
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,791
was how to send good
men to their deaths.

338
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:28,000
It seems I have failed you
utterly, Master Mirumo.

339
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,458
Please forgive my incompetence.

340
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,083
It's fine. You did
nothing wrong.

341
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,583
I'm just glad you're safe.

342
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,208
[sighs]

343
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,250
[ALIZA]
Yes. But where is Yuma?

344
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,916
[MATSUMAE]
Aliza...

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,750
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,208
[gasps]

347
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:54,083
[KANAE] We can be sure
that the CCG has caught on

348
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,916
to what we're doing.
Any future harvest attempts

349
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,416
are going to be
extremely difficult.

350
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,791
But if we stop,
then Master Shu will...

351
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,791
[MATSUMAE grunts]

352
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,083
[gasps] Does it hurt?

353
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:10,791
It's not that bad. A bit
of rest, and I'll be fine.

354
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,750
Please don't let me keep
you from your work, Kanae.

355
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,833
[gasps]

356
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,208
[CHIE] I put some
pictures in this envelope.

357
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,500
I'm pretty sure he'd
want to see them.

358
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,500
If you really wanna see
Tsukiyama get better,

359
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,125
then you have to help
him get what he wants.

360
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,500
[metal leg tapping]

361
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,083
[KIJIMA] I can tell
just by looking at you.

362
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,458
You won't talk.

363
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,166
No matter how creative
this interrogation may get,

364
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,208
you will be silent as a lamb.

365
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,958
With that in mind,

366
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:48,583
I think instead, I'd like to
offer your friends a gift.

367
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:54,125
Tell me. What part
should I give them first?

368
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,416
[CHIE] I need you to make
me a promise, okay?

369
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,208
Promise that you'll
honor Tsukiyama's wishes

370
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:05,958
above everything else.
If you think you can do that,

371
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,291
then let him see
the first photo.

372
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,958
[TSUKIYAMA]
Kanae. This...

373
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:19,416
[gasps]

374
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,583
...is heartbreaking.

375
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:56,375
[clock ticking]

376
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,958
[HOGURO]
Are they the ones we're after?

377
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,958
[TSUKIYAMA] There's no way my
sweet Kaneki could ever forge...

378
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,541
[GRAVE ROBBER]
Are you all right, Torso?

379
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:03,166
[KIJIMA] As you know,
we captured your colleague...

380
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,750
[SHIKORAE] You're like
a plump, little <i>manju</i> bun.

381
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,125
[CHIE] Okay, then. Here's what
I'm gonna need you to do.

382
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:09,875
[URIE] This guy sure
looks like a ghoul to me.

383
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,208
[SHIKORAE]
Can't wait anymore... Hungry!

384
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:12,500
[HOGURO] Let's just
go ahead and kill him, too!

385
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,583
