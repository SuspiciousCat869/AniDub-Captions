Where did you go?

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,583
Come out, Wildfang!

4
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:46,875
[KANAE]
Well, hello. Going somewhere?

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,583
[KANAE laughs] Your wound is
already healed? <i>Wie toll</i> !

6
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,708
Oh, Master Shu is
going to adore you.

7
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,708
You'll bring him countless
hours of entertainment.

8
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:12,458
[KANAE] Splendid. Now that
I know you can heal...

9
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,750
This'll make it easier
for me to carry you!

[HAISE]
You okay?

12
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,916
I'm sorry we're late.

13
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,416
Thanks, Teach!

Yeah! Nice one, Urie!

16
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,208
That's a rinkaku.

[gasps, sniffs]

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,583
[KANAE] That smell.
I'd know it anywhere.

19
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:35,875
You're Haise Sasaki!

Fall back!

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,958
Like jam!

00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,625
[SEIDO]
Jam, jam, jam.

00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,833
Jam, jam, jam, jam!

29
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,833
[AKAI] It's no use.
He'll catch up to us!

30
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,541
Go on ahead--

How heroic of you.
Now, give me some jam!

33
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,791
We're in place to take control
of the monitor room.

34
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,250
We'll find where Big Madam
and the others are hiding.

35
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,041
Moving in right now.

[OSHIBA] We hit the jackpot,
men. It's Nutcracker!

You may be a siren,
but you can't tempt me!

39
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,750
She's an A-rated bikaku type
but we've got her outnumbered!

40
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,416
We can take her down!
Just keep calm!

41
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,375
Huh?

[yells]

45
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,833
[AKIRA]
I'm wielding the Fueguchi.

46
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,583
It's a weapon that's extremely
difficult to control.

47
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,541
I spent a whole year
learning to master it.

48
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,541
And it paid off. Now it's
so easy to maneuver,

49
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,375
it's practically an
extension of my body.

[yells]

52
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,500
Your problem is you're
too caught up in the past.

53
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,333
You've got to stop that, or
you'll never be able to change.

00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,083

He's no good to me if he's dead.

All the more reason
for me to kill him!

58
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,875
[NAKI] She thinks I'm too
caught up in the past.

59
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,916
Well, of course I am!

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,125
My strength, my everything,
it's all behind me.

61

Malice and sorrow
are all that I have now.

You don't know a damn
thing about me, lady!

[HINAMI]
It's Naki and the others.

81
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,208
[AYATO]
Are they outnumbered?

[HINAMI]
Mm-hm. Can you help them?

83

I need to protect Madam.

[HINAMI]
Yeah, you're right. Sorry.

Maybe I should retreat
while I still can.

Guess he's out of ammo.

[MATSURI]
It's Washu.

117
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,791
I see that you've caught up
to Investigator Mutsuki.

118
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,375
[HAISE]
Yes, sir.

119
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,666
[MATSURI] Oshiba Squad
has been wiped out.

120
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,166
[HAISE]
Seriously?

121
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,666
[MATSURI]
They engaged with Nutcracker

122
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,875
and she slaughtered
the entire squad.

123
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,166
Her rating has been
elevated from A to S.

124
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,166
Quinx Squad is hereby ordered
to dispatch Nutcracker.

125
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,541
I'm sending Ato
Squad in, as well.

126
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,916
[HAISE]
Acknowledged.

127
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,250
[HAISE]
Investigator Washu?

128
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:41,375
[MATSURI]
What is it?

129
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,916
[HAISE] Fighting against
an S-rated ghoul

130
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,333
is much more dangerous.

131
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,083
Third Class Mutsuki
is injured and exhausted.

132
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,791
I feel that any further combat
would be pushing him too hard.

133
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,000
Permission for him to evacuate?

134
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,041
[MATSURI]
Granted.

135
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,416
Assign someone to accompany
him, just to be safe.

136
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,208
I'd suggest Second Class Urie.

137
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,166
[HAISE]
Are you sure about that, sir?

138
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,250
[MATSURI] Do you think there's
someone better suited?

139
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:13,166
[HAISE] No, you're right.
I'll take your suggestion.

140
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,583
Assigning Urie to escort
Mutsuki's immediate evacuation.

141
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,958
[MUTSUKI]
Thanks a lot, Urie.

142
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,125
[URIE]
No problem.

143
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,916
Least I can do for
a fellow squad member.

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,541
[URIE] How am I supposed
to distinguish myself

145
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,041
when I'm on escort duty?

146
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,208
[MUTSUKI]
It may sound pathetic.

147
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,958
But I'm glad my
evacuation was granted.

148
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,541
Being auctioned off
was terrifying.

149
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:38,208
I had no idea what
was gonna happen to me.

150
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,291
Yeah, I can imagine.

151
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,416
I think you did
just fine, Mutsuki.

152
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,666
I sure hope so.
I did the best I could.

153
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,166
[URIE]
I can't leave yet.

154
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,583
Not until I've
distinguished myself.

155
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,500
[URIE] Let's go.
The exit's to the right.

156
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,583
[URIE] Sorry, but I have
no sense of direction.

157
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,416
Well, not today, anyway.

158
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,583
[MATSURI]
Attention Ato Squad.

159
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,375
Head to the administration
building at once.

160
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,458
[MATSURI]
Investigator Ato?

161
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,750
I heard you.

162
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,166
[SEIDO]
Delicious. So delicious!

163
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,291
[SEIDO] Look at you
trembling like a leaf.

164
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,958
Why is that? You scared?

165
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,833
The only reason you're
frightened of me

166
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:31,416
is because I'm "different."

167
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,125
You fear me because you
only see our differences--

168
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,250
it's human nature. But if
we were to become similar,

169
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,041
you wouldn't be afraid anymore.

170
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:43,458
[gasps] Wait a sec.
You're Mr. Takizawa!

171
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:49,791
[TOGI] You gave us a lecture
on quinques at the academy.

172
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,291
My name's Togi!
Do you remember me?

173
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,458
'Cause I remember
you, Mr. Takizawa!

174
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,166
Togi.

175
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,541
Wait, the cutup who talked
to the girl next to her

176
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,583
throughout my entire lecture?

177
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,791
Yeah, that's me! I knew you--

178
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,000
You should have listened to me!

179
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,708
Hey, Mutsuki. Notice anything?

180
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,041
Huh?

181
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,833
[URIE] All the deceased
are either CCG or Aogiri.

182
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,500
You're right.

183
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,083
But there were a ton of
people in the audience,

184
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,916
and every single one of
them was wearing a mask.

185
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,208
[URIE]
This place is giant.

186
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,708
There had to have been
hundreds of people here.

187
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,625
But I don't understand.

188
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,208
Where could they have gone?

189
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,625
Found it.

190
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,666
[URIE]
The basement.

191
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,833
[URIE] Chances are they're
hiding down there somewhere.

192
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,041
You wanna check it out?

193
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,666
Don't get anxious.

194
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,250
If we find the enemy,
we'll come right back.

195
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,291
We're just scouting
out the place.

kneel there, you idiot.

[HINAMI]
Ayato.

204
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,291
[URIE]
Bingo.

205
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,000
[URIE] Can I take this
many of them alone?

206
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,625
No, it's better not to risk it.

207
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,916
I'll stick with the plan,
then break off later.

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,583

Shh!

What're you doing down here?

213
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,000
I made a split decision
to follow 'em,

214
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,083
and this is where I ended up.

215
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,708
[URIE]
You little sneak.

216
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,750
Do you have a
communicator on ya?

217
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,833
'Cause I need to contact HQ.

218
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,541
[URIE]
It won't work.

219
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,291
We're too far below
ground to get a signal.

220
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,166
Really? Did you try it?

221
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,166
[URIE]
Yeah, a moment ago.

222
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,416
[URIE]
It's bad enough Suzuya's here,

223
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,291
he'll end up claiming
half the credit.

224
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,041
There's no way I'm letting
them call in more backup.

[MUTSUKI]
What should we do?

226
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:32,791
You think they've
secured an escape route?

227
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,541
Sure wish I had more
weapons on me right now.

228
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,333
We've got no choice
but to fight 'em.

Huh?

I'm scared, but...

This is my job.
I'm an investigator!

[yells]

239

[UTA] Impressive.
You've gotten stronger.

240
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,541
And your attacks
are more precise.

241
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,500
I see you've moved up in rank.

242
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,458
You're pretty high up
there now, aren't you?

Get up!

This one looks like
he'd be tasty.

249

He's nice and meaty,
but he's also lean.

250
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,166
He's the perfect appetizer.

That's Suzuya, for ya.

He's fast and vicious.

either! Let's do this!

You don't hate him, do you?

If you don't mind,

Hm. I suspected as much.

Urie's too ambitious
to carry out escort duty.

285
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:02,875
It would appear
he took a detour

and uncovered treasure,
just as I hoped he would.

00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,166
Shirazu! Take First Class
Hayashimura and run!

322
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,166
But, sir!

323
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,583
[HAISE]
Just do it!

324
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,416
This is Hayashimura
of Oshiba Squad!

325
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,333
First Class Sasaki is engaging
an unidentified ghoul, sir!

326
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,541
Estimated rating is S or higher!

327
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,125
[MATSURI]
S or higher?

328
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,375
[beeping]

329
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,833
[MATSURI]
First Class Sasaki.

330
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,000
[HAISE]
Yes, sir?

331
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,833
[MATSURI]
His provisional rating is SS.

332
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,208
Unfortunately, you're
going to have

333
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,625
to confront him alone.

334
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,708
First Class Hayashimura
and Sasaki Squad, fall back.

335
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,041
Head to the
administration building.

336
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,625
[SHIRAZU]
Are you kidding me?

337
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,375
There's no way in hell
we're abandoning Mr. Sass!

338
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,833
--What kind of order is--?
--You heard the man, fall back!

339
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,208
For real?

340
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,833
[HAYASHIMURA]
Let's go, Third Class Shirazu!

341
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:54,875
No, I'm not goin' anywhere!

342
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,333
[HAISE]
Shirazu. Look after Saiko.

343
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,250
Fine. Copy that.

344
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:05,750
[SEIDO]
You're a model superior officer.

345
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:09,458
I like that about you.
Wanna know why?

346
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,875
You remind me of my own
superior back in the day.

347
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,041
If I tell you a secret,

348
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,750
do you promise not
to tell anyone?

349
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,916
It's just between us!

350
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:58,333
[clock ticking]

351
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,958
[SEIDO]
Why don't we put on a play?

352
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,333
[HAISE] Please give me the
strength to protect them.

353
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:06,000
[SEIDO] The difference between
a solid 99 and a perfect 100...

354
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,291
[SHIRAZU]
Then I'll hit her from here!

355
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:07,916
Huh?

356
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,125
[shrieks]

357
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,625
[URIE] I hate every
last one of your guts.

358
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:11,375
[SAIKO]
For Maman!

359
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,666
[SEIDO]
Little Hina?

360
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,708
