1
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:31,727
Asuna.

2
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:34,220
Siune.

3
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,134
Please, do you know what happened to Yuuki?

4
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,867
It's been three days, and she hasn't logged back in.

5
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,132
It's not just you. None of us
have been able to contact her either.

6
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:48,102
Asuna, I hate to say this,

7
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:50,595
but I don't think she wants to see you again.

8
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:53,114
I think she's doing it for your own good.

9
00:00:54,202 --> 00:00:55,327
But why?

10
00:01:00,604 --> 00:01:02,837
I had a feeling something wasn't right.

11
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:07,583
I could tell everyone in the group
was avoiding getting too close to me.

12
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:12,730
The last thing I want is to upset anyone or be a nuisance.

13
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:16,867
But still, I don't see how any
of this could be for my sake!

14
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:18,653
You're not a nuisance!

15
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:24,453
It's not like that. Believe me when I
say we're all truly happy to have met you.

16
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:30,656
We got to have one last amazing memory of our
time together here, and it's all thanks to you.

17
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,139
And Yuuki, I know she's grateful, too,

18
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:37,734
but please, forget you ever met us.

19
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:41,004
It really is the best thing for you and for Yuuki.

20
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:44,552
I can't ever see any of you again?

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,345
I thought after the guild was gone,

22
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,942
I thought we could at least keep on being friends,

23
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,407
but this whole time,

24
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:54,475
I was the only one who thought that?

25
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:57,572
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:00,942
No, wait!

27
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:05,047
Asuna!

28
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,327
Morning.

29
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,855
Morning, Asuna.

30
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,948
Good morning.

31
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,695
Ah, we finally caught you.

32
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:16,520
All right, we're here, so you gonna
tell us what that message was about?

33
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:17,387
Is it true?

34
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:20,034
Liz said something about you joining a guild.

35
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:22,632
Come on. Come on, tell us. Are they cool?

36
00:04:22,797 --> 00:04:24,192
Well, it's like...

37
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,430
Oh, hang on a sec.

38
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:29,971
Huh?

39
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,748
All right, how's that?

40
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,989
Can you see my face okay? I see
you, but you're a little blurry.

41
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:42,200
Hmm. It's the autofocus again. It's gotta be that.

42
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:43,996
Give me a sec, Yui.

43
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,076
Okay, daddy.

44
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:56,913
Hey.

45
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,957
This Zekken, you still want to see her?

46
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:10,668
Mm‐hmm.

47
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:13,731
Even after they say it's better you didn't,

48
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:15,050
you still do?

49
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:15,769
Mm‐hmm.

50
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:17,572
I don't care what they say.

51
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,165
All I want is to talk to Yuuki one last time.

52
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,987
I can't leave it like this.

53
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,027
Okay.

54
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,903
I think I might have found where she's at.

55
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,915
I'm not sure, but it's the best I got.

56
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,000
What makes you think she'd be here?

57
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,341
That place has a medicuboid.

58
00:05:35,914 --> 00:05:38,516
They're the only ones doing the clinical trials for it.

59
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,633
Medicuboid?

60
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,286
Excuse me.

61
00:05:53,492 --> 00:05:54,365
May I help you?

62
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:55,158
Yes.

63
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,716
I, um... I think I'm looking for a patient.

64
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,536
Uh...

65
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,495
Well, she's about 15 years old or so.

66
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:05,272
I think her name might be Yuuki, but I'm not sure.

67
00:06:05,694 --> 00:06:07,090
I need a name at least.

68
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:12,197
Oh. Um, well, I think she might be the
patient who's testing that medicuboid thing.

69
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:14,411
Pardon me, miss.

70
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:15,440
What's your name?

71
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:16,871
Uh, oh, sorry.

72
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:18,755
My name is Asuna Yuuki.

73
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,797
Please have a seat.

74
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,226
I'll get someone right away.

75
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,464
Um, sure.

76
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:32,958
Hi. Sorry about that.

77
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:34,885
I hope you haven't been waiting long.

78
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,345
No, not at all.

79
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:37,484
That's good.

80
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:39,417
They told me you're Asuna Yuuki.

81
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,230
Yes.

82
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,236
Great. I'm Dr. Kurahashi.

83
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,610
I'm Yuuki Konno's primary physician.

84
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:46,535
Yuuki Konno.

85
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,996
You know, I'm surprised you even found us.

86
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:51,596
Why?

87
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:53,997
Oh, well, we keep a low profile.

88
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:58,445
That said, Yuuki warned me someone called
Asuna might try and pay her a visit at some point.

89
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,630
She warned you?

90
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,157
Uh‐huh. She also said she didn't tell you where she was,

91
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:06,560
so I said, "don't worry about
it." She's not gonna find you here."

92
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:12,114
When reception told me you
were in the lobby, I was shocked.

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,459
Doctor, has Yuuki told you
anything else about me or how we met?

94
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:18,778
I'll say she has.

95
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:21,097
You're pretty much the only person she talks about.

96
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:27,472
Although, it seems whenever Yuuki does
mention you, she always ends up in tears.

97
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:32,428
She's always been a brave girl
and never felt sorry for herself.

98
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:34,355
She wants to see you,

99
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:36,491
but she can't bring herself to do it.

100
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,357
Yes, I know, and I still can't wrap my head around it.

101
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,227
A friend of hers told me in‐game
that it was for my own good.

102
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:47,034
Why is that?

103
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:48,848
Why can't we see each other?

104
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:57,152
For starters,

105
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,561
I should tell you what the medicuboid is about.

106
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:00,674
Okay.

107
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,947
Medicuboid is the code name for the
world's first medical full‐dive machine.

108
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,424
It's so revolutionary, the
government's backing its development.

109
00:08:09,624 --> 00:08:12,070
It's a full‐dive rig for hospitals?

110
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:12,791
Uh‐huh.

111
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:14,632
For example,

112
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:17,877
let's say you were a patient
with a visual or hearing disability.

113
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:20,430
This machine can give you back those senses.

114
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:25,091
You know how with the amusphere rig images
and sounds get sent directly to your brain?

115
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,587
Well, transmitting signals isn't all it does.

116
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:33,875
The amusphere has the ability to
cancel out physical sensations, too.

117
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:39,060
Back here, it hits that spot with electromagnetic
pulses, so it temporarily numbs the nerves.

118
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,362
It's kind of like a general anesthetic.

119
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,996
Okay, but how is that useful for hospitals?

120
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:48,959
There's a limit to how much the amusphere can block out.

121
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,472
What happens if a patient's in serious pain?

122
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,630
Exactly.

123
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:54,170
You hit the nail right on the head.

124
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,339
The amusphere can't do it.

125
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:59,840
Even the Nervegear can't block
pain from surgery or chronic illness.

126
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,197
However, the medicuboid enhances
the electromagnetic pulse.

127
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,562
Plus it's built into the bed, so there's
more coverage, the brain, spine, everything.

128
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:12,552
Once it gets on the market, it'll change
the course of medicine as we know it.

129
00:09:12,805 --> 00:09:15,236
The medicuboid has incredible potential.

130
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,763
You could, say, pair it with a
camera and give it an AR function.

131
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:21,838
The patient gets real‐world images in real time.

132
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:22,878
That's great.

133
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,120
Sounds more like a miracle than a machine to me.

134
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:30,893
Yes. In a way, it is a miracle.

135
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:36,671
Even so, curing illness is something it can't do.

136
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:40,422
The medicuboid is making an impact, though,

137
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,452
we hope, in terminal care.

138
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,340
Terminal care?

139
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:46,854
Yes.

140
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,184
It's helping patients who are dying.

141
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:51,720
She's dying?

142
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:59,657
Yuuki told me that if you really wanted to hear about
what's going on with her, I could go ahead and tell you,

143
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:03,240
but I have to warn you, it's not a pleasant story.

144
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,332
You're going to wish this conversation ended right here.

145
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:12,882
No...

146
00:10:14,642 --> 00:10:16,762
I want to hear it, the whole thing,

147
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,550
and I'm not leaving here until you tell me.

148
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:26,770
Yuuki was born in may of 2011,

149
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,293
but there were complications, and the
doctors had to give her mother a C‐section.

150
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:34,745
Her mother was given a transfusion during the procedure,

151
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,967
But unfortunately the blood they
used was contaminated with a virus.

152
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,150
They didn't find out about it until September, when
her mother was having tests run for an infection she got.

153
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,104
But by that time,

154
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:51,261
the whole family'd been infected.

155
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,011
This way.

156
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,979
We have to keep the room on the other
side of the glass hermetically sealed,

157
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,964
so this is as close as you can get.

158
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:12,776
I hope you understand.

159
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:24,924
Yuuki.

160
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:29,654
Doctor, what kind of illness does Yuuki have?

161
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:32,500
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome,

162
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,346
aids for short.

163
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:38,311
It's caused by the HIV virus.

164
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:39,977
It's scary, but there's hope,

165
00:11:40,143 --> 00:11:42,539
because not everyone who has it develops aids.

166
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:46,516
If you can treat HIV early, you can have a long life.

167
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:51,607
In her family's case, the virus was difficult to treat.

168
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:53,680
It's a drug‐resistant strain.

169
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:57,647
When her mother found out, she got
so upset over her children's fate,

170
00:11:57,914 --> 00:12:01,529
she actually considered killing
the whole family along with herself.

171
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:07,614
But then she changed her mind and
decided to fight the disease instead.

172
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,480
She fought it

173
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,063
for her kids.

174
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:17,187
Yes. Soon after they were diagnosed, Yuuki
was put on a multidrug course of therapy,

175
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:22,672
but it's hard for a child to have to take so
many different medications and keep taking them.

176
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,969
The side‐effects are one thing.

177
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:29,628
The other, being shunned by people
who don't understand her condition.

178
00:12:30,253 --> 00:12:35,350
Still, Yuuki was a trouper. She believed
her and her family would get better eventually.

179
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:41,669
However, when she was in the fourth
grade, her immune system suddenly collapsed,

180
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:47,358
and then she was brought to this hospital,
and that's when she was diagnosed with aids.

181
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:51,254
But like I said, she's a trouper.

182
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,145
She never once lost her optimism.

183
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,068
Doctor...

184
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:56,888
Hmm?

185
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:59,255
Why is she using the medicuboid?

186
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:04,758
I guess you could say it all started back when
everyone was panicking over that Nervegear incident.

187
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:08,354
They had just completed the
first prototype of the medicuboid.

188
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:13,652
The electromagnetic pulses it put out
were many times stronger than the Nervegear's.

189
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:18,116
That was a problem, since no one knew
what the long‐term effects of exposure were.

190
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,760
Because of that, they couldn't find a patient
willing to take the risk, so its trial run was stalled.

191
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,617
When I found out, I thought about Yuuki's situation,

192
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,330
and I contacted her parents.

193
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:33,850
If she were the test subject, she'd
be moved to the medicuboid sterile room.

194
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:36,540
She'd run less of a risk of getting an infection.

195
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,814
I told them it was a great opportunity.

196
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,628
At least, that's what I thought.

197
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:45,403
But honestly, I still don't
know if I was right to suggest it.

198
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:51,423
God knows what it was like for Yuuki and her
parents, thinking about whether or not to accept.

199
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:57,595
But I think the lure of the unknown, the
virtual world was the deciding factor for Yuuki,

200
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:02,086
so that brave little girl agreed to be
a test subject, and they moved her in.

201
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,370
She's lived inside the medicuboid ever since.

202
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,704
You mean she's never come out?

203
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:09,917
No, she hasn't.

204
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:14,172
Yuuki stays logged in and rarely
spends any time in the real world.

205
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:16,575
She's always in a lot of pain,

206
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:20,259
but thanks to the medicuboid's
sensation canceler, she can block it out.

207
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,615
So wait. You mean she's in a continuous, 24‐hour dive?

208
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:26,229
Since when?

209
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:28,326
For three years now.

210
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,217
That's a whole year longer than us.

211
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:36,014
It felt like they were a product
of the full‐dive environment itself.

212
00:14:54,258 --> 00:14:55,573
Thank you, doctor.

213
00:14:57,311 --> 00:14:59,268
I'm glad I got to see her again.

214
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:03,172
She'll be okay as long as she's here, right?

215
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,445
We're doing everything we can for her,

216
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,897
but even if the room is sterile, there's no
way to eliminate the virus that's inside her.

217
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,306
What do you mean?

218
00:15:13,075 --> 00:15:15,225
Yuuki doesn't have much time left.

219
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:21,658
And that's most likely the reason why she
tried cutting ties with you the way she did.

220
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:23,887
That's why she...

221
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,367
Yuuki!

222
00:15:26,163 --> 00:15:29,445
Asuna, I... I...

223
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:31,794
We did it!

224
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:33,691
Leave it to me, sis!

225
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,715
Um, doctor, I was wondering,

226
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,643
does Yuuki have an older sister?

227
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:42,070
Uh, yes, actually,

228
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,212
a twin sister, to be precise.

229
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:46,651
Her name's Aiko,

230
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:48,530
and she was born a few minutes earlier.

231
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,339
Yuuki was the cheerful one.

232
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:53,955
In fact, Aiko would just sit and watch her and smile.

233
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,601
Come to think of it,

234
00:15:56,806 --> 00:15:59,956
if Aiko were here, I'd imagine she'd be a lot like you.

235
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:01,405
Where is she?

236
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,043
Yuuki's parents passed away two years ago,

237
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,906
and last year, Aiko.

238
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,565
Yuuki.

239
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,566
Yuuki.

240
00:16:24,945 --> 00:16:26,644
Don't cry, Asuna.

241
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:27,990
Huh?

242
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:32,349
Yuuki.

243
00:16:32,502 --> 00:16:34,308
Yuuki! You can hear me?!

244
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:36,538
Yeah, I can hear you.

245
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:38,330
I can see you, too.

246
00:16:39,026 --> 00:16:42,319
Wow, you look exactly like you do in the game.

247
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,582
Thanks for coming to see me.

248
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:45,933
Yuuki.

249
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:48,357
I just... I don't...

250
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,669
Hey, doc, would it be okay if
Asuna used the room next‐door?

251
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:54,924
Sure. Why not?

252
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:57,839
I keep an amusphere in there so I can visit her.

253
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,305
Go ahead. It's all yours.

254
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:00,358
Thanks.

255
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:03,246
The "ALO" app's on the start‐up menu.

256
00:17:03,812 --> 00:17:07,765
After you log in, come to the
place where we first met, okay?

257
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,310
I want to see you.

258
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,400
I want to see you one more time!

259
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:28,882
I want to see you, and this time,
I want to talk to you for real.

260
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:44,686
Yuuki!

261
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,028
Yuuki!

262
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:06,204
Yuuki.

263
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:09,678
I knew it.

264
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:15,185
I don't know how you did it, but I had a
feeling you'd find me in the real world somehow.

265
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:19,895
And I was so careful not to say
nothin', thought I had you fooled.

266
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:23,210
It didn't work. You found me anyway.

267
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:27,109
I must be turning psychic, 'cause
my predictions never come true.

268
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:29,879
But I'm happy, really.

269
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,912
My sis used to hug me like this.

270
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,279
You smell like her, like the sun.

271
00:18:54,304 --> 00:18:57,879
Did Aiko play VRMMOs with you, too?

272
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:03,222
Yup. In fact, she was the first
leader the sleeping knights ever had.

273
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:07,539
And if you thought I was strong,
man, you should have seen her.

274
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:13,250
We met Siune and the other guys in this
virtual hospice called the serene garden.

275
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,840
Back then, there were nine of us,

276
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:18,488
but my sis and Clovis and Merida,

277
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,653
well, they're all gone.

278
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:29,256
Anyway, if you want to know why we're
disbanding, it's cause we promised each other

279
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,485
if we lost someone, we'd end it.

280
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,686
I'm sorry, Asuna.

281
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,626
That's why I couldn't tell you.

282
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,206
The sleeping knights won't be
around anymore by this spring,

283
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,492
but it's not 'cause we'll all be too busy to play anymore.

284
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:46,665
It's 'cause a little while ago, two
of us got the news from our doctors.

285
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:48,495
They gave us three months.

286
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:59,374
You see, that's why we were all so fired up on
having one last big adventure together in this world.

287
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:05,455
We wanted to leave some kind of proof we were here
on that big old monument where everyone can see it,

288
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:10,515
one last run that was so cool, we could
brag about it to my sis and the others.

289
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:14,159
But nothing was going right for us,

290
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:18,895
so we decided the best way to get there
was to get someone tough enough to help.

291
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:21,367
But we just caused you trouble,

292
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,692
and we hurt your feelings, too.

293
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:25,267
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:26,513
We all are.

295
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,350
Forget about us.

296
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:30,498
It's probably for the best, anyway.

297
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:33,497
I can't do that.

298
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:37,338
I'm happy I got to meet you,

299
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:38,431
all of you,

300
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,146
and I'm glad I got to be a part of your last quest.

301
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,139
Even after everything,

302
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:45,718
I still wish I could join the knights.

303
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:49,519
Yeah, I wish...  I wish you could, too,

304
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:52,621
but I'm happy I came here and got to meet you.

305
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,077
You saying that makes it worth it,

306
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,621
more than worth it.

307
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:58,828
That's enough for me.

308
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:00,015
I'm good.

309
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:04,803
But isn't there anything else you want to do?

310
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:09,375
I mean, I'm sure there's lots of
places in Alfheim you haven't been yet

311
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,182
and other virtual worlds.

312
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:16,052
There's still lots of things to do and places
to see. You can't tell me you've had enough.

313
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:19,830
For the last three years,

314
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,770
we got to go on tons of adventures in other worlds.

315
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,890
But I want my very last memory to be
the one I got to go on with you, Asuna.

316
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:33,437
Yeah, but can't you think of anything
else you want to see or maybe do?

317
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,102
I don't know.

318
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:42,168
I guess maybe go to school again.

319
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:43,741
Uh, for real?

320
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,945
Nah, forget it. Just kidding.

321
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:49,592
I'm happy you want to help, but don't sweat it.

322
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,809
It's cool. I had an awesome life, really.

323
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:00,486
Maybe you can.

324
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,665
Wait. What?

325
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:04,701
Maybe you can go, you know, to school!

326
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,139
Next time: "The Dream Begins".
