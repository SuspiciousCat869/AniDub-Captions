1
00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:21,255
Whether you're a fake using his name or the real guy,

2
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,284
someday I'll kill you.

3
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,618
The first time Death Gun showed up

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,160
was after the second Bullet of Bullets,

5
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:42,838
and both of the murders he committed
happened in front of witnesses.

6
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:47,132
He's been staying under the radar since the last killing,

7
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,958
probably leveling up as much as he can.

8
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:54,082
I don't see anyone registered as Death Gun here,

9
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,641
but if he wants to stage another murder,

10
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,247
BOB's perfect.

11
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,029
He'll be here.

12
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:01,261
I know it.

13
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:05,647
I gotta find out the name of
Death Gun's avatar and stop him.

14
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,129
Hey.

15
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:55,867
Hey, Sinon.

16
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,862
Hello. Anyone home?

17
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,493
Come o... Shut up.

18
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,157
I thought I made it clear I was done talking.

19
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:06,978
God, what else do you want from me?

20
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:08,312
N‐Nothing.

21
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:12,375
But now that you mention it, maybe we
could swap some info before this starts.

22
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,494
I mean...

23
00:03:14,363 --> 00:03:17,055
Like, you know, for old times' sake.

24
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,565
Fine. Whatever.

25
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:24,345
I'll do it,

26
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,944
even though I'm the one who's
gonna be giving all the info.

27
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,025
But I got stuff to share, too.

28
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:31,241
It's not a lot, but still...

29
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:43,270
How are you feeling?

30
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,054
You think you got a shot this time?

31
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,637
By the time he sees me, it'll be too late.

32
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,306
This is crazy.

33
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:52,047
Yeah. The final is like one big party.

34
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:52,850
Yeah.

35
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,694
...Picking a winner is gonna be tougher than ever!

36
00:03:54,728 --> 00:03:59,405
For only 1,000 creds, I can hook you up
with top‐secret info on all the top players.

37
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:01,871
Here goes. All on Yamikaze.

38
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,473
I wonder what Huuka's odds are.

39
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:04,633
Come on. Dyne?

40
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,934
Sure, he's got good gear and solid skills,

41
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,058
but that dude's older than hell, you know.

42
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,508
At best, he'd come in 15th today.

43
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:14,223
If you want to go with a long shot, go with Richie.

44
00:04:14,345 --> 00:04:14,790
Hmm?

45
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:19,127
So you think I'm too old to get it on?

46
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,633
No, I was just saying...

47
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:21,968
This old dog's got some new tricks.

48
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:22,822
Hey, look.

49
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:24,594
I‐It's Kirito.

50
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,229
She hacks up people good with that photon sword.

51
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,364
Oh, a hot berserker with a blade.

52
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,597
Sinon's more my type, brother.

53
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:34,992
I wouldn't mind getting a bullet from Sinon.

54
00:04:35,037 --> 00:04:35,977
Roger that.

55
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,577
Heh. I'd rather get slashed.

56
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:40,022
Then go play "ALO" With the faeries.

57
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:43,717
Oh, sorry.

58
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:45,406
You're Kirito!

59
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,326
S‐sorry!

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,139
Hey, guys...

61
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,132
Hope y'all root for me.

62
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,677
Y‐You got it. Good luck out there.

63
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:05,435
I bet my life savings on you.

64
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,865
Oh, god. Quit messing with them.

65
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:18,196
Okay.

66
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:24,106
So 30 players get dropped randomly across the same map,

67
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:25,359
and then...

68
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:31,170
And then you go around shooting whoever you
find, and the winner's the last one standing?

69
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,020
Oh, man. Knew it.

70
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:37,317
You're gonna make me explain the
whole damn thing to you after all.

71
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,247
Don't you have email?

72
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:43,671
The admins sent the rules out, so
it should be sitting in your in‐box.

73
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,826
Yeah, I did scan through it, but...

74
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,888
It's like I wanted to make sure I understood.

75
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:52,297
There was a lot of info to absorb.

76
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,790
"Absorb."

77
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,027
Basically you pretty much got the gist of it.

78
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:01,870
This thing's a battle royale
between 30 players on the same map.

79
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:06,822
Start points are random, and players are
dropped about 1,000 meters away from each other.

80
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,440
Whoa. 1,000.

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,094
That's gotta be one insanely huge map.

82
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,721
Honestly, you didn't read the email, did you?

83
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:19,694
It's a multistage arena 10 kilometers in diameter.

84
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,270
It's got mountains, forests, and deserts.

85
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:28,060
The start time's afternoon, so there's no
advantage or disadvantage in terms of gear or skills.

86
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:31,173
How can you find anyone in a field that big?

87
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:32,550
That makes it challenging.

88
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,880
It's a game with gunfights, remember?

89
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,274
Anyway, players get an item to track other players.

90
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:40,350
It's called a satellite scan terminal.

91
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:41,817
There's a satellite?

92
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:43,975
Like a spy drone or something?

93
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,513
Yep.

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,698
It works just like in real life.

95
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,345
It passes overhead every 15 minutes.

96
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:50,829
It scans the arena

97
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:54,610
and then transmits the coordinates of
all the players directly to your terminal.

98
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:55,604
Neat, huh?

99
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:56,619
Hmm.

100
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:01,924
So basically you can only hide in one spot for 15 minutes.

101
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:03,592
You catch on quick.

102
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:06,425
But then doesn't all that moving around

103
00:07:06,457 --> 00:07:08,265
put a sniper at a disadvantage?

104
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,861
15 minutes is more than enough
time for a sniper to do their job.

105
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,815
I fire. I kill my target.

106
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,727
I move on.

107
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:18,045
Uh, yeah, I guess.

108
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:20,762
So we good here? Great.

109
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,022
Next time we see each other, You can bet your ass...

110
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,607
No! Wait! Hold on!

111
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:30,865
Is there something else?

112
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,384
Uh‐huh.

113
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,741
It's what I really want to talk about.

114
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:42,138
Mm.

115
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,597
Hang on.

116
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,022
Could you take a look at this list real quick?

117
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:48,719
Out of all the BOB contestants,

118
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,733
are there any first‐timers
whose names you don't recognize?

119
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,658
Okay, that's weird.

120
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:55,757
Please, just look at it, and tell me.

121
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,964
It's important.

122
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,451
Well, if that's all you want to know,

123
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:02,484
I guess it's cool.

124
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,262
The first‐timers I don't know,

125
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,980
besides a certain loser with a photon sword,

126
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,215
are three names.

127
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,666
That's great. Who?

128
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:13,579
Point 'em out.

129
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:18,825
Jushi X, Pale Rider,

130
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,485
and this guy,

131
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:23,069
Sterben?

132
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,812
Is one of them Death Gun?

133
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:31,126
You gonna tell me what this is about,
or are you gonna keep me in the dark?

134
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,446
Uh...

135
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,830
Getting ready to blow a fuse over here.

136
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:41,817
Uh...

137
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:43,393
Speak up.

138
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:47,215
I swear, if you're trying to make me
mess up today by pissing me off, I'm gonna...

139
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,121
No, that's not it.

140
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,525
It's just that...

141
00:08:53,714 --> 00:08:56,921
Does it have anything to do with
why you were acting weird yesterday,

142
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,847
you know, after the prelims?

143
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,478
Uh‐huh. It does.

144
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:13,103
Yesterday, this person I once played
against in another VRMMO came up to me.

145
00:09:13,945 --> 00:09:17,419
I'm pretty sure one of the names you pointed out is him.

146
00:09:18,503 --> 00:09:19,916
Is he a friend of yours?

147
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,640
No, an enemy.

148
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,361
I can't remember his name, though,

149
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:30,013
and I think we tried to kill each other.

150
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,562
Kill each other?

151
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:34,172
For real?

152
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:38,006
Was it like an argument with someone in your party,

153
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,115
something like that?

154
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,397
No way. It wasn't that.

155
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:43,396
You don't kill someone over an argument.

156
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:46,917
Him and his group did horrible things,

157
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:49,687
things like murder.

158
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:54,262
They were too far gone, and the
only way to stop them was by force.

159
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,990
I don't regret what I did,

160
00:09:57,642 --> 00:10:02,819
but still, I've avoided taking responsibility for it.

161
00:10:03,446 --> 00:10:06,031
I forced myself to forget it even happened.

162
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:12,347
For me, there's no more running away,

163
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:15,835
and this time, I have to face what I did head‐on.

164
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,335
Sorry to emote like that.

165
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:20,614
Just forget it.

166
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,222
Do you think you could still pull the trigger, though?

167
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:28,063
Could you shoot a player in here

168
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,889
if you knew, in the real world,
that player would die from it?

169
00:10:32,547 --> 00:10:34,863
And what if you had to kill that player,

170
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:38,585
'cause if you didn't, you or someone you love would die?

171
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:40,282
If you had that power,

172
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,332
could you still pull that trigger?

173
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:44,324
Kirito...

174
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,377
What's the name of the game you met this guy in?

175
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:52,509
Sorry. Never mind. That's personal.

176
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,634
No, that's okay.

177
00:11:00,434 --> 00:11:01,310
Kirito...

178
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:03,441
I...

179
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:08,105
Sinon?

180
00:11:10,562 --> 00:11:13,199
We should start heading over to the waiting dome now.

181
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,983
We have to check our gear

182
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,261
and get ourselves psyched up for this battle.

183
00:11:17,347 --> 00:11:18,682
Yeah, sure.

184
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,908
Lead the way.

185
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:38,610
I get you've got your reasons for being here,

186
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:39,790
just like me.

187
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,923
But it's got nothing to do with that promise you made.

188
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:49,846
I gotta pay you back for what
happened in yesterday's final. Got it?

189
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,127
You owe me a fight, so you better stay alive.

190
00:11:54,154 --> 00:11:56,646
Roger that. I promise I'll survive

191
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,412
and give you the fight you want.

192
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,407
Thanks.

193
00:12:07,753 --> 00:12:11,548
If you're a battle junkie who loves
the smell of gun oil and gun smoke,

194
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:12,962
then get ready!

195
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:15,617
Place your bets, 'cause we're about to start!

196
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,557
Now are you guys ready to find out who's
the strongest player in "Gun Gale Online,"

197
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,267
the hardest game in town?

198
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:34,324
As usual, MMO stream will be
broadcasting the battle live and uncensored!

199
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:39,955
All right, help me out with the countdown, guys.

200
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,037
10, 9, 8,

201
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:50,055
7, 6, 5,

202
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,942
4, 3, 2,

203
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,136
1!

204
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:58,066
The third Bullet of Bullets has begun!

205
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:06,670
Hmm?

206
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:11,533
Bingo.

207
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,172
All right. Yeah, you go, girl.

208
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,607
21 survivors left in play.

209
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,386
Looks like Dyne's on the run.

210
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,167
Richie's got a heavy machine gun, so he'll sit tight.

211
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,397
He likes his prey coming to him.

212
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,503
I'll go after Dyne and Pale Rider.

213
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,535
Wonder how he's doing out there.

214
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,697
Ah, what the hell do I care?

215
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,836
Damn. This guy's freaking persistent.

216
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:38,533
Eh?

217
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:45,384
Heh.

218
00:15:58,002 --> 00:16:01,293
Come on. I got a mag full of rounds with your name on 'em.

219
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,944
You forgot to check your six again, Dyne.

220
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,284
See you later.

221
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:13,807
Who's there?

222
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:16,977
Shh.

223
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:19,644
Keep it down.

224
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:20,975
I need a favor.

225
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,060
Are you kidding?

226
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:24,233
It's too late for any more favors.

227
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,956
One of us dies right now.

228
00:16:26,981 --> 00:16:27,725
Stop it.

229
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,805
I don't want those guys to know we're here.

230
00:16:30,701 --> 00:16:31,795
What are you up to?

231
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,163
I want to watch what happens on that bridge,

232
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:35,983
so don't shoot, okay?

233
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,333
Okay. Then what?

234
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:40,667
That depends,

235
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,226
but I'm not here for you.

236
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:44,394
I'll leave after, promise.

237
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:46,831
The minute you turn your back,

238
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:47,804
I'll blow you away.

239
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,484
If that's what you want, then fine,

240
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:51,904
but for now, just stay quiet.

241
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,329
All right,

242
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,990
but after they're done down there, it's you and me.

243
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,044
Okay.

244
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:11,641
Your stealth skills are pretty pathetic.

245
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:19,617
I'm not letting him leave the area alive.

246
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,912
If he makes a move, I'm taking the shot.

247
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,280
He's all yours.

248
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:24,827
Wait. Company.

249
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:47,082
Eh? Son of a...

250
00:17:56,084 --> 00:17:57,060
Damn.

251
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,109
Whoa. He's fast.

252
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:06,798
He boosted his three‐dimensional
mobility by carrying lighter gear.

253
00:18:09,973 --> 00:18:12,796
His acrobatic skills are through the roof.

254
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:20,254
Bastard.

255
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,233
No.

256
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:52,880
If only he had time to switch mags,

257
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,366
he could have shot from the hip and killed him easy.

258
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,899
That pale guy,

259
00:18:57,522 --> 00:18:59,982
he's quick and powerful.

260
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:03,028
Maybe he's the one in the cloak.

261
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:07,913
An enemy. I think we tried to kill each other once before.

262
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:13,678
I'm taking him out.

263
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:14,918
Okay,

264
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,868
but it won't be easy if he's who I think.

265
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,822
Oh, please.

266
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:22,267
He can't dodge my bullet at this range.

267
00:19:32,732 --> 00:19:34,430
Did you hear a gunshot?

268
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:35,790
There wasn't one.

269
00:19:36,813 --> 00:19:38,485
What the hell's going on?

270
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:40,347
Two possibilities.

271
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:46,187
It could have been a laser rifle with a muffled
blast or maybe a Live‐AMMO gun with a silencer.

272
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:49,362
Either way, it wasn't a kill shot,

273
00:19:49,513 --> 00:19:51,307
so why isn't he moving?

274
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:53,758
I think the shot came from the forest.

275
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:57,330
Uh‐uh. He was sniped from further away than that.

276
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,001
I did a scan of the map not too long ago.

277
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,615
There's no one within one kilometer of here.

278
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:05,248
And now that we're on the subject,

279
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:07,249
you mind telling me where you came from?

280
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,569
Uh, I was chasing after that Pale Rider guy.

281
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:11,957
Hang on.

282
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,164
Oh, no way.

283
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:14,010
What's up?

284
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,258
When the satellite was scanning the area,

285
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,051
I was swimming in that river.

286
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:22,067
I guess my location didn't register
on the map 'cause I was underwater.

287
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:24,189
With all that gear, you should have drowned.

288
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:26,382
Nah. I took it all off before I dove in,

289
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:28,337
stuck it in my item storage.

290
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:33,799
I never knew we could use the
river for cover from the satellite.

291
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,059
Thanks for the tip.

292
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:36,859
I'll keep it in mind.

293
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:40,217
Sinon, check out his shoulder.

294
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,050
There's a weird light there.

295
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:46,598
A stun bullet.

296
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:04,016
How long's he been there?

297
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,305
He's got a silent assassin.

298
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,282
Is that what his rifle's called?

299
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:22,092
Yeah. It's a high‐end sniper rifle
that's got a bad‐ass silencer on it.

300
00:21:22,954 --> 00:21:25,712
I heard rumors about there being one in "GGO",

301
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,881
but I've never seen it before.

302
00:21:28,984 --> 00:21:30,742
If he can handle that gun,

303
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,140
he must be some player.

304
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:51,992
Why would he use his handgun to finish him off?

305
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,262
Sinon, shoot.

306
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,792
Huh? Which one?

307
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,318
It's the guy in the cloak.

308
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:00,887
There's no time! Shoot him!

309
00:22:01,034 --> 00:22:01,713
Hurry!

310
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:04,024
Don't let him fire that gun!

311
00:23:36,387 --> 00:23:38,373
Next time: "Death Gun".
