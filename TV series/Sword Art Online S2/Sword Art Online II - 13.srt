1
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:21,892
Damn it. He's tough.

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,187
If I can slow him down,

3
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,316
One second's all I need.

4
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,190
Kirito!

5
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:40,999
If only I had my scope.

6
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:42,680
I get it now.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,917
There are things I shouldn't forget,

8
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,520
What it means to kill,

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,835
The significance of taking a life,

10
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:50,919
And once I accept it,

11
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:53,817
maybe then I'll be able to find some closure.

12
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:55,400
That's how I see it.

13
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:01,967
Right now, Kirito's trying to get
that closure he was talking about.

14
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,299
He's confronting his demons from "SAO" By
taking on the person who represents them, Death Gun.

15
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:12,217
And the reason he can isn't 'cause he's strong.

16
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,183
It's 'cause he accepts what he did,
even though it still tears him up,

17
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:19,435
and he's still trying to move on despite it.

18
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:25,138
I gotta do something.

19
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,019
Think!

20
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,601
Kirito.

21
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,702
He's sweating so much. He'll dehydrate soon.

22
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:22,158
I wonder if we can get him to
log out or at least warn him.

23
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:23,753
No, he wouldn't hear us.

24
00:03:23,778 --> 00:03:25,366
The dive blocks everything out.

25
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:31,666
The amusphere is designed with stuff like this in
mind, so it should shut off if he gets too dehydrated.

26
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:36,563
Okay, then. I guess we just have to wait.

27
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:39,213
Hey, mommy,

28
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,630
try holding daddy's hand.

29
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:46,033
He'll feel the warmth of your touch
and know you're here watching over him.

30
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,263
Since I can't touch anything in
your world, hold it for me, too.

31
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,031
I know he won't feel me there, but still.

32
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,681
No, that's not true.

33
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,751
I'm sure he'll feel your hand, too.

34
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:01,466
I know he will.

35
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,017
We'll cheer him on together.

36
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:06,941
Mommy.

37
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,234
Hang in there, Kirito.

38
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:11,387
Fight for what you believe in,

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,407
and I'll be right here by your side.

40
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,184
Wherever you go and whatever you do,

41
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:18,126
I'll always be with you.

42
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:23,473
He's right. I didn't want to know his name.

43
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:26,214
I didn't want anything to do with him.

44
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,262
But I should have known

45
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,577
I wouldn't be rid of him that easy.

46
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,553
I didn't forget.

47
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,592
I only pretended to.

48
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:42,989
But I was just fooling myself.

49
00:04:59,444 --> 00:05:00,736
Red eyes.

50
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:09,240
I saw them in the briefing before the raid.

51
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,362
Black.

52
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:17,445
Red.

53
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:19,871
Red.

54
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:27,277
Xaxa.

55
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:32,952
Red‐eyed Xaxa,

56
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:34,813
That's you! That's your name!

57
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,028
Kirito!

58
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,399
Sinon's distracting him with her bullet line.

59
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,438
She's got him in her sights,

60
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,619
Using all her skill and spirit to keep it trained on him.

61
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:04,816
It's like a phantom bullet.

62
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:07,851
One last attack!

63
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,404
I can't waste this chance!

64
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,521
Fool.

65
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,047
It's not over yet.

66
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,520
You can't stop me.

67
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,808
He'll find you,

68
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:28,520
And he'll...

69
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,691
No, Xaxa, you're done,

70
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:39,168
and we'll find your partner, too.

71
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,803
He won't kill anyone anymore.

72
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,927
Laughing coffin's dead.

73
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,046
Kirito.

74
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,769
Daddy.

75
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,372
It's over.

76
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,572
Yeah.

77
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:39,820
I guess now.

78
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,247
We should probably get this tourney over with, huh?

79
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,940
Yeah, we should.

80
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,091
With Death Gun out of the picture,

81
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,645
I'm pretty sure the guy casing
out your apartment's taken off.

82
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:52,265
Hmm.

83
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,072
I don't think you'll be in any danger when you log out,

84
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,660
But you should call the cops when you do, just to be safe.

85
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,719
Okay, but what am I supposed to tell them?

86
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:05,678
Oh, yeah. Right.

87
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,582
The guy I work for is with the government.

88
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,345
I could ask him to send the cops to your place,

89
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:15,766
but how am I gonna get your info?
I can't really ask for it in here.

90
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:18,943
It's cool.

91
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:19,756
I'll tell you.

92
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,018
Huh? Are you sure?

93
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:26,302
My name is Shino, Shino Asada,

94
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:27,840
And I live at...

95
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,528
You're not gonna believe this,

96
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,864
But you're close to the place I'm diving from.

97
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:36,882
Yeah? Wow, no way.

98
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:38,283
How 'bout this?

99
00:09:38,308 --> 00:09:40,437
After we log out, I could head over to you.

100
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,020
You would? Really?

101
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:45,270
Oh.

102
00:09:45,748 --> 00:09:46,466
No, I'm good.

103
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:49,760
A friend of mine lives near
me, so I've got help if I need it.

104
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,022
Okay, but after I log out, I'll call the guy I work for.

105
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,492
And have him send the cops if you're cool with that.

106
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:56,876
Mm‐hmm. Sounds good.

107
00:09:58,427 --> 00:09:59,492
But not good enough.

108
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:02,632
You just gonna log out without telling me your info?

109
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:04,614
Oh, right. Sorry.

110
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,685
My real name is Kazuto Kirigaya.

111
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:11,321
That's how you got "Kirito"? Seriously?

112
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,843
Talk about a lack of imagination.

113
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,473
Yeah, well, like you're one to talk.

114
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:16,953
Hmm?

115
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:24,415
All right, then.

116
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:28,587
If we're ever gonna log out of
this thing, we've gotta end BOB first.

117
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,122
So how do you wanna do this?

118
00:10:31,555 --> 00:10:33,692
Want to have a duel like we did yesterday?

119
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:35,125
Hmm.

120
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:38,380
Look at yourself. You're all banged up.

121
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:42,230
There's no challenge in beating
someone who's already as thrashed as you.

122
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:46,962
Nah. I'll take you on at the next
BOB, but you better not leave me hanging.

123
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,520
Well, let's get this thing over with already.

124
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,162
How we gonna do that?

125
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,336
Unless one of our HPs drains out all
the way, there's not gonna be a winner.

126
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,421
I guess you didn't hear what happened in the first BOB.

127
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:02,666
There were two winners.

128
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,720
The player who should have
won let his guard down too soon,

129
00:11:05,744 --> 00:11:08,986
So his opponent gave him what we call a souvenir grenade.

130
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,057
A souvenir grenade?

131
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,170
What the heck's that?

132
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:12,883
This.

133
00:11:21,475 --> 00:11:22,622
Uh...

134
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,537
Death Gun had two victims this time.

135
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:14,747
That means he's got at least two others helping him.

136
00:13:21,673 --> 00:13:22,964
What am I doing?

137
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:47,386
Asada? You there?

138
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:49,763
It's me, Asada.

139
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:52,105
Shinkawa.

140
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:55,792
I, uh, just wanted to congratulate you on your win.

141
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,948
I even brought some pastries.

142
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,214
And, hey, congrats.

143
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,503
You were so awesome, Asada.

144
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,525
I mean Sinon.

145
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:07,928
You did it.

146
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:10,295
You're the best gunner in "GGO" now.

147
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:13,883
I knew all along you could do it.

148
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:17,075
You deserve being number one more than anybody.

149
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,163
You showed them all what real strength's about.

150
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:21,327
You should be proud.

151
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:23,640
Thank you.

152
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:27,361
Um, Asada...

153
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:28,641
What's up?

154
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:31,397
You said... you said to wait.

155
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,844
Remember that?

156
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:34,968
What are you talking about?

157
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:40,126
Well, you told me to wait and,
if I did, then you'd be mine.

158
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:40,806
Huh?

159
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:42,781
I waited.

160
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,436
I waited for you.

161
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,978
What's gotten into you?

162
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,590
From now on, I'll always be with you.

163
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,480
You don't need him to protect you.

164
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,691
That's my job.

165
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:57,870
I'm gonna protect you now...

166
00:14:58,863 --> 00:14:59,794
Forever.

167
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:09,901
Shinkawa!

168
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,235
I love you, Asada.

169
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:14,038
You're mine, my Asada,

170
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:17,680
My Sinon, mine.

171
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:20,448
Let go!

172
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:24,453
Huh?

173
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:29,471
Why'd you push me away like that?

174
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,313
You made a promise.

175
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:32,746
We both did.

176
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,641
Shinkawa.

177
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,771
Sh‐shinkawa.

178
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,961
Don't make any sudden moves, Asada.

179
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:03,286
The syringe I'm holding's got a drug in it
that'll paralyze your muscles in an instant.

180
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:06,640
Before you know it, your lungs will stop, then your heart.

181
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,887
Syringe?

182
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,154
Maybe by injecting some kind of drug or something.

183
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:12,727
That's one way.

184
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:15,488
Yeah, it is the family business.

185
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:20,152
I promised my dad I'd go to med school,
so it's a done deal. Stuck with it now.

186
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:22,971
This is crazy.

187
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,957
You're the other Death Gun?

188
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:30,018
Ooh, I'm impressed.

189
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,562
You figured out Death Gun's little secret.

190
00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,261
It's true.

191
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,731
I'm Death Gun's partner in crime.

192
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,442
Up to now,

193
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,938
Before this year's BOB, anyway,

194
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:46,173
I was the one playing Sterben,

195
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:51,762
but today I insisted on being the one to do the job IRL.

196
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:57,403
Don't you see I had to be the one doing the
deed? I can't let some other guy touch you,

197
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,938
Even if that guy is my brother.

198
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:01,786
Your brother?

199
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,107
So then the player who belonged
to that murder guild in "SAO",

200
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,566
That was your older brother.

201
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:11,080
Forget about him.

202
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,718
It's just you and me now, Asada.

203
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:16,699
Stop.

204
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,701
It's not too late.

205
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,047
You don't have to do this.

206
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,263
What about cram school, huh?

207
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,732
You said you were gonna be a doctor.

208
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,365
Doctor?

209
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,061
You think I give a damn about that,

210
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:35,363
About my parents, those guys at school?

211
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,247
They're all assholes!

212
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:39,950
You know what would have made me happy?

213
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,093
To be the strongest player in "GGO",

214
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,567
But that piece of shit Zxe‐D lied
about AGI types being the strongest,

215
00:17:47,228 --> 00:17:49,583
And I fell for it like an idiot!

216
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,735
You don't know.

217
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:53,973
"GGO" was everything to me,

218
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:58,221
And I gave everything up in the
real world for it, god damn it!

219
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:03,397
Y‐You killed Zxe‐D 'cause he lied?

220
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,258
Oh, come on.

221
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,754
He was the perfect victim.

222
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:10,166
We had to show the world Death
Gun was the strongest in "GGO",

223
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,840
In all the VRMMOs.

224
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:14,770
What better person to sacrifice than that dork?

225
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,993
And now that that's done,

226
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,569
I don't need this reality anymore.

227
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,544
Let's move on to the next one.

228
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,458
Come on, just you and me.

229
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,505
What are you saying?

230
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,908
We can go somewhere like "GGO".

231
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,693
Mm. No, someplace with a fantasy vibe instead.

232
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:35,226
As long as it's with you, I don't care.

233
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:40,047
We'll be reborn, be husband and wife.
We'll get a house. We'll go on quests together,

234
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,124
Oh, and have kids, too.

235
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:43,792
It'll be so much fun.

236
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,007
I know it will. Come with me.

237
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:49,054
Asada.

238
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,154
You're so beautiful.

239
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:52,539
You are.

240
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:57,202
More than anything, you're mine and no one else's.

241
00:18:57,228 --> 00:18:59,030
I always loved you, Asada,

242
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,661
Always.

243
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:05,848
In school, when I heard about what
happened, when I heard what you did,

244
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:09,519
I could look all over and
never find another girl like you.

245
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:14,510
I mean, you shot a real bad guy
with a real gun and killed him!

246
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,700
How cool is that?

247
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:18,735
I told you, didn't I?

248
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,015
I said you had real power.

249
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:24,668
When I came up with the Death Gun legend,

250
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:27,703
I picked the type 54 as his gun 'cause of you.

251
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,947
That's how much I love you, Asada.

252
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,615
I love you so much,

253
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,749
More than anything.

254
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,038
No.

255
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,824
I don't want to see anything,

256
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,636
or feel anything anymore.

257
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:06,051
This isn't real.

258
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:07,699
It can't be.

259
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,238
Kirito.

260
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:15,308
You went to all that trouble to save me,

261
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,769
But it was all for nothing.

262
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:19,809
How 'bout this?

263
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:22,137
After we log out, I could head over to you.

264
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:26,507
If he comes over, he'll be in danger.

265
00:20:28,366 --> 00:20:30,877
And I can't do anything about it.

266
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,792
That's not true.

267
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:34,973
Huh?

268
00:20:35,912 --> 00:20:39,829
Up to this point, all we've been
doing was looking out for ourselves.

269
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,953
We certainly never fought for anyone else.

270
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,167
But now, even though it might be too late for us,

271
00:20:47,667 --> 00:20:49,651
Let's go fight for someone else,

272
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,775
just this once, me and you.

273
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,776
Come on. Let's go.

274
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,726
I love you, Asada.

275
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,842
A‐Asada!

276
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:40,382
No.

277
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:42,873
Let go of me! No!

278
00:21:45,634 --> 00:21:47,633
Asada. Asada.

279
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,753
Asada! Asada!

280
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,628
Asada! Asada!

281
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:52,570
Asada!

282
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,144
Run, Sinon!

283
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:04,360
Kirito.

284
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,206
Next time: "One Little Step".
