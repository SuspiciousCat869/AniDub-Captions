1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,853
No, see, the way it's set now, the gyro's too sensitive.

2
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,524
If you want to prioritize the visual tracking,

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,579
you gotta give yourself a little
more room in these parameters.

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,655
Okay, but won't it lag like
crazy if she makes any sudden moves?

5
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:21,051
I guess you'll just have to trust that the
learning program and the optimizer can deal with it.

6
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:23,801
How much longer, guys?

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,608
Our lunch break's almost over.

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,985
Let's just save this as the
default setting and hope it works.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,207
Hey, uh, Yuuki, can you hear okay?

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,510
Yup! I hear you loud and clear.

11
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:35,216
Good.

12
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:38,526
All right, I'm firing up the
lens now, so it might get bright.

13
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:41,410
Let me know when you can see
perfect, and I'll lock that setting in.

14
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:42,682
Fire away!

15
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:46,711
Hold it.

16
00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:48,961
Okay, you're ready to go.

17
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,982
Last thing, I installed
stabilizers, but they're kinda janky.

18
00:00:53,216 --> 00:00:55,137
Try not to make any sudden moves, 'Kay?

19
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,596
Thanks, Kirito!

20
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:34,435
Wow. Your school's ginormous.

21
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:36,019
I know, right?

22
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,353
I'm sorry I couldn't show you around first,

23
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:40,946
but the lunch break's almost
over, and we don't want to be late.

24
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:42,132
Nah, that's okay.

25
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,430
I'm just excited to check out your class.

26
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:48,741
Sweet. Then let's head to the faculty
room and introduce you to my teacher!

27
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,429
What's wrong?

28
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,045
It's the one part of school I don't miss,

29
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,087
going to the faculty room.

30
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,217
Heh. Don't worry.

31
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:00,212
The teachers here aren't your typical teachers.

32
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:00,873
They're cool.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,793
Excuse me!

34
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:04,388
M‐me, too!

35
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,857
I just wanted to make sure it was still all right.

36
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:10,829
Sure. I'm fine with it.

37
00:03:11,197 --> 00:03:14,703
And what's the name of the
student who'll be joining us today?

38
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:17,932
Oh, um, Yuuki, Yuuki Konno, sir.

39
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:20,098
Uh, okay.

40
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:23,306
Ms. Konno, you're welcome in my class anytime you want.

41
00:03:23,562 --> 00:03:26,452
Although, we start Akutagawa's "a lorry" today.

42
00:03:26,612 --> 00:03:29,384
Unless you stick with it to
the end, you won't get the point.

43
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:32,110
Yes, sir. Thank you very much.

44
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,694
Mm. Heh heh.

45
00:03:35,527 --> 00:03:36,500
See you in class.

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,739
Hm? Uh...

47
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,095
Heh.

48
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:00,098
What's that, Ms. Yuuki?

49
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:02,222
Hey, how'd you know my name?

50
00:04:02,895 --> 00:04:05,063
No, she was using my last name there.

51
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,120
Oh, right. Duh.

52
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:09,440
Guys, meet Yuuki Konno.

53
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:12,396
She's in the hospital right now and can't leave her room,

54
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:14,874
so instead, she'll be attending our class like this.

55
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,162
Nice to meet you!

56
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,299
I can only hang out for a little while, though.

57
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,419
Cool.

58
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:20,887
Nice to meet you.

59
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:22,402
Hey, there. My name's Kota.

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,518
Oh, hi. Hey. Nice to meet you, too.

61
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:35,838
Please stand.

62
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:39,088
Bow. Be seated.

63
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:43,153
All right then, class.

64
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:46,037
Please open your textbooks to page ninety‐seven.

65
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:49,739
We'll be reading "a lorry" by Ryunosuke Akutagawa.

66
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,546
Let's see. Who'll read it for us?

67
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:55,661
Yuuki Konno, would you do the honors?

68
00:04:57,138 --> 00:04:58,431
Huh? Me?

69
00:04:58,717 --> 00:04:59,185
Uh...

70
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:02,060
Problem?

71
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:04,477
No, sir. I can do it.

72
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:10,108
Yuuki, are you up for this?

73
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:13,481
I might not look it, but I have read before.

74
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:22,065
"When Ryohei was eight years old,

75
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:26,197
construction on the light railway
between Odawara and Atami began.

76
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:31,337
Every day, he would head to the
outskirts of town to watch the progress.

77
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:35,254
It wasn't the construction of
it that fascinated him so much.

78
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:39,446
It was the sight of the lorries
transporting the soil which drew him.

79
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:42,624
There were two laborers aboard the lorry

80
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,452
standing behind the soil they'd just loaded.

81
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:48,290
Since the lorry was headed down the mountain,

82
00:05:48,476 --> 00:05:50,123
it didn't need anyone to push it.

83
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,530
So as the chassis swung

84
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:55,009
and the sleeves of the laborers' coats flapped

85
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:57,892
and the narrow rails bent under the strain,

86
00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:01,214
Ryohei would gaze longingly at these sights

87
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,495
and wish he could be a laborer, too,

88
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:05,403
or at the very least,

89
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,856
be able to ride on it with them, if only once.

90
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,571
I loved listening to you read, Yuuki.

91
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,822
Hey, have you had a chance to tour the school?

92
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:20,640
If not, we could show you around.

93
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:21,862
T‐Take it easy, guys!

94
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,995
Hey, wanna go to a soccer match?

95
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,829
Thanks, guys! You're the best!

96
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,619
Now that was fun.

97
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:29,992
I know, right?

98
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,858
Thanks for making today happen, Asuna.

99
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,337
Really, I had a blast.

100
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm never gonna forget today ever.

101
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,929
Well, of course you won't.

102
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,856
The teacher said you could come back again if you want.

103
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,780
Oh, modern Japanese is third period tomorrow.

104
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,013
You don't want to miss that.

105
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:52,319
Yeah.

106
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:53,476
'Kay, what's next?

107
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,666
Is there anything else you want to do or see?

108
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:58,019
Oh. Um...

109
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:01,545
I guess there is one place I'd like to go.

110
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,544
Where?

111
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,662
It's so pretty here, huh?

112
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,891
Just look at that sky.

113
00:07:13,722 --> 00:07:14,508
Yeah.

114
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,707
Hey, are your folks cool with you staying out so late?

115
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:19,755
You've been hauling me around all day.

116
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,416
Don't you worry about it.

117
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,114
I sent them a text, and it's fine.

118
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,651
Well? Where do you want to go next, Yuuki?

119
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,991
Go left.

120
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:46,253
Hey, are we in Tsukimidai yet?

121
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:47,273
Yeah.

122
00:07:47,977 --> 00:07:49,907
Next corner, there's a white house.

123
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,255
Can you stop there?

124
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:02,512
Yuuki, this is your house, huh?

125
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:03,724
Mm‐hmm.

126
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,848
I never thought I'd get the chance to see it again.

127
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:12,358
Thanks for bringing me out here and for everything.

128
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,550
Do you want to go inside?

129
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:16,285
Nah. This was enough.

130
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:19,993
Come on. Let's head back before your folks get worried.

131
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,932
No, it's okay. We can stay a little longer.

132
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,082
Me and my family,

133
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,850
we only got to live here a little over a year,

134
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:34,278
and the weird thing is I can remember every day so clear.

135
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:40,053
My sister and me used to play in the yard,
running around and around. We had barbecues,

136
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:42,613
and we even built these bookshelves with our dad.

137
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:44,459
Good times.

138
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,259
Lucky you.

139
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:49,652
Yeah. They're gonna tear it all down, though.

140
00:08:49,677 --> 00:08:51,300
Really? Why?

141
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:53,833
My aunt wants to either put a convenience store here

142
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,145
or maybe sell it.

143
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:56,277
No way.

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,868
That's why I wanted to come here,
so I could see it one more time.

145
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,038
Well, I know how you can save it.

146
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:02,752
How?

147
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:04,700
You're fifteen now, aren't you?

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,679
When you turn sixteen,

149
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:08,438
find someone you love, and marry 'em!

150
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,568
That way, you'll have someone around who'll
keep this house from ever being torn down.

151
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:16,692
You got the craziest ideas!

152
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:20,826
I don't think there's anyone I wanna marry, though.

153
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:24,007
Oh, yeah? But you and jun make a cute couple.

154
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,188
God, no! That guy's so immature.

155
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:30,641
Let's see. Who should I marry?

156
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,212
Oh, I know!

157
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:32,722
You!

158
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:33,380
Huh?

159
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,299
The only thing is, if you marry me,

160
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,534
you'll have to be the wife.

161
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,318
I mean, the other way around,

162
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:41,153
my name'd be Yuuki Yuuki, and that'd be weird.

163
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,690
I can't imagine what my mom would say.

164
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:46,152
I know. I'm kidding.

165
00:09:46,508 --> 00:09:49,000
'Sides, you already got someone lined up.

166
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:52,057
Oh, well, yeah. I guess.

167
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,863
Still, you should be careful.

168
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,944
I get the feeling he's not
living in the real world, either.

169
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:58,939
Not like me, but you know.

170
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,933
I can't thank you enough, Asuna.

171
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,275
Just to see my old house again,

172
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:07,397
you don't know how happy that makes me.

173
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:10,000
Back when we lived here,

174
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:13,477
I remember we'd go to church to pray and stuff,

175
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,332
and mom used to always say this to me and my sister,

176
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:20,282
"god would never put us through all this suffering

177
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,670
if he didn't think we could bear it."

178
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,722
It didn't make me feel any better, though.

179
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:33,289
Instead of quoting the Bible, what I really wanted
was for mom to talk to us like... well, like a mom.

180
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:37,850
But you know, after seeing our old house again,

181
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,205
I think I get it now.

182
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,249
The words didn't matter.

183
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,759
It was the feeling behind those words.

184
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:48,291
She was praying for me so I
wouldn't feel sorry for myself,

185
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,615
so I could be strong 'til the end,

186
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,710
and now I finally get it.

187
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:55,984
I'm the same.

188
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:00,043
See, I‐I haven't understood my mom, either.

189
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,798
I can't hear what she's really trying to tell me.

190
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,243
She can't seem to hear me.

191
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:12,462
Remember what you told me, that sometimes
you have to fight to get your point across?

192
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,834
How can I get to be strong like you?

193
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:16,661
Me?

194
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:20,284
Heh. I'm not strong. No way.

195
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:21,769
Oh, yes, you are!

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,153
You're not like me.

197
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,698
When you stand up to someone, you
don't flinch or let them intimidate you.

198
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:28,715
Nothing seems to scare you at all.

199
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:30,774
It's like second nature for you.

200
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:33,960
Mm, yeah, I don't know.

201
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,077
When I was living in the real world or...

202
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,354
you know what I mean...

203
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,303
most of the time, I was faking it.

204
00:11:39,354 --> 00:11:39,683
Huh?

205
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,759
It's like I thought I had to act cheerful,

206
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:45,494
'cause I didn't wanna make my mom and dad feel sad for me.

207
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,176
Yuuki.

208
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,186
You wanna know what I think in the end?

209
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,390
So what if I'm just acting?

210
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:54,787
If I get to spend more time smiling,

211
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,536
even if it's fake, what's the big deal? Am I right?

212
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:01,623
I mean, it's not like I got a whole lot of time left,

213
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:05,713
and it'd be a shame to waste whatever
I do got by moping around all the time,

214
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:09,821
so now I say exactly what I feel to everyone,

215
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:12,216
and if they got a problem with that, who cares?

216
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,057
At least I spoke my mind

217
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,850
and maybe even got a little closer to 'em.

218
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:18,707
You're right.

219
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,262
That's the reason we're here today,

220
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,021
why we're so close after only a few days.

221
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:25,108
It's all 'cause of you.

222
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,851
Nope, that wasn't 'cause of me.

223
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:28,464
Huh?

224
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:31,134
It's 'cause even after I ran away from you,

225
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,922
you tracked me down.

226
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:38,068
Look, how 'bout you try talking
to your mom like you did to me?

227
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,492
If you try telling her how you feel,

228
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,462
maybe you'll get through to her.

229
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:46,221
Don't worry. You can do it.

230
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,967
You're way stronger than me, honest!

231
00:12:52,457 --> 00:12:53,214
Yuuki.

232
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:57,513
You hit me with everything you had.

233
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,463
That's how I knew I could trust you with everything I had.

234
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:03,801
In the end, it worked out for both of us, didn't it?

235
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,346
Yes, it did.

236
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:07,246
Thank you so much, Yuuki.

237
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:25,960
If you try telling her how you feel,

238
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,075
maybe you'll get through to her.

239
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,234
Don't worry. I know you can do it.

240
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:37,297
Come in.

241
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,061
You're late again.

242
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,361
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:54,881
Well, if you're hungry,

244
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:57,387
you'll have to make do with whatever's in the fridge.

245
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:02,638
Oh, and don't forget, the deadline for
your transfer application is due tomorrow.

246
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:04,898
Make sure it's filled out by morning.

247
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,755
Actually, about that...

248
00:14:06,897 --> 00:14:07,292
Hm?

249
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,276
We need to talk, mother.

250
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,428
Well, what is it?

251
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:15,592
I can't really explain it here.

252
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:17,661
Okay, then. Where shall we go?

253
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,158
The virtual world.

254
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,878
It'll only be for a little while,

255
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,653
and you're going to have to use this.

256
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:30,732
Don't be ridiculous!

257
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:33,776
If you can't tell me what this
is about like a normal person,

258
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:35,193
I don't want to hear it.

259
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:36,526
But you don't understand.

260
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:38,425
It's the only way I can explain!

261
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,898
It's just five minutes!

262
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:42,653
Mom, please!

263
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:46,423
There's no other way to tell you what
I'm thinking and how I'm feeling, honest!

264
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:48,611
I can't tell you any of that here!

265
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:50,411
Just this once.

266
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:53,368
Mom, all I want is for you to see my world!

267
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,427
Five minutes.

268
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,738
But no matter what you say,

269
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:10,087
I have no intention of allowing you to
attend that school again next year, understood?

270
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:13,859
Also once you're done, you will fill out that application.

271
00:15:14,422 --> 00:15:15,054
Okay.

272
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:17,707
So how do I use that thing?

273
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:26,049
Just sit back and relax. Once I turn it on,

274
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:29,415
it'll automatically connect you
to my sub‐account in the game.

275
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,118
After you're in, wait for me.

276
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,377
I'm turning it on now.

277
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,763
Link start.

278
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:05,375
This is so bizarre.

279
00:16:06,393 --> 00:16:09,776
Seeing a strange face mimic what I do is unsettling.

280
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,828
And this body, it's so light.

281
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:13,988
Oh, that's normal.

282
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,656
That particular avatar's weight
setting is about ninety pounds or so.

283
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,372
Feels lighter than your real body, huh?

284
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,745
That is so rude!

285
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,995
I do not appreciate what you're implying.

286
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:25,988
That's interesting.

287
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,215
Your face here looks just like your real one.

288
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,790
Well, yes.

289
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:34,277
Actually, I take it back. Your
real face is puffier than this one.

290
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:36,086
Oh, now who's being rude?

291
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,129
I look the same here as I do there.

292
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,043
Well, I'm here. Now what?

293
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:45,989
You don't have much time left.

294
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,236
Follow me, mom.

295
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,477
You see? It looks just like it.

296
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:21,957
I have no idea what you mean.

297
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:24,094
All I see is some old cedar gro...

298
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,163
Doesn't it bring back memories

299
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,616
of the house that grandma and grandpa had?

300
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,933
I really loved their place in Miyagi.

301
00:17:38,115 --> 00:17:39,592
It was magical.

302
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:08,548
Remember that obon holiday when I was twelve?

303
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:12,842
You, dad, and Koichiro went to
the Yuuki family compound in Kyoto,

304
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:14,868
and I went to Miyagi by myself.

305
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:16,634
I remember.

306
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,233
When I got there,

307
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,908
I apologized to them that you couldn't be with us.

308
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,617
I felt bad you couldn't visit our ancestors' graves.

309
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:26,906
I wanted to, but that year,

310
00:18:26,951 --> 00:18:29,626
the Yuukis were having an important memorial service.

311
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,316
No, mom, I'm not blaming you or anything.

312
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:36,148
In fact, you know what grandpa said?

313
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:37,952
He said not to fuss,

314
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,323
because he and grandma were so proud of you.

315
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:50,042
You left this village, went to university,
became a scholar, and got your work published.

316
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,812
It made him so happy to see you
make a name for yourself in the world.

317
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:58,206
And then he told me something I'll never forget,

318
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:03,976
that someday you might get tired from all
the hard work you do and need a break from it,

319
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:06,175
and if that day ever came,

320
00:19:06,432 --> 00:19:09,892
he said he wanted to make sure the
house and the mountain were always there,

321
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,021
that he'd guard them to give you a
place to come home to if you needed it.

322
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,544
I didn't understand it then,

323
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:27,655
but now, after everything that's
happened to me, I think I finally do.

324
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:31,856
Life isn't just about doing
the things that make you happy.

325
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,765
It's also about finding a way to live

326
00:19:35,017 --> 00:19:38,319
where the happiness of everyone
around you fulfills you, too.

327
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:45,556
Somehow, I want to figure out how to live
a life that makes everyone around me happy.

328
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,255
I want a life that lets me be there for the
people I care about when they need someone to lean on.

329
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,116
That's all I want.

330
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:56,423
Mother, I'll study and work hard,

331
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,931
but I want to keep going to the school that I love.

332
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:22,722
Mom.

333
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,862
What is this?

334
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:29,152
This is crazy. I'm not really crying.

335
00:20:30,222 --> 00:20:30,812
Mom.

336
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,318
You can't hide it when you're sad in this world.

337
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:38,208
When you cry, you cry just like in real life.

338
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:41,958
Such an annoying world.

339
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,286
Morning, mom.

340
00:21:16,745 --> 00:21:17,578
Morning.

341
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:26,347
Asuna, are you determined to live
the kind of selfless life you spoke of?

342
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:28,348
Mm‐hmm.

343
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,814
Fine. If that is what you want,

344
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,273
you'll have to be strong enough to carry that burden,

345
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,263
so make sure you go to college,

346
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:42,393
and for that, you'll have to get better
grades this trimester and next year.

347
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:44,948
Really?

348
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,280
Then I can stay?

349
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:48,487
That's up to you.

350
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:50,442
You'll have to prove yourself.

351
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,461
Do your best.

352
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:02,300
Thanks, mom. I will.

353
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:05,771
Thank you, Yuuki.

354
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,731
Here I go.

355
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,867
Next time: "Mother's Rosario".
