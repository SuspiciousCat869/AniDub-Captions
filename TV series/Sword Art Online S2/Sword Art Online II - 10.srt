1
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:11,467
A type 54 Black Star.

2
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,195
It's the gun.

3
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:16,615
Why?

4
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:18,635
Why here?

5
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,414
Why does he have that gun?

6
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,769
What it means to be strong,

7
00:02:30,744 --> 00:02:31,768
to be brave...

8
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:41,141
I thought somehow I could learn those things from Kirito.

9
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:46,151
I don't wanna die.

10
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,187
A grenade.

11
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,425
Kiri... to.

12
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,194
I'm slowing you down.

13
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,667
Just leave me.

14
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,021
Not the horse.

15
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,372
It can go fast,

16
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:15,586
but it's too hard to handle.

17
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:33,466
Sinon, get your rifle,

18
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,052
and blow that horse away.

19
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:37,222
Huh? What?

20
00:04:38,422 --> 00:04:39,381
All right.

21
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,072
I'll try.

22
00:04:52,787 --> 00:04:54,973
No. My finger.

23
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,260
I can't pull it.

24
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,532
I can't do it.

25
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:07,775
I can't pull the trigger.

26
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:14,822
Hang on tight.

27
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,233
It's no use.

28
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:32,863
We can still get away.

29
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,258
Stay sharp, damn it.

30
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:46,925
No.

31
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,683
He's catching up.

32
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,862
Hurry! Faster!

33
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:54,606
Please don't let him catch up to us.

34
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:24,419
Help me. I can't do this.

35
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:25,817
I don't wanna die!

36
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,789
Hey, Sinon, snap out of it!

37
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,782
Listen, he's catching up with us.

38
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,192
Pick up your gun, and shoot him!

39
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:43,930
No, I can't.

40
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:45,237
You don't have to hit him.

41
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:46,624
Just distract him.

42
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:48,764
I can't!

43
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:51,620
Don't make me. Don't make me.

44
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:53,536
Then get up here, and steer this thing.

45
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,223
Give me your gun, and I'll shoot him.

46
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,803
Hecate.

47
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,410
She's part of me.

48
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,415
I'm the only one who can use her.

49
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:17,605
I can't do it.

50
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,721
I can't shoot. I can't move my finger.

51
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:24,290
I can't. I can't fight anymore.

52
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,423
You can!

53
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,023
Everyone can fight if they want to.

54
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,035
It's your choice, so what'll it be?

55
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,992
Will you give up, or will you fight?

56
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:35,242
If it's my choice,

57
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,557
then I don't want to fight anymore.

58
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,092
I'm done.

59
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,396
I don't want to suffer anymore.

60
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:44,916
I thought I could get stronger playing this game,

61
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:47,120
but I was wrong.

62
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:52,380
I'll help you, but you have to try,

63
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,876
so come on. You can do this.

64
00:07:58,473 --> 00:07:59,710
It's no good.

65
00:07:59,748 --> 00:08:02,583
With all this shaking around, I can't lock on.

66
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:05,377
It's okay. The shaking's gonna stop in three,

67
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,059
two, one,

68
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,201
now!

69
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:13,075
How's he do it?

70
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:15,508
How can he be so calm now?

71
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:19,239
No, it's not that he's being calm.

72
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,016
He's giving it everything he's got.

73
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,912
When he fights, he goes all out every time,

74
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,284
no excuses.

75
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:29,702
That's it.

76
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,683
That's where he gets his strength.

77
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,162
I missed.

78
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:24,201
This isn't good.

79
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,069
We're like sitting ducks out here.

80
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,753
We need to find some cover.

81
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:35,766
Hey, I think I see a cave over there.

82
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,412
If we hide inside, we can avoid the sat scan.

83
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:41,320
Sounds good. Let's go.

84
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,798
This is perfect.

85
00:09:54,863 --> 00:09:57,197
We can dodge the scan and rest up, too.

86
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,224
What happened back there?

87
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,741
It's like he just popped up out of nowhere.

88
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:17,205
We didn't see him on the scan.

89
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:20,178
That must mean he's got some kind of cloaking skill.

90
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,648
Is there a skill like that here, invisibility?

91
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:25,853
Yeah, there is. It's a skill

92
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:29,990
called meta‐material optical camouflage.

93
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,608
We're safe, for now anyway.

94
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,621
Even if he's invisible,

95
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:38,839
the sands are rough here.

96
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,023
We'll hear it crunching under his boots.

97
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,802
We'll see his footprints, too,

98
00:10:42,827 --> 00:10:45,497
so he can't sneak up like he did before.

99
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:47,525
Roger that.

100
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,742
Well, I guess we'll keep our eyes and ears open.

101
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,104
Hey, Kirito,

102
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,835
do you think there's a chance Death
Gun was killed in that explosion?

103
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:03,809
No.

104
00:11:03,994 --> 00:11:05,973
The second before that truck blew up,

105
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,097
I saw him jump off of that robot horse.

106
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,571
He might have gotten dinged up,

107
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:14,193
but I can't believe that blast killed him.

108
00:11:15,236 --> 00:11:15,837
Oh.

109
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,248
When he had me in his sights back at
the stadium, I thought I was a goner.

110
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,010
How'd you know I was in trouble?

111
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,878
And how'd you get to me so fast from your position?

112
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:31,181
We were wrong about Jushi X being Death Gun.

113
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,685
I took one look, and I knew it wasn't.

114
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:35,562
It was pretty obvious, actually.

115
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:36,979
Obvious?

116
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:39,306
Yeah. I know a woman when I see one.

117
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:40,419
Oh.

118
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:42,429
The second I saw her,

119
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,097
I knew we overlooked something.

120
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:45,737
I didn't know what, though.

121
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:47,694
Oh, by the way,

122
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:49,769
even though her handle says Jushi,

123
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,826
she calls herself Musketeer X.

124
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,969
Anyway, after I took out Musketeer X,

125
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:59,253
I looked over to the south and
saw you lying there in the street.

126
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:02,394
I knew you were in trouble,

127
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:05,132
so I grabbed her rifle and grenades and charged in,

128
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:07,606
shooting and tossing bombs as fast as I could.

129
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,318
I can't believe I let my guard down like that.

130
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,513
Don't go beating yourself up over it.

131
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:27,633
I mean, look, it's not like I
knew he was hiding down there either,

132
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,335
and if our roles were flipped, you know what?

133
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,741
I would have been the one getting shot instead.

134
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,884
But that's okay, 'cause I know you
would have rescued me, too, wouldn't you?

135
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,009
I can't believe it.

136
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,136
My rival's trying to make me feel better.

137
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,565
He knows I'm weak, and here he is consoling me,

138
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:51,476
like I'm a kid or something.

139
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,241
I'm heading out for a bit.

140
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,422
You might as well kick back
here and rest up while you can.

141
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,055
I wish you could log out, but I know you can't,

142
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:03,186
not till the tourney's over, anyway.

143
00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:04,038
Huh?

144
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,692
You're going after Death Gun, aren't you?

145
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,020
You think you can take him on alone?

146
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:15,617
Yeah. I have to.

147
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:20,378
He's tough, and he won't go down
without getting off a shot or two at me.

148
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:24,369
If it comes down to that, I don't know what I'll do.

149
00:13:24,644 --> 00:13:25,703
I might bail.

150
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:30,688
I don't wanna leave you hanging like
that, so it's better if I face him alone.

151
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,431
Then you're scared of him, too?

152
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,375
Yeah, I am.

153
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,395
If it was the old me,

154
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:42,998
I would have jumped right in and fought
him, even if there was a chance I was gonna die,

155
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,615
but not anymore.

156
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,332
These days, there's things I have to protect.

157
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,309
I can't die.

158
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:50,658
I don't want to.

159
00:13:50,794 --> 00:13:52,664
Things you have to protect?

160
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,616
Yeah, in the virtual world

161
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:57,502
and the real one, too.

162
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,596
Okay.

163
00:13:59,677 --> 00:14:02,450
Then don't go after him. Just stay here, and keep low.

164
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:06,258
As long as BOB's going on, we can't log out,

165
00:14:06,484 --> 00:14:09,827
but once the competition's whittled
down to us and one other player,

166
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,408
we can suicide out and let the other guy win.

167
00:14:12,926 --> 00:14:14,477
That'll end the tournament.

168
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:16,258
Yeah, I don't know.

169
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,402
I mean, that's one way of doing it.

170
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,413
Thing is, it's not really a good option.

171
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:24,325
If we just sit here and wait for the tourney to end,

172
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:28,162
there's no telling how many
other players that guy's gonna kill.

173
00:14:29,558 --> 00:14:30,108
Yeah.

174
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:35,431
You really are strong after all.

175
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:41,425
I'm not gonna hide either.

176
00:14:42,074 --> 00:14:42,522
Huh?

177
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:46,917
I'm going outside and help you take that bastard out.

178
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:49,309
No, you're not. Haven't you been listening?

179
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,360
If he shoots you, there's a chance you'll die.

180
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,270
As a player, close combat's my specialty.

181
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,530
It's not yours.

182
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:57,557
You're in way more danger than me,

183
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,450
'cause he can be invisible if he wants.

184
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,221
He'll pop up next to you, and bang.

185
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,049
I don't care if I die.

186
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,874
I was scared out of my mind back at the stadium.

187
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,929
I was scared I was gonna die.

188
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:14,031
I was even weaker than I was five years ago,

189
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:16,381
like a screaming, crying little girl.

190
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:20,711
If that's how I'm gonna be for the rest of my life,

191
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,321
I'd rather be dead.

192
00:15:23,317 --> 00:15:25,252
It's only natural to be afraid.

193
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:27,916
I don't know anyone who's not afraid of dying.

194
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:30,126
Yeah, well, I hate it.

195
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,383
I'm tired of being afraid.

196
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,244
I'm so tired.

197
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:36,763
Whatever.

198
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,572
I'm not asking to go with you.

199
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:40,247
I'll fight by myself.

200
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,777
You want to fight alone and die alone.

201
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:47,352
Is that what you're saying?

202
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:48,733
Yeah.

203
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:51,255
I was always supposed to die alone.

204
00:15:53,103 --> 00:15:54,086
Let go.

205
00:15:54,443 --> 00:15:55,841
I have to do this.

206
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,311
You got it all wrong.

207
00:15:58,406 --> 00:15:59,935
There's no dying alone.

208
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,315
It's not that simple.

209
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:05,942
When you die, you leave a hole in all
the people whose lives you were part of,

210
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:09,044
and like it or not, you're part of mine now.

211
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,707
Yeah, well, I never asked to be a part of it.

212
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,717
Besides, my life's no one else's business but mine.

213
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:16,919
You're wrong.

214
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:19,096
We're involved in each other's lives now.

215
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:22,648
All right!

216
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:26,452
If that's how it is, then you can
protect me for the rest of my life!

217
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:35,601
You don't know anything,

218
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:39,741
and you can't do anything, so
don't go saying stuff like that!

219
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:43,524
This... this isn't your fight! It's mine!

220
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,128
Mine! You got that?!

221
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,905
Even if I lose, even if I die,

222
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:51,701
no one can blame me for what I did.

223
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:54,365
You want to help?

224
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,667
You gonna carry this burden with me?

225
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:58,951
Then what, huh?

226
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,121
You gonna hold my hands

227
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,514
even though they've got blood all over 'em?!

228
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,320
Murderer.

229
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,548
Murderer. Murderer.

230
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,143
Murderer.

231
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,558
Murderer.

232
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:19,773
You murderer!

233
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,459
You kill anyone today?

234
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:24,084
Eww. Don't touch me.

235
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,796
You'll get me all bloody.

236
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:27,609
Why don't you kill yourself?

237
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:28,882
Nyah, nyah!

238
00:17:28,951 --> 00:17:30,115
Psycho!

239
00:17:58,254 --> 00:17:59,335
I hate you!

240
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:00,788
I hate your guts!

241
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:02,010
I hate you.

242
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:23,498
Even though I hate your guts,

243
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,466
can I borrow your lap for a sec?

244
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:38,596
I...

245
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:40,444
I killed someone.

246
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:44,355
About five years ago,

247
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,223
in a small town up north,

248
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,776
this guy tried to Rob a post office.

249
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:54,414
The news said the robber died
'cause his gun went off accidentally.

250
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,204
But the truth is I was there.

251
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,141
I grabbed his gun and shot him dead.

252
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,164
How old were you?

253
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:05,928
11 years old.

254
00:19:06,134 --> 00:19:11,625
And ever since then, whenever I see a
gun, I start throwing up, and then I pass out.

255
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:18,500
If I see a gun, I see the face of the
robber the way he looked right before he died.

256
00:19:19,645 --> 00:19:22,314
And then I‐I get so scared.

257
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:23,412
Really?

258
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,759
Yeah, but in this world,

259
00:19:25,829 --> 00:19:27,956
I don't have those problems,

260
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:29,899
and that got me thinking.

261
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,340
If I can become the strongest player in the game,

262
00:19:33,771 --> 00:19:35,888
then I'll be strong IRL, too,

263
00:19:36,268 --> 00:19:38,203
and maybe even forget what I did.

264
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:40,640
But just now...

265
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:44,311
I mean, when Death Gun had me pinned,

266
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:45,977
I was terrified.

267
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,576
And just like that,

268
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,415
I wasn't Sinon anymore.

269
00:19:50,062 --> 00:19:51,643
I was the real me again.

270
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:55,938
I'm scared to die. I am.

271
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:59,797
Although, what's worse is living with this fear.

272
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,317
It's so painful, I'd rather be dead.

273
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:07,189
But I know if I run away from Death Gun and my past,

274
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,749
I'll end up weaker than before.

275
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:12,255
I will. I know it.

276
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:13,830
Yeah.

277
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:15,834
I get it.

278
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:18,580
I killed someone once, too.

279
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,680
What?

280
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:22,530
I mentioned it once,

281
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,287
'bout how I knew Death Gun.

282
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:27,838
We fought before when we were stuck in another game.

283
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,259
I'm sure you heard of it,

284
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:33,260
"Sword Art Online."

285
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,594
Oh, my god. I knew it.

286
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:42,151
Yeah, I'm a survivor of "SAO",

287
00:20:42,604 --> 00:20:45,599
and so is Death Gun, and back then,

288
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,636
he was a red player in this guild.

289
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:50,913
They called themselves Laughing Coffin, PKers.

290
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,270
They had to be stopped,

291
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:57,829
so one day, a party was formed to
catch 'em and haul 'em off to prison.

292
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,076
I was in that party.

293
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:07,532
They found out about our plans, and they ambushed us,

294
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:12,548
and in the middle of the chaos, I
killed two of Laughing Coffin. I just...

295
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:14,988
Cut 'em down.

296
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:23,747
And over time,

297
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,873
I managed to force myself to forget what I did,

298
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,440
till yesterday,

299
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:31,314
when I ran into the guy calling himself Death Gun.

300
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:35,789
And there's no doubt he was with Laughing Coffin that day?

301
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:38,282
You're sure he was part of that ambush?

302
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:41,160
I am, about as sure as I'll ever be.

303
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:44,051
He's one of the players we took to prison that day.

304
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:47,414
That's why, no matter what,

305
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,739
I have to settle things with him in here

306
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,139
in this world.

307
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,580
Next time: "What It Means to Be Strong".
