1
00:00:01,687 --> 00:00:02,546
Hey, guys!

2
00:00:03,202 --> 00:00:04,840
This is miss Asuna.

3
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:08,701
Miss Asuna, this is my guild, the Sleeping Knights!

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,436
My name's Jun.

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,370
What's up? How's it going?

6
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:15,097
H‐Hi, miss Asuna.

7
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:16,791
I‐I'm talken.

8
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:18,788
It's nice to meet you...

9
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:19,392
Ah!

10
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:23,005
You really need to get a grip
on those nerves, tal, seriously.

11
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:26,149
Every time you meet a girl,
you turn into a blubbering mess.

12
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,559
Anyway, my name's Nori.

13
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:29,552
Glad to meet ya.

14
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:31,108
My name is Siune.

15
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,613
It's wonderful to meet you,

16
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:34,888
and thank you so much for coming today.

17
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:36,412
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,576
My name's Tecchi.

19
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,353
And...

20
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:42,528
I'm Yuuki, the leader of this guild, kinda, sorta.

21
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,085
Miss Asuna, don't laugh,

22
00:00:45,196 --> 00:00:49,077
but see, we wanna be the only
guild to beat the boss on this floor,

23
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:51,266
and we want you to help us!

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,838
Huh?

25
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,109
Huh?!

26
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,025
That's very ambitious,

27
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:36,146
but a boss raid usually takes at least forty‐nine players.

28
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,759
That's seven parties with seven players apiece,

29
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,818
so no matter how skilled you are, with
just seven players, that's kind of...

30
00:02:43,182 --> 00:02:45,605
well, to be perfectly honest, it's unrealistic.

31
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,539
Yeah, it sorta is, isn't it?

32
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:51,983
We tried taking on the bosses on
floor twenty‐five and six the same way.

33
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,506
Huh?! J‐Just you six?

34
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:55,192
Yup.

35
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:58,713
And if you ask me, we put up a pretty good fight, too,

36
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:04,027
but both times, this huge guild swooped in and
beat 'em before we could figure out our next move.

37
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:06,831
Why would you even risk it?

38
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,378
That's a story.

39
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:12,235
It goes back to when we met
in another game's net community.

40
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,490
We hit it off right away, and
we've been friends ever since.

41
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:21,539
But we only have until next spring to go
on quests together. Since our time's limited,

42
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,152
we wanted to make the most of it.

43
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:28,091
You see, come spring, we'll all be busy with other things,

44
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,239
so we decided that before we disbanded the guild,

45
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:35,426
we had to do something so amazing, so
unbelievable we'd remember it forever.

46
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:36,152
Mm‐hmm.

47
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:38,771
So that's why you want to do this boss raid.

48
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:44,268
Exactly! If we defeat a boss together, our names
will be inscribed on the monument of swordsmen,

49
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,853
you know, the one in the town of
beginnings, in the black iron palace.

50
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:50,651
I know it sounds silly

51
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:52,737
and maybe even a little vain,

52
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:56,349
but we really want to get our
names up on that wall, no matter what.

53
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,743
But getting them on there's the hard part.

54
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:00,161
Hmm?

55
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:02,620
If a boss is defeated by a party,

56
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:05,677
then all of its members will get
their names inscribed on the monument,

57
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:09,207
but if it's beaten by multiple parties working in tandem,

58
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,007
only the names of the party leaders get inscribed.

59
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:12,974
Oh.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,535
That's the catch.

61
00:04:14,715 --> 00:04:17,996
If we want the names of everyone in
the Sleeping Knights up on that wall,

62
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:22,304
we have to beat the boss together, just us, no one else,

63
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,023
so we talked it over and came up with a plan.

64
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,563
A party can have up to seven players Max,

65
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:34,647
therefore we decided to find someone as strong or
even stronger than our most powerful player, Yuuki,

66
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:38,403
and hope whoever we found accepted our invitation.

67
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:41,496
I get it. That's why you were dueling.

68
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:45,222
Well? What do you think about joining up with us?

69
00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:48,425
We can't pay you very much, but
you're welcome to what we have.

70
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,384
Uh, oh, no, that's okay!

71
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:54,965
Boss raids cost a fortune as it is,
so you should use your money for that.

72
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:57,524
I'd feel horrible taking your money, really.

73
00:04:57,704 --> 00:05:01,136
If you want, you could give me
whatever the boss drops, and I'll be fine.

74
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,783
Really?! Then you'll join our party?

75
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:19,787
Huh.

76
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,617
This is nothing like how the old Aincrad was,

77
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:29,786
and yet here I am thinking about
safety margins and the odds of winning,

78
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:34,751
having safe fights and certain victories.

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,118
There's more fun to games than that.

80
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,314
I bet Yuuki and her friends already know this

81
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:45,482
better than I do.

82
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,342
Okay, let's see how far we can go.

83
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,154
Yes! Awesome.

84
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,200
In the end, it's not about winning or losing.

85
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:56,038
It's having fu...

86
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,558
Thanks a bunch, miss Asuna!

87
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:00,014
Please,

88
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:02,463
I‐I'd prefer it if you just called me Asuna.

89
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:04,700
Then you can call me Yuuki.

90
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:09,628
That reminds me, Ms. Yuuki... sorry, Yuuki...

91
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:12,104
The duel was all about testing players, right?

92
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:13,488
Yup. Pretty much.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,899
Then you must've gone up against a
ton of strong players before I showed up.

94
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:21,095
Do you remember ever fighting
a spriggan, dressed in black?

95
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,715
He would've been using a one‐handed sword.

96
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:25,401
Huh.

97
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,575
You know what? I do.

98
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,744
Man, he was pretty tough.

99
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,890
Then why didn't you ask him to help you out?

100
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,951
I don't know. He just wasn't right.

101
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:38,502
Well, why not?

102
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,065
He found out my secret.

103
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,512
I can't have that.

104
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,403
Okay, so for tomorrow,

105
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:50,103
how 'bout we meet back here at 1:00?

106
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,353
You got it! You got it!

107
00:06:51,468 --> 00:06:52,433
Roger that. What they said.

108
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,610
And let's have fun.

109
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:54,446
Right!

110
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:37,813
Wh...

111
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:40,082
mom? What are you doing?!

112
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,310
Last month, when you were late for dinner,

113
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,265
I told you it better not happen again.

114
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,929
And here we are.

115
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:52,237
You're late because of that game,
so now you lose your privileges.

116
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,610
I just lost track of time.

117
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,547
That's my fault, and I'm sorry.

118
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:59,161
But you didn't have to go and
pull the plug on me like that.

119
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:01,661
You could've shaken me or even yelled in my ear.

120
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:04,294
I would've gotten an alert in‐game,
and then I could've logged out...

121
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,837
I tried that approach before.

122
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,843
It took you five minutes to snap out of it, remember?

123
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,263
Well, yeah.

124
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,971
I had to say good‐bye to everyone before I log...

125
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:14,184
Oh, don't give me that.

126
00:08:14,456 --> 00:08:17,747
What you do in some stupid
virtual game does not take priority

127
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:20,720
over your commitments in the real world, ever.

128
00:08:24,287 --> 00:08:25,085
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:28,442
I'll be more careful next time.

130
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:31,932
This will be your last warning.

131
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,260
If you break your word to me because of that thing again,

132
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:36,525
I'm confiscating it.

133
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:40,241
I have no idea what's going on in that head of yours.

134
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,675
You lost two years of your life
because of that... that infernal machine.

135
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,802
You could've died.

136
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:48,774
How can you even stand to look at it?

137
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,046
This isn't the Nervegear, mother.

138
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,720
It's dinnertime.

139
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,030
Get changed, and come downstairs.

140
00:09:03,802 --> 00:09:04,935
I'm not hungry.

141
00:09:05,853 --> 00:09:07,328
As you wish.

142
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,003
Hmm.

143
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:25,518
Sounds like a good lineup, right?

144
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,577
Huh? Asuna.

145
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:34,520
Uh, s‐so Yuuki, Jun, and Tecchi are up front.

146
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:36,830
Then talken and Nori are midrange,

147
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,398
and Siune, you're the backup? Right.

148
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,731
Then I guess, if you're covered,

149
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,669
maybe I should hang back as the rearguard.

150
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:48,144
Yeah, sorry. I feel bad you're not up
front when you're so good with a sword.

151
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,496
Oh, I don't mind at all.

152
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:51,768
I'm afraid I'm not much good as a tank.

153
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:57,291
And anyway, I'm curious to see whether
Jun and Tecchi can survive a proper beatdown.

154
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,529
Don't worry about us!

155
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:00,731
We can handle it.

156
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:01,981
I guess we'll see.

157
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:02,798
I hope.

158
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:09,050
All right, ready to go take a peek at that boss room?

159
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:10,685
Yeah!

160
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:21,899
Yeah! Yeah!

161
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,418
What a team.

162
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:28,024
I wonder if they really need me after all.

163
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,511
I can't believe how quickly you
guys are clearing the labyrinth.

164
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:36,308
You're an amazing group of players.

165
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:41,486
It's the boss room! Come on!

166
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:45,612
Yuuki, hold it!

167
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,301
Eck, kaa‐rah, phim, fisckle,

168
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,314
bryotah, ryu‐gah, gardol.

169
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:15,790
Look!

170
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:20,533
W‐W‐Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on!

171
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:22,567
Hang on! We're not here to fight you!

172
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,482
Then lower your weapons now!

173
00:12:24,507 --> 00:12:25,047
Get rid of it.

174
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:29,094
Keep your eye on them, and if
they make a move for their weapons,

175
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:30,847
hit 'em with an aqua bind spell.

176
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,846
You got it.

177
00:12:33,256 --> 00:12:35,905
This is our first‐ever PVP in "ALO".

178
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,456
It's kind of thrilling.

179
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,329
If you're not PKers, then why were you hiding from us?

180
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,371
We were waiting for someone.

181
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:49,139
We were hiding, 'cause we didn't wanna get hit by a
mob before our friends got here. You know how it is.

182
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,796
All right, then.

183
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:55,906
We're here to take on the boss,
so if you're not ready to enter yet,

184
00:12:55,998 --> 00:12:58,143
we'd like to take a crack at it first.

185
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:00,296
N‐No, that's cool.

186
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,149
We'll just hang here,

187
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,777
you know, till our buddies show up.

188
00:13:09,857 --> 00:13:11,507
Oh, and, uh, watch your backs in there.

189
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:13,141
Good luck.

190
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:17,059
Oath, shaal, oh‐bis, glone, lopt!

191
00:13:17,892 --> 00:13:19,789
Don't give those dudes a second thought.

192
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:20,989
Come on. Let's do this.

193
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:22,709
Hmm. Don't worry.

194
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:25,738
Let's just stick to the plan and have a look inside, okay?

195
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:26,639
Okay.

196
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:29,385
Instead of just scoping it out,

197
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:33,645
let's bust in there and trash the
boss. If you want to try, go for it.

198
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:38,023
Just make sure not to use any of your
expensive potions and stuff to recover.

199
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:43,198
Siune and I will support you with healing spells,
so fight hard, but try not to get too far in the red.

200
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:45,675
Ha! Right on, coach! Uhh!

201
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:47,476
Listen up.

202
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,603
If you die, don't respawn right away.

203
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,473
Just hang out, and study the boss' attack patterns.

204
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:56,643
Then let's meet back at the lombard save
point and talk about what we learned, okay?

205
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:57,990
Roger that!

206
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:47,345
Let's get him!

207
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,285
Right!

208
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,079
Jeez! We got our butts kicked!

209
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:57,688
What kinda attack was that?

210
00:14:57,752 --> 00:14:59,796
That's gotta be against the rules!

211
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,188
That boss sure knows how to defend itself.

212
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:03,734
You think that's a random move,

213
00:15:03,823 --> 00:15:05,216
using his arms to block?

214
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,566
And we fought so hard, too.

215
00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:10,785
Hey! What's wrong?!

216
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,283
Hmm? Hmm?

217
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,302
Come here, you guys. Gather round.

218
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:14,524
Eh? Eh?

219
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,288
I know you're tired, but we need to talk.

220
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,426
Remember those three guys standing by the boss room?

221
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:22,659
Sure. Why?

222
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:26,236
They were scouts from a guild
that specializes in boss raids.

223
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:31,857
If another guild tries to hit that boss
room, their job is to sit back and watch.

224
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:36,035
The bosses you tried to raid on the
previous floor and the one before that,

225
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,173
I have a feeling they were there, too.

226
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,647
I had no idea they were even there.

227
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:46,079
They didn't get in our way or try to stop us, so
they're definitely spies. All they want is intel.

228
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:50,385
And when a small guild like the Sleeping
Knights comes along to take on a boss,

229
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:54,135
we're helping them figure out all
its attack patterns and weaknesses.

230
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:55,858
Wait a sec.

231
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,793
The door shut behind us when we were
inside, and they definitely didn't follow us,

232
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,566
so if they can't see us fighting the boss,

233
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,996
how are they gonna gather any intel on it?

234
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,404
Actually, they could see us fight.

235
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,789
Towards the end there, I looked over, and
I saw a tiny gray lizard near Jun's feet.

236
00:16:11,957 --> 00:16:14,655
That's when I realized I let my guard down too soon.

237
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,146
It's a dark spell called peeping.

238
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:21,100
It binds a familiar to a player,
and the caster sees what it sees.

239
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:29,738
So what you're saying is after we got hammered
by the bosses on floors twenty‐five and six,

240
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:32,250
that other guild swooping in and beating 'em,

241
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:34,142
that wasn't a coincidence?

242
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,594
No, I'm afraid it wasn't.

243
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,281
You probably fought so hard, the
boss used every move it had against you,

244
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:40,599
and they saw it all.

245
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,910
That's how they beat the bosses so quickly.

246
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,135
They used us again.

247
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:49,071
Now they know everything about this boss, too.

248
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:51,620
They're probably in there taking it down.

249
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,709
Those dicks.

250
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:55,631
Damn it.

251
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:56,832
Easy, guys.

252
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,458
Don't count us out just yet.

253
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,364
But what can we do about it now?

254
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,443
Simple. It's 2:30 P.M. in the real world.

255
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,284
At this time of day and on such short notice,

256
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:10,799
it'll be hard to find enough people for a raid party.

257
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,805
By my estimate, it should take them at least an hour.

258
00:17:15,037 --> 00:17:16,782
That's plenty of time for us.

259
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,399
So here's the deal. After this,

260
00:17:19,436 --> 00:17:22,588
if we can get back to that room
in thirty minutes, we can take it.

261
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:23,428
Okay?

262
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:28,880
Yeah!

263
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:35,766
Last one there's a rotten egg!

264
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,445
Hey! Wait for us!

265
00:17:38,713 --> 00:17:39,809
Slowpoke!

266
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,247
Crap! We're too late.

267
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,002
Don't worry.

268
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,353
They won't advance with only twenty players.

269
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:57,680
We should have enough time to give it
one more try before the rest show up.

270
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:58,686
You think?

271
00:17:59,674 --> 00:18:00,826
Excuse me! Hm?

272
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,569
We'd like to try the boss before you do.

273
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,506
Could you guys let us by?

274
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:07,788
Sorry, doll‐face.

275
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:09,666
The boss room's off‐limits for now.

276
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,969
Wait. Off‐limits? What's that supposed to mean?

277
00:18:13,311 --> 00:18:16,658
It means, in a couple minutes, the
rest of the guild's gonna roll up here.

278
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,945
We're just holding the room till they do.

279
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,224
If you want, you can wait over there.

280
00:18:21,304 --> 00:18:23,621
And how long do you expect us to wait?

281
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:24,774
Um...

282
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:26,759
Another hour or so.

283
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,373
But we don't have that kind of time!

284
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,256
If you were going in right now,
well, that's a different story,

285
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,831
but you're not, so let us go in first.

286
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,738
Look, I don't make the rules.

287
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:38,262
I'm just a grunt here,

288
00:18:38,362 --> 00:18:40,732
following orders like everyone else, okay?

289
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:42,469
You got a complaint,

290
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:44,729
go to the guild headquarters, and talk to them.

291
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,515
It's over in ygg city, so get...

292
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:48,080
Are you kidding? That's far away!

293
00:18:48,105 --> 00:18:50,053
It'd take us at least an hour to get there!

294
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:52,155
Hey, big guy.

295
00:18:52,568 --> 00:18:53,069
Hmm?

296
00:18:53,409 --> 00:18:55,169
Just trying to figure things out here.

297
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:57,336
So no matter how nice we ask,

298
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:59,060
you're not gonna let us get by you.

299
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:00,450
Is that what you're saying?

300
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:02,714
Yeah, that's it.

301
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:04,360
That's pretty much what I'm saying.

302
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,047
Okay. If that's what you're saying...

303
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:08,871
You wanna fight?

304
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:09,637
Huh?

305
00:19:09,836 --> 00:19:10,511
Huh?

306
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:16,965
But, Yuuki, are you sure?

307
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:21,036
Asuna, sometimes you gotta fight to get your point across,

308
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,596
you know, like how dead serious you are about something.

309
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:26,695
Just saying.

310
00:19:27,578 --> 00:19:29,667
Yup, that's pretty much how it is!

311
00:19:30,131 --> 00:19:31,177
You guys.

312
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,044
These folks know exactly what I'm talking about.

313
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,896
They look like the serious types.

314
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:41,006
We could chop away all day, and they'd
defend this room to the last player.

315
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,508
Right, big guy?

316
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,194
Uh...

317
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:46,381
W‐We got orders to...

318
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,468
Come on, draw your sword.

319
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,093
Y‐You little punk.

320
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,366
I'm gonna make you pay for that.

321
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:27,097
Sometimes you gotta fight to get your point across.

322
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:33,055
Yeah...

323
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:35,235
She's right.

324
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,909
Hey, guys!

325
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,934
I should've dealt with this when I had the chance.

326
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:10,865
Sorry, Asuna.

327
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,588
My big mouth got you into this mess.

328
00:21:13,913 --> 00:21:15,854
But it was totally worth it.

329
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:18,783
Know why? 'Cause just now,

330
00:21:18,908 --> 00:21:21,561
I saw the best smile I've ever seen on you!

331
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:23,654
In that case,

332
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:25,776
I'll start pulling my weight.

333
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,982
We might not take down this boss,

334
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,814
but the next one,

335
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:34,020
I promise that one's ours!

336
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,504
Eh?

337
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,976
Heh. Some folks just don't know when to quit.

338
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:52,734
Sorry, guys.

339
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,256
Stand down.

340
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,202
You're not getting past me.

341
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:39,168
Next time: "The Monument of Swordsmen".
