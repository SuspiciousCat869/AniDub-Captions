1
00:00:02,875 --> 00:00:05,346
Only three days left till the new year,

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,321
and I hope you're all enjoying your holiday.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:11,117
Hey, were you up late again?

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:12,283
Yeah,

5
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:14,575
for a mechatronics project for school.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,950
Mecha‐what? Sounds fun.

7
00:00:19,226 --> 00:00:20,111
Kazuto.

8
00:00:20,556 --> 00:00:21,496
You see this yet?

9
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:23,157
What the?!

10
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:26,201
The holy sword Excalibur has been found in "ALO"?!

11
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:28,532
Aw, man, that sucks.

12
00:00:28,564 --> 00:00:30,759
I can't believe someone else beat us to it.

13
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:34,432
Read the article, doofus. It says it's been found, is all.

14
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,274
No one's actually got it yet.

15
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:38,184
Oh.

16
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:39,621
Yeah, you're right.

17
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:41,132
Don't scare me like that.

18
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:45,985
A couple months ago on the Arun plains,

19
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:49,643
Leafa, Yui, and me got swallowed
by a big‐ass monster worm.

20
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:52,993
It dropped us in an underground realm called Jotunheim.

21
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:57,656
We looked around for a bit and came
across this four‐armed humanoid monster.

22
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,157
It was fighting another monster that looked
like a cross between an elephant and a jellyfish.

23
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:07,356
Go figure. Leafa felt sorry for the
jelly‐phant thing and told me to go save it.

24
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,939
I lured four arms onto this frozen
lake, and it fell through the ice.

25
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:12,661
Then the jelly‐phant took care of it.

26
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,557
Leafa decided to call it Tonky,

27
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:21,025
and suddenly it transformed into an
even‐weirder‐looking thing with eight wings.

28
00:01:21,232 --> 00:01:23,973
We hopped on its back, and it took us to a passageway

29
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:25,807
leading to the surface world.

30
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:35,170
On the way up was when we saw it, an upside‐down
pyramid hanging from the roots of the World Tree

31
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:38,898
and a long, golden sword shimmering inside.

32
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:46,453
Excalibur.

33
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,850
I was planning on going back for it someday, but now...

34
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:54,858
It'd be a nice break from all that
floor‐clearing you're doing in new Aincrad.

35
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,676
This article doesn't say anything about how they found it.

36
00:01:57,883 --> 00:02:00,416
Players can't fly in Jotunheim, remember?

37
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,444
But that's the only way to spot Excalibur.

38
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,444
That thing's too high up to see.

39
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,929
Unless they rescued one of Tonky's friends,
hitched a ride, and triggered the quest flag.

40
00:02:08,981 --> 00:02:10,989
If we could do it, so could someone else.

41
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:15,830
I guess that makes sense, although who'd trust a creepy...

42
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:21,992
Uh, I mean who'd trust such a unique
monster unless they had weird ta...

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,458
I mean a weirdly big heart.

44
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,195
Someone just like you, sis.

45
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,036
What are the odds?

46
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:30,272
He is not creepy. He's adorable.

47
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:34,179
Anyway, the whole point of showing
you that was to get you going.

48
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,228
It's only a matter of time before someone
grinds through that dungeon and gets the sword.

49
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,631
You're right. Clock's ticking.

50
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:43,259
So what are you gonna do about it?

51
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:49,705
Sugu, getting rare items isn't the point of it.

52
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,308
If that's all you play for, you're missing out.

53
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,705
Yeah, I guess you're right.

54
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,191
There's funner things to do than boosting stats.

55
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,368
I wasn't finished.

56
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:00,403
I think Tonky wanted us to find it,

57
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,605
and that's why he showed us where it was.

58
00:03:02,786 --> 00:03:07,418
For some reason, he needs us to clear that
dungeon, so it's up to us to make his wish come true.

59
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,652
Tonky's our friend, and there's no
way I'm turning my back on a friend.

60
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,338
Mmm!

61
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,834
A minute ago, you called your friend creepy.

62
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:16,313
Mm.

63
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,999
I meant creepy cool.

64
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:20,514
Anyway, you in?

65
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,907
Sure. I don't have practice 'cause of the holidays.

66
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:24,731
Awesome.

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,605
Okay, we'll need seven others.

68
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,025
We don't want to overload Tonky.

69
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,559
For starters, we got you, me, and Asuna.

70
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,699
Then there's Klein, Liz, and Silica.

71
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:35,729
We need one more person.

72
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,070
Agil's gotta work tonight.

73
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:40,319
Chrysheight's not leveled up yet.

74
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,185
Recon's grinding in sylph territory.

75
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,162
Oh, I know.

76
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,955
Let's ask Sinon to come along.

77
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:47,972
Great idea, sis.

78
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,238
What'd you expect?

79
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,658
I'll message 'em right now,

80
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,674
except for Asuna. I'll leave that to you.

81
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:54,441
Okay.

82
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:01,854
I wish I could see Kirito again

83
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,754
before I go visit my grandparents.

84
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:11,061
H-Hi, Kirito.

85
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,520
Morning, Asuna.

86
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,189
Sorry to call so early.

87
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:19,305
We were planning on going on a quest
in "ALO" This afternoon. You want to go?

88
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:22,117
Yeah, I'll totally go. I'm free all day today.

89
00:04:22,142 --> 00:04:24,660
Cool. I'll text you the time and place,

90
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,032
so keep an eye out for it.

91
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,599
You know I will.

92
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:29,483
See you in a little while, then.

93
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:32,010
Yes.

94
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:12,843
Hey, Klein,

95
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,117
do you get to take vacation for new year's?

96
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,010
Been on it since yesterday.

97
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,229
Even if I wanted to work... and I don't...

98
00:06:19,256 --> 00:06:21,096
there's no shipments this time of year.

99
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:23,039
You know what my cheap‐ass boss said?

100
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:26,245
"Be thankful you got a job where you
get a whole week off for new year's,"

101
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,792
bragging about it like he was doing us a favor.

102
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,753
And speaking of favors,

103
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,260
if we do manage to snag Excalibur today,

104
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:37,571
how about doing me a solid and helping me
get my hands on the soul blade kaguzuchi?

105
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,912
Seriously?

106
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:41,441
That dungeon's like a frigging oven, man.

107
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:45,545
Yeah, well, I'm going to Jotunheim for you,
where it's colder than the ass‐end of an ice pop.

108
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,189
You know, I want something out of this, too,

109
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:49,797
the Shekhinah bow.

110
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:55,209
Uh, your avatar's two weeks old, and
already you're gunning for a legendary weapon?

111
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:58,121
Yeah, well, that bow Liz made me is great and all,

112
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,190
but I need something with a little more range.

113
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:00,986
Oh, yeah?

114
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,418
Then what the heck are you using a bow in "ALO" For?

115
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:06,714
Their range falls between spears and magic.

116
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:11,286
You're like the only player who wants to
use these things to snipe from 100 meters.

117
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,078
If I had my way, I'd want double that range at least.

118
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,912
We're back, guys.

119
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,383
Thanks for waiting.

120
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,432
We thought you were never coming back.

121
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,975
What's up? You get lost or something?

122
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,182
Not at all.

123
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,657
We were gathering information while we shopped.

124
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:32,487
We talked to a whole bunch of people, daddy,

125
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:36,341
and so far, not one player or
party has reached that dungeon yet.

126
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:37,506
Really?

127
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,991
Well, then how the heck do they know where Excalibur's at?

128
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,405
That's the thing, daddy.

129
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,259
No one really knows where it is.

130
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:47,657
Apparently they found a different
quest than the one Tonky showed us.

131
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:53,859
They met an NPC who told them if they finished
this other quest, they'd get Excalibur as the reward.

132
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:56,158
And from what we heard,

133
00:07:56,396 --> 00:07:58,762
the quest they're going on isn't very pleasant.

134
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:05,855
Instead of a delivery quest or an escort quest,
it's a kill quest, just slaughtering monsters.

135
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,125
Everyone in Jotunheim is out there
right now killing as many as they can.

136
00:08:10,277 --> 00:08:13,495
Yeah, that doesn't even sound close to being pleasant.

137
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:16,170
This whole thing sounds sketchy to me, guys.

138
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:17,565
Here's what we know.

139
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:21,299
There's a dungeon in the sky with
Excalibur locked up at the bottom of it.

140
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:24,374
To get to it, you gotta fight
your way through a bunch of monsters.

141
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,161
But now we got an NPC offering it up
as a kill‐quest reward? That's bizarre.

142
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,698
Now that you mention it,

143
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:36,643
The NPC's not showing anyone to the
dungeon, but that's where the sword is.

144
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,146
Well, I'm sure we'll find out why once we get there.

145
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,540
All righty.

146
00:08:44,806 --> 00:08:47,473
Your weapons are all restored and ready for action.

147
00:09:00,465 --> 00:09:04,518
Even though our party's full of hotness,
we're still a bunch of gear‐toting meatheads.

148
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,531
If you wanna switch it up, you
could always boost your magic.

149
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:09,396
Ha! Keep dreaming.

150
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:12,941
A real samurai, he wouldn't be caught dead using magic.

151
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,168
Code of honor.

152
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:15,814
Code of honor, huh?

153
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:18,735
Know what samurai's are classified as in RPGs?

154
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:21,490
They're both warriors and black‐magic users.

155
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:25,946
Please. I'd rather bust my sword and
quit being a samurai than use magic, doll.

156
00:09:26,258 --> 00:09:28,664
I don't know, Klein. If I remember right,

157
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:31,189
didn't you use a flame‐sword skill the other day?

158
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:34,229
You know, when you activate it, you are using part magic.

159
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:35,891
No way. Really?

160
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,546
Yes, Klein. What Silica said is true.

161
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,566
Remember the may update?

162
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:43,871
It brought a whole bunch of new sword skills to "ALO".

163
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,488
Some are physical, and others are advanced,

164
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:50,789
like earth, water, fire, wind, dark, and divine,

165
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,856
all of which are magical attributes.

166
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:55,134
Fire's magical, too, huh?

167
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:58,843
Okay, ex‐samurai, you need help busting that sword?

168
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,326
Dude, back me up here.

169
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:06,944
Well, since you don't chant when using
sword skills, I guess it's not the same.

170
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,677
I'll let it slide this time. Heh.

171
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:16,789
I really appreciate you guys
helping me out on such short notice.

172
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:20,684
Seriously, you don't know how much this means to me.

173
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,164
All right, are you ready?

174
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,542
Yeah!

175
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,624
God.

176
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:32,824
How many steps does this thing have, anyway?

177
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:39,429
I know. I bet the tower on the dungeon floor
of new Aincrad doesn't even have as many as this.

178
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,339
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

179
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,434
If we took the normal route to Jotunheim,

180
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,891
it'd take at least two hours.

181
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,811
This way, it's just five minutes.

182
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,081
Instead of complaining about the steps,

183
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:53,140
you should be thanking me for
showing you guys this rad shortcut.

184
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,518
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

185
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,075
It's still a pain in the butt.

186
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,182
I got your pain in the butt.

187
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,028
Why, you...

188
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:08,402
Dumb‐ass. Do that again, and you
get a fire arrow in your piehole.

189
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,688
Brother, you got balls of steel, no joke.

190
00:11:19,996 --> 00:11:20,997
Freezing.

191
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:27,352
Wowsers.

192
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:29,366
Amazing.

193
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:42,999
Aren't you cold?

194
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:50,237
Oath, sharle, raise, vind, bard, harl‐ca, stoles.

195
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:54,994
Better?

196
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:57,857
I cast a freeze‐resistance spell over us.

197
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,783
Tonky, up here!

198
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:19,726
Jesus.

199
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,432
Take it easy, Klein.

200
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,794
He doesn't look it, but he's a vegetarian.

201
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,585
Well, not exactly.

202
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,799
When I brought him some fish from aboveground,

203
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:30,559
he scarfed it all down in one bite.

204
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:31,993
Uh‐oh.

205
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,887
What's he doing?

206
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,162
He's telling you to get on his back is all.

207
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,606
Dude, no way. No way in hell.

208
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:44,483
My grandpa's dying words were don't ride in
foreign cars or on flying cthulhu elephants.

209
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:48,971
Is he the same dead grandpa whose dried
figs we were eating at dicey's the other day?

210
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:50,934
Stop farting around, and get on.

211
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,279
If it eats me, man...

212
00:12:54,823 --> 00:12:56,336
This is gonna be fun.

213
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:57,724
We're so dead.

214
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,926
Thanks a lot for doing this, Tonky.

215
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,245
All right, Tonky.

216
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:09,027
Everyone's onboard, so take us to that dungeon!

217
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,954
Wow. I wonder what would happen
if you fell from way up here?

218
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:28,789
The same thing that happened when
a certain someone decided to get

219
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,904
to the next level of Aincrad
by climbing the outer pillars.

220
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,519
So how 'bout it, wonder Klutz? Care to show the lady?

221
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:36,032
Nah. I think I'll pass.

222
00:13:36,152 --> 00:13:39,573
But maybe one of our more catlike
friends would like to take a shot.

223
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,149
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

224
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,539
Eh?

225
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,247
Yah‐hah!

226
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:06,248
Kazuto, get up here. Check it out.

227
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:16,880
My god. I‐I can't believe it.

228
00:14:16,945 --> 00:14:19,688
They figured out how to make that monster fight for them.

229
00:14:19,803 --> 00:14:21,741
No, there's gotta be another reason.

230
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:24,423
It's not possible to tame monsters in this game,

231
00:14:24,478 --> 00:14:28,964
not even if you're a cait sith master tamer
with a full power boost and special equipment.

232
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,863
Then they're leeching off the monster?

233
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:33,645
No, wait. They're not leeching.

234
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,655
Piggybacking, yeah, that's it.

235
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:39,499
See, that group's got ol' four‐arms
there doing all the heavy lifting

236
00:14:39,524 --> 00:14:41,878
and sniping at the jelly‐phant when they get an opening.

237
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,414
But is it that easy to control a monster's aggro?

238
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:47,180
It's ignoring everyone else.

239
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:08,908
How come they're not taking on that four‐armed dude?

240
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:10,169
Where's everyone going?

241
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:12,317
Hey, you guys, look.

242
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:17,745
What the hell's going on down there?

243
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:22,270
After what we just saw and how it went
down, it should be pretty obvious what it is.

244
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,174
I hate to say it, but we're looking
at that kill quest Asuna told us about.

245
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:32,198
Even though it's a quest, helping these four‐armed
freaks murder Tonky's friends is disgusting.

246
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,319
Hmm?

247
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:41,558
Damn, she's tall.

248
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:44,426
Greetings.

249
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:47,147
I am Urd, queen of the lake.

250
00:15:48,105 --> 00:15:51,446
You have bonded with my kinsman, and I am grateful.

251
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,627
My two younger sisters and I have spoken at length,

252
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,754
and we have a request for you.

253
00:15:57,298 --> 00:15:58,888
If you would be so kind,

254
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,334
we ask that you save our lands from the frost giants.

255
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,337
Daddy, she's an NPC.

256
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,057
There's something strange about her, though.

257
00:16:08,525 --> 00:16:13,771
Her speech pattern doesn't follow the same
set response routines that a normal NPC's would.

258
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:18,364
Her core programming is connected to
the language engine module of the game.

259
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,068
What are you saying?

260
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,624
Is she some kind of A. I.?

261
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:23,413
Yes, daddy, she is.

262
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:24,651
In the past,

263
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:27,298
Jotunheim was similar to your Alfheim,

264
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,402
covered in lush greenery and beautiful lakes.

265
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:34,337
It basked in the blessings of Yggdrasil, the World Tree.

266
00:16:35,075 --> 00:16:37,224
We, the hill giants,

267
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,564
lived in peace and Harmony
with our kinfolk, the creatures.

268
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,761
Far below the splendor of Jotunheim

269
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:48,936
is a realm of ice and snow known as Niflheim.

270
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:53,046
Thrymr, king of the frost giants, rules that land.

271
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:56,361
He shattered our peace by casting Excalibur,

272
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:59,036
the sword that slices through wood and iron,

273
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,744
into the well of Urd,

274
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,009
the heart of our land.

275
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:07,462
It severed the thickest roots of the World Tree.

276
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:12,593
In an instant, Jotunheim lost the
blessings it received from Yggdrasil.

277
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:33,978
I was right, Excalibur.

278
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:37,430
Under Thrymr's command,

279
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:42,084
the frost giants marched on
Jotunheim and overwhelmed our defenses.

280
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,407
Their fortresses and castles soon blighted our land,

281
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:49,169
and scores of my people were captured and imprisoned.

282
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:54,185
Once they seized control, they
built Thrymheim, their largest castle,

283
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,931
atop the mass of ice once known as the well of Urd.

284
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,750
During the chaos, my sisters and I
escaped to the bottom of a frozen lake.

285
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,239
However, we no longer have the power we once had.

286
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,943
The frost giants are not satisfied with their spoils.

287
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,332
They wish to annihilate our kin,

288
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,981
the creatures that populate our realm.

289
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:21,061
If they succeed, my powers will be extinguished,

290
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,074
and Thrymheim will rise to the next world,

291
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,995
your world, Alfheim.

292
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:29,259
Hold the phone.

293
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:33,062
You're telling us that once they're done
here, they're gonna go up and destroy Arun?

294
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,202
Yes, that is their intention.

295
00:18:35,564 --> 00:18:39,207
King Thrymr will seal Alfheim in ice and continue on

296
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,812
until he reaches the top of Yggdrasil.

297
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,836
Once he reaches it, he will take
the golden apple growing there.

298
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:54,411
Thrymr and his generals have grown frustrated
by the time it is taking to wipe out my kinfolk,

299
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,115
so they have turned to your people, the faeries,

300
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,664
for assistance in their murderous plot.

301
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:06,115
Your kind hunts our kinfolk to extinction,
lured by the offer of Excalibur as a reward.

302
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:12,777
However, king Thrymr cannot bestow that sword unto others,

303
00:19:13,414 --> 00:19:16,197
for if Excalibur ever leaves Thrymheim,

304
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,414
the blessings of Yggdrasil will return to this land,

305
00:19:19,737 --> 00:19:23,086
and their castle will vanish as a mist upon a meadow.

306
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:25,126
But... but then...

307
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:28,482
What kind of quest is it when
the reward for it's a total lie?

308
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:30,337
How is he gonna get away with it?

309
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:34,154
Most likely, he will award the
Victor a sword called Caliburn,

310
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,930
whose appearance is identical to Excalibur.

311
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:38,351
But that's cheating.

312
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:40,669
If he's a king, doesn't he have a code of honor?

313
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,303
Unfortunately, cheating and falsehoods

314
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:45,879
are Thrymr's most powerful assets.

315
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,440
However, he has made one great mistake.

316
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,958
In his eagerness to slaughter my kin,

317
00:19:53,034 --> 00:19:56,018
he has sent a number of his giants down from Thrymheim

318
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,101
to marshal your kind for battle.

319
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:02,798
At this moment, the defenses of his
castle are weaker than they have ever been.

320
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:04,234
There's our shot.

321
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:14,742
Once the stone in the amulet turns black,

322
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,812
it will mean all my kinfolk have been slain

323
00:20:18,247 --> 00:20:20,165
and my powers have left me.

324
00:20:21,273 --> 00:20:24,122
Good faeries, infiltrate Thrymheim,

325
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:26,164
remove Excalibur from its plinth,

326
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:27,766
and save my realm.

327
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,775
I am counting on you, good faeries.

328
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,162
This is turning into a bigger deal than we thought.

329
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,739
Is this still considered a quest?

330
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:52,994
'Cause it's kinda turned into something
way more epic than a plain old quest.

331
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:57,151
You heard her. She said if the
creatures in this world get killed off,

332
00:20:57,276 --> 00:20:59,994
the frost giants'll take over the surface next.

333
00:21:00,056 --> 00:21:01,108
Yeah, I know,

334
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:06,506
but I doubt the admins would let that happen
without some kind of update or warning or something.

335
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:08,756
I mean, normally,

336
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:11,220
they'd let players know a week ahead of time.

337
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:15,447
Whatever. We're gonna finish this quest for Tonky.

338
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,639
Right, Kazuto?

339
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,674
You know it.

340
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:20,806
We were gonna storm the castle and grab Excalibur anyway.

341
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,598
It'll be easy if the castle's defenses are down.

342
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,818
Helping Tonky and his friends out, that's a bonus.

343
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,976
Here we go, guys! Our last big quest of the year!

344
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:37,641
Let's spank this thing and score us a
spot on the front page of MMO tomorrow!

345
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,181
Yeah!

346
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,861
Don't you worry, Tonky.

347
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,656
We'll get your home back for you.

348
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:50,546
It'll be good as new. Promise.

349
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:00,638
Here we go.

350
00:23:36,127 --> 00:23:38,493
Next time: "The King of the Giants".
