1
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:04,219
Um, okay, everyone!

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,823
A toast to this gathering of friends, new and old.

3
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:08,076
To us!

4
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:09,893
To us!

5
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:26,830
With everyone here, we'd be an amazing party.

6
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:28,963
Yeah, we would. I know!

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,227
We should raid the boss on floor twenty‐three.

8
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:32,456
I'm down with that!

9
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:33,783
Then let's go get him!

10
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:34,468
Yeah!

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,213
You're goin' down!

12
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:06,257
Aww.

13
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:32,473
Crap.

14
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:42,236
Hmph.

15
00:01:52,514 --> 00:01:53,416
Yeah!

16
00:03:29,722 --> 00:03:31,449
Thank goodness. You made it.

17
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,467
About forty minutes ago, her
heart stopped, but only for a moment.

18
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,658
We got it going with defibrillation and meds,

19
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,546
but if it happens again...

20
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:43,301
Why now? Why is this happening?

21
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,456
She seemed fine!

22
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:46,946
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:49,412
The truth is, ever since January,

24
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,925
when you first came to visit her,

25
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,772
her condition's been touch and go,

26
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,452
and for these last three months, we've all been stunned

27
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,477
by how Yuuki's managed to hang in there.

28
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:01,769
She can't beat this, but she keeps fighting.

29
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,010
She keeps on fighting.

30
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:09,184
The fifteen years Yuuki's spent on
this planet have been one long battle.

31
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,348
The HIV's only part of it.

32
00:04:11,725 --> 00:04:15,834
She's also been fighting the harsh
reality of her situation while in treatment.

33
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:21,381
There's no doubt the clinical trials with the
medicuboid caused her an unimaginable amount of pain,

34
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:25,224
and still somehow Yuuki keeps hanging on.

35
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:29,156
Well, anyway, we should let her get some rest now.

36
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:32,300
Come on, Yuuki.

37
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,212
You can't lose.

38
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,787
I mean, you're Zekken...

39
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,944
The ultimate swordswoman.

40
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,233
Take her hand.

41
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,114
It's okay. That's what she wants.

42
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:06,516
Doctor, can she use the medicuboid now?

43
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:10,486
But, well, wouldn't she want
to spend her last moments here?

44
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,361
No. She wants to go back one last time.

45
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:17,075
Please, doctor, let her use the medicuboid again.

46
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,215
Mm.

47
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,625
It's going to take about a minute to boot up.

48
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:26,402
Then what?

49
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:29,205
I'm going next door to log in with the Amusphere.

50
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,004
Wait for me, Yuuki. I'm coming.

51
00:05:56,807 --> 00:05:57,912
Thanks, Asuna.

52
00:05:58,615 --> 00:06:01,982
I'm glad I got to see you again,
'cause I got somethin' for you.

53
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,599
I can't believe I almost forgot about it.

54
00:06:04,992 --> 00:06:07,576
Really? What is it you wanted to give me?

55
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:10,362
Oh, um, I still gotta make it.

56
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,693
Hang on a sec.

57
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:52,303
Yuuki!

58
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:02,396
That's weird.

59
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:04,870
I feel so weak all of a sudden.

60
00:07:05,396 --> 00:07:07,871
I'm not in any pain or anything, though.

61
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:11,035
It's okay. You're just a little tired, is all.

62
00:07:11,742 --> 00:07:13,470
You'll feel better if you rest.

63
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:15,747
Yeah, maybe.

64
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,828
Listen, Asuna, take this.

65
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,063
It's my original sword skill.

66
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:24,253
No, Yuuki, I couldn't.

67
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:27,141
Oh, come on. I want you to have it.

68
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:29,383
Open the window.

69
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,752
I gave it a cool name,

70
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,956
Mother's Rosario.

71
00:07:45,557 --> 00:07:49,294
I‐It'll keep you safe when you need it.

72
00:07:52,007 --> 00:07:53,642
Thank you, Yuuki.

73
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,239
I promise I'll take good care of it,

74
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:59,829
and someday, when I leave this world,

75
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:03,557
I'll make sure to pass it on to someone before I go.

76
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:07,476
Your sword'll live on until the end of time.

77
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:09,678
Thank you.

78
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,569
Aww, guys. Come on.

79
00:08:22,182 --> 00:08:24,048
We talked about this.

80
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:26,899
You promised, no good‐byes.

81
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,573
Nah, you got it wrong.

82
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:30,155
We're all here to cheer you up.

83
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,672
When you get to the other side, wait for us, okay.

84
00:08:34,857 --> 00:08:36,709
We won't take too long, promise.

85
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,388
What're you talking about?

86
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:43,262
If you get there too soon, I'll be pissed.

87
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:43,727
Tsk, tsk!

88
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:45,376
You know the deal.

89
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,049
You're hopeless without us,

90
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,739
so don't even try to argue!

91
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,191
Just sit tight, and wait...

92
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,817
for... for us.

93
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:55,609
Please, Nori, don't cry.

94
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:58,024
We promised we'd be strong.

95
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,861
I give up. You win.

96
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:11,489
I'll wait for you.

97
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,658
But take your time.

98
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:14,970
You got it?

99
00:09:16,235 --> 00:09:17,139
Mm‐hmm.

100
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,716
Whoa.

101
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,645
Look at all those fairies.

102
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:06,204
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,628
I had to let them know.

104
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:09,188
I hope you're not mad at me.

105
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:10,930
Are you kidding?

106
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:13,067
Why would I be mad?

107
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:15,921
There's so many of 'em.

108
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:18,833
It's like a dream.

109
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:21,553
Why are they here?

110
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:23,515
Because of you.

111
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:29,293
You're the strongest, most powerful
swordswoman this world's ever seen.

112
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:32,159
There will never be anyone else like you again.

113
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,396
We can't let you go without saying good‐bye.

114
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:36,850
It's not right.

115
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,366
We're all praying for you,

116
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:41,547
that your next journey

117
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:45,157
will be to a place as wonderful as this.

118
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:48,936
I'm happy.

119
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:51,342
I'm so happy.

120
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:03,316
You know, this whole time, I thought if I was born to die,

121
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:07,630
what the heck was the point of me even being born?

122
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:11,836
I never made anything or gave anything to anyone.

123
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:15,679
All I did was waste drugs and hog that machine

124
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:18,223
and cause trouble for everyone.

125
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:23,113
If all I get to do is suffer and disappear in the end,

126
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:27,369
it'd be better to just disappear right now.

127
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,291
I used to always think,

128
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,686
why am I alive?

129
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:36,221
Why'd I stick around for this long?

130
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:40,076
But you know what?

131
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:44,850
After all this time, I think I know why now.

132
00:11:46,048 --> 00:11:47,952
I might not have done much,

133
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,607
but I'm glad I got to live,

134
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,522
'cause after everything,

135
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:56,609
these last few moments, they're the best ever.

136
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,263
I'm surrounded by all my friends,

137
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:08,577
and I got to end my journey in the arms of someone I love.

138
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,462
Yuuki, I promise,

139
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:17,232
I will see you again someday,

140
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:20,616
in some other place, some other world.

141
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:23,173
I don't know how, but I'll find you,

142
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:26,212
and then we can sit and talk,

143
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,319
and you could tell me where you've been.

144
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:49,495
I gave this life everything I had.

145
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:52,613
I was alive.

146
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,843
I never made anything or gave anything to anyone.

147
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,568
You gave me something.

148
00:13:46,774 --> 00:13:48,930
You carved it deep into my heart,

149
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:51,172
and it'll always be there.

150
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,298
Hello, Asuna.

151
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,418
How are you?

152
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:06,611
Wait. Is that you, Siune?

153
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,202
Yes, in the flesh.

154
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,581
It's nice to finally meet you in the real world.

155
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:12,996
I'm Shi‐Eun An.

156
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:15,343
Oh! I‐It's nice to see you, too.

157
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:16,688
I'm Asuna Yuuki.

158
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,714
Like meeting for the first time, huh?

159
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,404
No, it's okay.

160
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:29,780
Just this month, I got the all‐clear from
my doctor and was discharged from the hospital.

161
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,675
Then, you're doing better?

162
00:14:31,873 --> 00:14:32,595
Yes.

163
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:37,547
The type of disease I have is
called acute lymphocytic leukemia,

164
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,698
and it was about three years ago when I developed it.

165
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,252
The side effects from the medicine were so horrible,

166
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:46,658
I wanted to die rather than keep suffering,

167
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:50,739
but whenever I saw Yuuki, I thought, "here's this kid,

168
00:14:50,876 --> 00:14:54,186
and she's handling her situation
better than I'm handling mine."

169
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,981
Around February,

170
00:14:56,057 --> 00:14:58,336
they started cutting back on the meds I was on.

171
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,425
I thought, "this is it,"

172
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,548
and I braced myself for the end.

173
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,208
And then a week ago,

174
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:06,883
the day after Yuuki died,

175
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:09,124
my doctor came in and said,

176
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:12,126
"congratulations. You're in complete remission."

177
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:15,269
Next thing I knew, I was being discharged.

178
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,058
I barely had a chance to process the news.

179
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,647
And the truth is, it still hasn't sunk in yet.

180
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:26,155
It's like I should feel awful.

181
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:29,580
It doesn't seem fair that I'm
still here and Yuuki's waiting.

182
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:33,264
Yuuki and Ran, Clovis and Merida,

183
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,068
we promised we'd stick together forever,

184
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,815
and I‐I'm here, and...

185
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:40,511
Shi‐Eun.

186
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:44,094
You know, our lives are like vessels,

187
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,353
and we carry the teachings of
the ones who've passed in them.

188
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:50,616
For the longest time, I was so scared,

189
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:55,688
scared of telling someone how I really
felt and scared of finding out how they felt.

190
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,953
But I learned from Yuuki that
that was no way for me to live.

191
00:16:00,245 --> 00:16:02,415
If I didn't even try to reach out,

192
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,452
nothing would ever change.

193
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:07,329
She taught me how to be strong,

194
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,238
and I want to share that with others.

195
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:11,573
As long as I'm alive,

196
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:14,836
I'll pass on what I learned from her to everyone I meet,

197
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:17,913
and then someday, when I see her again,

198
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,648
I want to tell her about all the people she's helped.

199
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:22,483
That's how I'll pay her back.

200
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,761
Thank you, Asuna.

201
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:35,703
You know, we're all so grateful for what you've done.

202
00:16:37,153 --> 00:16:39,322
I'd been so worried about Yuuki.

203
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:43,768
She was carrying a heavy burden
on those little shoulders of hers,

204
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,961
but then you showed up, and something in her changed.

205
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,492
When you were together,

206
00:16:50,517 --> 00:16:52,847
Yuuki seemed like she was really having fun.

207
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:56,739
She was like a forgetful bird who remembered how to fly,

208
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,607
and she flew up and up, and now she's out of our reach.

209
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,240
Anyway, jun's also doing great.

210
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,517
The medication he's on seems to be working.

211
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:12,783
It's like... I don't know.

212
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,128
To me, it feels like Yuuki's telling all of us

213
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:16,843
it's still too soon to join her.

214
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:19,830
I guess that means it's going to be a while yet

215
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,915
before the sleeping knights get back together.

216
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,977
Just remember, next time, you're taking me in as a member,

217
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,888
and I don't want to hear any arguments.

218
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:29,884
Hey.

219
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,946
I hope we're not interrupting anything.

220
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:36,449
No. But wait.

221
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:38,008
Do you guys know each other?

222
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:38,846
Sort of.

223
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:42,805
He's trying to steal my ideas
about that communications pod I made.

224
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,089
No, he's lying.

225
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:47,504
I'm interested in its possibilities
in full‐dive medical tech,

226
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,235
so we've been e‐mailing back and forth.

227
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:50,950
That's great for both of you.

228
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:53,329
What about the medicuboid?

229
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:56,300
Are you going to phase it out,
or were the trials successful?

230
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:59,249
Glad you asked. They were extremely successful,

231
00:17:59,274 --> 00:18:01,849
and now we have enough data to proceed to the next phase.

232
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,561
Soon, patients all over the country will have...

233
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,611
I am so sorry about that.

234
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,338
I can't believe I didn't say this first.

235
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,550
Ms. An, congratulations on your recovery.

236
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,271
I know Yuuki would be thrilled at the news, too.

237
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,939
Thank you for saying so,

238
00:18:18,328 --> 00:18:20,461
and congratulations on the trials.

239
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:24,509
It's good to know what you learned
from Yuuki will be used to help others.

240
00:18:24,642 --> 00:18:25,973
That makes me happy.

241
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,113
Me, too.

242
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:30,247
Yuuki was the first person to test the medicuboid,

243
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:32,828
and her name will always be remembered.

244
00:18:33,231 --> 00:18:35,816
If she were here, she'd get an award for her help,

245
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:38,749
along with the benefactor who made it all possible.

246
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:42,577
Knowing Yuuki, she wouldn't be
too thrilled at getting an award.

247
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:46,162
She'd say, "what's the point
in having it if I can't eat it?"

248
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:54,831
Um, doctor, you just mentioned the
medicuboid had some kind of benefactor?

249
00:18:55,094 --> 00:18:57,552
I thought you said the government was paying for it.

250
00:18:57,977 --> 00:19:00,082
Oh, well, yes, they are,

251
00:19:00,282 --> 00:19:03,852
but the initial designs were given
to us for free from someone else.

252
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:05,961
If I remember correctly,

253
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:09,295
I think her name was Dr. Rinko Koujiro.

254
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,565
W‐What's wrong, Kirito?

255
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,927
I‐I know her

256
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:18,745
How?

257
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,199
I met her once.

258
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:25,344
Yeah, in fact, she was taking care of
Heathcliff's body while he was diving.

259
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,493
She was his head researcher.

260
00:19:27,595 --> 00:19:30,276
She helped him develop full‐dive technology.

261
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,511
You see? The medicuboid's design,

262
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,986
you know who invented it?

263
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:36,354
No way.

264
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,329
It was Kayaba.

265
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,319
Need any help unpacking all this stuff?

266
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:35,213
Sure, but only if you're not busy.

267
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:37,479
Seriously, ain't she cute?

268
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,227
Uh... Uh...

269
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:39,653
I got you a little gift.

270
00:21:39,718 --> 00:21:41,594
No way. You shouldn't have.

271
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,004
Hey... You guys suck.

272
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,372
Are you having fun hanging out here with everyone?

273
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:46,125
Yes!

274
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,185
And the cherry blossoms are pretty.

275
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,259
Yeah, it's too bad they're almost gone.

276
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:53,017
Oh, please, there's plenty left, you spoilsport.

277
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,153
Anyway, we're here with Yui.

278
00:21:55,221 --> 00:21:56,602
That's the important thing.

279
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:59,364
I still can't believe we made it happen that fast.

280
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:01,263
Thank you so much for this, daddy.

281
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,891
Yeah, Kirito, thank you.

282
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,884
Nah, if you want to thank someone,
thank Yuuki for helping me develop it.

283
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:13,155
Wow!

284
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,443
The real world and the virtual,

285
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:20,266
I thought the closer they came together,

286
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,913
the better the future would be.

287
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,679
Hm?

288
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,433
It's like the more the lines between these worlds blur,

289
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,088
the more everyone gets sucked into its darkness.

290
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:33,229
Yeah, but a lot of people have been helped by it, too.

291
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:35,471
If anything,

292
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:38,199
I wish I knew what Kayaba's master plan was.

293
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:43,220
I don't know. Maybe it's our job
as survivors of "SAO" To find out.

294
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:45,721
I think you're overthinking things.

295
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,050
Yeah, I guess.

296
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:50,173
Still, I wanna find out more than ever now.

297
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,305
Even after everything that's happened,

298
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,187
my curiosity's got me hooked.

299
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,415
Although, a part of me thinks I'm being played here.

300
00:22:57,556 --> 00:22:58,954
That's kind of annoying.

301
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:01,079
Whatever.

302
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,783
I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow.

303
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:08,234
All I know is I wanna be with you forever,

304
00:23:08,483 --> 00:23:10,164
and I want you to be with me.

305
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:14,090
I'll stick by you, even if you
move halfway across the planet.

306
00:23:14,408 --> 00:23:16,227
Who said anything about moving?

307
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:18,562
Don't forget to take me along.

308
00:23:19,384 --> 00:23:21,519
Hey, lovebirds!

309
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,543
Quit makin' out! We wanna take a photo!

310
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:26,634
Get over here, guys! Today, guys!

311
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,220
Hurry up! Move it, dude!

312
00:23:28,689 --> 00:23:30,024
Well, shall we?

313
00:23:30,135 --> 00:23:30,732
Mm‐hmm.

314
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:31,938
Okay, daddy.
