1
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:18,302
These players who think it's all about their agility...

2
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,330
man, they're livin' in a dream.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,563
I mean, sure, firing speed and evasion are important,

4
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,078
and time was, if you rocked those two
things, it's all you needed to be the best.

5
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:29,438
'Til now, that is.

6
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:33,109
Yeah, hate to say it, but it don't work like that anymore.

7
00:00:33,224 --> 00:00:38,353
In fact, I got a message for the folks who spent
the last eight months indoors boosting their AGI.

8
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,370
Sucks to be you right now, don't it?

9
00:00:41,623 --> 00:00:42,536
You suck!

10
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:48,147
Now that's the kind of comment we'd expect
from the top player of "Gun Gale Online,"

11
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:50,623
one of the most challenging VRMMOs!

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,278
Talk about controversial!

13
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:55,281
I guess, but who knows if I'll be on "MMO Stream" again,

14
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,943
so might as well stir things up!

15
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:01,060
Oh, please! So, do you think you have a
shot in the upcoming Bullet of Bullets?

16
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:05,046
Damn right, honey. I wouldn't be in
it if I didn't think I could win it!

17
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,333
It won't be that easy, XeXeeD.

18
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,579
The BOB's a solo tourney, so it's way different.

19
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:15,801
What worked for you up to now,
doesn't mean it'll work again.

20
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:19,277
If I were you, I wouldn't chalk
my wins up to my status type.

21
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:24,445
Yeah, well, if anything, my results
point to some big changes happenin' in "GGO".

22
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:26,710
You're all about AGI, Yamikaze.

23
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,590
Go figure you'd be in denial.

24
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:31,554
Wake up, people!

25
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:36,961
'Til now, the best strategy was boosting your AGI
and shooting a powerful gun as fast as you could,

26
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:38,024
but the reality is,

27
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:41,236
the balance of game play in an MMO is always changing,

28
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:45,561
especially in games like this one, with
levels that don't let you re‐spec your stats.

29
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,291
You have to think ahead and
be smart when using your points,

30
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:53,256
'cause the best weapon in one level
zone, might not work for you in the next.

31
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:55,618
Besides, the new guns comin' out

32
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:59,041
are gonna have higher strength
requirements and accuracy bonuses.

33
00:02:01,897 --> 00:02:05,886
You remember when he was talking
'bout how great bein' an AGI‐type was?

34
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:07,778
That dick totally scammed us.

35
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:16,372
You're nothing but a fake, XeXeeD,

36
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,780
and now you'll face judgment from someone with real power.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,539
All I'm sayin' is

38
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:40,797
what's really important in the
end is the player's ability to...

39
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:51,816
Uh‐oh.

40
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,297
I guess we have a bad connection here.

41
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't worry, folks. I'm sure he'll be back shortly.

42
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,906
Stay tuned for more "MMO Stream."

43
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:06,603
This is real power, real strength!

44
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:11,309
Let your fear carve one name into your brains...

45
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,735
The name I share with this weapon...

46
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,108
Death Gun!

47
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:36,033
December seventh, 2025.

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,158
Has it already been a year?

49
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:52,172
I wonder what the difference is between the real world...

50
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:53,585
And the virtual.

51
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:57,102
The amount of data. That's all.

52
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:01,123
You scared me.

53
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:02,536
Sorry 'bout that.

54
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:03,778
I'm on time, though.

55
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,421
What?

56
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:08,722
No, I'm sorry. I was spacing out.

57
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:09,756
Anyway...

58
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:12,454
Hello, Kirito. How are you doing today?!

59
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,029
It's been good so far, but it's even better now.

60
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:18,677
What are you staring at?

61
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:20,675
Nothing! Just...

62
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,848
That outfit looks good on you.

63
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,332
It brings back a lot of memories.

64
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:26,762
I guess it does.

65
00:04:27,022 --> 00:04:28,687
No rapier, though.

66
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:32,121
Looks like you went overboard on the black today.

67
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:32,870
Yeah!

68
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,267
Sugu threw everything in the wash this morning,

69
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,170
and this is all I had left.

70
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,583
Then stop putting your laundry off.

71
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,620
I can't believe we both dressed in our old colors today.

72
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,161
What are the odds of that?

73
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,771
Well... If we see each other every day for a year, it's...

74
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:52,734
Stop. That was a rhetorical
question, smarty‐pants. Come on.

75
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:54,267
Okay, okay.

76
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,342
I don't know about you,

77
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,674
but I think the Imperial Palace is interesting.

78
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,675
Interesting? What do you mean?

79
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,450
It's two kilometers north to south,

80
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:08,311
1.5 east to west,

81
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,663
and it takes up 20% of Chiyoda ward.

82
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:13,346
There aren't any subways or tunnels under it,

83
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,903
and it's a no‐fly zone.

84
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,610
It's kinda cool, don't you think?

85
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:20,386
I mean, it's this big restricted
area right in the middle of Tokyo.

86
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:23,667
Not only is it cut off from everything physically,

87
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:25,305
but information‐wise as well.

88
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:26,453
See that?

89
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,337
It's a surveillance camera.

90
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:31,667
This place was set up with its very own closed network.

91
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:34,195
You can't even access it from the outside.

92
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:37,261
Wow. That's a weird‐looking camera.

93
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,201
Yeah.

94
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:43,286
Not only is this place the heart of Tokyo,
but it's also an isolated world of its own.

95
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,785
Maybe I'm exaggerating its cool factor.

96
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:47,154
I get like that.

97
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:48,194
You think?

98
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,482
Wow!

99
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,995
This used to be the inner citadel.

100
00:05:58,264 --> 00:05:59,445
Come on! Let's go!

101
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:22,410
Hey, you know that questionnaire they gave
us to fill out, the one about our future plans?

102
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,776
Do you know what you want to do yet?

103
00:06:24,131 --> 00:06:24,766
Hmm.

104
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:29,515
I guess, if anything, I wanna go
from playing games to being a creator.

105
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:30,643
A creator?

106
00:06:31,007 --> 00:06:32,045
What, for games?

107
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:33,769
No, not for games.

108
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,736
I wanna make a human‐machine interface
to replace the full‐dive tech we use now.

109
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,811
I've been goin' to all these
tech forums to learn more about it,

110
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:43,631
but it's a heck of a lot of information to absorb.

111
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,898
After I graduate, all I want is to be with you.

112
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,659
Huh? I‐I mean...

113
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:54,374
I‐I wish we could figure out a way
to live with Yui in this world, too!

114
00:06:54,654 --> 00:06:56,548
We'll be able to live with her someday,

115
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:59,923
as soon as we figure out how to
access augmented reality at will.

116
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:03,446
The only thing standing in the way is
the difference in the amount of data.

117
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,144
Didn't you say something like that a little while ago,

118
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:10,169
that the difference between our world
and the virtual was the amount of data?

119
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:12,095
What does that mean, anyway?

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,559
Let's see. It's like this.

121
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,833
If we were holding hands in "ALO",

122
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:19,370
it wouldn't be the same as in the real world, would it?

123
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,773
No, it wouldn't.

124
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:25,334
You can feel a lot more touching a real hand.

125
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,710
Hey, is that what you mean by the
difference in the amount of data?

126
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:33,846
Yup. And can you imagine what it would be like
if we could reproduce the feel of skin and a pulse?

127
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:37,985
Would we be able to tell the difference
between a real hand and an avatar's hand?

128
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:41,408
I know I could if I was touching your hand.

129
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:44,502
But it's not just touch, is it?

130
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:48,995
I mean, in the real world, we get a lot of
information from how something sounds or tastes.

131
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:53,960
Even if our Amusphere rigs could access
augmented reality, we'd still know the difference.

132
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:58,901
Yeah. The second you saw or touched
something, you'd know if it was real or not.

133
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:03,204
But hopefully someone'll come along
and make a technological breakthrough,

134
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:08,154
and whatever that is, it'll have to
output a ton of sensory data all the time.

135
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:12,822
Then we could break down the wall
between both worlds and be with Yui forever.

136
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,143
Do you think that day will ever come for us?

137
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:15,877
Yeah.

138
00:08:15,977 --> 00:08:18,442
Then get to work and make it happen, 'Kay?

139
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:19,438
Okay.

140
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,424
Welcome, sir.

141
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:44,713
Hey, Kirito!

142
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:45,998
Over here!

143
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,902
Go ahead. Order whatever you want.

144
00:08:56,177 --> 00:08:57,072
It's on me.

145
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:59,662
Thank you, sir. That's very kind of you.

146
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,313
Come on. You don't have to be so formal with me.

147
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,848
Relax, and talk to me like you would in "ALO".

148
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,158
Okay. If you say so.

149
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,514
Then I guess I'll...

150
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:18,132
I'd like the parfait au chocolate,

151
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:22,072
the framboise mille‐feuille, and a hazelnut latte.

152
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,307
Sorry to make you come all the way out here, Kirito.

153
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:29,727
If you're that sorry about it,
why'd you ask me to come to Ginza?

154
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,565
Oh, and do you think you can
not call me by that name in public?

155
00:09:33,888 --> 00:09:35,543
What's with all the attitude?

156
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,245
I thought we were buds.

157
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:40,549
I was the first to visit you in the hospital, remember?

158
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:47,401
He's right. When I came to, the
first one there wasn't my family.

159
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,780
It was the leader of the task force,

160
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:55,918
Seijirou Kikuoka from the Tech Bureau at the
Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications,

161
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,668
AKA the virtual reality section.

162
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:05,388
So what'd you wanna see me about?

163
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:09,049
If it's anything "SAO" related,
I told you everything I know.

164
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,863
Actually, I wanna talk to you about something else.

165
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:15,603
Have a look at that.

166
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:17,985
Who's he?

167
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,450
This won't be pleasant.

168
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,401
So last month, on November the 14th...

169
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:28,335
The landlord of an apartment complex in
Nakano, Tokyo, noticed a foul odor while cleaning.

170
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:30,383
It was coming from one of the units,

171
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,322
so he disabled the lock and discovered this man dead.

172
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:36,722
His name was Tamotsu Shigemura, and he was 26.

173
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,809
He'd been dead for five days.

174
00:10:39,342 --> 00:10:40,381
They found him in bed.

175
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:42,573
His place was a mess, but no signs of burglary.

176
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,147
He had something interesting on his head, though.

177
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,194
An Amusphere?

178
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,665
Yeah. It was ruled an unnatural
death, so they did an autopsy.

179
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:54,795
The cause of death was found to be acute heart failure.

180
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,651
Wait. Heart failure?

181
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,419
You mean his heart stopped?

182
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,195
They find out why?

183
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:01,498
No, they didn't.

184
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,475
Here you are, sir.

185
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:13,001
Unfortunately, since so much time had passed since
his death and foul play was ruled out as the cause,

186
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,916
the autopsy wasn't very thorough.

187
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:19,793
We do know he'd been logged in for two days
straight and hadn't eaten anything the whole time.

188
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:23,796
Well, that's not that unusual. Players do it all the time.

189
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:26,053
Wait. Why are you tellin' me about this?

190
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,409
He had a game installed on his system
called "Gun Gale Online." You know that one?

191
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:31,838
Yeah. "GGO".

192
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:35,070
It's the only MMO in Japan with professional players.

193
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:39,998
This past October, there was a tournament
to decide the most powerful player in "GGO".

194
00:11:40,643 --> 00:11:42,588
The deceased was the guy who won it.

195
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,810
His character's name was XeXeeD.

196
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,191
Was he playing "GGO" when he died?

197
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:54,134
No. When it happened, he was appearing on a
show called "MMO Stream" as XeXeeD's avatar.

198
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,315
We know the time from the logs.

199
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,974
This next bit of info still needs to be confirmed.

200
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,585
According to another player's blog, at
the same time Shigemura had the heart attack,

201
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,859
something strange happened in "GGO".

202
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,303
What?

203
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:12,443
Some players were at a bar in‐game watching
the show, when one of the players stood up

204
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:13,832
and started acting erratically.

205
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:20,341
The blog states the player was shouting stuff
about "judgment" and "power" at XeXeeD's image on the TV

206
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,809
and then fired his gun at it.

207
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:25,953
At the time, another player in the
bar happened to be recording audio.

208
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,278
He uploaded it to a video site.

209
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:32,593
Since the file had a Japan standard time counter embedded,

210
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,388
we know that the shot fired
at the TV and Shigemura's avatar

211
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:39,311
disappearing from the show
happened at about the same time.

212
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:41,782
Probably just coincidence.

213
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,892
There was another death, though.

214
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,836
What?

215
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,633
This one happened on November the 28th

216
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,758
somewhere in Saitama prefecture, same setup as before.

217
00:12:51,946 --> 00:12:53,829
The deceased was found in their apartment.

218
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,813
A guy delivering the newspaper
happened to look in the window.

219
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:59,794
He saw the victim lying in bed wearing an Amusphere rig,

220
00:12:59,901 --> 00:13:00,993
said the smell was...

221
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:02,227
Ahem!

222
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,922
Let's skip the details of the corpse's condition.

223
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:09,000
Anyway, heart failure was the cause of death.

224
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:12,053
The victim was also a top‐ranking "GGO" player.

225
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,803
His character's name was...

226
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:17,222
Usushio Tarako? Well, he was playing when he died.

227
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,917
It happened in the Central Plaza in Glocken.

228
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,896
He was in the middle of a meeting with his "squad."

229
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:25,301
I guess that's the same as a guild.

230
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:29,438
A strange player went up to him and shot him, point‐blank.

231
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,499
Do you know if it was the same guy who shot XeXeeD?

232
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:34,659
Most likely.

233
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,127
He said stuff about judgment and power

234
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,545
and then identified himself with the same character name.

235
00:13:40,293 --> 00:13:41,130
What name?

236
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:43,497
Death Gun.

237
00:13:44,313 --> 00:13:45,705
Death... Gun?

238
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:56,430
Are you absolutely sure both
victims died from heart failure?

239
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:57,434
What do you mean?

240
00:13:58,698 --> 00:14:00,929
Was there any damage to their brains?

241
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:04,204
I was wondering about that, too,

242
00:14:04,396 --> 00:14:09,742
so I asked the coroner if he found any trace of damage to
either of their brains, and he said they were both fine.

243
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:14,242
Besides, the Nervegear rig used high‐output microwaves

244
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:17,324
powerful enough to fry the signal
elements and destroy the brain.

245
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:22,759
On the other hand, the Amusphere rig was designed so
that it couldn't emit electromagnetic waves that powerful.

246
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:25,109
At least, that's what the developers claim.

247
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,217
It sounds like you guys have done your homework,

248
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:32,142
but even so, your story's built
around coincidence and rumors.

249
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,792
True. It could be a coincidence or even a hoax.

250
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,151
I'm not sold either way.

251
00:14:36,393 --> 00:14:39,160
For now, and this is hypothetical, mind you...

252
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:41,610
do you think it's even remotely possible

253
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:46,320
to stop a player's heart in the real
world with virtual bullets from a virtual gun?

254
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,785
No. I don't think so.

255
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,377
But hypothetically let's say this Death Gun

256
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:14,638
did send some kind of killer signal to
XeXeeD and that Tarako guy's Amuspheres.

257
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,978
What would it be?

258
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:19,058
Could the sensation of a touch stop a heart?

259
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:21,219
Maybe a taste or smell,

260
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:22,856
a sight, a sound,

261
00:15:22,995 --> 00:15:24,744
or some other sensation.

262
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:26,906
Huh?

263
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,896
Okay, whoa. You already thought of this, haven't you?

264
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,433
Oh, I get it, you and your team can't figure it out,

265
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,282
so you invite me for coffee to pick my brain?

266
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:41,224
No! What are you talking about? I‐I'd
never do something like that to you, honest.

267
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,859
I like talking to you and just wanted your opinion.

268
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,184
We're done.

269
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,231
You want my opinion, here it is.

270
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:50,750
You can't stop a player's heart in
the real world by actions in‐game.

271
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,619
Shots fired and the heart attacks are coincidences.

272
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,598
Wait! Hold on!

273
00:15:53,623 --> 00:15:55,672
Listen, you can order something else!

274
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:57,327
Just sit down, and hang out for a bit.

275
00:15:58,256 --> 00:15:58,985
Please.

276
00:16:00,057 --> 00:16:02,815
I can't tell you how relieved I
am to hear you put it into words.

277
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,573
Fact is, I'm of the same opinion as you.

278
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:09,605
I don't believe these two deaths
were caused by in‐game gunshots either.

279
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,819
And now that we've talked, I want to ask you officially.

280
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:18,289
Would you log in to "Gun Gale Online" and make
contact with the player calling himself Death Gun?

281
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,637
And once I do find the guy, then what?

282
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:23,823
You want me to get shot? Is that it?

283
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,926
Whoa, now. Come on. Well, screw that!

284
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,284
I don't wanna get killed!

285
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:29,643
That's not possible!

286
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,670
We just agreed it wasn't, didn't we?!

287
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:35,567
Besides, this Death Gun guy is
only going after specific targets!

288
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,150
They have to meet his criteria!

289
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,837
Criteria? Uh‐huh!

290
00:16:40,113 --> 00:16:41,193
Here's the deal.

291
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:45,859
XeXeeD and Usushio Tarako weren't just
any old players. They were top ranked,

292
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:49,065
so it's safe to assume he's not interested in newbies.

293
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,870
But if you were strong enough to
beat Kayaba at his own game, then...

294
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:52,717
That's different!

295
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:54,191
Look, I don't know what you've heard,

296
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,985
but "GGO" is no walk in the park!

297
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,404
It's filled with pro gamers!

298
00:16:57,429 --> 00:16:58,268
Hold the phone!

299
00:16:58,322 --> 00:17:00,715
You said, "pro gamer." What does that mean, "pro"?

300
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,456
It means professional, literally.

301
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:09,696
"Gun Gale Online" is the only virtual MMO with a
game‐coin to real‐currency conversion system in place.

302
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:10,723
What?

303
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:15,879
It means whatever money you earn in the game gets
paid back to you in cold, hard cash in the real world.

304
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:20,690
Bein' a pro means you have a constant stream
of income from the game comin' in every month,

305
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:24,994
and if you're a top player, that means
monthly you're making two to three hundred thou.

306
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:27,499
It's an awesome gig.

307
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,821
That's why the high‐level guys in "GGO" are so hardcore.

308
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:34,634
They pour more time and passion
into it than players from other MMOs.

309
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:39,562
Someone like me can't just log in and match
players like that. You should find someone else...

310
00:17:39,587 --> 00:17:40,954
Whoa, hold it! Hold it!

311
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:42,884
Who else am I gonna find? You're it!

312
00:17:42,986 --> 00:17:44,965
I need your help in this investigation,

313
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,565
and if taking these pros on
is going to be that big a deal,

314
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,667
I can pay you this much.

315
00:17:51,621 --> 00:17:53,865
I don't get why you're so hung up on this.

316
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,665
You find horror stories like these all the time online.

317
00:17:57,591 --> 00:17:58,722
Yeah, I know.

318
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,963
But still, it's got my bosses worried.

319
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:05,391
The effect of full‐dive technology on
the real world is the hottest topic today.

320
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,794
Literally everyone's researching it.

321
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,725
People are going to try to use these
deaths to regulate the technology.

322
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:14,357
We want to know the facts before that happens.

323
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:15,895
We want to be sure.

324
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,343
That's why we're interested.

325
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,700
You guys could just go directly to the admins about it.

326
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,703
Right, but ZASKAR,

327
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:26,852
the company that developed and hosts "GGO", is in the US.

328
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,272
Their address, phone number, and email,

329
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:32,175
none of it's been made public, so we can't contact them.

330
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,007
Ever since the seed was released,

331
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,633
all kinds of shady VR worlds have popped up.

332
00:18:37,852 --> 00:18:38,644
Yeah.

333
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,410
Maybe they're legit,

334
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,135
maybe they're not, but if we want to find anything out,

335
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,302
the only way to do it is to
try contacting them in the game.

336
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,313
I'm not asking you to get shot.

337
00:18:48,598 --> 00:18:50,844
We'll take whatever safety precautions we have to.

338
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:54,134
Just evaluate the situation, and report back.

339
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:56,099
So will you help us, or what?

340
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:01,454
Four thousand people...

341
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:03,360
Died in Aincrad.

342
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,292
It's been a year,

343
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,362
and finally those memories are starting to fade.

344
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:13,601
But now more people are dying in another virtual world,

345
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,721
and I'm getting pulled back in.

346
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,362
It's like someone doesn't want me to ever forget.

347
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,693
Ohh. Now I get it.

348
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:30,071
I think I figured out why you brought me here today.

349
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:31,929
Oh. You did, huh?

350
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:32,736
Mm‐hmm.

351
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:36,378
If our world is made up of an axis called time

352
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:42,111
and a plane called space, then the center of
our reality is this place in the heart of Tokyo

353
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,076
where a castle used to stand.

354
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:47,755
And the axis of all the virtual worlds popping up now,

355
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:50,699
thanks to the seed, is a place
that also had a castle once,

356
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:51,772
Aincrad.

357
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,272
That's why this sunset feels so nostalgic now.

358
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,932
You're right. It does.

359
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,462
You know, what you just said
helped me figure something out, too.

360
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:04,702
Huh? Really?

361
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,135
You remember what Aincrad looked like?

362
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:12,540
Well, maybe its shape was supposed to
represent the axis of time and the plane of space.

363
00:20:12,805 --> 00:20:17,736
Maybe, but if its vertical axis
represented time and its floors space,

364
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,297
then the commander made a world that tapered to nothing.

365
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,494
Everything ended once you reached the top.

366
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,113
Unfortunately, a certain someone destroyed it halfway up.

367
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,210
Now we'll never know how it ended.

368
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:30,920
Yes, ma'am! Sorry about that, ma'am!

369
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,540
Asuna, listen. I...

370
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:40,514
What?

371
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,806
Nah. Hey, it's gettin' cold.

372
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:46,228
You wanna start headin' back now?

373
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:49,912
Mm‐hmm. Oh, and next time we come,
let's bring Liz and Leafa and the others.

374
00:20:50,037 --> 00:20:52,856
Wouldn't it be fun to get
everyone together for a picnic here?

375
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,536
Yeah, it would, especially in springtime.

376
00:21:10,932 --> 00:21:11,792
I'm in position.

377
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:12,602
Roger.

378
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:15,630
Targets haven't changed their course or their speed.

379
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,068
They're four hundred meters from you,

380
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:19,475
fifteen hundred from me.

381
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:21,899
Pretty far. Can you make the shot?

382
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:23,509
No sweat.

383
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,462
Okay, then. Fire when ready.

384
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:27,110
I'm counting on you, Sinon.

385
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:28,303
Roger.

386
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:33,991
This pressure...

387
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:35,844
This anxiety...

388
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:37,682
This fear.

389
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:40,535
Fifteen hundred meters?

390
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,681
That's nothing,

391
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:44,497
like tossing a wad of paper into a trash can.

392
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:47,085
No way.

393
00:21:47,994 --> 00:21:50,636
This is nothing like how it felt that day.

394
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,037
Next.

395
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,659
Next time: "Cold-Hearted Sniper".
