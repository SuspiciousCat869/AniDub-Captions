1
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:06,583
Kazuto!

2
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:12,335
Okay, what's with that goofy grin?

3
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:13,592
Well...

4
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:18,042
This morning, I just so happened
to see an interesting article.

5
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,283
And then I noticed that.

6
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:22,283
Oh.

7
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:26,779
Wow, what are the odds? Someone's got a similar handle.

8
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:28,896
Yeah, except this isn't similar.

9
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,507
It's exactly the same.

10
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:32,217
If you're gonna put it that way,

11
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:33,564
then, yeah, I guess.

12
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:36,765
Although that name's not really that unusual.

13
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:39,114
I mean, mine's an abbreviation.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,762
Maybe the Kirito in GGO's name is Kiri...

15
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,211
Kirigamine. Yeah, Touguro Kirigamine or something.

16
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:52,367
Better eat up, or it's gonna get cold.

17
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,160
Who is he?

18
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:39,346
He's gotta be one of the survivors from "SAO".

19
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:41,823
And that's not all.

20
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:44,526
We must have fought at some point,

21
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:47,457
and I bet we were trying to kill each other.

22
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:51,320
Kazuto.

23
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:54,709
You're making that scary face again.

24
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,754
I hope it's not scarier than usual.

25
00:02:58,434 --> 00:03:01,113
Look, I already know everything.

26
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,723
I know you converted Kirito from "ALO" to "GGO",

27
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,853
so just drop the act already, okay?

28
00:03:07,997 --> 00:03:08,719
Come on.

29
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:12,929
Did you honestly think I wouldn't notice
when you suddenly vanished from my friend list?

30
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,969
I didn't think you checked that thing every five minutes.

31
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:17,912
I don't. I just knew.

32
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:22,211
Last night, I got this weird feeling and checked my list.

33
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,964
When I saw you weren't on it,

34
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,741
I headed over to your room and
was about to bust the door down.

35
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:30,602
I didn't, 'cause I knew it'd
piss you off something fierce.

36
00:03:30,682 --> 00:03:33,599
I also knew you'd never quit "ALO" Without telling me.

37
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:38,961
I figured you must have a good reason, so I
called Asuna up to see if she knew anything.

38
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:40,683
You did?

39
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:41,582
Huh.

40
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:44,109
Sorry.

41
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,015
I hope I'm not calling you too late.

42
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,417
It's okay. I wasn't sleeping.

43
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,416
Besides, I...

44
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:51,978
Never mind.

45
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:55,925
Honestly. You started to say
something, so just go ahead and say it.

46
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,219
I guess...

47
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,611
I guess I was just thinking about how...

48
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,926
I'd like to hear your voice.

49
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:04,336
That wasn't so hard.

50
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:09,499
What's wrong?

51
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:11,884
Nothing's wrong. Long day.

52
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,111
Did something happen in the game you converted over to?

53
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,324
N‐Nothing happened.

54
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,444
It's just...

55
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:24,588
If the new job's overloading you, I could help.

56
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:26,015
Thanks for offering.

57
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:28,005
I got it, though.

58
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:31,653
Besides, if you converted over, you would get lonely.

59
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,836
Are you sure you're all right?

60
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:36,483
Yeah. I'll be back before you know it.

61
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:39,006
If you need me, call, okay?

62
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:39,917
Will do.

63
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:41,869
Good night.

64
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:43,329
Good night.

65
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:50,461
I can't drag Asuna into this.

66
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:55,092
That guy's sure to show up in BOB's main tournament.

67
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,681
I have to end this.

68
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:01,324
This is my problem, not hers.

69
00:05:03,365 --> 00:05:04,468
Kazuto.

70
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,137
Know what Asuna told me?

71
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,286
She said not to worry,

72
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,876
'cause once you tore up "GGO", you'd be back.

73
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:15,421
She didn't say it,

74
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:17,835
but I knew she was really worried about you.

75
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,870
That makes two of us.

76
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:24,562
Last night, you got home so
late, and when I saw your face,

77
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:27,810
I wanted to say something,
'cause you looked all freaked out.

78
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:30,180
I did? Sorry.

79
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,289
I hope you're not doing anything crazy,

80
00:05:33,404 --> 00:05:34,652
because if you are,

81
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:37,100
I couldn't bear it if something happened to you.

82
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:41,546
I'm gonna be fine. I promise.

83
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:45,746
Tonight's the last night of GGO's
tourney, and after that, I'll be back

84
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:48,832
to "ALO" and here.

85
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,920
I'll be back, no matter what, so don't worry, okay?

86
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:54,973
'Kay.

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,584
Oh, I almost forgot.

88
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:03,290
What?

89
00:06:03,686 --> 00:06:05,209
When I was talking to Asuna,

90
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:09,451
she just so happened to tell me that you're
gonna get a huge check from this new gig.

91
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,922
That's right, and when I get back,

92
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,574
I'll treat you to something cool.

93
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:16,901
Seriously? In that case,

94
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,476
there's this awesome new
nanocarbon shinai I've had my eye on.

95
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:22,118
Oh. Okay.

96
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:24,375
Sure. You got it.

97
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:27,203
That dumb‐ass.

98
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:31,713
He pisses me off.

99
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,619
I'm so mad, I could kill him.

100
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,742
Take it easy, Asada.

101
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:40,353
I know you're upset,

102
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:42,774
but it's weird to see you this worked up.

103
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,086
You saw him.

104
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:47,346
He's obnoxious, he's cocky, and he's a dirty liar.

105
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:53,014
He thinks he's such a big shot fighting
with a sword in "GGO" of all places.

106
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,443
He tricked me into thinking he was a
girl and had me take him to the gun market.

107
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,463
I even helped him pick out his gear.

108
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,983
He thinks I'm an idiot.

109
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,561
Oh, man!

110
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:04,741
Really pisses me off.

111
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,491
What's that look for?

112
00:07:07,993 --> 00:07:09,932
Nothing. I mean, it's just that,

113
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,999
like, you're acting kind of strange.

114
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,856
I don't think you've ever talked
this much about someone else before.

115
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:17,684
You're kidding. Really?

116
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:21,316
Yeah. I mean, you don't usually let people get to you,

117
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,361
you know, like this.

118
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,810
I get like this when people push my buttons.

119
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:28,881
Yeah, I guess you do.

120
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:30,384
I know.

121
00:07:30,415 --> 00:07:32,858
How 'bout we find a field in the game and ambush him?

122
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:33,539
Huh?

123
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,372
Yeah. I can lure him out, and then you can snipe him.

124
00:07:36,872 --> 00:07:40,244
Although, if you want to get him back,
you probably want to take him head‐on.

125
00:07:40,382 --> 00:07:44,203
Either way, I know I can find a couple
machine gunners to back you up if you want.

126
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:46,560
Thank you, but mm‐mm.

127
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:48,537
I had something else in mind.

128
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:51,927
It's like, yeah, he pisses me off,

129
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:55,302
but when he fights, at least he seems honorable about it.

130
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:59,087
Unless I beat him fair and square, it won't mean anything.

131
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:04,879
And in today's final, I'm gonna blow a hole through
that dumb avatar of his if it's the last thing I do.

132
00:08:05,748 --> 00:08:07,625
Would you mind surrendering, then?

133
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,966
I'm not a big fan of slashing at girls.

134
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:15,945
Just you wait.

135
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:19,917
I swear I'm gonna pay you back
double for what you did to me.

136
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:25,897
What? What's wrong?

137
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,279
Nothing. It's just that...

138
00:08:28,603 --> 00:08:29,949
You see what you're doing?

139
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:30,581
Huh?

140
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,888
Wow. I didn't even notice.

141
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,138
I guess it didn't bother me, 'cause I was so mad.

142
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:39,176
Oh.

143
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,039
Asada...

144
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,244
W‐Wait. What are you doing?

145
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:47,397
What's the matter?

146
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:49,972
I'm worried about you. That's what.

147
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,509
You're not acting like your usual self today.

148
00:08:53,906 --> 00:08:54,759
Oh.

149
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,565
W‐What do you mean? How do I usually act?

150
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,967
As long as I've known you,

151
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,050
you've been cool, calm, and levelheaded.

152
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:06,552
Nothing gets to you.

153
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,029
You've got the same problems at school as me,

154
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,373
but you didn't run away like I did.

155
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:14,114
You're, like, really strong.

156
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,082
But I‐I'm not strong at all.

157
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,235
You know that.

158
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:21,226
I get freaked out whenever I see a gun.

159
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,931
But Sinon doesn't.

160
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:25,777
She's got that amazing rifle and knows how to use it.

161
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:30,054
If you ask me, that's who you really are,

162
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,814
and I know, one day,

163
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:34,084
you'll be like that in real life, too.

164
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:38,261
That's why when you go ballistic over that guy,

165
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,849
I start to worry.

166
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,510
When I see you lose it like that,

167
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,292
I want to help you.

168
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:46,634
I'd do anything to help you!

169
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:49,624
I remember...

170
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:52,392
I used to be normal once.

171
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,026
I laughed and cried just like anyone else.

172
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:02,439
I didn't become who I am now because I wanted to.

173
00:10:09,107 --> 00:10:10,135
Asada.

174
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:18,457
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:21,594
I really appreciate you wanting to help me,

176
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:24,713
especially since you're the only one in the city

177
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,862
who really understands what I'm going through.

178
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,175
But I...

179
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,652
I'm just not ready to be anyone's girlfriend yet.

180
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:36,885
Besides, I can't really fix what's
bothering me unless I do it on my own.

181
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,597
I see.

182
00:10:40,018 --> 00:10:41,026
Until then,

183
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:43,025
do you think you could wait for me?

184
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,747
Thank you.

185
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,504
With that name

186
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:22,367
and your sword skills,

187
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,622
are you the Real Deal or what?

188
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:28,081
Are you Kirito?

189
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,169
Are you Kirito?

190
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:32,064
Are you Kirito?

191
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:34,542
Are you Kirito?!

192
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:55,413
What's the matter, kiddo?

193
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,857
You look like you've seen a ghost.

194
00:11:57,882 --> 00:11:59,772
Oh. N‐No.

195
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:00,876
It's nothing.

196
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:05,524
You got a super‐hot nurse sitting here, offering
free counseling, and you're gonna pass it up?

197
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,887
Come on. Tell me what's bothering you.

198
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,673
Well, since you put it that way,

199
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,714
I guess I don't really have a choice, do I?

200
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,230
Um...

201
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,603
Before you came to the rehab unit,

202
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:21,390
you were in trauma, right?

203
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:22,807
That I was.

204
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,879
I've got a personal question,

205
00:12:26,206 --> 00:12:28,868
and if you don't want to answer, I totally understand.

206
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,051
Of all the patients you've cared for,

207
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,422
can you remember the ones who died?

208
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:36,308
Let's see.

209
00:12:36,685 --> 00:12:38,349
I guess if I think about it,

210
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:41,084
I can recall their faces and names,

211
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:45,314
even patients I only spent an hour or so with in the OR.

212
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,004
Mm‐hmm. I remember.

213
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:52,154
Do you ever wish you could just forget about those people?

214
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:54,731
Hmm. That's a tough one.

215
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:58,497
Not sure if this is an answer, but it's the best I got.

216
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:02,067
I guess I think if something's meant to be forgotten,

217
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,146
a person'll end up forgetting it

218
00:13:04,963 --> 00:13:06,963
without even thinking they want to.

219
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,627
That said,

220
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,679
the more a person wishes they could forget something,

221
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,657
the stronger the memory becomes,

222
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,720
till they can't stop thinking about it.

223
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:17,913
And if that's the case,

224
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:20,848
then maybe subconsciously, whatever the memory is,

225
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,299
it's something that shouldn't be forgotten.

226
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:26,410
Then if I forgot,

227
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,952
I must be a monster.

228
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:33,586
When I was stuck in "SAO,"

229
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,886
I took out...

230
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,952
no, I killed three people.

231
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:40,775
They were all red players,

232
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:43,247
so murder was their business,

233
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:46,629
and I could have overpowered
them instead of killing them, but...

234
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:49,682
I went ahead and killed them anyway.

235
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:53,822
I did it out of rage, hatred, revenge.

236
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,993
And over the past year,

237
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,492
I've totally forgotten all about those people.

238
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,061
Even as I sit here talking about it,

239
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:06,359
I can't remember what two of 'em
looked like or what their names were.

240
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:08,312
How's that possible?

241
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,775
If I can forget people I killed,

242
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,186
what's that say about me as a person?

243
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,416
I'm sorry, Kirigaya.

244
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,207
I guess I'm not the awesome counselor I thought I was.

245
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,582
I wish I could take away the burden you're carrying

246
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,838
or at least help share the load of it.

247
00:14:32,745 --> 00:14:33,800
What do I know?

248
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:36,337
I've never even played "Sword Art Online."

249
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,315
When you say you killed someone,

250
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,015
I don't even know what that means,

251
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,879
but there's one thing I know.

252
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:45,643
When all's said and done,

253
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:47,589
the reason you did what you did

254
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,632
was to save someone else, wasn't it?

255
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,727
In the medical field,

256
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,964
sometimes we have to choose who to save.

257
00:14:55,841 --> 00:14:58,706
It doesn't make the decision
to let someone die any easier,

258
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:02,083
but still, in a life‐or‐death situation,

259
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:05,214
everyone's got the right to
consider the people they can save

260
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,320
over those they can't,

261
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,301
even you.

262
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:12,074
Just think about the lives of all the people you saved,

263
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:14,496
and you'll make peace with your decision.

264
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:16,693
I don't know.

265
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:18,797
I want to believe you, but...

266
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,697
I can't. I killed people.

267
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:25,606
I killed 'em, and I can't even remember who they were!

268
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:26,951
Don't you get it?

269
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,556
It's like I don't even care that they're dead.

270
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,235
I don't deserve to find any peace!

271
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:39,264
If you didn't care about what you
did, you wouldn't be suffering like this.

272
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,209
Deep down, you remember.

273
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,936
And when the time's right,

274
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,488
it'll all come back to you.

275
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,743
When it does... and it will...

276
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,762
just make sure you remember

277
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:04,803
all the people who are alive today
because you were there to protect them.

278
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:11,904
If you need me, call, okay?

279
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:29,933
Um...

280
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:31,644
Thank you,

281
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:34,153
you know, for the pep talk.

282
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,397
Sure. Glad I could help.

283
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:40,698
I don't think anything'll happen till after 8:00.

284
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:43,170
I should be out by 10:00 at the latest.

285
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:47,300
Well, here I go.

286
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:48,222
Okeydoke.

287
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,644
Bon voyage, you super stud, you.

288
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:55,133
Link start.

289
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:07,916
Asada.

290
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:15,145
Okay.

291
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,450
I'm gonna fight hard,

292
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,001
and I will beat him.

293
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,177
Link start.

294
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:43,698
Incoming!

295
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:46,713
Oh, my gosh!

296
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,250
Klein, are you okay?

297
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:52,887
Come on, guys.

298
00:17:53,091 --> 00:17:55,479
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

299
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,314
He's being extra manly today.

300
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:58,864
Yeah, tell me about it.

301
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:00,384
Hang on, Klein. We're coming.

302
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:01,874
Take your time, ladies.

303
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,448
Oh, crap!

304
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:10,955
Poison gas!

305
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:13,783
Hold your breath!

306
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:17,092
Asuna!

307
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,865
Hey, Asuna...

308
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:22,691
Need a hand here.

309
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:27,281
Alfheim to Asuna!

310
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:31,756
Soo filla hail oustroo.

311
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,256
I'm sorry, guys.

312
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,155
I didn't mean to space out like that.

313
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:50,823
Nah, it's all good.

314
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:52,335
No harm, no foul, right?

315
00:18:52,408 --> 00:18:54,613
Yeah. Today's your boy's big day.

316
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:56,668
That's right, Kirito's tournament.

317
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:57,948
It's gonna start soon.

318
00:18:58,356 --> 00:18:59,511
I don't know about you guys,

319
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:00,789
but I say we quit early

320
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:02,635
and get over to our room to watch it.

321
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:05,887
I say we use the cash we scored
today to buy beer and snacks.

322
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:09,275
Do you honestly think we're gonna
let you blow all our money on food?

323
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:12,199
Don't you worry, mommy.

324
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:15,043
Daddy's gonna win today. You'll see.

325
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:17,095
Sure he will.

326
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,650
No matter where he goes,

327
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,945
Kirito knows how to handle himself.

328
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:26,371
Hey, guys, we don't want to miss the first match.

329
00:19:26,422 --> 00:19:28,573
So let's start heading over to Yggdrasil city.

330
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,584
Okay.

331
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:42,550
Huh?

332
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:50,147
Come on, folks. Place your bets.

333
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:58,878
Sinon!

334
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,242
Hey, Spiegel.

335
00:20:04,152 --> 00:20:05,190
It's almost time.

336
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,536
I believe in you.

337
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,180
I know you're gonna win this thing.

338
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:12,883
Thanks.

339
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:15,412
So what are you gonna do?

340
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:18,182
Well, I thought I'd find a bar somewhere

341
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,706
and watch the feed from there.

342
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:23,705
Cool. I'll track you down after
this, and we can toast my victory

343
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:25,340
or cry in our beers.

344
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:28,692
Sinon...

345
00:20:29,386 --> 00:20:31,005
I mean Asada...

346
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,558
Yeah? What's up?

347
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:35,323
I was wondering if you meant what you said earlier.

348
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,189
What did I say?

349
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:40,087
You asked me to wait for you, remember?

350
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:43,210
After you won this thing and conquered your fears, we...

351
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,478
then maybe we could go out and stuff.

352
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:46,245
What the...

353
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,373
you're bringing this up now?

354
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:50,041
It's just that...

355
00:20:50,198 --> 00:20:52,283
I care about you so much, Asada.

356
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:56,539
Don't do this now.

357
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,134
I have to focus on the tournament.

358
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:04,255
I'm sorry, but I don't have a chance of
winning unless I put everything I've got into it.

359
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:06,900
Right.

360
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:08,387
I understand.

361
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:12,261
Even so, I believe in you,

362
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:13,988
and I'll wait till you're ready.

363
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,989
Okay.

364
00:21:16,784 --> 00:21:19,357
Well, uh, I better go get ready now.

365
00:21:19,817 --> 00:21:20,603
See ya.

366
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,244
I'll be rooting for you.

367
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:25,144
Good luck.

368
00:21:37,943 --> 00:21:39,333
Whoa.

369
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,324
I won't lose today.

370
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,892
I won't either.

371
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,660
Next time: "Bullet of Bullets".
