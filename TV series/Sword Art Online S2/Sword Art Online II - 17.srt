1
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:13,505
Punches incoming, two in a row!

2
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:42,442
His ice breath is next!

3
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,135
Coming up in three,

4
00:00:48,227 --> 00:00:50,761
two, one, now!

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,171
Now it's our turn!

6
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,887
Attack pattern's changing! Stay sharp!

7
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,687
Oh, my god. Kazuto!

8
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,648
There's only three clear spots left.

9
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:16,878
Can't you use that skill
connector thingie you used before?

10
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,942
He's still got two bars left on his HP gauge.

11
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,392
Skill connect won't even put a dent in it.

12
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,948
Watch out! Ice breath coming up!

13
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:41,573
Oh, no. The buff!

14
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:43,255
Kazuto, wa...

15
00:04:12,247 --> 00:04:13,472
Get out of there!

16
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,534
Sinon, keep him busy for a few!

17
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:38,612
Eh?

18
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,415
Swordsman,

19
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:45,515
if we continue this course of
action, we will not defeat Thrmyr.

20
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,372
There is but one hope now.

21
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,380
Somewhere in this room, hidden in the plunder,

22
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:52,701
you will find the treasure of my people.

23
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:53,728
I'm on it.

24
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:55,729
Tell me what it looks like, and I'll grab it.

25
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,060
It is about yea big.

26
00:04:58,376 --> 00:05:00,115
It is a hammer made of gold.

27
00:05:00,452 --> 00:05:02,033
Wait. It's a hammer?

28
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:12,319
Hey, Kazuto,

29
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,512
you can find it using a lightning skill.

30
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,718
Lightning? Really?

31
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,300
There it is.

32
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:52,621
Freyja, catch!

33
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:04,324
It flows into me.

34
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:05,742
Huh?

35
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:07,823
F‐Freyja?

36
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:12,357
Through me,

37
00:06:12,495 --> 00:06:15,001
it overflows.

38
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,963
Freyja? Uh...

39
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:33,077
She's a...

40
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:35,892
A frigging dude?!

41
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,615
Oh, he's Thor, the god of thunder.

42
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:47,587
Hmm?

43
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:53,604
You despicable giant,

44
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,632
your treachery and deceit has come to an end,

45
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,032
and now you shall pay for stealing Mjolnir!

46
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:12,009
I shall make you pay for deceiving
me, you miserable excuse of a god.

47
00:07:12,128 --> 00:07:14,832
I shall rip that beard from your face

48
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,849
and send your body back to Asgard!

49
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,329
Thor's pulling aggro from Thrmyr.

50
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:21,930
Let's attack while we can.

51
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:24,742
Here we go, guys! Hit him hard!

52
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,141
Don't hold back! Use all your sword skills!

53
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,188
Freyja!

54
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,138
Yaah!

55
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:05,937
This is it!

56
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,152
Return to your abyss, king of the giants!

57
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,988
Revel in your victory, insects,

58
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,359
but take heed.

59
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:49,524
If you put your faith in the dogs of aesir...

60
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:06,209
You have my gratitude, brave faerie warriors.

61
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:11,312
Thanks to you, my treasure has
been returned and my disgrace avenged.

62
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,330
Now then, I must reward you.

63
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,539
That is Mjolnir, the lightning hammer.

64
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,745
Use it in noble battles.

65
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:28,600
Farewell, my champions.

66
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:49,469
Congrats, pal.

67
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:51,213
You've got a legendary weapon.

68
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,761
Yeah, but it's a hammer.

69
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,725
I don't got no hammer skills.

70
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:04,802
The... the room's moving.

71
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:07,603
Wait. Is it floating?

72
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,420
Hey, Kazuto,

73
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,008
I don't think this quest is over yet.

74
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,668
Huh?

75
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:18,142
Good faeries, infiltrate Thrymheim,

76
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,166
remove Excalibur from its plinth,

77
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,807
and save my realm.

78
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:23,051
Look at the medallion.

79
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:25,520
It's all black except for that one clear spot.

80
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:31,200
Daddy, a stairway leading down
has just appeared behind the throne.

81
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:32,340
Seriously?

82
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:43,232
Let's go.

83
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,061
System command, generate object!

84
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,131
ID, Excalibur!

85
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:09,678
Long time, no see.

86
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:18,899
You got it, Kirito!

87
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:20,347
Come on! Pull harder!

88
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:21,644
Put your back into it!

89
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:24,618
Don't give up, daddy!

90
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,020
You can do it! I know you can do it!

91
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,432
Go! Keep pulling!

92
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:57,335
Aw, crap.

93
00:11:57,525 --> 00:11:58,962
It's breaking up.

94
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:07,117
Daddy, Thrymheim is collapsing.

95
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:08,801
We have to leave here now.

96
00:12:08,826 --> 00:12:10,094
I know. I know.

97
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,905
Heh. All right.

98
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,280
Looks like it's up to me to save the day.

99
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,469
Time for some olympic‐grade high jumping.

100
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:28,306
Ow!

101
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,438
We're so screwed.

102
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:55,411
Leafa, how much time we got?

103
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:57,540
We made it.

104
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,237
Thank god. We made it!

105
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,204
Yeah.

106
00:13:07,014 --> 00:13:11,253
Looks like I can't claim Excalibur
unless the quest is cleared.

107
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:17,028
Did you hear that?

108
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:17,498
Huh?

109
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:22,070
There it is again.

110
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:29,748
Tonky!

111
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:33,407
We're saved!

112
00:13:33,865 --> 00:13:35,937
Hurry, guys. Hop on his back.

113
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:42,792
We're running out of time.

114
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:44,092
Yeah, I know!

115
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:48,249
Wish it wasn't so high up.

116
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,897
Go on. Jump!

117
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,949
Huh?

118
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,817
Hey, Tonky.

119
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:58,828
Thanks for saving my ass.

120
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,964
I guess you're still too heavy for me.

121
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:08,665
Daddy?

122
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,252
Seriously, stupid cardinal system.

123
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,795
That's about 200 meters.

124
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,459
Huh?

125
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,114
Uh...

126
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:47,995
Uh...

127
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:57,900
Ecku, skeata, aftol, ale.

128
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:05,352
You gotta be kidding.

129
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,845
Whoa. Heavy.

130
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:18,173
S‐S‐S...

131
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,357
Sinon, that was awesome!

132
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,172
Don't look at me like that.

133
00:15:26,252 --> 00:15:28,425
You can have it. Here.

134
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:31,383
Thanks. You're the best. Uh...

135
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:34,080
I'll give it to you, but with one condition.

136
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,216
You gotta promise me...

137
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:41,541
Every time you draw it, you have to think about me, okay?

138
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:43,791
Uh...

139
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:47,059
Well, well,

140
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,953
the chick magnet's got another girl...

141
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,305
uhh!

142
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:53,889
You got it.

143
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:56,110
I'll think about you every time I draw it.

144
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,191
Thanks a lot.

145
00:15:57,455 --> 00:15:58,886
You're more than welcome.

146
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:15,008
Man, this sucks.

147
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:18,350
We only got to do one quest in
it, and now it's gone for good.

148
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,818
I know. It seems like such a waste.

149
00:17:10,942 --> 00:17:13,068
Look at that. It's sprouting.

150
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,876
So warm.

151
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,801
He's happy.

152
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,878
I'm happy, too.

153
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:23,073
Isn't this great, Tonky?

154
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:26,746
Look, all your friends have come to say hi.

155
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,126
You see 'em? They're all waving.

156
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:31,051
You're a popular guy.

157
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:34,267
Eh?

158
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:39,112
You removed Excalibur from its plinth.

159
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:41,681
The quest has been completed.

160
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,524
Now that the sword which slices wood and iron is secure,

161
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:48,621
Jotunheim can return to its former glory.

162
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,678
It is all thanks to you and your bravery.

163
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:56,938
My younger sisters would also like
to express their gratitude towards you.

164
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:02,926
My name is Verdandi.

165
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,121
Thank you, all brave faerie warriors.

166
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,588
To think I can gaze upon a green Jotunheim again,

167
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,698
oh, it's like a dream.

168
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:22,908
And my name is Skuld.

169
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,628
You have my thanks and respect.

170
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,468
My gift to you shall be the holy sword.

171
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:48,363
Yes.

172
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,740
Thank you, noble faeries,

173
00:19:52,036 --> 00:19:53,517
until we meet again.

174
00:19:55,812 --> 00:19:57,281
We finally cleared it.

175
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,474
Um, 'scuse me,

176
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:11,514
lady Skuld,

177
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,207
can I get your number?!

178
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:43,933
Heh heh.

179
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:47,814
Right now, I respect you more than ever, Klein.

180
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,669
You can be a dork, but you got heart.

181
00:20:58,428 --> 00:20:59,538
How's that, Yui?

182
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:03,528
I can see perfectly, daddy, and I can hear, too.

183
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,672
Cool, but what is it?

184
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:10,115
I'm turning real‐time footage
of the cafe into mock‐3D images.

185
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,534
Okay, try moving, but take it slow.

186
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:13,985
Okay.

187
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,293
If it's working right,

188
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:22,613
Yui should feel like she's flying around the room.

189
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:28,063
I get it. That camera and its mic
are acting like Yui's eyes and ears.

190
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,113
Gotta hand it to you, that's pretty clever.

191
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,555
Kazuto's taking a class called mecho...

192
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:33,745
mecha‐something.

193
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,243
It's mechatronics.

194
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:38,289
Like I was saying, he's taking this mecha‐thing class.

195
00:21:38,392 --> 00:21:41,012
He has to do a project, so he came up with this idea.

196
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:43,460
But if you ask me, he's just doing it for Yui.

197
00:21:43,505 --> 00:21:45,132
You're spoiling me, daddy.

198
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,955
Hmm? Eh?

199
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:56,560
Nice job, guys.

200
00:21:56,594 --> 00:22:00,286
We got the holy sword Excalibur
and Mjolnir, the lightning hammer.

201
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,426
Congrats.

202
00:22:01,477 --> 00:22:02,788
To 2025.

203
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,108
To us.

204
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:05,328
To us!

205
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,936
Hey, I was wondering,

206
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:11,450
why did they call it Excalibur in the game?

207
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:12,057
Huh?

208
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:13,266
What do you mean, why?

209
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:18,993
Well, usually in the fantasy books and comics
I've read, it's always called Caliburn, not Excalibur.

210
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:20,706
Oh. I don't know.

211
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:24,744
No way. You don't seem like someone
who'd be a fan of fantasy books.

212
00:22:25,848 --> 00:22:28,949
When I was in middle school, I
pretty much lived at the library.

213
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:32,220
I spent all my time there reading books about king Arthur.

214
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:34,668
Every one of 'em referred to it as Caliburn.

215
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:39,212
Actually, didn't the sword go by a lot of
different names in most of those legends?

216
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:41,296
Depending on which Celtic language,

217
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:45,287
but the word caliber is cool, 'cause it's
what you call the diameter of a gun barrel

218
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:48,988
and it's also how you describe
the quality of a person's character.

219
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:50,450
Thanks for the lesson, teach.

220
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:52,580
Sorry if I got carried away there.

221
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:54,550
So basically what you're saying is

222
00:22:54,601 --> 00:22:58,561
whoever owns Excalibur has to be
someone who's an exceptional person.

223
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,956
Huh? Who is?

224
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,098
You mean Kirito?

225
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,714
Yeah, of course. Duh.

226
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,398
In fact, he's so exceptional,

227
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:09,610
he wouldn't think twice about paying for dinner
with some of that crazy money he made, right?

228
00:23:12,796 --> 00:23:15,473
Yeah. I was saving it for a surprise,

229
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:16,511
but, yeah, totally.

230
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:18,053
This dinner's on me.

231
00:23:18,415 --> 00:23:19,236
Thank you, Kirito.

232
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,720
Oh, thanks, Kirito.

233
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:21,347
It's free?

234
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:23,278
Yeah. Start pouring the top‐shelf stuff.

235
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:26,552
We're gonna eat till you're broke, dude.

236
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:38,063
Next time: "The Forest House".
