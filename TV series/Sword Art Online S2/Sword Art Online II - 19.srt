1
00:00:03,553 --> 00:00:08,120
So Zekken shows up at 3:00 on this island on floor 24.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:08,947
Mm‐hmm.

3
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:11,322
Then I'll see you guys there tomorrow at 2:30.

4
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:11,731
Okay.

5
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:12,235
You got it.

6
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,295
I can't wait.

7
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:14,797
This'll be so much fun.

8
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:16,666
Yeah, it will. Huh. Yeah!

9
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,720
The berserk healer's gonna get unleashed.

10
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:19,780
Oh?

11
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:23,366
Daddy, you have something on your face.

12
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,697
Huh? For real?

13
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,403
Yes. It's covered in ink.

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,480
You're kidding!

15
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:29,949
See you guys tomorrow.

16
00:00:30,107 --> 00:00:31,237
Yeah! See ya! See ya!

17
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,239
Good night, Ms. Sada.

18
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,400
Thank you for coming.

19
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:09,646
I'm sorry you had to work so late.

20
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,146
Not at all, really.

21
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,341
Just doing my job, miss.

22
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:18,900
Do you know if my mother and brother are home yet?

23
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:22,570
Koichiro phoned to say he won't be in till late tonight,

24
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:25,478
and your mother is waiting in the dining room.

25
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:27,782
Oh. Thank you.

26
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:29,864
Have a good night, Ms. Sada.

27
00:03:54,232 --> 00:03:55,188
You're late.

28
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,036
Next time, I want you here five minutes early.

29
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,317
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,045
It looks good.

31
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,906
I assume you were using that thing again?

32
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:48,489
Yes.

33
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,071
My friends and I were doing our homework together.

34
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:56,101
Unless you actually physically do
your homework, you won't learn a thing.

35
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,620
But we all live so far away from each other.

36
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,933
It's more convenient for us to meet in‐game.

37
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:04,398
It hardly qualifies as meeting if you're using that toy.

38
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:07,421
Besides, doing your homework is not a team activity.

39
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,929
If you're with your friends, you'll just fool around.

40
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:16,270
Asuna, you don't have time to play around anymore.

41
00:05:16,429 --> 00:05:18,711
You're two years behind everyone else.

42
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:22,344
You should be studying as hard as you
can to make up for all that lost time.

43
00:05:22,744 --> 00:05:24,432
But I am studying hard.

44
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,328
Didn't you see my grades for the second semester?

45
00:05:27,353 --> 00:05:28,626
I left them on your desk.

46
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,285
Yes, I saw them,

47
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:34,136
but grades from a school like that are suspect, at best.

48
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,855
They're not suspect.

49
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,854
Yes, well, for your next trimester,
I've decided to hire you a tutor,

50
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:45,207
and not one of those virtual
ones everyone's going on about,

51
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:46,804
someone who'll come to the house.

52
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:49,297
But don't I get to have any say in it?

53
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,884
Have a look at this.

54
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,058
A transfer exam study guide?

55
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:01,142
I know someone on the board of directors there.

56
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,322
After some discussion, I convinced them to let
you take an exam to transfer into their senior class.

57
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:10,748
It's a proper high school, not some makeshift study hall.

58
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:12,558
And since it's credit‐based,

59
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:15,912
I'm sure you'll be able to
graduate after the first trimester.

60
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:19,024
If you do, you'll be back on track for college.

61
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,198
Wait! Hold on!

62
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:22,819
You can't just make a decision like this without me!

63
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:24,993
I‐I happen to like the school I'm in.

64
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,973
The teachers there are great.

65
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:29,288
I‐I can learn there just as much as anywhere!

66
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,275
I don't have to change schools!

67
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:41,238
I've done my research, you know, and believe me, that
place you're attending can hardly be called a school.

68
00:06:41,577 --> 00:06:44,753
The curriculum is slapdash, and the classes are a joke.

69
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,048
Even the faculty's substandard.

70
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,426
They're a bunch of losers with
no real credentials to speak of.

71
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:52,923
Don't say that.

72
00:06:56,978 --> 00:07:00,834
They claim they're helping the students
who fell behind because of that accident.

73
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:05,635
It's all a lie. They just want all the children
who've spent the last two years killing each other

74
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,564
in one convenient place so they can monitor them.

75
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,705
It's more like an asylum than a school.

76
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,726
Did you forget, mother?

77
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,592
I spent two years killing other kids, too.

78
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:26,025
All the friends you had back in junior high
are studying to get into college this year.

79
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:27,680
They're leaving you behind.

80
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:29,082
Doesn't that bother you?

81
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:34,180
Not at all. If it takes an extra year or
two, it won't make much of a difference.

82
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,404
Besides, I might not want to go to college.

83
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:40,528
Ridiculous. I won't entertain such talk.

84
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:45,604
You're far too gifted, and your father and I
have gone to great lengths to nurture your talents.

85
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,430
I hope you appreciate that.

86
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:50,664
I do, but shouldn't I get to have a say in my own future?

87
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:54,818
Sure, I might not know what kind of career I
want right now, but I'm close to finding out.

88
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:58,961
If I stay in my school for another
year, it will help me make that decision.

89
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:05,538
No matter how long you stay at a place
like that, it'll just limit your options.

90
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,335
Look, try to understand.

91
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:10,554
I don't want you to make a
wrong turn now and regret it later.

92
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:14,997
I just want you to have a good life and
find yourself a good career you can be proud of.

93
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,973
So that boy you forced me to meet on new year's day,

94
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:21,330
that was you trying to help me with my career?

95
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:22,924
You should've heard him.

96
00:08:23,097 --> 00:08:25,772
He was talking like we were already engaged or something.

97
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:28,277
You're the one who's limiting my options,

98
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,137
not me and not my school!

99
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,394
Marriage is part of your career.

100
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:41,494
If you marry beneath you or marry
poor, I guarantee you'll regret it.

101
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:45,226
You won't have the means to pursue
whatever it is you really want to do.

102
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:49,116
That's why I think Yuuya would be an excellent choice.

103
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,598
His family owns a small regional bank.

104
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,737
Those are much more stable than some
mega‐bank run by a board of directors.

105
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,073
Your last choice wasn't very good.

106
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,924
Did you forget how he made me and
I don't know how many others suffer?

107
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:09,256
Nobuyuki Sugou nearly bankrupted rect.

108
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,405
He was your choice, mother.

109
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:13,160
Enough, young lady!

110
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,868
I don't want to hear about him in this house again.

111
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:19,722
And you're wrong. It wasn't
my choice. It was your father's.

112
00:09:19,747 --> 00:09:22,309
He suggested that crook marry into this family.

113
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,581
He's never been a good judge of character.

114
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:28,405
But don't worry. Yuuya might lack
initiative, but he seems stable,

115
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:31,464
and stability is the cornerstone of marriage.

116
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:32,649
I don't care.

117
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:34,917
I have no intention to date or marry him.

118
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:36,777
I choose who I'll marry.

119
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:41,605
Fine. As long as the man you choose is
from a good family and is worthy of you.

120
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,301
However, a boy like that,

121
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,284
your little friend from school, is not worthy.

122
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:53,264
Y‐You had him investigated?

123
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,709
Of course I did. Try to understand. Your
father and I only want what's best for you in life.

124
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:03,620
You have the potential to do whatever you
want as long as you make the right choices.

125
00:10:09,216 --> 00:10:11,443
I need time to think about transferring.

126
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:14,004
Keep in mind the deadline's next week.

127
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,601
Don't forget.

128
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:20,600
And after you fill out the form, make three
copies, and leave them in my office on my desk.

129
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:23,293
Mother...

130
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,013
What is it?

131
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:30,160
Even though they're gone, you're still
ashamed of grandma and grandpa, aren't you?

132
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,087
You're angry you weren't born
into a rich, important family.

133
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:38,403
Asuna, come back here right now!

134
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,116
Asuna!

135
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:56,479
Kirito.

136
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:02,989
Hey, about that questionnaire, have
you figured out what you wanna do yet?

137
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:07,663
I guess, if anything, I wanna go
from playing games to being a creator.

138
00:11:07,783 --> 00:11:10,336
A creator? What, for games?

139
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:11,850
No, not for games.

140
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:15,865
I wanna make a human‐machine interface
to replace the full‐dive tech we use now.

141
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,829
I've been going to all these
tech forums to learn more about it,

142
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:21,708
but it's a heck of a lot of information to absorb.

143
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:27,834
I want to be with Kirito and go after the same dream,

144
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:29,331
but now...

145
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:32,030
You sure are strong,

146
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,902
way stronger than I am.

147
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:36,903
I'm not strong at all.

148
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,345
In that world, I was a warrior,

149
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:41,719
but here...

150
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,543
Lightning Flash Asuna of the
knights of the blood oath is gone.

151
00:11:50,347 --> 00:11:54,097
In the real world, I don't have any real power.

152
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,556
Hey.

153
00:12:09,934 --> 00:12:12,516
It's rare for you to be so punctual, don't ya think?

154
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:14,724
It happens sometimes.

155
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:43,425
Hey, you remember?

156
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:47,321
You know, that one day you came to my
place in Selmburg and I made you dinner?

157
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:51,007
Hate to say it, but my memory's
about as good as my punctuality.

158
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,059
What?!

159
00:12:52,892 --> 00:12:55,629
Yeah. I remember that day like it was yesterday.

160
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:56,843
Really?

161
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,318
Of course. Let's see.

162
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:02,028
That's the day I got a super‐rare food item, right?

163
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,876
And you made an awesome stew out of it.

164
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,446
That was some tasty meat.

165
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,641
I'm never gonna forget that day.

166
00:13:10,962 --> 00:13:13,659
You don't remember anything except that stupid dinner?!

167
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,114
It's almost time.

168
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,561
I better get over there.

169
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,256
Asuna, be careful with Zekken.

170
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:26,927
Huh?

171
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,132
Well, it's like...

172
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,379
Zekken's really strong. Just sayin'.

173
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:35,471
Don't you worry. Liz and the
others already told me everything.

174
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
Yup, they even told me about how you lost.

175
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:40,499
I still can't believe it.

176
00:13:41,376 --> 00:13:45,673
Oh, by the way, Leafa said in the middle of
your duel with Zekken, you stopped fighting to talk.

177
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,172
What'd you talk about?

178
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,649
Well, actually, I asked a question.

179
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:51,635
What about?

180
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,514
I got a weird vibe, so I asked...

181
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:59,672
You're full‐time in this world, aren't you, Zekken?

182
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:04,631
And then, for an answer, I got a
sly grin and a mega‐fast attack.

183
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:08,535
I'd never seen anything move that fast.

184
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,576
What did you mean by "full time in this world"?

185
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:14,459
Is that the same thing as being a heavy user?

186
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:19,964
Uh‐uh. Zekken's way different than
your average, everyday hardcore gamer.

187
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:25,314
It felt like... like they were a sort of
product of the full‐dive environment itself.

188
00:14:25,521 --> 00:14:27,560
I have no idea what you're talking about.

189
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,793
In a way, it's probably better you don't.

190
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:34,941
The best way to explain it is for you to experience it.

191
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:42,803
Every time we turn around,
you're always pawin' at each other.

192
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:49,959
Sorry to interrupt your little love‐fest, but
there's a duel that's supposed to be happenin'.

193
00:14:50,026 --> 00:14:51,027
Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,371
I‐I know. I was on my way.

195
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:15,595
I yield! I quit, resign!

196
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:23,154
Ah, yeah! That's 67 wins in a row! Zekken's undefeated!

197
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:42,432
Hah!

198
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,379
'Scuse me. Liz...

199
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:51,013
What?

200
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,887
You didn't say Zekken's a girl!

201
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,210
I didn't? I could've sworn I did.

202
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,209
You didn't!

203
00:15:58,686 --> 00:15:59,532
And you...

204
00:16:00,156 --> 00:16:02,547
I have a feeling I know why you lost now.

205
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,827
Stare...

206
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,032
Mm‐mm. No, you're wrong.

207
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:10,402
I didn't go easy on her 'cause she's a girl!

208
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:12,808
I was goin' full‐out! I swear!

209
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,281
Halfway through our duel, anyway.

210
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,054
Whatever!

211
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,821
So, uh, is there anyone else
out there wanna take me on today?

212
00:16:23,088 --> 00:16:24,616
You're up. Go on. Get 'er!

213
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,981
Wait. I gotta psych myself up first.

214
00:16:27,006 --> 00:16:30,694
Oh, please! Once you cross swords with
her, believe me, you'll get psyched up.

215
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,913
Go on! Get in there!

216
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,296
Hey, what's up? You next?

217
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,164
Oh, uh, hi.

218
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,066
I‐I guess I am?

219
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,579
Awesome!

220
00:16:54,766 --> 00:16:57,881
So, uh, does anything go in this duel?

221
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,870
Of course. You can use magic or items, whatever you want.

222
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,517
I'm only gonna use my sword, though.

223
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,881
Oh, wait. Almost forgot.

224
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,864
You wanna fight on the ground or in the air?

225
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,624
Is either okay?

226
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:14,664
Mm‐hmm.

227
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,336
Hmm.

228
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,459
Let's duel on the ground, then.

229
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:19,773
You got it.

230
00:17:19,866 --> 00:17:22,902
Jumping's allowed, but no using your wings, okay?

231
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,952
"Yuuki".

232
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,071
Ho ho ho.

233
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:18,358
She is strong,

234
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,248
but if I gave up now,

235
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:22,881
I'd ruin my reputation as a swordswoman.

236
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:26,749
In that world, I was a warrior, but here...

237
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:42,613
Got her.

238
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:55,256
She saw my quadruple pain?

239
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,291
No way.

240
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:07,990
I won't lose!

241
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,274
Is this the 11‐hit combo,

242
00:20:25,954 --> 00:20:27,962
her original sword skill?

243
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:29,970
If I'm going to lose,

244
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,922
it might as well be to something as awesome as that.

245
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,701
That was an awesome fight, girl!

246
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:02,416
You're definitely the one.

247
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,424
Uh, what?

248
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,466
Aren't we gonna finish the duel?

249
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:10,816
I totally seen enough to know you got what it takes,

250
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:12,871
but if you want, we can keep goin'.

251
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:15,208
Mm‐mm.

252
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,920
I been lookin' for someone who could go the distance.

253
00:21:20,032 --> 00:21:21,755
At last, I found ya!

254
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:33,341
Hmm?

255
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,107
Whoa!

256
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,081
Mommy.

257
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:43,023
Asuna! Where ya goin'?!

258
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:44,238
Asuna!

259
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,289
Um...

260
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:55,819
I picked ya,

261
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,921
'cause you're the only one who can help us.

262
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:01,011
Help? With what?

263
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:39,180
Next time: "The Sleeping Knights".
