1
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm ninety‐nine percent sure the Death Gun story's a hoax,

2
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:07,695
probably someone trolling.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,232
You can't kill someone in the
real world from the virtual anymore.

4
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:14,574
I know that's impossible.

5
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:19,163
But there's still that one
percent chance it could be true.

6
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,176
That's why I'm here.

7
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:26,365
Link start!

8
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:47,643
It's a lot different than ALO.

9
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:52,713
Go figure. Killing people's the point in here.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,648
All right, then.

11
00:01:00,288 --> 00:01:00,872
Hmm?

12
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,417
Holy crap!

13
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:58,045
I wish I looked a little more soldierish.

14
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:03,084
Holy bazongers! That's the F‐1300 model, isn't it?!

15
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:06,545
That avatar's so rare, I've
only heard about them till now.

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,760
I want it.

17
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,749
I'll give you two mega‐credits for your account.

18
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,766
Come on, lady. What do you say?

19
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:13,189
L‐Lady?

20
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,826
Um, hate to break it you, guy,

21
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,886
but I'm a guy, too.

22
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,805
Holy crap!

23
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,215
Then that means you got the M‐9000 model!

24
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:28,376
I'll give you four, no, five for it.

25
00:03:28,465 --> 00:03:30,883
Sell it to me. Come on. Sell it to me.

26
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:34,110
Sorry, but this isn't a default avatar.

27
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,540
It's a converted one.

28
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,683
I can't exchange it for cash.

29
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,304
Aww, that sucks.

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,203
Yeah, well, later.

31
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:47,589
Hey, if you ever change your mind, give me the first bid.

32
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,597
If I want to get Death Gun's attention,

33
00:03:58,845 --> 00:04:01,176
I have to make a name for myself first.

34
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,310
Looking for some action? 'Cause here it is.

35
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:05,870
What? Are you too good for me?

36
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,629
I'm totally lost.

37
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:37,096
Some shortcut this turned out to be.

38
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,670
Uh, excuse me.

39
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:43,257
Can you tell me where...

40
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:47,813
Uh‐oh. She thinks I'm hitting on her.

41
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:51,363
Yeah? What?

42
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:52,552
Uh...

43
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,256
your first time in the game, huh?

44
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:03,559
I, um...

45
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:07,323
Oh, my god.

46
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,745
She thinks I'm a girl, too.

47
00:05:10,565 --> 00:05:11,831
Where do you wanna go?

48
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:12,835
Uh...

49
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:14,741
I, uh...

50
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:31,209
Yes, it's my first time.

51
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,042
I'm looking for a place to buy a cheap gun.

52
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:38,274
Oh, and I also need to find out
where the governor's office is.

53
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,187
Oh. Sure.

54
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,515
I can show you.

55
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:45,176
It's not cool,

56
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:48,242
but I'll let her keep thinking I'm a girl for a while.

57
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,073
By the way,

58
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:54,233
why do you want to go to the governor's office?

59
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:59,403
Uh, I wanted to sign myself up for
an event called Bullet of Bullets.

60
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,650
BOB?

61
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:04,695
Okay, but you just started playing today, right?

62
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,663
Yes.

63
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:07,972
Yeah, I don't know.

64
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:10,527
Your stats may not be high enough for that.

65
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:13,315
Oh. Well, I converted,

66
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:16,174
so all my skills have been transferred from another game.

67
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,830
If you say so.

68
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,713
So, anyway, you picked a heck of a game to play.

69
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:24,970
It's all grimy and stinks of oil.

70
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,043
Mm, well, I've only played fantasy games up to now.

71
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:32,967
They're fun, but I thought I'd try a cyber‐game for once.

72
00:06:35,664 --> 00:06:38,963
I was also interested in seeing
what gun battles were like.

73
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:39,980
Really?

74
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:44,358
It takes guts to want to start
with BOB Right off the bat like that.

75
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,574
Let's hook you up with a gun then.

76
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:50,346
I know this great market. It's down here.

77
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:51,766
Okay.

78
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,572
Wow. This place looks like it has everything.

79
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,391
Yeah, well, the two types of
weapons that are mostly used in GGO

80
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,858
are optical guns and live‐ammo guns.

81
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:15,632
Huh.

82
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:19,788
An optical gun's lighter and more
accurate, but it has its drawbacks.

83
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:23,721
If your opponent equips their defense
shield, it only does half the damage.

84
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,186
For a one‐on‐one tourney like BOB,

85
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:27,935
a live‐ammo gun's the best bet.

86
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:29,195
Oh. Okay.

87
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:35,328
All right, let's start with your stats, highest one first.

88
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,076
Um, I guess my strength is the highest,

89
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,660
and speed after that.

90
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,095
You're an Str‐Agi type, huh?

91
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:47,890
Okay, you've got two choices for your main weapon,

92
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:51,695
either a heavy assault rifle
or a large‐caliber machine gun.

93
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:57,177
Whichever one you choose, you're also
gonna need a handgun for a backup weapon.

94
00:07:57,871 --> 00:07:58,990
Oh, wait a sec.

95
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:01,470
You said you just converted over, didn't you?

96
00:08:01,495 --> 00:08:02,693
Do you have any credits?

97
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,326
Yeah, I should.

98
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:07,143
Let's see.

99
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,556
It says I have a thousand credits.

100
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:11,644
Everybody gets that when they start.

101
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:12,121
Oh.

102
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:18,689
Hmm. If that's all you have, the most
you can afford's gonna be a small ray gun.

103
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,876
And for a live‐ammo gun, a thousand
won't even get you a used revolver.

104
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,264
Listen, if you want,

105
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:29,830
I could loan you the money to buy a gun.

106
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,977
That's really sweet of you, but I couldn't. Uh, I know.

107
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:37,933
Does this game have anything in it where a
new player like me could go earn some money?

108
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,811
Well, I don't recommend them, but
there are casinos and gambling games,

109
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:43,999
like that one.

110
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:52,347
Hey, chicken, come on.

111
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,262
How do you play?

112
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:59,081
You enter through that gate and go
down the alley, dodging the NPC's bullets.

113
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,397
The idea is to get as close as
you can to him without getting shot.

114
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:04,252
If you can touch him,

115
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,140
you win all the cash everyone's sunk
into it since the last time it was beat.

116
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,721
All of it?!

117
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,957
Three hundred thou and change.

118
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:14,490
Now, that is a heck of a lot of money.

119
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,991
Well, no one's beaten it.

120
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,509
Once you get eight meters away from the gunslinger,

121
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,043
he switches to this wicked‐fast quick‐draw mode.

122
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,911
By the time you see the bullet lines, it's too late.

123
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,573
The bullet lines?

124
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,970
Look. Another sucker's stepping up to add to the jackpot.

125
00:09:30,043 --> 00:09:31,398
Today's the day, man.

126
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:32,671
Yeah, you got this.

127
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:33,906
Here goes nothin'.

128
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:42,839
I'm gonna blast you from here to the moon, ya varmint.

129
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:47,486
Hurry up, and die already.

130
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:49,876
Watch me clear this beeyotch in nothing flat.

131
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,197
Jackpot's yours.

132
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:52,729
Yeah, you know it.

133
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,370
Why's he doing that?

134
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,788
Was that the bullet line?

135
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:14,685
Yep. It's a defensive system assist.

136
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,858
We all have it.

137
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,119
Except for a sniper's first shot,

138
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,707
bullet prediction lines always show
up in the target's field of vision.

139
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,331
I'll kill ya.

140
00:10:31,728 --> 00:10:32,774
Whatever.

141
00:10:33,596 --> 00:10:34,416
Run, man!

142
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:35,515
You so got this!

143
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,091
You loser.

144
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:49,942
Game over, hoss.

145
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,082
Well, that sucked.

146
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,928
That guy didn't have a chance.

147
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,108
See?

148
00:10:57,215 --> 00:11:00,542
That alley is so narrow, you
can't move too far to either side,

149
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:03,247
and you're forced to charge the gunslinger straight on.

150
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,508
That's about as far as anyone's gotten.

151
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:07,833
Ah, I get it.

152
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,060
If I wait to see the bullet lines, it'll be too late.

153
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:14,294
Uh, hey, where are you going?

154
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:23,276
Ten creds says the newbie gets it out of the gate.

155
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:25,666
Whoa. That's the cutest target I ever seen.

156
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:27,926
Let's stick around and watch her get pwned.

157
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,567
I'll kill ya.

158
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,732
You loser.

159
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,108
You're kidding.

160
00:11:57,502 --> 00:11:59,176
She passed the ten‐meter Mark.

161
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,285
That is one fast kid.

162
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:04,119
Die, you varmint.

163
00:12:06,664 --> 00:12:08,889
I'll blast you to hell!

164
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,552
Looks like someone's out of bullets.

165
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:35,182
No!

166
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,909
Hey, chicken, come on.

167
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,595
What the hell was that?

168
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,152
Who is that kid?

169
00:12:59,854 --> 00:13:00,860
Oh, my god.

170
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,840
I've never seen reflexes like that.

171
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:05,372
I mean, at the end,

172
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:08,654
you dodged his lasers from about two meters away.

173
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:13,645
At that range, the time between you seeing the
bullet lines and the shots fired... well, that's it.

174
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,609
There shouldn't have been any time between 'em.

175
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:17,302
Oh. Um...

176
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,791
Really?

177
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,635
Well, since it's a game of dodging bullets,

178
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,581
I just predicted the bullet lines.

179
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,370
You know, predict the predictions.

180
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:33,419
You‐You predicted the predictions?!

181
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,447
Huh?

182
00:13:37,722 --> 00:13:40,752
I'm confused about the specs for this assault rifle.

183
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:46,535
I mean, this thing's ginormous, so why's the caliber
of the bullets it fires smaller than a submachine gun's?

184
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:51,820
I'm confused about how someone like you can
dodge bullets like a ghost and not know that.

185
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:54,433
You converted from another game.

186
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:56,282
What'd you play before this one?

187
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:57,641
Nothing special.

188
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:00,505
Just one of those typical fantasy games, is all.

189
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:01,584
Hmm.

190
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:05,781
Yeah, so you said.

191
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,791
Well, during the BOB Prelims,

192
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,995
I'll get an idea of what you can really do.

193
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,250
As for the assault rifle,

194
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,962
you want to know why it uses a small caliber?

195
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:18,195
Sure.

196
00:14:18,405 --> 00:14:21,434
It all goes back to the M16 from the US.

197
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,213
They designed it for precision and penetrative power,

198
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,837
but using a fast, small‐caliber round.

199
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,206
You don't need to know that stuff, though.

200
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:37,154
Now that you've got three hundred K, you
can buy pretty much whatever gun you want.

201
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:41,264
It all comes down to what you want
and what you think'll work best for you.

202
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,595
What does work for me?

203
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:44,847
Hmm.

204
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,696
Hey, what are these?

205
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:54,316
Oh, those are photon swords.

206
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:55,587
Photon.

207
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,079
It's a beam of light

208
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,583
that's a wave and a particle.

209
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:03,466
Photon sword's the official name, but
people call 'em laser blades, beam sabers,

210
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,315
and something else I can't remember.

211
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,923
Oh, cool! You can use a sword here?

212
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:11,220
Yeah, if you want, but nobody really uses them.

213
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,533
Why don't they?

214
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,016
Well, I mean, because you can't use
it unless you're close to your target,

215
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:19,255
and if you're crazy enough to get that close,

216
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,912
you'll get shot full of holes.

217
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:25,037
So basically it's good as long as you get close enough.

218
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,534
Yeah, I guess, but even with your skill at dodging,

219
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:31,291
if there's a full‐auto gun firing at yo...

220
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:33,435
ugh.

221
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:37,219
Welcome, player.

222
00:15:42,047 --> 00:15:42,770
Thank you.

223
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,418
Thank you for your purchase.

224
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,562
Have a nice day.

225
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,312
Oh, well.

226
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,773
I guess when it comes to combat,
everyone's got their own style.

227
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,300
The way I see it, if this place sells something,

228
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,963
it must be okay for battle, even this.

229
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:02,375
Whoa.

230
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:10,792
Huh.

231
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,352
She looks like she knows what she's doing.

232
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,118
Wow.

233
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,166
Those are your fantasy game skills?

234
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:26,468
Not bad.

235
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:28,710
I know a couple of moves.

236
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,476
This sure is light.

237
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:34,530
Huh?

238
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:44,034
Well, looks like you're dead
set on that for your main weapon,

239
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,419
but you should have a submachine gun
or a handgun in your inventory, too.

240
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,572
It'll distract your enemy so you can get closer.

241
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:53,252
Oh, okay.

242
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:54,967
How much do you have left?

243
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,957
About a hundred‐fifty K.

244
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,359
Whoa. Those photon thingies are expensive.

245
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:02,520
You got a hundred and fifty K, huh?

246
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:07,750
You still need to get protective gear,
some kind of weapon, and the ammo for it.

247
00:17:07,946 --> 00:17:09,587
What's cheap, but good?

248
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,160
I'll trust your judgment with all that.

249
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:17,718
For BOB, a live‐ammo weapon's your best bet.

250
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:21,225
If I were you, I'd go for accuracy over stopping power.

251
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,307
Hmm.

252
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:26,407
Oh. You'll spend most of your credits on it,

253
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:27,655
but this one's good,

254
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:29,235
the FN five seven.

255
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:31,572
What's five seven?

256
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,052
The bullet caliber,

257
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:35,484
5.7 millimeters.

258
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:39,576
They're smaller than the nine‐mill
parabellum bullets, but they still pack a punch.

259
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:45,321
They're similar in shape to rifle bullets, so
they've got the edge in both precision and stopping power.

260
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:46,509
Huh.

261
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,606
Hey, are you even listening?

262
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,713
Huh? Oh, yeah.

263
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:53,256
I guess I'll buy that one then.

264
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:56,108
Is that it, or do I need anything else?

265
00:17:56,577 --> 00:18:01,695
Yeah, you do. You're gonna need a holster,
some extra mags, some protective gear.

266
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:05,715
And you should also get yourself
a defense field and range time.

267
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,263
What's that?

268
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:10,126
You never fired a gun before, have you?

269
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,333
Uh‐uh, never.

270
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:13,157
Let's change that.

271
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,812
If you buy a gun from the shop,

272
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,071
you can test it here.

273
00:18:28,737 --> 00:18:29,945
Know how to hold it?

274
00:18:30,423 --> 00:18:31,334
I guess.

275
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,230
It's lighter than I thought.

276
00:18:36,446 --> 00:18:39,349
That's 'cause that model's made of reinforced plastic.

277
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:41,622
The recoil isn't too bad on it.

278
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,627
Still, you should grip it with both
hands. And keep your left eye open.

279
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,449
Oh, okay.

280
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:03,093
So right now, you should be seeing a
green circle in your field of vision.

281
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,901
Is it supposed to be shrinking and expanding like that?

282
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:08,098
Yep.

283
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,766
It's called the bullet circle,

284
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,391
your offensive assist system.

285
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:15,083
Your bullets'll hit the target
at random inside the circle.

286
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,078
How do I boost my accuracy?

287
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:21,401
I guess the easiest way is to get closer to your target.

288
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:22,707
What else?

289
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,876
Try to stay calm.

290
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:26,977
The faster your heart beats,

291
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,725
the more the circle expands.

292
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:33,129
This is harder than I thought.

293
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,140
No way.

294
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:56,305
I missed?

295
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:57,839
What'd you expect?

296
00:19:57,877 --> 00:19:59,298
It's your first time.

297
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,730
Thank you for going out of your way for me.

298
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,207
I really appreciate it.

299
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,368
Mm‐mmm. I was happy to help.

300
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:09,380
There aren't many girl players here.

301
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,876
I wasn't doing anything, so it was a good
way to kill some time before the prelims.

302
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,866
Wait. You're gonna compete in BOB, too?

303
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:20,364
Uh‐huh. I was on my way to sign up before...

304
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,289
Oh, my god.

305
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:24,615
They're closing soon.

306
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,472
Really? I'm so sorry.

307
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,827
It's my fault we're late.

308
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,665
No, it's mine for not keeping track of the time.

309
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,100
Whatever. Let's hurry.

310
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:35,932
We're never gonna make it.

311
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,778
Can't we just teleport over there?

312
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:42,952
I wish. That only happens when you
respawn at a revival point after you die.

313
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:48,475
And we can't suicide ourselves to get there
either, 'cause in town, our HP Never goes down.

314
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:51,608
The governor's office is at least three kilometers away.

315
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:56,239
It's gonna take us five minutes to
sign up, so we have to get there in three.

316
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,538
Don't close.

317
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,668
Don't close till we get there.

318
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,140
That's it.

319
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:14,350
Here we go.

320
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,611
Better hang on!

321
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,150
Wait a sec.

322
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:30,267
These are supposed to be ridiculously hard to drive.

323
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,224
I don't know anyone who can
handle 'em, so how come you can?

324
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:37,542
Oh, well, I used to play a lot
