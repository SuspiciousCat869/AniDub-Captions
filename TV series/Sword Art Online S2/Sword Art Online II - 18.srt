1
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:11,273
His fast‐acting mind is one reason.

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:13,836
Huh.

3
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:22,055
Wake up. If you start napping now, it's
gonna be hard to get to sleep tonight.

4
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:26,907
There's three days of winter break left,
and your homework won't finish itself.

5
00:00:27,107 --> 00:00:30,107
Sinon finished hers before heading back home to visit.

6
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:31,245
Just saying.

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,190
I'm so sleepy.

8
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:34,285
Poor thing.

9
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:37,079
It's probably 'cause the room's too warm.

10
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,136
You want me to turn down the heat?

11
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:41,580
It's not the heat.

12
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:44,183
It's the masters of the sleep skill over there.

13
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:45,125
Huh?

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,395
Oh. Well, that figures.

15
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,885
He's been working hard on his project
ever since he got back from "GGO".

16
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:01,485
You mean that gizmo for Yui

17
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:02,975
he demoed the other day at Agil's?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,280
Oh, the mecha‐phonics?

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,678
No, it's called mechatronics.

20
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:08,317
Uh, yeah, that.

21
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,843
Anyway, he's napping like there's no tomorrow.

22
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,519
Look at him. He's making me feel sleepy.

23
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:19,589
Hmm.

24
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,397
Here you go.

25
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:09,161
Yo, guys, seriously,

26
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,142
y'all don't have to come here every time you're on a date.

27
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,918
There's classier places in town you could go to.

28
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:17,639
What are you talking about? This place is plenty classy,

29
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:19,832
compared to your shop in algade, anyway.

30
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,684
Oh, don't listen to him. I liked it.

31
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:24,371
That place was a rip‐off.

32
00:03:24,396 --> 00:03:26,194
Half that junk was papier‐mache.

33
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,559
How can you say that?

34
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,394
He was letting you stay there for free.

35
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,955
That's got nothing to do with it.

36
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,150
Oh, whatever.

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,175
Okay, spill it.

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,282
What's so funny?

39
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:36,364
Nothing.

40
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:38,683
Just seeing you like this.

41
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,758
Y'all don't look anything like
the assault team's top players.

42
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,336
Right back at you, buddy.

43
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,563
Heh. Well, on that note,

44
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:48,889
I bet you've played MMORPGs for a long time, huh?

45
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:50,499
True that.

46
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:53,122
I played so much, I met the missus in‐game.

47
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:57,232
She used to live in the US,
and we fell for each other hard.

48
00:03:57,358 --> 00:04:00,026
A year later, she was here running the place with me.

49
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,109
Y'all never know what life's got planned for you.

50
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,523
Aww!

51
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:07,968
If Klein heard that story, he'd pop a blood vessel.

52
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:13,084
Anyway, we got married. Next big step was
getting ourselves a pair of Nervegear rigs.

53
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:15,966
But when the time came, we could only preorder one.

54
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:19,936
Heh. I remember we played some
game to see who'd get to try it first.

55
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,488
I'm glad it was me who cracked the seal on it, not her.

56
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,445
Still feel that way.

57
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,537
The assault team was the only ticket out.

58
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,170
That's why I joined up with 'em.

59
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,404
All I wanted was to get back to this place and to my lady.

60
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,754
I know what you mean.

61
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:39,383
I wanted to get back to my family, too.

62
00:04:39,634 --> 00:04:41,354
It's what kept me alive in there.

63
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:43,479
You and the assault team, brother.

64
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:48,676
Hell, man, I bet every player in Aincrad
felt the same way about going home again.

65
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,540
Right, Asuna?

66
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,219
Ain't that what motivated you?

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,054
Hmm. No, not really.

68
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,269
I‐I mean, it's complicated between me and my family.

69
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:03,041
I guess that's why there are a couple times in
there I almost forgot what I was fighting for.

70
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:06,653
Sometimes I felt like I didn't belong anywhere.

71
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,501
Real and virtual were both dead ends.

72
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,720
But then I met Kirito.

73
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,004
He gave me something I could come home to,

74
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,787
a place that felt more like a home

75
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,416
than anything I ever had in the real world.

76
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:22,975
I was happy,

77
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:26,734
even though I knew once "SAO" was
cleared, our cabin would be gone.

78
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:32,687
But I knew deep down that one day, somehow
I'd have a home again with Kirito and Yui.

79
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:36,622
That's what finally gave me the
strength to fight and keep fighting.

80
00:05:37,482 --> 00:05:38,451
It gave me hope.

81
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,779
Speaking of Aincrad, kiddies.

82
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,811
The mods just posted some info on the next update.

83
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:52,106
It's mostly typical stuff.

84
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,210
They're gonna be adding new weapons and sword skills.

85
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,686
But they're also gonna be unlocking
floors 21 to 30 in new Aincrad. Boom.

86
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,694
Wait. You know what that means?!

87
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,564
If we beat the boss on floor 21,

88
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:09,900
we have a chance to buy that log cabin again.

89
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:15,520
Yeah. Yeah, but there's been a ton of
little changes to new Aincrad lately.

90
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,074
It'd suck to get our hopes up
just to find our cabin's not there.

91
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,006
Yeah, it would.

92
00:06:21,429 --> 00:06:22,725
But I know it's there.

93
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:25,945
It'll be waiting for us just like how we left it.

94
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:28,548
Heh.

95
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,850
Well, y'all better get a move on then.

96
00:06:32,148 --> 00:06:34,025
Update goes live Christmas Eve.

97
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:57,393
<i>Sa‐yahh shahl lindoh‐asheena.</i>

98
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:59,959
<i>Bart Aimee orgh‐sverld.</i>

99
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,433
I'm going in!

100
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:08,855
Asuna.

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,228
Keep going. I've got your back.

102
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:13,047
Asuna, you and me!

103
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,857
Watch out, daddy! It's about to punch!

104
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,007
Switch out!

105
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,053
I beat ya!

106
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,282
Whoa.

107
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:48,370
All right!

108
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,966
We made it to floor 22!

109
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:54,771
Huh?

110
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,377
Heh.

111
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,277
Hey, Asuna,

112
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:06,435
if you're hanging around 'cause of the
teleport gate, don't bother. We can activate it.

113
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,832
Mm‐hmm. Heh.

114
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,848
Thanks a lot, you guys.

115
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:43,322
Are you seeing this?

116
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,922
Here we go. You ready?

117
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:00,715
Heh.

118
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:01,702
Oh.

119
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:05,530
Heh.

120
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,876
I'm home.

121
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:19,673
Oh, my god, seriously?

122
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:20,948
Hey, Asuna, wake up!

123
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,644
Huh?

124
00:11:22,776 --> 00:11:24,105
That goes for you, too.

125
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,563
Huh?

126
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,884
God, would you look at that.

127
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,630
It's like he's daring us to stay awake.

128
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,589
I'll make some more tea, and it'll wake us right up.

129
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,871
Hey, look.

130
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:41,141
I guess it stopped snowing while we were sleeping.

131
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:42,996
Yeah. It really came down.

132
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,811
Oh, have you heard the news?

133
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:45,257
What?

134
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:47,128
You know, about Zekken?

135
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:48,734
Don't tell me you haven't heard.

136
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,756
Zek‐ken?

137
00:11:53,032 --> 00:11:57,069
Zekken? Is that some kind of rare item or something?

138
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:58,376
Errh! Wrong.

139
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,755
It's the name of a player.

140
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,968
Actually, it's not their
handle. It's more like a nickname.

141
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:06,711
Anyway, this player's so badass,
someone called them Zekken.

142
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,471
The name caught on, and there you go.

143
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,801
It means "absolute sword."

144
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:12,707
Ultimate sword's better, though.

145
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,720
Either way, this player's tough.

146
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:15,971
Really?

147
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,584
So, uh, when did you first hear about this Zekken person?

148
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:27,406
I don't know. I guess maybe the first
time was around new year's or something,

149
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,298
maybe a week or so ago.

150
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:32,877
Oh, duh. That explains why
you're so out of the loop about it.

151
00:12:33,077 --> 00:12:35,867
You've been at your family's
compound in Kyoto this whole time.

152
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,303
I was having a good time, but you had to bring that up.

153
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,382
Listen to the rich girl rebeling against her cushy life.

154
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:44,336
Sounds like a drag.

155
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,448
A drag is exactly what it was.

156
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:49,892
I had to sit on my knees in a
kimono all day greeting people.

157
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,438
I brought my Amusphere along,

158
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,235
thinking I could dive at night while everyone was asleep,

159
00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:56,605
but you know what?

160
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:59,678
The guesthouse I was in didn't have WiFi.

161
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:00,624
Fun, right?

162
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:02,692
It wasn't.

163
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:33,669
Asuna.

164
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,479
Asuna.

165
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,374
You even listening? Hello.

166
00:13:39,609 --> 00:13:41,161
Huh? S‐Sorry.

167
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:43,255
I just remembered something lame.

168
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,842
I wonder what that could be.

169
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,100
Were your folks trying to hook you up with someone?

170
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,187
N‐No, not at all! Forget I said anything.

171
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,506
Okay, okay. Just kidding.

172
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:56,869
So, anyway, is this tough new player a PKer or something?

173
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,113
Mm‐mm. Just a duelist. That's all.

174
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,890
Were they in any tournaments?

175
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:03,923
Nope. As far as I know, this
player's a total noob. I have a feeling

176
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:07,901
they might have converted over from another game, though.

177
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,385
You should see their skill stats.

178
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,641
They're through the roof.

179
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:16,055
You know how, on floor 24, there's that
tiny, little island just north of the main town,

180
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,602
the one with the huge tree?

181
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,985
Well, every day at 3:00,

182
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,220
you know who shows up under that tree

183
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,307
waiting to take on any challenger one‐on‐one.

184
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:34,381
Zekken started by posting this opponents
wanted notice on the MMO tomorrow bulletin board.

185
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:37,927
Folks wanted to teach this cocky "ALO" noob a lesson,

186
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,828
so on the first day, about 30 players showed up.

187
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:43,343
It didn't go so well for 'em, though.

188
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,142
What? They lost?

189
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:47,304
All of 'em, one after the other.

190
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:52,398
And get this. None of 'em managed to
chip off more than 30% of Zekken's HP.

191
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,946
That's a badass.

192
00:14:54,746 --> 00:14:57,203
I can't believe how good Zekken is.

193
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,804
Who thought a newbie to the
game could fly as good as that?

194
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:05,198
It took me at least six months to learn
how to fly and fight at the same time,

195
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:07,062
and I'm still learning stuff.

196
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:09,150
I‐I did it.

197
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,137
Whaah!

198
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:12,978
Did you fight Zekken, too?

199
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:16,338
Not even. I'm no dummy.

200
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:19,003
I watched one duel, and I knew I didn't stand a chance.

201
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,746
If you want to know what it was
like, why don't you ask Liz and Leafa?

202
00:15:22,771 --> 00:15:24,352
They took Zekken on yesterday.

203
00:15:24,394 --> 00:15:26,238
They fought and lost like a couple of champs.

204
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:27,567
Please don't remind me.

205
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,175
Good learning experience, though.

206
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,412
Ah. It's snowing.

207
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:36,298
Yeah. Pretty, isn't it?

208
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:41,110
So, anyway, back to Zekken.

209
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,538
If this player's as strong as you say,

210
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:47,059
it's only a matter of time before
there are no more challengers to face.

211
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,792
I don't know about that.

212
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,397
There's a pretty cool prize on the line, don't you know?

213
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:55,192
Really? What is it, some kind of rare item or something?

214
00:15:55,447 --> 00:15:57,209
Nope. It's nothing like that.

215
00:15:57,347 --> 00:16:00,304
Whoever beats Zekken will get an original sword skill.

216
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:04,134
It's a special move that's supposed to be super strong.

217
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:06,151
An original sword skill?

218
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:07,631
Huh.

219
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,137
What type? How many hits?

220
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,088
Mm...

221
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:15,076
Well, it's a general skill for a one‐handed sword.

222
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:16,828
Oh, but here's the thing.

223
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:18,465
It's an 11‐hit combo!

224
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,925
No way! 11?!

225
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:24,999
The strongest original sword skill being
used right now, how many hits does it have?

226
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:29,024
That'd be the one general Eugene
developed, the volcanic blazer.

227
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,219
It's supposed to be an eight‐hit combo.

228
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,180
He hasn't passed it on to anyone
else yet, and I doubt he ever will.

229
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:39,862
I guess that explains why so many
players keep lining up to challenge Zekken.

230
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,664
Have any of you seen this sword skill in action?

231
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:47,153
Mm‐mm. I heard Zekken demoed it on
the first day of the duels, though.

232
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,967
Apparently it blew minds left and right,

233
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,204
but since then, it hasn't been used in any of the fights.

234
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:59,482
Maybe the reason for that's 'cause there hasn't
been anyone tough enough to get Zekken to use it.

235
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:02,166
Whoever does has my respect.

236
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,300
Leafa,

237
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,611
what happened when you fought Zekken?

238
00:17:07,058 --> 00:17:12,939
Besides losing? It was going good
till our HPs dropped below 60%, but...

239
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,705
In the end, Zekken beat me
using nothing but default skills.

240
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,252
Really?

241
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,623
Oh! I can't believe I almost forgot to ask.

242
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:27,219
What's Zekken's race and weapon of choice?

243
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,869
An imp.

244
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:30,198
The main weapon's a one‐handed sword.

245
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:34,108
It's about as skinny as your rapier, Asuna, but only just.

246
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:36,845
And Zekken's super fast, too.

247
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:39,426
I couldn't even see the attacks coming at me.

248
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,485
That's never happened to me before.

249
00:17:41,578 --> 00:17:43,087
I'm still kind of shocked.

250
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,992
A speed type, huh?

251
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,517
If you had a hard time tracking Zekken,

252
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,507
I doubt I'd be able to, either.

253
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:52,472
Ah! I know someone who might, though.

254
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,184
Mr. Sleepyhead's the fastest player I've seen.

255
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:56,654
What do you guys think?

256
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,438
Would Kirito go for that kind of challenge?

257
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,632
What? What'd I say?

258
00:18:04,574 --> 00:18:07,080
Nothing. It's just Kazuto already tried it,

259
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:09,686
and, boy, did he lose spectacularly.

260
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,331
I don't believe it.

261
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,564
Was he holding back?

262
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,086
Hmm.

263
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:18,467
Kind of hard for me to say.

264
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,547
From where I was standing, it looked like it.

265
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:24,499
Yeah, but then I don't think I'm really the
best person to judge whether he was or wasn't.

266
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:28,324
He didn't use that Dual‐Wielding trick. That's for sure.

267
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:31,601
So I guess, in a way, he wasn't going all out.

268
00:18:32,999 --> 00:18:33,974
But you know what?

269
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,331
That kind of makes sense.

270
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:39,164
I mean, it's a duel in a normal game.

271
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:43,631
There's no reason for Kirito to fight
like his life depended on it anymore.

272
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:48,912
The only time he'll take a fight seriously
now is if the game stops being a game,

273
00:18:49,534 --> 00:18:52,009
when the virtual world becomes the real world.

274
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:56,952
In a way, I hope he never goes
full tilt in a battle ever again.

275
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,605
He's kind of had enough of that.

276
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:02,568
I mean, heck, he gets into
enough trouble on his own as it is.

277
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:05,080
Heh.

278
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:06,820
Yeah, I guess you're right.

279
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:12,083
Well, from where I was standing,
I got a different impression.

280
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:15,371
I think Kazuto was definitely giving it his all.

281
00:19:15,396 --> 00:19:17,898
He seemed serious and focused and determined.

282
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,132
He put up a good fight.

283
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:22,462
At one point, though, something weird happened.

284
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:25,165
Right before the duel was over,

285
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:29,313
they were locking swords, and then they both just stopped.

286
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:32,999
It looked like Kazuto was saying something to Zekken.

287
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:35,382
I couldn't hear what 'cause of all the cheering.

288
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,961
And then, all of a sudden,
they backed off from each other.

289
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,843
Zekken charged him.

290
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:44,971
But Kazuto couldn't dodge it,
and that's how the duel ended.

291
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,600
Really?

292
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,876
What were they talking about?

293
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:50,196
I wish I knew.

294
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,484
I asked him, but Kazuto wouldn't tell me.

295
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,847
Whatever it was, it must be
pretty important to keep to himself.

296
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:57,256
Interesting.

297
00:19:58,742 --> 00:19:59,615
All right, then.

298
00:19:59,702 --> 00:20:03,290
I guess the only way to find out
what he said is to ask Zekken myself.

299
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:06,244
Huh. You think you're up to the challenge?

300
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:08,510
I'm not doing it 'cause I think I can win.

301
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:11,756
Something about this Zekken person intrigues me, is all.

302
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:16,852
I don't know why, but I think this Zekken
person's here for reasons other than dueling.

303
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:19,327
Yep, that's what I think, too.

304
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,857
But if you want to find out what it is,
get ready, 'cause you're gonna have to put up

305
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,668
as good a fight as your boy Kirito and then some.

306
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,820
Yeah, I know.

307
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,787
Will you guys come cheer me on?

308
00:20:30,957 --> 00:20:32,057
Mm‐hmm. You know we will.

309
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:34,436
It'll be awesome. We wouldn't miss it for anything.

310
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,829
Which character are you gonna duel with?

311
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,088
You still have the sylph account, don't ya?

312
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:42,252
Hmm. I guess I'll use this one.

313
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:47,730
If Zekken's a speed type, it'll probably come
down to who can hold out the longest, rather than DPS.

314
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:49,707
And that's that.

315
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:53,107
So 3:00 on the island on floor 24, right?

316
00:20:53,226 --> 00:20:53,751
Mm‐hmm.

317
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,376
Then if we meet here tomorrow at 2:30, we can...

318
00:20:57,678 --> 00:21:01,135
Oh, no. It's already 6:00? I'll be late for dinner.

319
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,894
I guess we might as well call it a day and log out, too.

320
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,129
Rich girls and their problems. Am I right?

321
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:11,032
I can't believe he's still asleep.

322
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:12,576
I know. He didn't even feel a thing.

323
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,560
Hey, Liz. What's up?

324
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,750
A little while ago,

325
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:19,605
you said you thought Zekken converted over to "ALO".

326
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:22,860
The way you described the duels got me thinking.

327
00:21:22,898 --> 00:21:25,623
Could Zekken be someone from "SAO"?

328
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,537
Uh‐huh.

329
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,212
That's the impression I got after my duel.

330
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,366
I wanted a second opinion,

331
00:21:37,393 --> 00:21:40,799
so after Kirito lost his, I asked him what he thought.

332
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:44,156
So what did Kirito have to say?

333
00:21:44,658 --> 00:21:48,479
He said that even though the skills were
through the roof, Zekken's definitely not

334
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,003
a player from "SAO" That's not all.

335
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,955
Kirito also said that if Zekken really was from "SAO",

336
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,642
the Dual‐Wielding skill wouldn't have gone to him.

337
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,206
It would have gone to Zekken.

338
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:38,266
Next time: "Zekken".
