1
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:22,287
Asada!

2
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:25,391
Shino Asada!

3
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:03,704
All your favorites are in stock right now.

4
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:05,801
Move.

5
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,875
Go on. Quit draggin' your feet!

6
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:11,503
I need a favor.

7
00:02:11,772 --> 00:02:15,935
We sorta went over‐time at Karaoke, and now
we don't have enough cash for the train home.

8
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:17,709
We're gonna need about ten.

9
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:19,180
We'll pay you back, though.

10
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,035
Ten thousand?

11
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:23,187
I don't have that much money on me.

12
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:26,493
Well, go withdraw it then.

13
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:30,590
No.

14
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:31,369
Huh?

15
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,728
You heard. I said no.

16
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,705
I'm not giving you guys any money.

17
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,965
You bitch.

18
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:41,692
We'll do this the hard way.

19
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:44,539
Get out of the way. I wanna go.

20
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:08,005
Bang.

21
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:13,271
Poor Asada.

22
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:15,042
Y'know my big brother?

23
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:17,707
Well, he's got a butt‐load of these model guns.

24
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,688
Wouldn't it be cool if I brought some to class?

25
00:03:20,886 --> 00:03:22,532
I know you like guns,

26
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,016
especially pistols.

27
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,058
Uh‐oh. Someone's gonna hurl.

28
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:33,860
Remember when you blew chunks in class and fainted?

29
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,372
Oh, god, that stank like ass for days.

30
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:40,518
All you have to do is give us your
money, and we'll let you go home.

31
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:43,847
Don't ya wanna? I mean, you look like hell.

32
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,684
Officer!

33
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:49,650
A girl's getting mugged in the alley! Hurry!

34
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:53,591
Bitch!

35
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:04,213
Asada.

36
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:05,628
Are you okay?

37
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,806
Yeah, I'm fine, Shinkawa.

38
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,099
Thanks for that.

39
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,403
So I heard what happened the other day.

40
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,607
You went on quite the rampage.

41
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,252
Yeah, but for a strategy, it was a fail.

42
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:33,342
I mean, we started the op with
six and lost four by the end of it.

43
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,126
If that's the outcome of an ambush we set up,

44
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,894
it's not much of a win, y'know?

45
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:39,574
You were pretty rad, though.

46
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,899
Y'know that behemoth guy with the Minigun?

47
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:45,819
He was kind of a legend in the game, 'cause
he never bought it in a squad fight before.

48
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,773
Yeah?

49
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:49,157
I had no idea he was that good.

50
00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:52,688
I never really saw his rankings in BOB.

51
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:54,134
His days were numbered.

52
00:04:54,173 --> 00:04:56,373
I mean, no matter how powerful a Minigun is,

53
00:04:56,434 --> 00:04:58,210
carrying five hundred rounds of a MMO

54
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:00,570
pushes you over the weight limit, so you can't run.

55
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:03,158
And since BOB's a solo encounter battle,

56
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:05,204
he was easy pickings for a sniper like you.

57
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,912
Still, with that gun, he's pretty much
invincible as long as he's with a good squad.

58
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,406
The Minigun should be banned.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,260
If we're talking about banning weapons, don't
forget some people think my Hecate's a cheat, too.

60
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,481
As its owner, I have to admit

61
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,113
using it does have its own special problems.

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,985
Wish I had problems like that.

63
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:33,241
So what're your plans for the next BOB?

64
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,340
I'm definitely entering.

65
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:39,853
I did my homework and have most of the info
of the top twenty players from the last one,

66
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,840
and I've got my Hecate now.

67
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:44,077
With her in my hands, I'm sure I can ki...

68
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,736
I‐I mean crack the higher ranks.

69
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:51,106
If I can take out all my enemies

70
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,634
and prove I'm the strongest, I'll be free.

71
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:56,932
Man...

72
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:59,947
Asada, you're amazing.

73
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:01,996
Having that awesome gun is one thing,

74
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:06,630
but you were also smart enough to put your
points on strength stats so you could use it.

75
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:09,491
I'm the one who got you into GGO,

76
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,359
but I've been totally left behind.

77
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,989
That is so not true.

78
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,491
In the last qualifier,

79
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,394
you made it all the way to the semifinals, remember?

80
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:19,284
Eh. Whatever.

81
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,425
An AGI build only gets you so far in GGO.

82
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:24,111
A good gun helps, too.

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,418
I spent points on the wrong stat.

84
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:28,528
Don't get so down about that stuff.

85
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:30,896
Sign up for BOB, and see what happens.

86
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:32,984
Nah. No point.

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,973
I'd just die.

88
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,281
Oh. Hmm.

89
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,743
Hey, how're your studies coming along?

90
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:40,571
You still wanna be a doctor?

91
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,155
Yeah. It is the family business.

92
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:47,822
I promised my dad I'd go to med school,
so it's a done deal. Stuck with it now.

93
00:06:48,137 --> 00:06:51,217
Well, what about cram school and the GED?

94
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:52,682
Are those going okay?

95
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,516
Oh, yeah. It's goin' great.

96
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,437
I'm maintaining the same rank I had when I was at school.

97
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,117
Stayin' sharp, ma'am. Locked and loaded.

98
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,711
Roger that.

99
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:09,405
The reason I asked, is 'cause
you're always online when I log on.

100
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,035
That's why I was a little worried.

101
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:13,575
If you're online that much, when do you study?

102
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,050
I do most of my studying during the day,

103
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:18,040
and I take lots of breaks, too.

104
00:07:18,395 --> 00:07:21,915
You must be making tons of cash if
you're diving all the time like that.

105
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,607
I'm not making that much.

106
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,406
Solo hunting's impossible for AGI builds these days.

107
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:31,913
Oh. Well, you're doing great if you're
earning enough for the connection fee.

108
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,187
Uh‐oh, it's late.

109
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:37,539
Sorry. I have to get going now.

110
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:40,572
Oh. Okay. Hey, uh...

111
00:07:40,597 --> 00:07:42,504
Are you still makin' dinner for yourself?

112
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:45,256
I'd love to try more of your cooking someday.

113
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:48,700
Huh? Oh, sure. Okay.

114
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:52,137
It's just I think I need to get better at it first.

115
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,133
Thanks for the tea.

116
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,914
And thanks... I mean, thank you for saving me.

117
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,741
You were pretty cool.

118
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:04,469
I wish I could always be there to protect you.

119
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:07,063
Hey, uh, if you want,

120
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,732
I can walk you home every day.

121
00:08:08,812 --> 00:08:10,598
I mean, if you want.

122
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,226
Oh, no, no.

123
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:13,563
That's okay.

124
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:14,752
I'll be fine.

125
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,720
It's the only way I'll get stronger.

126
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,651
What a day.

127
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:04,877
I can do this.

128
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,445
I don't remember what dad looked like.

129
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:56,348
I remember hearing he died in a car accident, though,

130
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:59,015
sometime before I turned two.

131
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:02,585
After the accident, my mom and I left Tokyo.

132
00:10:02,924 --> 00:10:04,768
We went to go live with her parents.

133
00:10:05,247 --> 00:10:08,270
It was peaceful there for both of us.

134
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,379
Huh?

135
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,466
And then one day,

136
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,153
that peace was shattered.

137
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,762
Put the money in the bag, god damn it!

138
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,653
And don't hit the alarm, or else!

139
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:42,956
Mommy!

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,037
C'mon! Don't just stand there!

141
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:46,397
Start fillin' it up!

142
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:47,868
Let's go! Move it!

143
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,384
Okay, sure.

144
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:06,051
I told him not to! You heard me!

145
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,403
Let's go, bitch!

146
00:11:07,744 --> 00:11:09,695
Fill it up, or you get it, too!

147
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:14,623
Gimme the money now, or I'm gonna kill her next!

148
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,290
I swear I'll do it!

149
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,045
You little...

150
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,922
Give it back, you brat! Let go!

151
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,722
Let go of my gun!

152
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:40,673
I look awful.

153
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,043
Somebody...

154
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,497
Anybody save me.

155
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,831
Wait! What?! Y‐You're kidding!

156
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,305
You're quitting ALO?!

157
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,632
N‐No! I'll just be gone for a couple of days.

158
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,627
I'll convert back after that.

159
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:17,896
But why?

160
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,829
Well, actually...

161
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,369
It's complicated.

162
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:25,963
There's this other virtual MMO that I need to check out.

163
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:27,942
"Need to," huh?

164
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:30,744
You've done this before and just used new accounts.

165
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,337
Why not for this one, too?

166
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,212
I mean, if you convert, your items will be reset.

167
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:37,311
Why would you want to do that?

168
00:14:37,758 --> 00:14:39,995
Well, it's like a favor

169
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,932
for that guy from the government.

170
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:53,087
I guess if Mr. Kikuoka's asking you to, you can't say no.

171
00:14:53,747 --> 00:14:55,791
I don't know what it is about that man,

172
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,370
but there's a part of me that
still has a hard time trusting him.

173
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:03,102
Yeah. I'm not too sure I can trust him, either.

174
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:06,230
Just get back as soon as you can.

175
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:07,995
This is our home,

176
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:09,725
and it's not the same without you.

177
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:21,470
Don't worry.

178
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,977
I'll be back in ALO before you know it.

179
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:28,025
I'll just dive into Gun Gale Online
for a couple days, see what's goin' on,

180
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:29,025
and that's that.

181
00:15:31,227 --> 00:15:34,703
I'm ninety‐nine percent sure the Death Gun story's a hoax,

182
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,078
probably someone trolling.

183
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:40,662
You can't kill someone in the
real world from the virtual anymore.

184
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:42,757
I know that's impossible.

185
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,435
This is real power,

186
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,694
real strength!

187
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:51,268
Let your fear carve one name into your brains,

188
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,042
the name I share with this weapon,

189
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,412
Death Gun!

190
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:01,682
But there's still that one
percent chance it could be true.

191
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:03,475
That's why I'm here.

192
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:13,661
Hello. Anyone here?

193
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:14,410
Yep!

194
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,085
What's goin' on, Kirigaya?

195
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,259
Ms. Aki.

196
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:22,914
It's nice to see you again.

197
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:27,004
Whoa!

198
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,783
You finally got some meat on you.

199
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,801
You could use some filling out, though.

200
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:32,194
You sure you're eating right?

201
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:34,251
Yeah, I'm eating. I'm eating.

202
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:36,595
Wait a minute. What're you doing here?

203
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,262
Your friend in the suit and
glasses told me about your mission.

204
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:45,943
He said something about you going into a virtual
network and doing some reconnaissance or something.

205
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,444
I can't believe he'd ask you.

206
00:16:47,469 --> 00:16:49,406
I mean, you've only been back for a year.

207
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:53,576
Anyway, he found out I was the
one who was in charge of your rehab,

208
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:56,600
so he asked me to keep an eye
on your monitors while you dive.

209
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,833
They took me off my normal shift and everything.

210
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:02,114
The head nurse wasn't happy, but what can she do about it?

211
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,213
If the government wants something, they're gonna get it.

212
00:17:05,098 --> 00:17:08,259
Well, I guess you and me are back together again, huh?

213
00:17:09,824 --> 00:17:11,746
Yeah. Thanks for being here.

214
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:15,607
Um, so it's just us today? No Kikuoka?

215
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,458
Mm‐hmm. He asked me to give you a message, though.

216
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,937
Email your reports to me at the usual address.

217
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,327
Your fee and expenses will be
paid when you finish the mission,

218
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:33,678
so please don't forget to send me an invoice.

219
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:37,215
PS: Just because you're alone with a pretty nurse,

220
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,447
you're still on the clock.

221
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:41,391
Try to keep those hormones of yours under control.

222
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,591
Uh, if it's okay,

223
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,277
I'd like to connect to the network now.

224
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:52,063
Yeah, sure. It's all set up.

225
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,426
Okay, hot stuff, strip!

226
00:18:01,507 --> 00:18:02,303
Why?!

227
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:03,845
For the electrodes.

228
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:05,672
Oh, don't be shy.

229
00:18:05,697 --> 00:18:07,770
I've seen all your goodies before.

230
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,912
Uh, actually, can I just take off my shirt?

231
00:18:13,214 --> 00:18:14,165
Mm‐hmm.

232
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,470
There. You're good to go.

233
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,543
Well, here I go. Wish me luck.

234
00:18:30,226 --> 00:18:33,122
I don't see this takin' me more than four or five hours.

235
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:34,415
You got it.

236
00:18:34,876 --> 00:18:37,606
And don't you worry about your body while you're gone.

237
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,232
I'll keep a close eye on it.

238
00:18:39,528 --> 00:18:41,713
Thanks. I feel better already.

239
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,850
Link start!

240
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,833
Yeah, I'm doing great.

241
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:02,336
I'm used to the school now,
and I've made some friends, too.

242
00:19:03,995 --> 00:19:05,720
I'm fine, really.

243
00:19:06,263 --> 00:19:08,869
I've only had a couple panic attacks. That's all.

244
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,706
Yeah, grandpa, I will.

245
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:14,520
Don't you catch any colds, either.

246
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:16,389
I'll come home for winter break.

247
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:18,939
Me, too. Bye.

248
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:25,732
Ever since that day,

249
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:28,230
whenever I see a gun, I freak out.

250
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:31,810
If I see a picture of one or see one on TV,

251
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm guaranteed a panic attack.

252
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:39,927
I came to Tokyo for high school, thinking
if I got far enough away from home, it'd help,

253
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,413
but it didn't.

254
00:19:45,363 --> 00:19:49,013
One day, Shinkawa told me about Gun Gale Online,

255
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,221
and I thought it could work as a kind of therapy for me.

256
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:54,887
And in a way, it worked.

257
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:59,628
As Sinon, when I'm holding a gun
or when someone's drawing down on me,

258
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:01,032
I can handle it.

259
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:07,619
I figure the stronger Sinon gets,

260
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,947
the stronger I'll get in the real world,

261
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,622
so I keep fighting with my Hecate Ⅱ,

262
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,456
hoping it'll help me kick this phobia.

263
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,057
Winning the next Bullet of Bullets will cure me.

264
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,072
I know it will.

265
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:25,884
It has to.

266
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,917
Link start.

267
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:42,217
Zxe‐D and Tarako haven't logged on for a while.

268
00:20:42,301 --> 00:20:43,672
It's been, like, a month.

269
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:48,027
If anyone's got their contact info
in the real world, hook us up with it.

270
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:50,627
Dude, if no one's heard from 'em this long,

271
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,119
they're gone for good.

272
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,980
We know the date and time they
were shot by Death Gun, though,

273
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:59,311
so all we have to do is check if any
VRMMO players died around that time,

274
00:20:59,336 --> 00:21:00,570
and we'll know what happened to 'em.

275
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:04,395
Yeah, but if they lived alone,
maybe no one's found their bodies yet.

276
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,734
We already asked the cops, but they're not talking.

277
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:11,049
We even sent emails to Zaskar about
'em, but all they sent back was the old,

278
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:13,871
"sorry, we never share our users' personal info" crap.

279
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:15,287
I hate to say it,

280
00:21:15,312 --> 00:21:18,849
but the only way to be sure they were
killed is for one of us to sacrifice himself.

281
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:20,679
So tomorrow at 11:30 PM,

282
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:23,295
I'm gonna wait for Death Gun at the Glocken Central Bank,

283
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:24,643
and just so he knows it's me,

284
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,335
I'll have a red rose on my chest.

285
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Shoot me, Death Gun! I dare you.

286
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,437
Ah, dude, you'll be a hero.

287
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,332
But you better post your real name
and address. Otherwise, what's the point?

288
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:37,360
Oh, do a public dive at an Internet cafe, man!

289
00:21:39,672 --> 00:21:40,379
Do it!

290
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,903
Whatever.

291
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,833
Next time: "GGO".
