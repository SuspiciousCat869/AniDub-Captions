1
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:14,165
Hmm, where's Kazuto?

2
00:00:14,278 --> 00:00:15,899
He should have shown up by now.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,792
Maybe they don't have all the battles up on the feed yet.

4
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:23,424
I mean, knowing Kirito, we should have seen
him running around, guns blazing from the start.

5
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:24,630
I don't know.

6
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:27,141
He's one of the craftiest players I've ever met.

7
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:31,280
He's probably laying low somewhere, waiting
for the competition to kill each other off.

8
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,333
Oh, please.

9
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,505
You and I both know he doesn't play like that.

10
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:36,911
Isn't that right, Yui?

11
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:38,078
Absolutely.

12
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,381
Besides, daddy's so fast, I
doubt he'll even show up on camera.

13
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,742
He'll sneak up and strike before
his enemy knows what's happening.

14
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,204
He can't do it any other way.

15
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,694
I mean, it's a game with guns, and he's using a sword.

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,805
What a doofus.

17
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:53,853
Yeah, he is kind of a dork.

18
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:58,003
That one guy's unbelievable.

19
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:58,679
Huh?

20
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:01,627
You mean the one in white?

21
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:15,540
No!

22
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,255
He's super fast.

23
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,365
Yeah.

24
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,429
That guy's sick.

25
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,046
I bet he's gonna win this thing.

26
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:38,938
Looks like your boy is full of suck, Liz.

27
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:41,226
Shut up. He's not out of it yet.

28
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:47,047
What happened to him?

29
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,887
It's some kind of paralysis attack,

30
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,653
most likely temporary.

31
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:57,263
It's like he was hit with that wind spell, thunder web.

32
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,588
Sinon, shoot.

33
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:15,888
Huh? Which one?

34
00:04:16,126 --> 00:04:17,549
It's the guy in the cloak.

35
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:19,041
There's no time! Shoot him!

36
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:19,847
Hurry!

37
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:21,647
Don't let him fire that gun!

38
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,261
Oh, crap.

39
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:37,039
He knew I was here.

40
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:38,880
How could he?

41
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,908
Maybe he spotted me earlier,

42
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,021
got my position from the last scan.

43
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:30,638
Jesus. What was that?

44
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,073
Death Gun is my name

45
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,712
and the name of my gun.

46
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:57,480
One day, I'll pay you all a visit, too,

47
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:02,103
and bring real death with this gun.

48
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,453
You've seen my power.

49
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:06,275
It is real.

50
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:10,366
This isn't over, not yet.

51
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:13,744
I'm just getting started.

52
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,200
It's showtime.

53
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,067
I've met that person before.

54
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:24,587
But where?

55
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,535
There's only one place I could've,

56
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:29,515
Aincrad.

57
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,271
Way to scare the hell outta everyone.

58
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:36,917
You gotta be kidding me.

59
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,119
No way. Can't be.

60
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:40,622
You know him, too?

61
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:42,169
Do you remember his name?

62
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:46,699
No. I forget the handle he used, but it's him.

63
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:48,915
There's no doubt.

64
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:51,070
He was in Laughing Coffin.

65
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:54,876
Laughing Coffin.

66
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:57,206
Was he their leader?

67
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,008
You know, the knife wielder?

68
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:01,925
No. Pretty sure it's not Poh.

69
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,621
Something about the way this
guy talks and acts is different.

70
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,898
Except for that "showtime" line, though.

71
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,493
Poh was the only one who said that.

72
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,532
But this guy, he was close to Poh.

73
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,489
I'm talking right‐hand‐man close.

74
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:18,941
Kirito.

75
00:07:23,998 --> 00:07:25,411
It's him, all right.

76
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:27,642
Oh, yeah. That's Death Gun.

77
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:28,817
Death Gun?

78
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,123
You're joking.

79
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:34,752
You mean those rumors about players getting
shot and disappearing, those are all true?

80
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:35,919
Yeah, they are.

81
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:37,757
I don't know how he does it yet,

82
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,382
but he's been killing players in the real world.

83
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:41,741
That's insane!

84
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:42,730
It's not.

85
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:44,880
Two people have been confirmed dead.

86
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:00,907
Where'd he go?

87
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,449
Kirito, watch the bridge for a sec.

88
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:12,257
I'm gonna check the scan and see what name he's going by.

89
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,377
Yeah, you got it.

90
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:27,846
Huh?

91
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:29,480
Where is he?

92
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,085
Could he have moved that fast?

93
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:34,233
No.

94
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:36,195
This is our chance.

95
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:37,884
For what?

96
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,503
Your pal in the cloak isn't showing up on the terminal.

97
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,787
My guess is he jumped in the river.

98
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,383
If I'm right, then he had to
disable his gear like you did.

99
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:48,201
What about his handgun?

100
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,005
He can still move underwater with that equipped, right?

101
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:53,382
Even if he could, it's just one little handgun.

102
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,872
I could take him out easy with my hecate.

103
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:55,732
You can't!

104
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:58,073
You saw what happened.

105
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:00,832
He used that little gun to kill Pale Rider.

106
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,149
All it takes is one shot.

107
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,553
Get it? One shot, and you're dead for real!

108
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,536
Yeah, well, I'm not buying it.

109
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,723
How's it even possible?

110
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:15,790
I mean, a player killing people IRL?

111
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:20,133
I know it sounds crazy, but it's the truth.

112
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:24,527
This Death Gun guy killed a lot
of people in that VRMMO I was in.

113
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,980
When he used his sword on someone,

114
00:09:27,196 --> 00:09:29,204
he knew he was really killing 'em.

115
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,569
And so did I.

116
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:41,020
There's a killer, a murderer, in "GGO"?

117
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:53,382
Sinon.

118
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:55,360
Sinon!

119
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,322
I'm all right,

120
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,749
just a little freaked out.

121
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:06,321
Anyway, I'm still not convinced
what you told me's possible,

122
00:10:06,763 --> 00:10:09,538
but I don't think you're lying to me about it, either.

123
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:10,702
That's good enough.

124
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,095
I can't ask for more.

125
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:16,294
Yeah, well, we better get out of the area asap.

126
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,339
The others know we're here by now.

127
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:22,841
They think we're busy fighting each
other, so they'll be closing in soon.

128
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:23,874
You got a point.

129
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,200
We'll split up here then.

130
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,248
Wait. What are you gonna do?

131
00:10:28,482 --> 00:10:30,714
I'm going after Death Gun alone.

132
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,606
Whatever you do, stay away from him.

133
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,476
But...

134
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:35,750
I'll keep my promise.

135
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,093
Next time we see each other,

136
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,383
I'll give you the fight I owe you.

137
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:40,255
Oh, and one more thing,

138
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,121
thanks for hearing me out just now instead of shooting me

139
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:43,815
huh?

140
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:47,427
Hey!

141
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:53,954
Wait for me!

142
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:58,086
I'm coming with you.

143
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,973
What?

144
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,337
That Death Gun guy seems pretty tough,

145
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:04,667
and if he kills you, you won't be able to fight me.

146
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:05,661
I don't think you get...

147
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:07,716
look, I'm not a fan of teaming up, either,

148
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:11,986
but I think we stand a better chance of knocking
that guy out of the game if we work together.

149
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:15,850
No, I'm not down with that. It's too dangerous.

150
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:18,687
We don't have any idea where he'll pop up next,

151
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,843
so it'll be dangerous whether we're together or not.

152
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:43,005
Huh?

153
00:11:44,984 --> 00:11:46,489
We better take care of this joker.

154
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,182
I'll block his bullets. You wait for an opening.

155
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,328
Roger that.

156
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:08,374
He's all yours!

157
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:16,636
No way.

158
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,577
Death Gun's probably heading north up the river.

159
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:41,175
I wanna be there when he surfaces,

160
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,586
but I don't know where he'll stop.

161
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:44,730
Got any ideas, Sinon?

162
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:45,757
Uh...

163
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,968
I don't know if he's got any other special skills,

164
00:12:51,023 --> 00:12:53,145
but from what I've seen, he's a sniper.

165
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,415
He's gonna avoid open spaces
and look for a place with cover.

166
00:12:57,765 --> 00:13:01,050
If I were him, I'd set myself
up in the ruins of that city.

167
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:04,678
Good. Then that's where you and me are gonna go.

168
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,802
On your six.

169
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:25,843
In "SAO", we had a code.

170
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:29,206
Never let another player's HP hit zero,

171
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,299
no matter what.

172
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,587
We knew if it dropped to nothing, that player would die.

173
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,388
Laughing Coffin didn't care.

174
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:41,887
They killed dozens... no, hundreds of people.

175
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:44,423
The assault team had to step in.

176
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:49,289
They put a party together to
hunt 'em down and capture them.

177
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,137
And Kazuto was there with you?

178
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:56,456
Yeah. He was up front, going toe to toe.

179
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,137
Everything went to hell pretty fast.

180
00:13:59,803 --> 00:14:00,697
Oh, man.

181
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:03,520
That's why Kazuto's been acting so weird lately.

182
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,984
Now I'm worried.

183
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:07,866
Maybe he's trying to settle some grudge or something

184
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:08,976
grudge?

185
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:11,447
Isn't this supposed to be a part‐time job?

186
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,756
Sorry. I'm logging out for a bit.

187
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:15,543
Why?

188
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,974
I have to get in touch with Kirito's client.

189
00:14:18,146 --> 00:14:19,747
Wait. He's got a client?

190
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:23,395
Mm‐hmm. He's the one who got Kirito to dive into "GGO".

191
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,447
I bet he knows what's going on.

192
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:29,131
Oh, and, Yui, I'm going to need your help while I'm gone.

193
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:31,646
Find out anything you can about "GGO".

194
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,743
You can count on me, mommy!

195
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:35,873
I'll be back in a little while.

196
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:36,757
Wish me luck.

197
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,167
Where the heck did he go?

198
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,614
You think we might've passed him on the way over here?

199
00:15:00,686 --> 00:15:02,099
No, we didn't pass him.

200
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,880
I was keeping an eye on the river
the whole time we were running.

201
00:15:05,934 --> 00:15:06,542
Oh.

202
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:09,079
Well, the river dead‐ends here.

203
00:15:09,764 --> 00:15:12,676
I guess he must be lurking
around somewhere in the city now.

204
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:14,626
Okay.

205
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:18,110
Listen, when his location pops up in the next scan,

206
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:20,724
we'll rush him before he can kill anyone else.

207
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,264
I'm down with that.

208
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:24,247
But there's one problem.

209
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:26,678
How will we know who Death Gun is?

210
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:29,736
I mean, that's not his avatar's handle, remember?

211
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,995
Uh, oh, yeah. Right.

212
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,692
Then let's start with what we know.

213
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,875
You said you didn't recognize
the names of three new players.

214
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,750
It's not Pale Rider, that's for sure.

215
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:44,173
That leaves us with two names
in play that could be Death Gun,

216
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:46,137
Jushi X and Sterben.

217
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,713
If they're both in the city,

218
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:50,653
we can't afford to pick the wrong one.

219
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,973
Wait a sec. I just thought of something.

220
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:58,672
In Japanese, the "Shi" in "Jushi" means death.

221
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,385
Get it?

222
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:01,473
And the "X" could mean cross,

223
00:16:01,498 --> 00:16:03,276
like making the sign of the cross!

224
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:06,035
You think? Or maybe it's too obvious.

225
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,175
Hmm. Maybe not.

226
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,492
Aren't avatar names usually simple and obvious?

227
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,545
Mine's a variation on my real name.

228
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:14,819
And yours?

229
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:16,798
Yeah, same here.

230
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:22,669
Well, if they're both here,

231
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:24,642
we'll go after Jushi X first.

232
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:28,270
Oh, and if I get paralyzed like Pale Rider, don't panic.

233
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:29,776
Get into position, and wait.

234
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:30,690
Huh?

235
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,247
Death Gun's probably hiding somewhere close.

236
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,088
When he comes out to finish me off,

237
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:36,410
that's when you shoot him.

238
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:40,209
Aren't you worried I'll shoot you, too?

239
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,370
Are you kidding?

240
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,057
You're the last person I'd expect to play it like that.

241
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,525
Let's go, partner. I'm counting on you.

242
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:00,081
Okay, but once we get him, all bets are off!

243
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,797
Kirito, check the north side of the map.

244
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:23,840
It's him.

245
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:26,455
He's the only one in the city.

246
00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:27,865
I guess he's our man, huh.

247
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,887
Yeah. I don't see Sterben around.

248
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,189
That settles it. Jushi X and
Death Gun are one and the same.

249
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,971
That means he's going after...

250
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:35,881
Him.

251
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:38,609
We better move fast.

252
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,162
Ricoco's almost in range.

253
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:42,360
Yeah. Are you ready for this?

254
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:43,060
Yup.

255
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:13,359
Found him. Up there.

256
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:17,402
He's probably waiting for Ricoco
to walk right up into his sights.

257
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:20,755
I'll attack Jushi X from behind while I got the chance.

258
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:24,799
That building in front of the stadium might
be a good place for you to get into position.

259
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:27,071
No. I'm coming with you.

260
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:28,532
Not this time.

261
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:31,066
I can fight way better knowing you got my back.

262
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:33,100
We're a team, remember?

263
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:35,408
Mm‐hmm.

264
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:40,013
All I'm gonna need is 30 seconds to get up there,

265
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:41,695
and I'll be ready to take him out.

266
00:18:41,811 --> 00:18:43,282
Is that enough time for you?

267
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:45,323
Mm‐hmm. Plenty.

268
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,560
Cool. See you in a bit.

269
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,947
Soon as Death Gun's gone, we'll be enemies again.

270
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:12,215
I'll shoot him, beat him,

271
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,692
and then forget him.

272
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,136
Whatever.

273
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,678
It's not like I'll ever see him again after this.

274
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,495
What?

275
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:37,779
But...

276
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,469
Death Gun's supposed to be in the stadium.

277
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,924
Kirito, wherever you are,

278
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:17,080
it's time I found out if you're the real deal or a fake.

279
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:21,690
I remember how you fought back then,

280
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:24,494
all fury and rage.

281
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,076
If I kill this friend of yours

282
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,687
and you go berserk like I remember,

283
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,916
I'll know it's really you.

284
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,641
He's gonna kill me?

285
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,320
Come on, Kirito.

286
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,727
Show me.

287
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,008
Let's see your fury,

288
00:20:44,364 --> 00:20:45,981
your rage,

289
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:49,511
your insane sword.

290
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:53,263
Show me for old times' sake.

291
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,733
A type 54 Black Star.

292
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:22,317
It's the gun.

293
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:25,074
Why?

294
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:27,105
Why here?

295
00:21:27,675 --> 00:21:29,537
Why does he have that gun?

296
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,807
Next time: "Death Chaser".
