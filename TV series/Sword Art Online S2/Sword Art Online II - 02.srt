1
00:01:44,985 --> 00:01:47,631
Ultima Ratio Hecate Ⅱ.

2
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:51,745
Hecate.

3
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,822
Yo, Dyne!

4
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:55,847
You sure you got the right info?

5
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,395
Are they comin', or what?

6
00:03:58,537 --> 00:03:59,875
They're comin', all right.

7
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,002
I checked the route myself, so relax.

8
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:08,708
I bet they're busy clearing some big‐ass monster spawn.

9
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,980
That means your cut'll be bigger this time,

10
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:12,357
so no complaining.

11
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:14,427
Dude, no one's complainin'!

12
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,194
But since we're talkin' about it, ain't
these the same jokers we hit last week?

13
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,979
They coulda wised up to us and changed their route.

14
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,578
All that squad does is hunt monsters.

15
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:28,086
They don't care how many times they get attacked,
'cause they'll just make up for it on their next hunt.

16
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:31,700
For player‐hunter squads like
us, they make the perfect target.

17
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:35,107
They move by algorithm, just like the monsters.

18
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,231
As far as I'm concerned, they're chumps.

19
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,685
Damn straight.

20
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,741
As for weapons, they're geared up
with optical guns for hunting monsters.

21
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,433
But we've got defense shields, so as long as those're up,

22
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,778
it's easy pickings.

23
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,623
Well, what if they got smart?

24
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:50,821
Like, what if they're ready for us this time?

25
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:52,832
We hit 'em not too long ago, right?

26
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,030
I doubt they got their hands on
enough live‐ammo guns that fast.

27
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,732
By now, they might have one firearm
for support, but that's about it.

28
00:05:00,178 --> 00:05:01,245
And besides...

29
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,619
We got the best sniper in "GGO" watchin' our backs.

30
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,525
We've got all our bases covered.

31
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,798
Right, Sinon?

32
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:17,680
Yep.

33
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:20,977
Guess I can't argue with that.

34
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:24,749
With a crack shot like Sinon up
here, things're lookin' goo‐ood!

35
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,144
It's better than good.

36
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,701
Well, "if"... it's a big "if," but still.

37
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:33,062
If she missed, I'd be cool with that.

38
00:05:33,565 --> 00:05:36,860
It'll take them about a minute to
figure out where the shot came from.

39
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:39,033
While they're doin' that, I'll be in position.

40
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:42,017
I'll hose 'em down and rake in the money.

41
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,689
Easy, cowboy.

42
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:48,306
Heya, dollface. I was wonderin'.

43
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:49,770
What you doin' after this?

44
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:52,570
I found a gun shop with an awesome inventory.

45
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,246
Maybe we could go get some tea or maybe do somethin' else!

46
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,073
You know what I mean?

47
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:03,346
I don't know what you mean, Ginrou.

48
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,057
Besides, there's stuff I have to do when I log out.

49
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,699
Ah, come on, dollface! What "stuff"?!

50
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:10,675
Wait. Are you still in school?

51
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,767
That's kinda hot.

52
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,239
You got a report due?!

53
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,108
Yeah. Right.

54
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:16,609
Lay off her, Ginrou.

55
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:18,256
Don't put her on the spot like that.

56
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:21,268
We're workin', so don't bring up the real world in here.

57
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,195
Yeah, man!

58
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,304
This ain't the time or place to re‐spec your solo status!

59
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:26,960
Like you guys can talk!

60
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,217
When's the last time either of you got lucky?!

61
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:31,789
Last night! With your sister!

62
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,758
Knock it off. Stay sharp.

63
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:35,493
Got 'em.

64
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,087
'Bout time they showed up to the party.

65
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,385
Yup. It's them.

66
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,617
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

67
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:52,607
That's one more than last week.

68
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:05,086
We got four optical blasters in the front.

69
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,415
I see one large caliber laser rifle.

70
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:14,292
Not a problem. And a guy with a MINIMI.

71
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:15,707
He goes down first.

72
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:20,612
The new guy in the back,

73
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:23,405
he's got a cloak on. Can't see what he's carrying.

74
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:25,273
He's wearin' a cloak?!

75
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:25,831
Yeah.

76
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:29,712
Maybe it's him, that death gun
guy everyone's talkin' about!

77
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,498
Huh. No way!

78
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,587
What, you believe in fairy tales now?

79
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:36,202
He looks like he's strength‐build.

80
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,783
Probably just a courier, though.

81
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:42,357
If anything, I bet he's carrying the
squad's ammo, energy packs and drops.

82
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,137
Eh, we can ignore him.

83
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,088
I'm getting a bad vibe from the guy in back.

84
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,022
I think we should take him out before anyone else.

85
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:57,893
No way. He's not carrying any weapons.

86
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,761
Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't.

87
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:01,992
He's an unknown, so he's a risk.

88
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,423
I hear what you're sayin',

89
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,929
but there's also a MINIMI out there, and that's a problem.

90
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:09,934
If he starts lighting us up and those
blasters move in, it's gonna get ugly.

91
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:14,012
Understood. I'll drop the guy with the MINIMI first,

92
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:17,245
but my second bullet's got Mr. Cloak's name on it.

93
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,333
Hate to interrupt you guys, but they're closing on us.

94
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,101
They're at twenty‐five hundred meters.

95
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:22,661
All right.

96
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:26,655
'We're gonna stick with the original plan
and wait for 'em in the shadow of that building.

97
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,943
Sinon, call out if the situation changes.

98
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,670
Wait for my order to fire.

99
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:33,250
Roger.

100
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:34,671
All right, move out.

101
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:16,136
I'm in position.

102
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:20,002
Roger. Targets haven't changed
their course, or their speed.

103
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:23,401
They're four hundred meters
from you, fifteen hundred from me.

104
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,649
Pretty far. Can you make the shot?

105
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:26,790
No sweat.

106
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:28,812
Okay, then. Fire when ready.

107
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,350
I'm counting on you, Sinon.

108
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:31,390
Roger.

109
00:09:37,221 --> 00:09:38,243
This pressure...

110
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,455
This anxiety...

111
00:09:41,475 --> 00:09:42,382
This fear.

112
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:45,345
Fifteen hundred meters,

113
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:46,505
that's nothing,

114
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,382
like tossing a wad of paper into a trash can.

115
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,243
No way.

116
00:09:52,052 --> 00:09:54,590
This is nothing like how it felt that day.

117
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:07,869
Next.

118
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,492
Can't change position.

119
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,793
I cleared the first target,

120
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,832
but I couldn't pop the second one.

121
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:30,970
Roger that. Sit tight up there, you hear?

122
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:32,573
Go, go, go!

123
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,635
He's got a... Minigun!

124
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,647
They're not late 'cause their hunt was running long.

125
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:08,300
They're moving slow in the field, 'cause the
weight of that Minigun's got a movement penalty!

126
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:29,814
Hmm.

127
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:39,266
Score!

128
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,574
Ha! I knew it.

129
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,445
This op's gonna be a cakewalk.

130
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:15,942
What was that?

131
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:20,655
If he can smile in the middle of a
firefight, he must be pretty brave...

132
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:24,285
Or crazy.

133
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:28,806
Either way, he's mine!

134
00:12:39,523 --> 00:12:40,265
Duck!

135
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:45,030
Crap! Don't let him get closer! Fire!

136
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,405
Y‐Yeah, Roger that!

137
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:00,692
Gotta find some cover. But where?

138
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:03,787
Where, damn it. Where?!

139
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:07,797
S‐Sinon?

140
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:29,283
Sinon! Are you hit?

141
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:34,730
Bastards.

142
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,227
They teamed up with a freakin' bodyguard!

143
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:40,833
Bodyguard?

144
00:13:41,515 --> 00:13:43,308
It's that guy with the Minigun.

145
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:46,300
He's a macho prick, calls himself behemoth.

146
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:49,390
Well, we can't keep sitting here,
'cause they're gonna wipe us out!

147
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,617
That Minigun's only got so much ammo to fire.

148
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,905
If we attack him at once,

149
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,953
he'll panic and burn through the rest of it.

150
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,537
Jin and Miso, you take the left flank.

151
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,279
Dyne and I'll come in from the right.

152
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,713
Arashi, you stay here and cover us.

153
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:04,977
That's crazy.

154
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:09,624
What about the three guys out there
carrying the blasters? Even if we rush 'em,

155
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,986
our defense shields aren't enough!

156
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:14,495
Right, but their blasters can't
fire as fast as a live‐ammo gun.

157
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:15,708
We can just dodge 'em!

158
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:19,906
Screw that! If we go charging out there,
that Minigun'll turn us into confetti!

159
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,940
Sorry, but we're packin' it in.

160
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:27,501
It's better if we logged out right now.

161
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,164
At least we'll be able to get away.

162
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:32,120
You don't get away from things by logging out.

163
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:35,932
Are you nuts?! This is a game, for Christ sakes!

164
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:36,767
Think about it.

165
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,497
Even if we charged 'em, we'd just die!

166
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:39,496
Then die!

167
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,116
It is a game, so you can at least have the
balls to face death here instead of whinin'!

168
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:54,212
We can do this.

169
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:58,086
If you can distract the Minigun
for three seconds, I can take him out.

170
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,279
O‐Okay.

171
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,905
Good. Then we'll split up and
attack him from both sides. Got it?

172
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,692
Got it! Got it!

173
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,219
Go!

174
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:34,817
Dyne! Cover me!

175
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,881
How you like that, punk?!

176
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,422
Screw you!

177
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:42,701
Yes.

178
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,737
Nice going! Now...

179
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:02,360
I've gotta figure out how to
get into behemoth's blind spot.

180
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,265
I'd better move fast.

181
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,434
Or he's gonna get a bead on my location.

182
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:17,855
Bullets are flyin', and he's
got the guts to smile like that.

183
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,898
Maybe I will, too, when I kill him.

184
00:18:21,223 --> 00:18:22,223
You're dead.

185
00:19:42,107 --> 00:19:43,022
Damn it.

186
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:46,939
I gotta get stronger.

187
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,505
Silica!

188
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:07,581
Ha ha! I've got a new trick up my sleeve!

189
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:18,149
L‐Leafa! Help me!

190
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:19,549
I'm comin'!

191
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,143
Lisbeth!

192
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,156
Yay!

193
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:42,175
Let's see what we got.

194
00:20:42,981 --> 00:20:45,003
Please tell me that's the last of it.

195
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,640
Hmm. I think I pretty much got everything I need now.

196
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:50,120
You wanna keep going some more?

197
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:53,840
You always hook us up at your shop, so
if you need more, we don't mind helping.

198
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:56,634
Thanks, guys. Although...

199
00:20:57,095 --> 00:21:00,268
Hmm. We sorta picked this place clean, didn't we?

200
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:02,723
Let's take a break and let 'em respawn.

201
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:03,656
Okay.

202
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:10,583
They're so into each other.

203
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,930
It's not fair, damn it.

204
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,290
Now, now...!

205
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:17,186
Uch. Doesn't matter if they're at school or here,

206
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:19,049
they can't keep their hands off each other!

207
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,721
You mean they're like this at school, too?

208
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,495
All day, every day.

209
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:58,145
Asuna...

210
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,566
There's something important I've been wanting to tell you.

211
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:38,567
Next time: "Memories of Blood".
