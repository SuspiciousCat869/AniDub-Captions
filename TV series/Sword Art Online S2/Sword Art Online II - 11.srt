1
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:09,253
So Death Gun was in Laughing Coffin,

2
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:11,113
And you guys fought before.

3
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:19,382
Kirito, I need to know something.

4
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,095
It's about the people you killed.

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,627
How did you get over what you did?

6
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,507
How are you not affected by it?

7
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:29,512
How are you so strong, you're not controlled by it?

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,021
I haven't gotten over it.

9
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:37,061
What?

10
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:43,162
Last night, I kept having nightmares
about the three guys I killed.

11
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,957
I hardly slept at all.

12
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,166
I saw their faces right before they vanished.

13
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,080
I heard their voices,

14
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:53,216
Their words.

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,149
I don't think I'm ever gonna forget 'em.

16
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:58,712
But then...

17
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:01,972
What am I supposed to do?

18
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,769
I... I can't...

19
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:07,048
It's okay.

20
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:10,300
I think that's probably how it should be.

21
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,175
I get it now.

22
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,103
There are things I shouldn't forget,

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,827
What it means to kill,

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,115
The significance of taking a life.

25
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,128
And once I accept it,

26
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:23,021
Maybe then I'll be able to find some closure.

27
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,740
That's how I see it.

28
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,188
Closure...

29
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:28,915
By accepting it?

30
00:03:18,724 --> 00:03:19,664
Death Gun.

31
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:20,483
Hmm?

32
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:24,561
It's hard to believe that under
that cloak, there's a real‐live person.

33
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:25,861
Who just wants to kill.

34
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:27,144
Yeah.

35
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,145
And if I knew his handle in "SAO",

36
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:33,947
I'd be able to figure out his
name and address in the real world.

37
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,863
That's the reason why I logged into "GGO".

38
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:39,791
Oh.

39
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:46,000
Then maybe his reason for being here is
'cause he likes to PK Maybe he misses the rush

40
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,367
of doing it from "SAO" You think?

41
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:50,670
Nah, there's more to it than that.

42
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,556
He killed Zxe‐D and Tarako in
front of a bunch of witnesses.

43
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:56,406
It was the same with pale rider.

44
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,883
He always picks times when he's got the biggest audience.

45
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,586
And that sign of the cross he makes,

46
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,252
I bet he does it to freak out as many people as possible.

47
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,211
He wants you to believe he's got
the power to kill you from in the game,

48
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,704
But it's all a show.

49
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,524
If that's true, then how's he killing people?

50
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,900
It's not 'cause of brain damage from their headgear.

51
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:22,430
The authorities said that Zxe‐D
and Tarako died of heart failure.

52
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:25,276
Heart failure?

53
00:04:25,405 --> 00:04:26,396
My god.

54
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,765
To be honest,

55
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:31,263
I have no idea how he killed 'em either.

56
00:04:31,993 --> 00:04:36,329
But the thought of firing a gun in the
virtual world and stopping a player's heart,

57
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,452
There's no way that's possible.

58
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,271
Hang on a second.

59
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,047
Come to think of it...

60
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:43,830
What?

61
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:45,383
That was weird.

62
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:46,631
What was?

63
00:04:46,832 --> 00:04:48,300
Back there in the ruins,

64
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,290
He had his handgun out for you,

65
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:52,217
but he switched to the rifle for me,

66
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,476
But he kills with the handgun.

67
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:58,740
He could have killed me with it, so why'd he switch?

68
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,996
Yeah. Good question.

69
00:05:09,673 --> 00:05:12,659
Could it be that he didn't shoot me with it

70
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,370
'cause he couldn't shoot me with it?

71
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,000
The handgun,

72
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:18,842
can't use it, though.

73
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:22,012
The switch. The crossing himself thing.

74
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,443
Invisibility cloak.

75
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:25,358
Conditions, rules.

76
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,841
Here. I can't tell you how relieved
I am to hear you put it into words.

77
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:32,470
Knew it.

78
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:35,206
In‐game guns can't kill IRL.

79
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,160
Shooting someone from in here's not what does it.

80
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:40,323
It takes preparation.

81
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:41,865
Now you lost me.

82
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,705
The only way to make it look
like he's killing people in‐game.

83
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:49,307
Is by setting up for the murder in the real world first.

84
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:51,622
How would he set something like that up?

85
00:05:51,876 --> 00:05:53,477
I mean, if you're right,

86
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:56,974
he'd have to get a player's
real‐life information to do it.

87
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,693
All that stuff's secure, though.

88
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:05,608
No. If someone's clever enough, they
can find out a player's address easy.

89
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:06,481
How?

90
00:06:06,965 --> 00:06:10,163
The terminals at the governor's office.

91
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:13,593
You have to plug your real name
and address into 'em to compete.

92
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,168
It's an open space.

93
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:17,118
You don't have any privacy there.

94
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,336
No way. You saying he peeked over their shoulders
while they entered their info? That can't be it,

95
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,620
'cause you'd notice someone lurking next to you.

96
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:29,619
He could have used a scope or
some binoculars from across the room.

97
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,148
That's breaking etiquette.

98
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:33,167
He'd get his ass kicked out of the game for that.

99
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,087
Then how 'bout this?

100
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:42,247
Maybe Death Gun can, like, use his
cloak to turn invisible in town, too.

101
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,574
He'd be right there, and you wouldn't even know it.

102
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:50,309
But still, he can't do anything in the real world.

103
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,688
When he's logged in here, he's unconscious there.

104
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:53,494
Right.

105
00:06:59,142 --> 00:06:59,822
Wait.

106
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,347
That's it. Yeah.

107
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,227
It's not just him.

108
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:05,484
Death Gun...

109
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,281
Has a partner!

110
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,498
Check it out.

111
00:07:09,893 --> 00:07:12,500
One of them plays as the Death Gun avatar.

112
00:07:12,594 --> 00:07:14,442
His job is to shoot the target.

113
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:16,705
At the same time, in the real world,

114
00:07:16,738 --> 00:07:19,015
the second person in the target's apartment.

115
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:21,346
His job is take the player out.

116
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:28,037
Okay, but let's say they found out your address.

117
00:07:28,091 --> 00:07:29,918
What about the other people living there?

118
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:31,401
And they'd need a key.

119
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,992
As far as Zxe‐D and Tarako go,

120
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,147
They lived alone,

121
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,606
And their apartments were in older buildings.

122
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,163
The e‐locks on their doors were probably first‐gen,

123
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,511
Not very secure.

124
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:46,861
Besides, they were both diving
in "GGO" During the break‐in,

125
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:49,665
so they were both unconscious and completely helpless.

126
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:50,953
They couldn't hear,

127
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:53,013
So the killer could take his time getting in.

128
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:58,318
But then you said the cause of death
for both was heart failure, right?

129
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:03,243
So how'd they stop someone's heart in a way
both the cops and the coroner couldn't figure out?

130
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:06,226
Maybe by injecting some kind of drug or something.

131
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,636
That's one way.

132
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,965
Okay, but someone should have found evidence of it,

133
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,582
A mark or something.

134
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,359
They didn't find the bodies for a while,

135
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:17,234
So they were pretty decomposed.

136
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,404
Besides, a hard‐core gamer can go
for days without eating or sleeping.

137
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:25,405
I doubt anyone would think it's weird if
someone died of a heart attack after that.

138
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,631
They're crazy.

139
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,761
Right?

140
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,418
I mean, why else would anyone do this?

141
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:37,030
Maybe, or maybe they do it

142
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:39,392
'cause red players are who they really are.

143
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:44,399
I mean, deep down, I think I'm really a swordsman.

144
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:47,679
When you put it that way, I can sort of understand.

145
00:08:48,537 --> 00:08:52,464
There's times when I think I'm a real sniper, not a gamer.

146
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:58,098
Wait. Do you think the guy doing
the killing's a red player, too,

147
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,135
You know, like Death Gun?

148
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,552
Yeah. They were probably in Laughing Coffin together.

149
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:09,248
I'm still wondering how they coordinated the
killings between this world and the real one.

150
00:09:09,533 --> 00:09:11,471
How are they so precise about it?

151
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,643
That's it.

152
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:17,338
That's what doing the sign of the cross is about.

153
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:19,022
It's not just for show.

154
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:22,399
It's also a great opportunity
to sneak a peek at his watch.

155
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,365
You're right.

156
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:30,690
Sinon...

157
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:33,371
Do you live alone?

158
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,327
Um, yeah.

159
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:37,294
But I'm sure I locked my door.

160
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:43,307
My building's got first‐gen
locks, but I've also got a chain.

161
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,670
I think I left the chain off tonight.

162
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:48,387
Oh, man.

163
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,490
Listen, you're not gonna like this.

164
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,253
When Death Gun was chasing us on that horse,

165
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,490
I wasn't the one he was shooting at.

166
00:10:01,556 --> 00:10:05,788
And that could only mean they got their
next victim all set up and ready to go.

167
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,122
Okay.

168
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,232
Then who's next?

169
00:10:09,898 --> 00:10:13,323
I got a feeling that right now in the real world,

170
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,639
Death Gun's partner's in your place.

171
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,533
He's watching the live stream,

172
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,749
Waiting for when you get shot by that gun.

173
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:21,586
It's just a hunch.

174
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:01,805
No.

175
00:11:02,643 --> 00:11:03,651
No. No, not that.

176
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:04,922
Oh, god.

177
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:21,241
Calm down.

178
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,914
If you log out now, you'll be in danger.

179
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:25,496
Just calm down.

180
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,023
Go easy.

181
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,888
Until Death Gun shoots you,

182
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:41,802
The guy in your place isn't gonna do anything, okay?

183
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:45,023
That's the rule they set up for themselves.

184
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,585
But if you log out now and wake up with his partner there,

185
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:52,537
He'll kill you, so you have to calm down.

186
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,630
But... but...

187
00:11:54,902 --> 00:11:57,694
I'm scared. I'm so scared.

188
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,393
Hmm?

189
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,936
Jeez, Chrysheight,

190
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,660
Took you long enough.

191
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:16,923
Sorry, guys. I booked it over here
as fast as I could from my save point.

192
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,668
If there were a speed limit in "ALO",

193
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,750
My license would have gotten suspended.

194
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:22,830
Huh?

195
00:12:26,691 --> 00:12:27,927
What is going on?

196
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:37,542
I'd be happy to explain in detail, but
I should warn you it might take a while.

197
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:40,863
To tell the truth, I'm not 100% sure where to begin.

198
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:41,649
Oh, don't even.

199
00:12:42,204 --> 00:12:43,091
Not to worry.

200
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,642
I know just where to start.

201
00:12:45,772 --> 00:12:48,441
On November 9, in "Gun Gale Online,"

202
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:52,940
A player called Death Gun fired his
weapon at an avatar appearing on a monitor.

203
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,846
That same day in Nakano ward,

204
00:12:56,872 --> 00:12:58,306
the player of that avatar mysteriously died.

205
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,307
Young lady, that was unbelievable.

206
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:11,625
Gathering all that information and connecting
it so quickly, you must be quite the researcher.

207
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,714
Have you ever thought about a career in the VR Section?

208
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:15,910
Whoa. You win.

209
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:19,031
I'm sorry. I'm not going to stonewall you, promise.

210
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:21,068
Just complimenting her, is all.

211
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:23,872
She's right, though. It's true.

212
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,980
Yo, Chrysheight or whatever,

213
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:29,484
I hear you're the one that hired
Kirito to dive into that game.

214
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:33,957
So let me get this straight. You got him to
convert over knowing a player got shot in‐game

215
00:13:33,982 --> 00:13:35,715
And died IRL because of it?

216
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,541
Easy, Klein. I can explain.

217
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,243
That's not how the player died.

218
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:40,527
Then how?

219
00:13:40,865 --> 00:13:42,595
It's not the Amusphere rig.

220
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,865
No matter what happens to you in‐game, it can't hurt you,

221
00:13:46,354 --> 00:13:50,449
And it certainly can't stop a player's heart
when it's not even directly connected to it.

222
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:55,918
As a matter of fact, Kirito and I met last week to
talk about it and pretty much agreed it was impossible.

223
00:13:56,395 --> 00:14:00,521
There's no way anyone can kill a person
in real life by shooting them in the game.

224
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:05,895
Okay, then, if what you say is true,

225
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,865
How come you had my brother dive into "GGO" For you, huh?

226
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,754
You had a hunch something was wrong.

227
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,053
Scratch that.

228
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:14,817
You know something's wrong.

229
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,794
That Death Gun guy's a part of it,

230
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,831
And I bet you sent my brother in to try to find him.

231
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:21,642
Chrysheight,

232
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:23,892
we figured it out.

233
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:27,282
Death Gun is an "SAO" Survivor just like us,

234
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:32,338
But unlike us, he was a red player who was
in a guild of killers called Laughing Coffin.

235
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:34,749
You sure he was with them?

236
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:37,846
Yes. None of us can remember his name, though.

237
00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:39,880
Klein and I met him once.

238
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,234
When our group went to capture his.

239
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:47,217
Um, hey, Asuna, I get the feeling
Chrysheight knows more than he's letting on.

240
00:14:47,318 --> 00:14:52,251
No offense, Chrysheight, but all we know is you
work for the government doing something with networks

241
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:54,124
and that you play "ALO".

242
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,547
As part of some kind of research you're doing on VRMMOs.

243
00:14:58,128 --> 00:14:59,828
Only for the past year.

244
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:02,565
The job I had before was a little...

245
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,779
Different.

246
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:07,970
I used to be part of the task
force for the "SAO" incident.

247
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,580
But even though we were called a task force,

248
00:15:11,607 --> 00:15:13,748
In the end, we were pretty ineffective.

249
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,595
Chrysheight, you're obviously well connected,
and with a little digging, you could find out

250
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,390
what the real‐life name and address of this Death Gun is.

251
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,423
Just make a list of the handles

252
00:15:24,448 --> 00:15:26,636
of all the surviving Laughing Coffin members.

253
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:28,550
Then contact their ISPs,

254
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,549
Ask which one's playing "GGO" Now,

255
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:32,121
And trace their location.

256
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,364
No. Sorry, that's not possible.

257
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,625
The ISPs aren't going to give
out a player's real‐life info.

258
00:15:37,652 --> 00:15:39,616
If all we have to go on are their handles.

259
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:42,794
Maybe if we ask the game's admins, they could help.

260
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:47,574
They might, but GGO's admins are in the US,
so it'll be a while before we got an answer.

261
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,059
I know my brother,

262
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:54,465
And right now, he's risking his life in that game,

263
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,707
Trying to find out who this person is.

264
00:15:57,104 --> 00:16:00,012
When he came home last night,
he had this look on his face,

265
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,585
Like he'd seen a ghost.

266
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:05,740
He must have bumped into the
guy yesterday during the prelims.

267
00:16:06,186 --> 00:16:10,629
I bet that's when he realized someone
from Laughing Coffin was in "GGO",

268
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,621
Someone who figured out how
to kill players for real again.

269
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:18,651
My brother went back to put an end to that nightmare,

270
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:22,788
to find out his name, and stop his PKing once and for all.

271
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:25,240
Darn it, Kirito.

272
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,073
You should have said something.

273
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:30,345
Why? Why do you always do this?

274
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:32,909
That damn idiot!

275
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,575
Why didn't he say anything?

276
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:39,488
I could be backing him up right now, all he had
to do was ask, and I would have converted over, too.

277
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:40,649
We all would have.

278
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:43,704
Don't you see? That's why he didn't tell us.

279
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:46,891
If he thought there was any
real danger in what he was doing,

280
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,355
there's no way he'd get us mixed up in it, too.

281
00:16:49,644 --> 00:16:51,075
That's just how he is.

282
00:16:51,554 --> 00:16:52,625
Yeah, you're right.

283
00:16:52,906 --> 00:16:55,143
He always thinks of others before himself.

284
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,914
In fact, he's probably protecting someone right now,

285
00:16:57,953 --> 00:17:01,310
and whoever that is, I bet it's
someone who doesn't like him much.

286
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:09,609
Okay, Chrysheight, where is Kirito diving from?

287
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:12,062
I know you know, so you better tell me now.

288
00:17:12,193 --> 00:17:12,524
Mm...

289
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:15,305
That's confidential.

290
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,151
Eh, okay, okay. I'll tell you.

291
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,707
I set up the room myself, so he's safe.

292
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:24,796
Security's rock‐solid, and
the monitoring's top of the line.

293
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:28,035
I've got a trained professional
right by his side at all times,

294
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:30,810
and I guarantee that his body's in no danger whatsoever.

295
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:31,868
Where is he?!

296
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:33,720
A hospital.

297
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,548
It's in Ochanomizu in Chiyoda ward.

298
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:37,672
He's in Chiyoda?

299
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:41,595
Wait. Is that the same hospital
he was in during his rehabilitation?

300
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,215
Yes, that's the one.

301
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:47,414
I'm going over there. I want to see
him, and you can't do a thing about it.

302
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,327
Tell me you got a plan.

303
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,326
We're going to take out Death Gun.

304
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,763
Once we do,

305
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:03,285
His real world partner'll stand down.

306
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:05,502
Then he'll just leave your apartment.

307
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,037
Okay, but he's skilled,

308
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,415
Black Star or no Black Star.

309
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:15,270
You saw. He dodged Hecate's
bullet from just 100 meters away.

310
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:20,111
And besides, I can't hide in this cave forever, you know.

311
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:24,338
By now, the other players probably
figured out the two of us are in here.

312
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,388
We might as well be sitting ducks.

313
00:18:26,668 --> 00:18:30,001
It's just a matter of time
before someone tosses a grenade in.

314
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,154
You're right.

315
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,160
We've been a team this whole time anyway, right?

316
00:18:34,718 --> 00:18:36,477
Might as well finish it together.

317
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:37,692
Okay,

318
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:40,787
But there's still the risk he shoots you with that gun.

319
00:18:41,147 --> 00:18:42,309
Oh, that thing.

320
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:44,979
It's just an old‐school single‐action sidearm.

321
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:48,291
He can fire it all he wants, but I got you there.

322
00:18:48,612 --> 00:18:50,420
Just deflect the bullets with your sword.

323
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,450
Right, and I won't let a single one of 'em hit you.

324
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:56,487
I still don't feel good about you being out there, though.

325
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,976
I mean, Death Gun's dangerous, and
you shouldn't get too close to him.

326
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,652
Oh, come on.

327
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:06,389
Hang on. I'm totally cool with you fighting
with me, and I wouldn't have it any other way,

328
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,451
But, Sinon, you're a sniper, remember?

329
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,887
Isn't your specialty the long‐range attack?

330
00:19:12,145 --> 00:19:14,022
Well, yeah. What about it?

331
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:15,517
Here's the plan.

332
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,929
On the next scan, I'm gonna
step outside so it picks me up.

333
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:21,350
That way, we'll get Death Gun to come to us.

334
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,925
He'll probably keep his distance and take cover.

335
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,354
Then he'll try to pick me off with his rifle.

336
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:30,257
When he shoots, we'll know where
he is, and then you take him out.

337
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:31,487
What do you think?

338
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:33,787
Are you cool with playing the decoy?

339
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:34,567
Mm‐hmm.

340
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,770
All right. We do it your way then.

341
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,309
Just be careful out there, 'cause
if he drops you with his first shot,

342
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:42,662
I'm gonna be pissed.

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,328
Heh. I'll keep that in mind.

344
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:47,454
Wait. I just remembered.

345
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:51,250
His rifle's got a silencer, and you
won't see the bullet line on the first shot.

346
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,601
Oh, I'll just predict the prediction,

347
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:56,438
You know, like a certain no‐good faker told...

348
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,664
Um, I think we should stop talking.

349
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,497
Uh...

350
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,884
Ugh. Oh, crap.

351
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:07,809
We should have been paying more attention.

352
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:09,027
What is it?

353
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:10,965
And will it kill us?

354
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,002
It's a live‐stream camera.

355
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:14,960
Usually they're only supposed to shadow.

356
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,532
Players on the battlefield.

357
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,510
I guess this one's in here now 'cause
there aren't many of us left out there.

358
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,067
Then do you...

359
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,536
Think it heard us?

360
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,863
Not a chance. For it to pick us up,

361
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:28,353
We'd have to be shouting at the top of our lungs.

362
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,219
Wave to the audience.

363
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:32,940
Unless you got someone back at home.

364
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,494
You don't want seeing this.

365
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,446
Uh, I, um...

366
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,778
Shouldn't you be worried who's watching?

367
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:45,452
I mean, since I sort of look like a girl,
they might, you know, think you're, you know.

368
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:48,809
I don't care. They can think what they want.

369
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:51,566
The guys in this game are dorks. If they think I'm gay,

370
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:54,403
at least they'll stop hitting on me every five seconds.

371
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,564
How much longer am I gonna have
to keep pretending to be a girl?

372
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,252
Oh, you poor baby.

373
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:03,862
You've been faking it like a champ since you
logged in. Another hour or two won't matter.

374
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,376
Thank god.

375
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:09,516
We better get ready.

376
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,104
We got two minutes before the next sat scan.

377
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:14,592
I'll set up here.

378
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:17,264
When you get outside, fire up your terminal,

379
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:19,338
and let me know when our boy's close.

380
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:24,812
Wait. Hold on.

381
00:21:25,265 --> 00:21:26,683
Why? What's wrong?

382
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,291
It's too late to change the plan now.

383
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,983
No, I don't want to change anything.

384
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,633
It's something else.

385
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:36,878
I was just thinking about Death Gun's real handle here.

386
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:40,321
The only name you didn't recognize
who's still alive is Sterben.

387
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,661
Oh. Huh.

388
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,338
I guess that's him then.

389
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:46,394
I wonder why he gave himself that name, though.

390
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,949
If I get up close and personal,

391
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,709
I'll be sure to ask him for you.

392
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:54,845
Well, here goes nothing.

393
00:21:57,729 --> 00:21:59,048
Be careful, okay?

394
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:38,387
Next time: "Bullet of a Phantom".
