1
00:00:00,853 --> 00:00:01,993
Hey, guys!

2
00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:05,566
We might not take down this boss,

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,566
but the next one,

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,612
I promise that one's ours!

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:14,711
Sorry, guys.

6
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:16,544
Stand down.

7
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,672
You're not getting past me.

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,400
Kirito!

9
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,405
You sure you wanna do this, buddy?

10
00:00:25,543 --> 00:00:26,919
It's a bad idea.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,169
I doubt even you can take on a horde this big solo.

12
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:31,569
Yeah, maybe.

13
00:00:32,207 --> 00:00:34,561
There's only one way to find out for sure.

14
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:35,874
It's your funeral.

15
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:38,207
Okay, people, you heard the man.

16
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,726
Mages, let him have it.

17
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,668
Eck, bulbah, ein, sreal.

18
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,049
Watch out, Kirito!

19
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:53,197
Smugah, steckle... Iskaldol, skeal...

20
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:55,317
orbinul!

21
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:47,990
Heh.

22
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,969
No way.

23
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,197
He cut their spells.

24
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:10,790
But that's impossible.

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,660
Eh, I didn't know he could do stuff like that.

26
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:15,289
Now you know.

27
00:03:16,274 --> 00:03:17,964
How'd you do that?

28
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:19,254
Easy.

29
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:24,851
Compared to a bullet from a high‐powered
rifle, knocking down high‐speed spells is nothing.

30
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:25,944
Ah, crap.

31
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,977
B‐battle formation on the double!

32
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:37,267
Eck, bulbah, sreal... Eck, skeatoh,
sreal... I can only hold 'em for a couple!

33
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,564
Head for the boss room! Hurry!

34
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,283
Oh, yeah? Hold your ground!

35
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,672
There's only one of him!

36
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,262
Not even!

37
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:57,592
I'm here, too!

38
00:03:57,998 --> 00:04:00,558
You just can't see me yet!

39
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:03,282
You're late! What the hell took you so long?

40
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,189
Sorry, man! Took a wrong turn.

41
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:07,996
Klein's here, too?

42
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,131
Thank you, Yui.

43
00:04:15,686 --> 00:04:17,413
You, too, Klein.

44
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,352
And, Kirito, I love you.

45
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:29,549
My friends will take care of those players,

46
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:31,762
but if we want to get into the boss room today,

47
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:34,328
we'll have to get through the ones blocking it ourselves.

48
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:35,312
Gotcha!

49
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,585
Ready?

50
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:42,979
Yup!

51
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,944
Hey! No fair!

52
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:50,421
Think you can heal them on your own for a bit?

53
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:52,860
Sure. I should have enough mana for that.

54
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:56,239
Great. Then I'm gonna take care of those enemy mages.

55
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:09,384
Yuuki! Watch out!

56
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:10,728
Huh?

57
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,447
Whoa! Whaah!

58
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,296
It's the berserk healer!

59
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,864
All right, guys. The hard part's next.

60
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:50,761
Come on. Let's get that boss.

61
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:51,669
Right!

62
00:07:23,906 --> 00:07:25,939
Yeah. We will beat him.

63
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:33,625
Okay, drink your potions, guys.

64
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:35,405
Max out your HP and MP.

65
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,524
Stick to the plan, and we'll have a shot.

66
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,672
We know at the start, its attack patterns are simple.

67
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:44,419
Stay calm, and avoid them.

68
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:49,919
Hmm?

69
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:51,172
Asuna...

70
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,928
Those guys, those friends of yours,

71
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:57,449
are they here just to help us?

72
00:07:59,131 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes.

73
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:01,836
They know it's important to you,

74
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:04,717
so let's pull this raid off
and make it worth their effort.

75
00:08:05,672 --> 00:08:06,631
Yeah, but...

76
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:11,838
I mean, we can't let you do all this
and not give you anything in return.

77
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,448
But you have.

78
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:18,592
You taught me something I'm always going to remember.

79
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:22,218
Sometimes you have to fight
to get your point across, right?

80
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:25,054
Mm‐hmm.

81
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,090
Well, this is our last chance at this.

82
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:35,481
Time's running out.

83
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,249
It won't be long before that guild
regroups and comes charging through that door.

84
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:41,359
Let's do our best to win

85
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:44,143
so we can flash them a victory sign when they do.

86
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,547
Hey, Yuuki, when this battle is over, I
want you to tell me all about yourself.

87
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,692
I want to know about all the worlds you've been to

88
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:57,006
and all the adventures you've had.

89
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,675
Here comes the boss, guys!

90
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,169
Let's mess him up!

91
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:24,307
Right!

92
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,709
Seh‐ah, filla! Seh‐ah, filla!

93
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:27,581
Only three left.

94
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:30,152
You guys, we're almost there!

95
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:31,675
Don't let up on him!

96
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:32,869
Right!

97
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:49,446
That boss sure knows how to defend itself.

98
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,322
You think that's a random move, using his arms to block?

99
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,437
Siune, I have an idea, and I need your help.

100
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:57,876
Can you take over healing for thirty seconds?

101
00:10:57,945 --> 00:10:59,865
Yes, that shouldn't be a problem.

102
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,011
I have enough reserves to cover everyone.

103
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:05,528
Eck, skeat, fio‐ril, iskaldol, ale!

104
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,743
I knew it. That wasn't random.

105
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:20,273
It's protecting a critical weak spot with that move.

106
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,141
You see that Jewel on its chest?

107
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:23,990
That's where we need to focus our attack.

108
00:11:24,034 --> 00:11:26,817
So we just shatter that Jewel, and we can defeat it?

109
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:29,494
At the very least, we'll put a dent in its HP.

110
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:34,042
Thing is, it's too high up to reach,
and we can't fly in this dungeon.

111
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:37,721
Then we'll just use our sword skills
and keep an eye out for countermoves.

112
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:38,684
Sounds good.

113
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,589
I'll go up front and tell them the plan.

114
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:42,655
Heal them for a little longer, okay?

115
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:43,963
Don't worry. I'm on it!

116
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:48,939
Yuuki!

117
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,574
Asuna! What's going on?

118
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,187
Guess what. I found a weak spot on the boss.

119
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:56,999
You see that Jewel on its chest, below the necks?

120
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,381
If you hit that, you'll do some major damage.

121
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:00,400
You sure?

122
00:12:03,283 --> 00:12:04,726
Here ya go!

123
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,219
It's high.

124
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,522
I couldn't reach it, even if I jumped.

125
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,134
You could if you had the right springboard, though.

126
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,572
Huh?

127
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,743
Tecchi!

128
00:12:20,677 --> 00:12:22,374
When he swings that hammer again,

129
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:23,500
take a knee!

130
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:24,839
Mm.

131
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,807
It's our chance to win.

132
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,311
Good luck, Yuuki!

133
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:33,952
Leave it to me, sis!

134
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:36,072
Uh, "sis"?

135
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:39,078
We did it.

136
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:40,998
You see that?!

137
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,257
We did it! We did it! We did it!

138
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:47,875
We beat him, Asuna!

139
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,775
That, we did.

140
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,193
I'm so tired.

141
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:54,914
We did it.

142
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,352
Yeah, but I'm wiped.

143
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:09,886
Oh, my god.

144
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,034
You...

145
00:14:19,564 --> 00:14:21,180
you... you...

146
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:25,077
you gotta be kidding me!

147
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:33,071
Yay! All right!

148
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,770
Great job, you guys!

149
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,842
I'm kind of sad it's over.

150
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,017
Oh, it's not over yet.

151
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:40,598
Huh?

152
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,431
There's one last thing to do.

153
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,257
Um...

154
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:45,887
You know, a party?

155
00:14:46,904 --> 00:14:47,515
Oh!

156
00:14:48,282 --> 00:14:49,182
Of course!

157
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,120
Let's have a big one.

158
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:54,119
We'll pull out all the stops.

159
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,029
Sweet! We got enough now to party in style, right?

160
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,051
Mm‐hmm.

161
00:14:58,102 --> 00:14:59,225
Where are we gonna have it?

162
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,706
Hey, we should go to some big city
and buy out a restaurant for the night.

163
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:04,419
Um... What?

164
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:07,241
Actually, if you guys want to,

165
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:09,453
we could have it at my place in‐game.

166
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,608
It's small, but cozy.

167
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:12,946
Really?!

168
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:15,352
Oh.

169
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:17,519
Y‐Yuuki, is something wrong?

170
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:19,926
Um...

171
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:22,780
Please forgive us, Asuna.

172
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,869
We really appreciate your offer to host the party.

173
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:27,674
It's just that...

174
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,429
Oh, never mind. It's nothing.

175
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,957
We'd be honored to have our
victory party at your home, Asuna.

176
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:51,473
That settles it.

177
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:54,718
Guys, we're heading over to the lombard central market.

178
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:57,034
We got ourselves some shopping to do.

179
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,384
Hell to the yes!

180
00:15:58,409 --> 00:15:59,923
Let's get some of that ale!

181
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:06,421
Wow.

182
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,849
Your place is so cool, Asuna.

183
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:13,343
Wait. There's already food and drinks out.

184
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:14,187
Whoa.

185
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:15,994
Now that's what I'm talking 'bout!

186
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:17,923
Man, look at that thing. Smells amazing.

187
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:19,617
Ah, it smells so good.

188
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:20,737
I'm gonna dig in, okay?

189
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:22,510
Put those over there, yeah?

190
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:37,051
You're not scared of a little alkie‐hol, are ya?

191
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:39,792
No! I just wanna pace myself.

192
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,530
Okay, so the worst MMO I ever played was...

193
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,400
This one from the US called insec‐site.

194
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,565
That one's bad.

195
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,528
Really? Why didn't you like it?

196
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,156
Bugs everywhere!

197
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:56,190
If it were just the monsters, no
problem, but you gotta play as a bug!

198
00:16:56,503 --> 00:17:00,221
I had to play as a bipedal ant,
so I guess I didn't have it too bad,

199
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:02,118
but you should've seen her.

200
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:04,325
No! Please don't say anything!

201
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:06,474
She was a giant caterpillar!

202
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,314
Spittin' silk like whoo!

203
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,597
That's awesome.

204
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,901
Sounds like you got to travel to
some really cool places together.

205
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:21,465
How 'bout you? I mean, you come off
like you've been playing VRMMOs forever.

206
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:22,638
Do I?

207
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:25,755
Well, I play this one a lot.

208
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:30,067
I can't tell you how many hours it
took to get the money to buy this cabin.

209
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,476
Worth it.

210
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:35,191
You know, when you said this place was cozy,

211
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,444
you weren't kidding.

212
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:39,710
It's got this really cool old‐timey vibe.

213
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:41,575
Yes, it does.

214
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,131
It's so peaceful, I could sit here all day.

215
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:48,041
W‐What's wrong, Siune?

216
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,974
I'm so sorry, but I just remembered.

217
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:52,384
When we asked you to help,

218
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,405
we said we'd give you whatever the boss dropped in return.

219
00:17:55,508 --> 00:18:00,794
It was money, though, and we spent a
lot of it on food and drink for our party.

220
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,477
What have we done?

221
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,193
Aw, man.

222
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:10,670
Crap! Now we don't have anything to give you.

223
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,757
No, it's okay.

224
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,617
How about a favor instead?

225
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,000
Favor?

226
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:18,862
Uh‐huh.

227
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:22,752
Honestly, I'm a little sad the quest is over.

228
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:25,882
I want to get to know you better, Yuuki.

229
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:28,837
There are so many things I want to ask you.

230
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:30,507
Asuna,

231
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,520
sometimes you gotta fight to get your point across.

232
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:38,211
Yuuki...

233
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:40,844
Would you let me join the sleeping knights?

234
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:52,243
Asuna, I wish you could, but...

235
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:56,057
It's like this is a temporary thing for us,

236
00:18:56,758 --> 00:18:59,543
and, like, come spring, we'll be splitting up,

237
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:01,565
and after that,

238
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,506
I doubt any of us'll be diving much any more.

239
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,159
I know, but can I join until then?

240
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:09,309
I want us to be friends.

241
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,515
I want to be friends with all of you.

242
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,103
There's still enough time for that, isn't there?

243
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:18,537
I‐I'm sorry, Asuna.

244
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:21,401
You can't. Sorry.

245
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,712
Not at all. It's fine.

246
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:28,123
I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that, Yuuki.

247
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,149
I'm sorry.

248
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,922
Um, Asuna,

249
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,486
I don't... you see, we...

250
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,727
No, really, you don't have to be.

251
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:40,191
Sorry I was so pushy.

252
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:41,737
Anyway, come on.

253
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:42,849
Let's go check it out.

254
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,038
What?

255
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:46,329
The reason we beat the boss, remember?

256
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:49,199
You know, the monument in the black iron palace.

257
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,416
I'm sure it's been updated by now.

258
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,775
Yeah, guys! Let's go! Oh.

259
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,568
Know what we should do?

260
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:57,125
We should take our picture with it.

261
00:19:57,156 --> 00:19:59,344
Good idea. Best one yet.

262
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:01,033
Oh, my gosh... Come on, guys.

263
00:20:01,071 --> 00:20:01,586
Let's go!

264
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:03,228
Hey, let's go.

265
00:20:21,948 --> 00:20:22,930
There it is!

266
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,967
Hey! Wait for me! Hold up!

267
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:35,083
Look. Up there.

268
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:45,038
There we are.

269
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,270
We got our names on it.

270
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:54,210
Hey, guys, let's take that picture!

271
00:20:55,357 --> 00:20:56,467
Come on, Yuuki.

272
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,247
Big smile.

273
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:23,475
There it is. You did it.

274
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:26,996
Yeah, I finally did, huh, sis?

275
00:21:28,277 --> 00:21:29,829
There you go again, Yuuki.

276
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:30,746
What?

277
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,600
You called me sis just now, that's what.

278
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,774
And in the boss room, too.

279
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:38,027
It's fine.

280
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,540
It makes me happy.

281
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,286
W‐What's wrong?

282
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:51,286
Asuna...

283
00:21:51,752 --> 00:21:53,618
I‐I...

284
00:21:54,694 --> 00:21:55,443
Yuuki.

285
00:23:36,593 --> 00:23:39,053
Next time: "The End of the Journey".
