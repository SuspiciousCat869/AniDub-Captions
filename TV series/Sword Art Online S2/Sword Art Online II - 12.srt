1
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:19,293
Huh. There's no one anywhere near us.

2
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:30,667
Death Gun and Sinon aren't on the map,

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,380
but counting them, there's six players left.

4
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:34,953
Huh?

5
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:37,375
They took each other out.

6
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,370
That leaves four.

7
00:00:43,729 --> 00:00:44,912
30 players started.

8
00:00:44,952 --> 00:00:47,387
24 are out, so that leaves six.

9
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,040
Me and Yamikaze

10
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,287
and Sinon and Death Gun,

11
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,428
that's 28,

12
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:54,902
and Pale Rider makes it 29.

13
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,568
We're short a player.

14
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:04,335
Did Death Gun murder someone else after he got Pale Rider?

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,016
No. His partner's been waiting at Sinon's for his cue.

16
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,207
He can't be two places at once.

17
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,864
Unless...

18
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,832
There's another angle to this I'm missing.

19
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,919
Well, what'd you find?

20
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,679
There's five of us left,

21
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,325
you, me, Yamikaze...

22
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:12,251
I didn't see Death Gun, though.

23
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,105
And there's another player out there somewhere.

24
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:19,027
The scan didn't pick him up, so
they might be hiding in a cave like us.

25
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:21,391
That's it, just us five?

26
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:26,098
Well, it's been an hour and 45 minutes already.

27
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,036
Seeing as how the last BOB ended in about two hours,

28
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:32,026
this one's right on schedule.

29
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:35,944
Heh. I'm surprised no one's chucked a grenade in here yet.

30
00:03:36,295 --> 00:03:39,389
Yeah. Maybe we've got Death Gun to thank for that.

31
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,259
Could be while he's looking for us, he's
whittling down the competition with that rifle of his.

32
00:03:46,563 --> 00:03:47,391
If you're right,

33
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:50,071
then he's a shoo‐in for the max‐kills award.

34
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,354
Whatever.

35
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,390
We should worry about Yamikaze.

36
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,393
You were probably the only one
who showed up on his terminal,

37
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,356
so we better get ready, 'cause he'll be coming for you.

38
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:01,953
He any good?

39
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,592
He was runner‐up in the last BOB.

40
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,214
He's your typical full‐on AGI type.

41
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,338
They call him the Run‐Gun Demon or something.

42
00:04:09,544 --> 00:04:11,437
Uh, run what?

43
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,721
Run and gun.

44
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:15,678
You run, shoot, run. It's a style of combat.

45
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,745
His main weapon's a Calico M900A,

46
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,377
an ultralight submachine gun.

47
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:25,435
Yamikaze couldn't compete with Zxe‐D's
rare gun and armor in the last tourney,

48
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,129
but even though he didn't win,

49
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,255
some people say he's the better player.

50
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,856
Whoa. He's really that good?

51
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:40,457
Like the best player on Japan's "GGO" server good?

52
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,401
Yeah, he is,

53
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:45,156
and he might be our ace in the hole, too.

54
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:48,846
If you're right about Death Gun, then
I'm the only one he's ready to kill.

55
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:53,489
You know, 'cause his partner's
waiting back at my apartment right now.

56
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:59,363
See, I figure that if that's the case,
Yamikaze's not in any real danger of getting killed.

57
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:01,840
This is gonna sound cold,

58
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:05,452
but I was thinking he would make the perfect decoy for us.

59
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:09,069
When Death Gun shoots Yamikaze, we'll know where he is.

60
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,401
In a way, we got two decoys,

61
00:05:13,777 --> 00:05:16,125
him in here and me IRL.

62
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,393
You're pretty brave, Sinon.

63
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,390
Huh?

64
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,787
Not even. I'm trying not to think about it,

65
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,643
trying to avoid what scares me, like I always do.

66
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:30,043
Anyway, you think it'll work?

67
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:33,405
Yeah. I mean, it sounds pretty good.

68
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,667
Although there's still one thing that bothers me.

69
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:41,551
Just now, when I added up the
players who were left and who were done,

70
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:43,659
I could only come up with 28.

71
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:47,247
Pale Rider's 29, but still, we're short one.

72
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:51,488
No way. Could Death Gun have killed
someone else after he tried for me?

73
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:56,634
How's that even possible? I mean, his number
two's supposed be waiting at my place now.

74
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:59,165
Right. That's how I figured it, too,

75
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:02,800
but now I'm thinking something else is going on.

76
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:09,254
Between the time Death Gun shot Pale Rider and
when he tried for you, only 30 minutes had gone by,

77
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,734
so based on my theory,

78
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:16,325
Pale Rider's apartment would have to be no
more than 30 minutes away from your place.

79
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,856
That's kind of convenient, don't you think?

80
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,214
I guess, but what other explanation is there for it?

81
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:25,275
Maybe Death Gun isn't working with just the one guy.

82
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,768
Like maybe he's got a few more partners.

83
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,836
If he does, then it'd be possible to kill one player

84
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,973
while still having someone available to kill you

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,063
and one for Yamikaze.

86
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:41,895
He could be a target now, too. I don't know. I don't know.

87
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,310
Oh, my god.

88
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:53,487
If you're right and there's more of 'em
out there, how many more are we talking about?

89
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,602
If they're all ex‐Laughing Coffin,

90
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,874
at least 10, maybe more.

91
00:06:58,662 --> 00:07:00,785
I doubt they're all involved with this,

92
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:04,884
but we can't be sure there's only one
real‐world killer out there anymore.

93
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:10,206
They're crazy. Why else would they do
this after getting out of "SAO" alive?

94
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,743
How could anyone stay a player‐killer after that game?

95
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,535
For the same reason as us.

96
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,539
Why do I keep being a swordsman

97
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:22,909
and you a sniper?

98
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:28,184
I called 'em PKers, but I take it back.

99
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,622
There are lots of people who PK in this game.

100
00:07:32,158 --> 00:07:34,733
I used to run with a squad of PKers myself.

101
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:38,397
But at the end of the day, Pkers
have a code of honor they stick to.

102
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:40,210
They're not PKers.

103
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:42,966
They kill people with poison while they're unconscious

104
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,677
like a bunch of cowards.

105
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,638
There's no honor in murder.

106
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:50,122
That's chickenshit, straight up,

107
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,301
and we can't let them get away with it.

108
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,516
No, we can't.

109
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:58,135
We've got a chance to stop these
people, and we're gonna take it.

110
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,843
Death Gun's going down on this battlefield.

111
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,345
It's over for him and his pals.

112
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:04,864
I'll make 'em all pay.

113
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:07,243
Yeah,

114
00:08:07,635 --> 00:08:10,241
this is how I make amends for what I did,

115
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,251
for losing it in the chaos of battle,

116
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:16,272
for killing those two players that night

117
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:18,589
and the other one later on.

118
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:20,815
This is how I'll get closure.

119
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:23,701
I'll protect Sinon,

120
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:25,064
take out Yamikaze,

121
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,511
and end Death Gun.

122
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:29,715
It won't be easy, but it's what I have to do.

123
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm gonna take Yamikaze out.

124
00:08:33,404 --> 00:08:35,445
I won't let Death Gun kill him.

125
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,068
Huh?

126
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:37,871
Yamikaze's tough.

127
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,638
I doubt even you could finish him with one hit,

128
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:44,206
and if he's busy with you, Death Gun's sure to go for him.

129
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,747
Then how are we gonna deal with that?

130
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:48,398
Did you forget what I am?

131
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:50,924
I'm a sniper.

132
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,153
I'll have eyes on you the whole time, so
once they move on you, I'll know their locations.

133
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:59,542
I'll hit Yamikaze first. Then I'll go for Death Gun.

134
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:01,290
Okay, then.

135
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,107
We go with your plan.

136
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:05,795
All right.

137
00:09:05,874 --> 00:09:07,999
I think they should be pretty close by now.

138
00:09:08,475 --> 00:09:10,361
I'm gonna hop on the buggy and head out.

139
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:12,756
Leave the cave right after I do,

140
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,679
and get set up as fast as you can.

141
00:09:23,932 --> 00:09:25,527
Good luck out there, partner.

142
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:56,782
Yamikaze's coming from the west,

143
00:09:56,975 --> 00:10:00,410
so if a shot comes from the
east, it'll probably be Death Gun.

144
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,122
He's got that cloak, so when
he shoots, he'll be invisible.

145
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,577
If he hits Kirito in the heart or head, it's over.

146
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,146
But if you can cut my bullet in half,

147
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,857
you can dodge his, right?

148
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:16,503
Right, Kirito?

149
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:21,311
My first priority is taking Yamikaze out of the picture.

150
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:24,038
If I miss, Kirito will get shot.

151
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:27,033
Then Death Gun will find me and kill me.

152
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,360
My life, my real life,

153
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:34,262
depends on a single bullet, like it did that day.

154
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,236
Please, Hecate.

155
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:44,337
I'm weak, and I need your strength,

156
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,127
the strength to stand up for myself

157
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:48,373
and move on.

158
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,774
Southwest.

159
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,508
That's Yamikaze.

160
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:18,740
Don't worry. Sinon's got him.

161
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:23,385
Whoa.

162
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:28,063
What do I do?

163
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,445
I could try to shoot in front of him

164
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:33,627
or shoot at his feet, hope he
panics, and then take him out.

165
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:41,929
No. Once he's got Kirito in
range, he'll stop to steady his aim.

166
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:43,959
I have to wait till he does.

167
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:46,190
I'll be patient.

168
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,091
Don't worry, Kirito.

169
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,511
I've got your back.

170
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,598
Concentrate.

171
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,844
Home in on his drive to kill

172
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:08,194
like last time.

173
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:21,019
That's right.

174
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,738
I could feel their lust for murder.

175
00:12:24,152 --> 00:12:25,613
That's how I noticed 'em.

176
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,596
The first guy who attacked me,

177
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:33,033
what was his name?

178
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:43,390
Kirito, someday I'll kill you properly.

179
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,835
Someday I'll kill you properly.

180
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,443
Yamikaze.

181
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,176
Kirito.

182
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:16,623
Gotcha.

183
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,883
It's up to you now, Kirito.

184
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:01,510
She did it.

185
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,805
Now it's my turn.

186
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:31,889
Kirito.

187
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:37,086
Don't worry, mommy.

188
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,480
No matter how strong his enemy is, daddy wont lose.

189
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:43,315
He's daddy, after all.

190
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:46,305
Yeah, you're right.

191
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,371
Turn left. His room is eight meters down.

192
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:52,661
Kirigaya?

193
00:15:55,793 --> 00:15:56,793
Kirito!

194
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,217
Miss Yuuki, right?

195
00:15:58,592 --> 00:15:59,879
We've been expecting you.

196
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,687
Is something wrong with Ki... I mean Kazuto?

197
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:04,261
No, he's okay.

198
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:06,779
I know it looks bad, but he's not in danger.

199
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:08,799
His heart rate spiked, is all.

200
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,789
His heart rate?

201
00:16:13,226 --> 00:16:15,286
Why? What's going on?

202
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:18,927
Mommy, look to your right at the monitor on the wall.

203
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:22,306
I'm going to patch in the live
footage from the MMO stream.

204
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:24,462
Huh?

205
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,550
Is that Kirito?

206
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:40,254
That's Kirigaya's avatar from the game he's diving in now?

207
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:42,373
Uh‐huh. He's in battle.

208
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,421
I think that's why his heart's racing so much.

209
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:49,689
An Estoc.

210
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:53,477
That's it.

211
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:56,691
One of Laughing Coffin's leaders
was a master with an Estoc,

212
00:16:56,938 --> 00:16:59,499
but what was he called?

213
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:02,259
"Sterben"?

214
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:04,769
Isn't it supposed to be Steven?

215
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:05,536
It's not.

216
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:06,520
She's right.

217
00:17:06,788 --> 00:17:08,153
It's a German word.

218
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:11,196
I know it. It's a medical term we use.

219
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,844
It's pronounced "shterben".

220
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,297
"Shterben"?

221
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,654
It means "to die."

222
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:22,926
In hospitals, we use that word
when a patient's passed away.

223
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,226
Kirito.

224
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:36,946
Heh.

225
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,423
That's an interesting weapon you've got there.

226
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,993
If I'd known there were metal swords in
"GGO", I would have gotten my hands on one.

227
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,999
You should have done your homework
before logging in, black swordsman.

228
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:52,243
I made this with the weapon creation skill.

229
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,576
It can't be any longer or heavier,

230
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,101
but it does the trick.

231
00:17:56,502 --> 00:18:00,937
Wow. If that's the best sword I can make, then
I guess I couldn't make one I'd be happy with.

232
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:04,553
Still into swords with high strength requirements?

233
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,308
You haven't changed.

234
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:08,315
Must be pretty tough for you,

235
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,638
having to twirl that flashlight around.

236
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:15,441
This thing's not as bad as all that.

237
00:18:16,112 --> 00:18:19,153
I always wondered what it'd be
like to fight with one of these.

238
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,981
Besides, a sword's a sword.

239
00:18:22,217 --> 00:18:24,827
If I can slash you and burn through your HP with it,

240
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,307
it's good enough for me.

241
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,299
You talk a good game,

242
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,787
but it's all talk.

243
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:36,068
You sucked in too much rotten air from the real world.

244
00:18:36,394 --> 00:18:39,182
That half‐ass vorpal strike you just pulled,

245
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:42,405
if the old you saw it, he'd shake his head.

246
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:44,068
Maybe so,

247
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:46,586
but the same goes for you, too.

248
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,393
You're living in the past.

249
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:51,562
I bet you think you're still a member of Laughing Coffin.

250
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:55,854
You remember.

251
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,636
I'm impressed.

252
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:02,154
Then I guess you understand
the difference between you and me.

253
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,418
I'm a genuine red player,

254
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,121
while you are not.

255
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:14,253
You killed only because you were scared,

256
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:17,010
scared and desperate to survive.

257
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,890
And instead of facing it,

258
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:21,186
I bet you tried to forget it even happened,

259
00:19:21,385 --> 00:19:23,788
just like a coward.

260
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:26,725
I might be a coward,

261
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:30,148
but still, I'll stop you from killing again.

262
00:19:31,277 --> 00:19:34,069
I figured out how Zxe‐D and the others were murdered.

263
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,173
It's got nothing to do with that handgun of yours,

264
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,790
and you don't have special powers either.

265
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:42,678
How'd those people die then?

266
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,843
Back at the terminals at the governor's office,

267
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:50,284
you used that cloak to scope out the
addresses of the BOB Contestants.

268
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,496
Then you had someone break into their apartments

269
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:56,869
and timed it so when you fired,
they'd inject a drug into 'em,

270
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,564
making it look like they died of heart failure.

271
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:01,112
That's how you did it.

272
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:08,436
The ministry of internal affairs has the in‐game and
real‐world info of every single player from "SAO".

273
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:12,082
Once they get your handle,
they'll find out your real name,

274
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,049
your real address, and all the evil shit you've ever done.

275
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,860
It's only a matter of time.

276
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,079
It's all over for you,

277
00:20:21,656 --> 00:20:24,158
so log out, and turn yourself in.

278
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:27,368
You think you've got it all figured out,

279
00:20:28,547 --> 00:20:29,677
but you don't.

280
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,645
And you can't stop me.

281
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:34,851
Want to know why?

282
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:39,716
Because I know you'll never remember what my handle was.

283
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:41,505
You think so?

284
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,693
What makes you so sure I won't?

285
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,148
You don't even remember the reason
you forgot it in the first place.

286
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:51,655
Think back.

287
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:55,101
After that battle between your group and mine,

288
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:57,360
I tried to tell you my name,

289
00:20:58,428 --> 00:21:00,463
but you said...

290
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,475
There's no point in giving me your name.

291
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:07,114
I don't want to know it.

292
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:10,565
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see you again.

293
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:17,396
You can't remember my handle,

294
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:19,115
and you never will.

295
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,211
I never gave it to you,

296
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,994
and now I'm going to cut you down.

297
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:28,537
I'll leave you lying here, watching
helplessly as I kill the girl,

298
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:31,181
and you can't stop me!

299
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,449
Stings, doesn't it?

300
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:50,937
This is made from the best metal you can get in the game.

301
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:56,003
It's armor plating from a space battleship.

302
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:37,773
Next time: "Phantom Bullet".
