1
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:10,757
A‐Asada!

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,264
No.

3
00:00:13,488 --> 00:00:15,448
Let go of me! No!

4
00:00:18,462 --> 00:00:20,519
Asada. Asada.

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,465
Asada! Asada!

6
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:24,225
Asada! Asada!

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:25,592
Asada!

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,843
Run, Sinon!

9
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:36,975
Kirito.

10
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,806
What the hell? Get off me!

11
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:47,873
Bastard! It's all your fault.

12
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:49,625
She's mine.

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,155
She's mine, damn it!

14
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:53,681
Stay away from her!

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,615
Kirito!

16
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:20,498
Kirito.

17
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:21,737
He got me.

18
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,857
It happened so fast.

19
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:25,666
Didn't even see the needle.

20
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,102
I know. I'm gonna take a look, okay?

21
00:01:31,952 --> 00:01:32,975
Hang on.

22
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,402
I'm not gonna let you die like this.

23
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,277
Um, hey...

24
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:08,847
You got this weird thing on your chest.

25
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,670
Please tell me that's where he hit me with the needle.

26
00:02:15,095 --> 00:02:17,067
It looks like it, I guess.

27
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,776
What is that thing, anyway?

28
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:24,222
It's one of the electrodes from
this heart monitor I was hooked up to.

29
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,714
Heart monitor?

30
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:27,396
Never mind.

31
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,324
You know, you scared the hell out of me.

32
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,538
I scared you?!

33
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,134
How do you think I feel?!

34
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:34,929
I thought you were gonna die just now, you dumb‐ass!

35
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:37,232
Hey! Easy!

36
00:02:42,534 --> 00:02:43,102
Mm.

37
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:50,180
He's not dead, is he?

38
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:58,542
Nah, he's still got a pulse.

39
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:10,009
You're crazy,

40
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:12,242
but thank you for coming over.

41
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:15,368
No, thank you for clocking him when you did.

42
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:17,927
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.

43
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:23,099
Uh, you okay?

44
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,545
Mm‐hmm.

45
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,697
I can't wait to see the look on her face.

46
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:06,066
Next time you wanna meet, be on time.

47
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,487
Seriously?

48
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,920
Girl, you been acting way too cocky lately.
She's right. We should teach you a lesson.

49
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:23,837
Nah, you guys. It's cool.

50
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:25,336
We're all friends here, right?

51
00:04:25,714 --> 00:04:27,277
It's good to have friends.

52
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,940
They come in real handy,

53
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,761
especially when you need a loan.

54
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,036
Speaking of, I need 20K, buddy.

55
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,142
I told you before.

56
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:48,562
I'm not lending you guys any money.

57
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,392
You'll change your mind after I
show you what my brother gave me.

58
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:54,605
I doubt it.

59
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:06,315
Get this. He told me not to point
this at anyone, but what does he know?

60
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:10,263
I mean, you've seen one before,
so it doesn't bug you, right?

61
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,948
Or does it, Asada?

62
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:16,954
Get on your knees, and say you're sorry.

63
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:21,897
Waah!

64
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,232
Crap. It's not working.

65
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:39,172
Ow!

66
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:46,136
Government‐Issue M1911.

67
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:48,198
Your brother has good taste.

68
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:50,373
It's not really my style, though.

69
00:05:50,972 --> 00:05:52,455
And for future reference,

70
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:54,547
it only fires when the safety's off.

71
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:12,450
Hey, whoa.

72
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:13,564
Your brother's right.

73
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,601
You shouldn't point this at people.

74
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:18,562
Here.

75
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,481
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

76
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,053
Come on. Get up, Endo.

77
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,830
See you around.

78
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,586
They say the first step's always the hardest.

79
00:06:53,857 --> 00:06:54,467
Huh?

80
00:06:58,894 --> 00:07:01,834
Hey, Asada, do you know that guy?

81
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,634
Is he your boyfriend?

82
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,989
Aww.

83
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:16,017
Really? When I said I'd meet you, I didn't
think you'd park yourself in front of my school.

84
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:16,863
Hmm?

85
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,132
Oh, what's up, Sinon?

86
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:29,244
Kyoji Shinkawa and his older
brother Shoichi were arrested.

87
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,090
During the interrogation,

88
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,669
it came out that another person was involved.

89
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,524
This third Death Gun, Atsushi Kanamoto,

90
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,672
is still out there,

91
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:41,207
but Kikuoka says they'll catch him soon enough.

92
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,925
They got the idea of creating the Death Gun character

93
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:48,119
when Shoichi got the invisibility cloak

94
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:49,602
through a real‐money trade.

95
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,450
Using the cloak and some binoculars,

96
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:57,295
Shoichi started stealing the
real‐world info of the other players.

97
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:02,360
Meanwhile, his little brother Kyoji was
having issues with his avatar, Spiegel.

98
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:07,629
These players who think it's
all about their Agility... Heh...

99
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:09,505
man, they're living in a dream.

100
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:13,297
Spiegel was an Agi‐type, which Zxe‐D used to recommend,

101
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:17,178
but Zxe‐D shifted his stats to a Str‐Vit combo,

102
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,069
and that pissed Kyoji off.

103
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,234
When Shoichi found out,

104
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,392
he gave Kyoji Zxe‐D's name and address IRL.

105
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:27,495
Then they started talking about how to kill him.

106
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,945
They say they weren't serious about it at first,

107
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:34,075
but day after day, the more they talked about it,

108
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,219
the more it seemed they could get away with it.

109
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:39,274
For their plan to work,

110
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:41,567
they needed two things from their dad's hospital,

111
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:45,252
a master key card used to open doors in emergencies

112
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,387
and a lethal drug for the deed.

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,330
They researched their victims carefully,

114
00:08:50,424 --> 00:08:54,634
narrowing the list down to the ones who
lived alone in low‐security apartments.

115
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:56,617
Using the key card,

116
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:59,385
Shoichi broke into their first victim's place,

117
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,858
Shigemura, AKA Zxe‐D.

118
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,040
The brothers worked out the
exact time he was supposed to die,

119
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:09,585
when Kyoji logged in as his brother's avatar Sterben

120
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:12,360
and announced himself as Death Gun and shot Zxe‐D.

121
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:15,714
Their second victim, Usushio Tarako,

122
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,356
was killed the same way.

123
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,533
But instead of being scared of Death Gun,

124
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,903
the other players in "GGO"
treated it like some kind of joke.

125
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:27,793
Shoichi and his partners were furious,

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,127
so they decided to kill some players during the BOB Final.

127
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:36,055
They found three who met the same
criteria as Zxe‐D and Tarako...

128
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:39,712
Pale Rider, Garrett, and Sinon.

129
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,428
Killing three people was gonna make
things hard for just the two of them, though.

130
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah. To be in sync with Death Gun,

131
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:58,843
the person doing the real‐world killing had to
make sure they'd be at each target's house on time.

132
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:04,707
So they recruited that Kanamoto guy you told me about
to be the third Death Gun. Where'd they find him, though?

133
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,963
Simple. Kanamoto was an old friend of Shoichi's.

134
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:11,460
They were both part of Laughing Coffin in "SAO".

135
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,164
We found out his handle there was Johnny Black.

136
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:15,470
That sound familiar?

137
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,193
Yeah. He worked with Xaxa.

138
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,990
I think his weapon of choice was a poison knife.

139
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:25,609
They put Kanamoto on Pale Rider and Garrett,

140
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,775
'cause he lived nearby.

141
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:29,608
Sinon, on the other hand, was Kyoji's.

142
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:33,087
See, Shoichi was the one who usually did the killing,

143
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:34,617
but for this one job,

144
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:37,079
Kyoji insisted on being the one to do it.

145
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,572
Um... Hmm?

146
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,902
Is that what he wanted for real?

147
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,601
Did Shinka... I mean Kyoji say that?

148
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:48,375
No. His brother was the one who
gave us all the details of their plan.

149
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,400
Kyoji still refuses to talk.

150
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:52,041
He does, huh?

151
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:54,160
Speaking of,

152
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:56,338
we found out a little more about Shoichi.

153
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,026
Healthwise, he'd been sickly since childhood.

154
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:04,953
His father pretty much gave up on him, so he
decided early on to hand the hospital over to Kyoji.

155
00:11:05,276 --> 00:11:07,570
Staying sharp, ma'am, locked and loaded.

156
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,468
Even so, the brothers seemed to be close growing up,

157
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:16,572
but then Shoichi got obsessed with MMORPGs, and

158
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,603
in 2022, he got trapped in "Sword Art Online."

159
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:23,598
After he got out,

160
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:26,147
Shoichi only spoke to Kyoji about it.

161
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:31,292
He bragged about how, in that world, he was
a real mass murderer and how he was feared.

162
00:11:31,863 --> 00:11:34,802
In Kyoji's eyes, his big brother was a hero.

163
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:39,840
As for Shoichi, he's sticking with the story
that everything about the Death Gun concept,

164
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,370
including the murders, was just part of a game,

165
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,078
that his actions here,

166
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:49,440
like gathering intel on victims, prepping for the murders,
and committing them, were no different than in "SAO".

167
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:52,135
The dark side of VRMMOs,

168
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,710
that's what it is.

169
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,451
His reality got a lot less real.

170
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,260
Yeah. Good point.

171
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,145
And how are you handling yours?

172
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,832
I feel like I left a part of me back in "SAO",

173
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:09,654
so right now, there's less of
me here than there was before.

174
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,214
I don't know.

175
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:12,375
You don't know?

176
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:13,857
Do you wanna go back?

177
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:16,467
Seriously? How could you ask me that?

178
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,587
Um, wait a sec.

179
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,519
You're kind of contradicting
what you told me the other day.

180
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,123
What?

181
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:25,529
You said there's no such thing
as a virtual world, remember?

182
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:28,426
That, like, wherever you were, that's your reality.

183
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,067
Where I am right now, here,

184
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:33,985
this world is my reality.

185
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:39,416
And even if you told me this was a virtual
world, it would still be reality to me.

186
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:41,556
You see what I mean?

187
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:43,153
I guess.

188
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:45,756
Yeah, you're right.

189
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:47,971
I gotta hand it to you, Sinon.

190
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,852
What you said just now might be the only
good thing to come out of this nightmare.

191
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,412
Oh, put a sock in it.

192
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,240
Sorry, I'm with Kirito on this one.

193
00:12:58,685 --> 00:13:01,705
Well, I told you pretty much all we've found out so far.

194
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:03,662
You have any questions before I go?

195
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:08,179
I do. Has there been any word on
what's gonna happen to Kyoji yet?

196
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,881
Based on his brother's confession and their behavior,

197
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:16,135
they'll most likely be sent to a medical detention center.

198
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,902
I doubt either one knows what reality is anymore.

199
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:22,613
No, I don't think that's true.

200
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:23,179
Hmm?

201
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,606
I don't know anything about Kyoji's brother.

202
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:26,709
I never met him.

203
00:13:26,995 --> 00:13:32,454
But I've known Kyoji a long time, and,
well, I think his reality was "Gun Gale Online."

204
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,315
He had pretty much given up on this world.

205
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:39,259
There was nothing left for him other than "GGO",

206
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,347
so he made that his reality.

207
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:47,176
He'd spend hours in it grinding away,
boosting his XP, and trying to be the best.

208
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,782
I guess the stress got to be too much for him.

209
00:13:50,862 --> 00:13:52,350
From playing a game?

210
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,391
I know you can lose track of time, but reality?

211
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,728
Sure. At some point, Kyoji just
swapped out one for the other,

212
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:02,704
his real life for his virtual one.

213
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:04,822
Okay, but why?

214
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,002
I don't know,

215
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,385
but I wish I did.

216
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:11,589
Kirito, why do you think he did it?

217
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,650
To get stronger.

218
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:15,734
You're right.

219
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:17,849
I guess I was the same way.

220
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:22,719
When it comes down to it, maybe
all us VRMMO players are the same.

221
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,847
All we want is to get stronger.

222
00:14:26,421 --> 00:14:27,722
Mr. Kikuoka,

223
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:30,388
I'd like to go see him if that's all right.

224
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:33,891
There's so much I want to tell him,
like what we were just talking about

225
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:37,226
and other stuff I've been thinking, if it's okay.

226
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,936
Mm. You're a strong person to want to,

227
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,686
and I, for one, think it's a great idea.

228
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:46,365
He can't have visitors yet, but
when he can, I'll let you know.

229
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,131
Well, I have to get back to the office now.

230
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,677
Okay. Thanks for taking the time.

231
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,648
Yes, thank you for talking to us.

232
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:56,993
Don't even mention it.

233
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,505
You guys risked your lives,

234
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:00,241
and god knows how many you saved.

235
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:01,612
It's the least I could do.

236
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,547
Oh, by the way, Kirito,

237
00:15:05,517 --> 00:15:11,915
Death Gun or Shoichi Shinkawa or Red‐Eyed Xaxa or whatever
you want to call him asked me to give you a message.

238
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,796
If you don't want to hear it,
say the word, and I'll tear it up.

239
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:19,897
I'll hear it.

240
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,024
You got it.

241
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,674
He wrote,

242
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,159
"if you think this is over, it's not.

243
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,492
You don't have what it takes to end this.

244
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:30,661
Sooner or later, you'll realize that.

245
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,447
It's showtime."

246
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:33,902
That's it.

247
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,613
Hey, uh, Sinon.

248
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,253
Hmm? What's up?

249
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,343
Are you free right now?

250
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,606
What do you mean, "free"?

251
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:57,511
Free for what?

252
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:08,059
So this is where you're taking me?

253
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,758
Yep. There's someone inside I want you to meet.

254
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:14,190
Well, it's about time.

255
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:18,229
You made us wait so darn long, I
went and had two slices of apple pie.

256
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:20,162
If I get fat, it's all your fault.

257
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,597
How's that my fault? Jeez.

258
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,580
Come on, Kirito.

259
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:27,327
Are you gonna introduce us or what?

260
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:29,668
Huh? Oh, right. Sorry.

261
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,385
This is Shino Asada, AKA Sinon,

262
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,747
"Gun Gale Online's" third super‐champ.

263
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,015
Oh, don't say that.

264
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,790
These are my friends from my time in "SAO",

265
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,872
Rika, AKA Liz, blacksmith and swindler.

266
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:48,257
Huh? What the hell'd you call me?

267
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,157
Hah!

268
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:51,772
And that's Asuna, the berserk healer,

269
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:53,565
real name Asuna Yuuki.

270
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:55,252
Uh, berserk?

271
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:56,682
Uh...

272
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,361
You wanna grab a seat and get something to drink?

273
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:04,204
That's what Ster... I mean Schterben means,

274
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,714
a term hospitals use for death.

275
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:11,764
What was he thinking giving his avatar a name like that?

276
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:16,207
If I were you, I wouldn't try to find some
deeper meaning in the name he gave his avatar.

277
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:19,709
A lot of times, it boils down to
whatever a player thinks sound cool.

278
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,408
Oh, that explains it.

279
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:25,229
This whole time, I thought you gave your
avatar your name 'cause you lacked imagination.

280
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,660
Zip it. Ahh.

281
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,932
I do so have imagination, lots of it.

282
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:30,137
Okay! Jeez.

283
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:30,897
Whatever.

284
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,912
So anyway, I'm super stoked you're here.

285
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,069
It's always cool to meet another girl VRMMO player.

286
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,142
You said it.

287
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,965
I hope we can be great friends, Asada.

288
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:53,045
Hmm.

289
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:57,137
Listen, Asada, Shino,

290
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:00,887
there's another reason for us
asking you to come here today.

291
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:02,400
What is it?

292
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:06,302
Sinon, I'm sorry to put you on the spot like this.

293
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,032
I, uh... I told Asuna and Liz about
what happened to you when you were younger.

294
00:18:14,368 --> 00:18:17,140
I didn't have a choice. I needed their help.

295
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:18,285
Huh?

296
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:19,515
I'll explain.

297
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:21,151
We wanted to help you,

298
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:23,801
so we paid a visit to the town where you used to live.

299
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,533
How could you?

300
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:28,297
Why would you do that?

301
00:18:30,889 --> 00:18:32,176
Wait, Sinon.

302
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:34,717
They found someone who wants to meet you.

303
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,865
I can't let you leave till you hear what they have to say.

304
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:44,206
It might hurt, and I'm sorry, but I can't
stand by if there's a chance what they say helps.

305
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,957
Who is this person?

306
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,069
What do they want to tell me?

307
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:12,291
Sorry. Do I know you?

308
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:15,341
Sachie Oosawa.

309
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:18,080
You're Shino Asada, aren't you?

310
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:20,868
I'd like to introduce you to my daughter.

311
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,754
Her name's Mizueh. She's four years old.

312
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,310
I don't know if you remember,

313
00:19:27,553 --> 00:19:29,679
but I used to work at the post office.

314
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,331
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:42,846
This is really hard.

316
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:43,946
See, I...

317
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,363
I should have done this ages ago.

318
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,633
I'm so sorry it took this long.

319
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:53,910
I never apologized or thanked you for what you did.

320
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,757
I was pregnant with her the day
that man came in and tried to Rob us.

321
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:08,400
What you did, it wasn't just my life you saved.

322
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:11,018
You saved the life of my little girl, too.

323
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,133
Thank you so much.

324
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:16,452
If it weren't for you, she wouldn't be here.

325
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:20,451
I saved your daughter?

326
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:23,852
Sinon, time to let go.

327
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:26,140
You've been blaming yourself way too long,

328
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,322
beating yourself up over what happened.

329
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,830
I'm not saying you're wrong to do that, but...

330
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:37,648
It's just whatever guilt you feel about what you did,

331
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,545
you got a right to consider the lives you saved, too.

332
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,365
You got the right to think about
those people and forgive yourself.

333
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:47,485
That's it.

334
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,260
That's what I wanted you to know.

335
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:12,575
I made it for you.

336
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,924
Thank you for saving mommy

337
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:16,974
and for saving me.

338
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,211
We love you.

339
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,180
Next time: "Debriefing".
