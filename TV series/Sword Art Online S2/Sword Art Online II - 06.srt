1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,326
With that name

2
00:00:03,995 --> 00:00:06,272
and your sword skills,

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,976
are you the Real Deal or what?

4
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:22,212
If he knows me, I should know him.

5
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:25,880
That's it.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,574
He's an "SAO" survivor.

7
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:36,601
Who is he,

8
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:40,007
and where did we meet in "SAO"?

9
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,617
Answer the question.

10
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:30,887
Or don't you understand?

11
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,611
No, I don't.

12
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:36,554
What do you mean by "Real Deal"?

13
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:39,070
Never mind.

14
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:42,406
Whether you're a fake using his name

15
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,275
or the real guy,

16
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:47,665
someday I'll kill you.

17
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:54,049
Laughing Coffin.

18
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:58,840
The emblem on his wrist belonged
to the murder guild from "SAO".

19
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,392
Laughing Coffin.

20
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,889
God knows how many players they killed in their time.

21
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,700
But they're not the only ones guilty of murder.

22
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:51,022
If the tip we got's good,

23
00:04:51,073 --> 00:04:53,119
we should be near Laughing Coffin's base,

24
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:56,815
but before we charge in, let's keep one thing in mind.

25
00:04:57,802 --> 00:05:00,219
Those guys are red players.

26
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:04,985
Once the battle starts, they're not gonna
think twice about killing any one of us,

27
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,006
so don't you hesitate.

28
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:08,837
You do, and you're dead.

29
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,710
We've got two things going for us, though.

30
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:15,696
We outnumber them, and we've got higher skill levels.

31
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,592
So who knows? Maybe they'll surrender peacefully.

32
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,489
Hell, a guy can dream, can't he?

33
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:44,907
Damn it.

34
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,998
Someone must have leaked our plans to these bastards!

35
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,372
They caught us off guard,

36
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,026
but we regrouped in time.

37
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:16,167
We can do this.

38
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:27,766
You're outnumbered.

39
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,328
Surrender now, or else.

40
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:32,332
Come on. Drop your sword.

41
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:34,088
Do it!

42
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:35,320
You can't take another hit!

43
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,139
Drop the sword now!

44
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:18,018
It turned into a blood‐soaked nightmare after that.

45
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,850
We won the battle,

46
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,936
but by the time it was over,

47
00:07:23,106 --> 00:07:25,060
we'd lost ten of ours.

48
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,657
As for Laughing Coffin,

49
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:31,896
twenty of them refused to surrender and were killed.

50
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,093
Out of that twenty,

51
00:07:35,557 --> 00:07:40,222
two lives were claimed by my sword.

52
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:48,360
That guy...

53
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:52,201
If he's one of the survivors from Laughing Coffin,

54
00:07:52,353 --> 00:07:55,708
then he must have talked to me
at some point after that battle,

55
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,973
or maybe he's one of the two people I killed.

56
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,518
No, that's impossible.

57
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:06,936
That's crazy.

58
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,313
...the name I share with this weapon, Death Gun.

59
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:12,804
Oh, my god.

60
00:08:13,066 --> 00:08:15,312
His voice was the same as Death Gun's.

61
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:18,191
Was that him?

62
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,645
Could he be Death Gun?

63
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,850
You look like you're about to lose it.

64
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,645
No, I'm okay.

65
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,343
Guess your first match was tougher than you thought.

66
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,835
You got back pretty early, though.

67
00:08:37,872 --> 00:08:39,536
Not too shabby for a noob.

68
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:46,392
God, if you're like this after one
match, you'll never make it to the finals.

69
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,665
You better man up, guy.

70
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,161
Remember, we got things to settle.

71
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:55,669
Hey, let go!

72
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,355
What's wrong with you?

73
00:09:11,207 --> 00:09:12,215
Are you oka...

74
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,926
That player got a death wish or what?

75
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:18,946
Hmm.

76
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:31,287
Wha?

77
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,914
Huh. I can't believe he keeps winning fighting like that.

78
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,533
His next match is in the semifinals.

79
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,392
Yours is, too, so get out there and rock.

80
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,364
Good luck.

81
00:10:57,794 --> 00:10:59,326
Stinger is my target.

82
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:02,518
His main weapon is an FN‐SCAR carbine rifle.

83
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,788
As a sniper, if I let him get too close,

84
00:11:05,924 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm done for.

85
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,194
But on this map,

86
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,291
if he wants to close in on me,

87
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,159
he's gonna have to go through there,

88
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:15,654
and that's where I'll take him out.

89
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:28,395
Damn him.

90
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:46,923
He wanted me to waste my first shot
to buy him time so he could advance.

91
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:51,977
Too bad for him,

92
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:54,918
'cause I know the path my first bullet took.

93
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:59,141
My second one'll be right on target.

94
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:12,872
You should have got out of the car, buddy.

95
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:15,923
If you did, you might have seen
the bullet line in time to dodge it.

96
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,815
He's gonna try and close in on me

97
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,530
using the shadows for cover.

98
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:18,827
My only chance is nailing him with the
first shot, before he figures out my location.

99
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,834
He won't even know what hit him.

100
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,070
What's my problem?

101
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:32,249
Why do I want to beat him so bad?

102
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:37,007
Is it 'cause he reminds me of me?

103
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:50,166
Does he think he can dodge my bullet at this range?

104
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:08,218
Does he even want to?

105
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:16,087
Don't...

106
00:14:18,552 --> 00:14:19,426
Don't...

107
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,248
don't screw with me!

108
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:15,958
Fight me.

109
00:15:16,261 --> 00:15:17,262
Come on, fight!

110
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,146
Or maybe you think I'm not worth the effort.

111
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:21,808
You got it all wrong.

112
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:24,018
All I want is to compete in the final.

113
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:27,364
There's no reason to fight anymore.

114
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,050
Then go on and shoot yourself, and get it over with!

115
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,071
Or would that be a waste of ammo?

116
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:37,230
Or maybe you wanted me to shoot you 'cause
you thought it would even the score between us.

117
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:39,252
To you, it's just a game,

118
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,059
just one stupid match.

119
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,772
That's all it is to you, is that it, a game?

120
00:15:45,364 --> 00:15:48,615
Well, just 'cause you feel that way doesn't mean I do!

121
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,454
But if we do meet in the final bracket of the prelims,

122
00:15:54,058 --> 00:15:55,722
I'll be playing to win.

123
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:58,369
Oh. I get it.

124
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:01,710
All right, if we both make it, no holding back.

125
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,453
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,478
What I did was wrong.

127
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,506
Sure, it's a game.

128
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,147
It's only one match.

129
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:18,782
But still, that's why we have to give it all we got.

130
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,135
It's why we're here.

131
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,823
It's how we live, how we keep surviving.

132
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,529
If anyone should have known that, it's me.

133
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:33,818
Sinon, give me a chance to make it right with you.

134
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,031
Let me give you the fight I promised.

135
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,150
I swear, if you're messing with me...

136
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:54,620
You got any bullets left on you, or are you out?

137
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,035
Yeah, I got one.

138
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,467
Okay, then let's have a duel.

139
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,614
Here's the rules.

140
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:03,487
We'll stand ten meters apart,

141
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,819
you with your rifle, and me with my sword.

142
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,421
I'll toss this bullet up,

143
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,429
and when it hits the ground, we start.

144
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:11,775
What do you say?

145
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:13,952
Hang on.

146
00:17:14,254 --> 00:17:19,020
If we're ten meters away from each other, it won't
give you enough time to see the bullet line and react,

147
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,890
and with my Hecate, I'll definitely hit you.

148
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,098
At that range, I can't miss.

149
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,317
You won't know for sure till you try.

150
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:30,876
Why's he acting so confident?

151
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:34,107
Does he have a plan or something?

152
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:37,838
Whatever it is, I'm ready for it.

153
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,199
Okay.

154
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:43,010
If that's how you want it, let's go.

155
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:08,810
I knew it.

156
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,526
He does have a plan.

157
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:16,972
'Kay. Get set.

158
00:18:58,152 --> 00:18:58,932
No way.

159
00:18:59,093 --> 00:19:00,639
That's impossible!

160
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:18,013
You knew where I was aiming.

161
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,790
But how? How'd you know I was going for your leg?

162
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:23,858
I knew, 'cause I could see your eye

163
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,274
through the lens of your scope.

164
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,870
That's how he predicted my bullet's path?

165
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:32,540
That's amazing.

166
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:36,335
That kind of power's way beyond any VR Game.

167
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,676
If you're so strong you can do that,

168
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:42,027
why'd you look so afraid before?

169
00:19:43,401 --> 00:19:45,373
You're wrong. It's not strength.

170
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:46,900
All it is is a skill.

171
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,066
No, it's not.

172
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,958
Technique isn't enough to cut
a bullet from my Hecate in half.

173
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:55,278
You and I both know that.

174
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:58,362
It takes strength, and all I
want to know is how to get it.

175
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:02,262
It's what I... it's what I'm here to figure out.

176
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:07,034
Listen, could you shoot a player in here

177
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:10,725
if you knew, in the real world,
that player would die from it?

178
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:13,517
And what if you had to kill that player,

179
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:16,857
'cause if you didn't, you or
someone you love would die instead?

180
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:18,864
If you had that power,

181
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:20,764
could you still pull that trigger?

182
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:24,815
Does he know

183
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:28,200
about what happened to me that day?

184
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:33,068
Maybe something like that happened to him, too.

185
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:38,267
I can't go through that again.

186
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:43,084
So I'm not as strong as you think I am.

187
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:45,654
I don't know the names of the two...

188
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:49,290
no, three people I killed in that other game.

189
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:53,170
I have to live with it every single day.

190
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,464
And every day, I keep hoping I'll forget.

191
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:08,918
I'm fine.

192
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:12,719
Anyway, I guess this means I won the duel, doesn't it?

193
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,122
Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess.

194
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,529
Well, would you mind surrendering then?

195
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:20,035
I'm not a big fan of slashing at girls.

196
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:20,788
Huh?

197
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:29,812
Next time, I'm not gonna lose.

198
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,653
See you in the finals.

199
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:34,330
And make sure you survive until you see me again.

200
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:36,930
Resign.

201
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,431
Huh?

202
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:38,667
Next time: "Crimson Memories".
