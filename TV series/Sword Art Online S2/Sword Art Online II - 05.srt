1
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:13,730
Five minutes to go.

2
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:14,957
We have to hurry.

3
00:00:15,406 --> 00:00:16,390
This way.

4
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:02,343
Hey, come on.

5
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,046
I wonder if one of these guys is Death Gun.

6
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:13,806
Here we are.

7
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:17,212
This is where we have to sign up for the tourney.

8
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,249
It's a typical, run‐of‐the‐mill touch‐panel interface.

9
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,615
Think you can handle it, or you want some help?

10
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,314
No, I can figure it out.

11
00:02:24,433 --> 00:02:28,525
Cool. I'm gonna be over at the next
terminal, so if you get stuck, holler.

12
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:30,308
Okay. Thanks a lot.

13
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,057
Huh?

14
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:44,960
We're supposed to enter our real‐life info?

15
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:52,998
Hmm.

16
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:04,547
You done yet?

17
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:08,894
Yes, I'm all done.

18
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:11,010
Thank you so much for all your help today.

19
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,327
Sorry for all the trouble.

20
00:03:12,453 --> 00:03:13,360
No worries.

21
00:03:13,385 --> 00:03:16,096
That crazy ride on the buggy more than made up for it.

22
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:19,394
Anyway, which block did you end up with for the prelims?

23
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:20,065
Um...

24
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:24,377
"F", I guess, F‐37.

25
00:03:24,642 --> 00:03:26,099
Oh, really?

26
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:28,056
I'm in "F", too, number 12.

27
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:30,254
That's kind of a cool coincidence, huh?

28
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:32,051
When do we meet, though?

29
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:35,717
Oh, good. We're not gonna meet up again till the finals.

30
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,960
I'm not sure what you mean. Why is that good?

31
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,841
If a player makes it to the final bracket in the prelims,

32
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:42,380
it won't matter if they lose.

33
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:44,857
They'll automatically advance to the Battle Royale.

34
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:48,257
That means we both have a shot
at advancing to the Battle Royale

35
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,605
as long as we make it to the last bracket.

36
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:51,305
Oh.

37
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:55,639
But if we do meet in the final bracket of the prelims,

38
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll be playing to win.

39
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:00,504
Oh. I get it.

40
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,827
All right, if we both make it, no holding back.

41
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,338
Wow. I'm impressed.

42
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:15,517
The Japanese translation on
these terminals is pretty good.

43
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,323
The official site was English only.

44
00:04:18,397 --> 00:04:22,546
Well, ZASKAR, the company that
developed and runs the game, is American.

45
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:25,997
They probably have some Japanese
staff to run Japan's server.

46
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,480
Oh, and get this. I don't know if you knew,

47
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:32,544
but "GGO" operates an illegal
gray zone here and in the US.

48
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,265
'Cause of its cash‐conversion system, right?

49
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:41,338
You won't find anything on the company's
home page except the most basic information,

50
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:46,335
and as for managing your character or accessing
your e‐money account to convert what you earn,

51
00:04:46,683 --> 00:04:50,263
any and all game‐related
procedures have to be done in the game.

52
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,809
It's amazing,

53
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,875
shady, but amazing.

54
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,642
It is.

55
00:04:56,026 --> 00:04:59,100
The game's practically independent of the real world.

56
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:06,085
Maybe that's why the person I am in here
and the real me feel like two different people.

57
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,888
Sorry. I don't know why I went there.

58
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,068
We should start heading over to the prelim area now.

59
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:14,887
You ready to go?

60
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:16,450
Sure. That way.

61
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:17,804
It's in the basement.

62
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:40,585
Something wrong?

63
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:42,552
Huh? No, nothing.

64
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:43,679
Good.

65
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,302
Let's go to the waiting room first.

66
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,701
You're gonna need some privacy to
change into your new combat suit.

67
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:50,767
Right.

68
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,424
I swear, what a bunch of dumb‐asses.

69
00:06:10,618 --> 00:06:12,407
Huh? Who do you mean?

70
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:14,438
Those tough‐looking guys outside?

71
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:15,917
Yeah, them.

72
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:19,828
It's a half‐hour before the match, and
they're out there showing off their main weapons.

73
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,587
It's like they're asking you
to come up with a countermeasure.

74
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:24,880
Oh. Yeah, that is silly.

75
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:26,170
Piece of advice,

76
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:30,147
don't equip your photon sword and five
seven till just before your match starts.

77
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,050
Mm‐hmm.

78
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:40,486
Huh?

79
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,384
Don't just stand there.

80
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,107
Hurry up, and get changed already.

81
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:46,782
Uh, yes. I mean, I can't.

82
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:48,577
I mean I can't change now!

83
00:06:48,631 --> 00:06:49,897
I‐I mean...

84
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:51,405
I'm sorry!

85
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,338
Why?

86
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:54,244
I haven't introduced myself.

87
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,686
This is who I really am.

88
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,494
Okay.

89
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:01,042
Kirito. Huh.

90
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,290
Well, it's an interesting name. I'll give you that.

91
00:07:04,645 --> 00:07:05,557
Wait.

92
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,532
Male?! But...

93
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,368
I... you...

94
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:11,440
You're a... you're kidding.

95
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,673
No way.

96
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,181
You're a guy?

97
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:16,048
With that avatar?!

98
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:19,732
Uh...

99
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:38,766
Why, you...

100
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,578
Stop following me.

101
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:54,489
But I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do after this.

102
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:56,276
Stop following me.

103
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,169
Okay,

104
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,241
but I don't know anyone else here.

105
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,165
Stop following me.

106
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,704
But‐But I...

107
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,105
I'll explain it, but just the bare minimum.

108
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:36,878
That's it. After that,

109
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:38,640
you and me are enemies.

110
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,572
Thanks. I appreciate it.

111
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:43,402
Yeah, well, just so we're clear,

112
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,234
this doesn't mean I forgive you.

113
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:48,199
You see that clock up there?

114
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:52,754
When it hits zero, everyone here will
automatically be transferred to a battlefield.

115
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:55,464
Along with whoever their first‐round opponent's gonna be.

116
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,837
You with me so far?

117
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:58,360
Uh, yeah.

118
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,660
The field's a square.

119
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,395
Each side's a kilometer.

120
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,743
The weather, terrain, and time are all randomly generated.

121
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:10,322
Your opponent's placed 500 meters away from you.

122
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,756
Whoever wins the match gets transferred back here.

123
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:18,153
The loser's transferred to the first‐floor hall,

124
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:21,525
and you don't get penalized for losing a match.

125
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,463
There are sixty‐four people in block "F",

126
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,940
so five wins will take you to the final,
and you'll be eligible for the Battle Royale.

127
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,562
That's it. No more questions.

128
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:33,809
I'm done helping you.

129
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,045
I think I got the gist of it,

130
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,245
and thanks again.

131
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,488
Hmph.

132
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:41,255
You better reach the finals,

133
00:09:41,632 --> 00:09:44,041
'cause even after everything I taught you today,

134
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:46,151
there's one thing left for you to learn.

135
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,738
Yeah? What?

136
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:50,867
The taste of the bullet that beats you.

137
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,577
I'll look forward to it.

138
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,384
What about you, though?

139
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,109
You think you'll make it to the finals?

140
00:09:59,492 --> 00:10:02,151
Heh. I'll retire if I get knocked out of the prelims.

141
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,146
But I won't.

142
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:08,747
Not this time.

143
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,239
This time, I'll kill all the strong players.

144
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:13,932
Heh.

145
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:24,146
Since this is the last time we'll be
chatting like this, you should know my name.

146
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:25,687
There it is,

147
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:28,212
the name of the person who's gonna beat you.

148
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,260
Sinon.

149
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,685
I'm Kirito.

150
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:35,712
Nice to meet you.

151
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:41,653
Hey.

152
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:44,117
About time you showed up.

153
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:47,131
I couldn't find you anywhere, and I
was worried you weren't gonna make it.

154
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,448
Sorry about that, Spiegel.

155
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:52,940
I totally lost track of time
thanks to an unexpected chore.

156
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:55,724
Hey, hang on. You said you weren't competing.

157
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:57,272
Did you change your mind?

158
00:10:57,297 --> 00:11:00,055
Well, even though I know how much it bugs you,

159
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,388
I thought I'd sort of cheer you on from the sidelines.

160
00:11:02,664 --> 00:11:05,372
I already picked out a spot in front
of the jumbo screen and everything.

161
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:08,782
What was that unexpected chore you were talking about?

162
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:10,414
Oh, nothing.

163
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,492
I was just giving this person a sort of orientation.

164
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,375
That'd be me. Hi. How's it going?

165
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:19,466
Oh, hi. It's, uh, nice to meet you.

166
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:23,240
So, uh, are you a friend of Sinon's?

167
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:26,020
Hate to break it to you, but she's a dude.

168
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:28,842
Yeah. My name's Kirito.

169
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,729
I'm a dude.

170
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,583
A‐A guy?

171
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,831
Then does that mean he's a... that you're...

172
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:35,951
Not even.

173
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,539
Hey, Sinon, thanks for showing me a good time.

174
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:39,895
It was a great first date.

175
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,355
What the hell are you saying?

176
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,421
It wasn't a good time,

177
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:46,451
and it was not a date. It was a mistake,
so forget my name, and forget we ever met.

178
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,583
Oh, come on. Don't be so heartless.

179
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,815
Heartless, my ass. I don't even know you.

180
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:54,247
But we spent the whole day
together picking out all my gear.

181
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:56,310
Yeah, but only 'cause you li...

182
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,674
Thank you for your patience, players.

183
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:01,326
I hope you're ready,

184
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,070
because the third Bullet of Bullets.

185
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:05,592
Preliminary Tournament is about to begin.

186
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,615
When the countdown clock reaches zero,

187
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:14,472
all competing players will be automatically
transported to their respective first‐round field maps.

188
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:17,169
Good luck to you all.

189
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,914
You better make it to the finals,

190
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,427
'cause I'm looking forward to blowing your head off.

191
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,928
I accept the invitation,

192
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,637
but don't keep me waiting too long.

193
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,434
Why, you...

194
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:40,655
Heh.

195
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,999
Maybe I went a little too far there.

196
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,893
This time, I'll kill all the strong players.

197
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:21,845
Is that possible?

198
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,092
Could she be Death Gun?

199
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:27,597
I saw two sides of her,

200
00:13:27,664 --> 00:13:29,634
but which is the real Sinon?

201
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:33,405
I won't find out standing here,

202
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:34,626
thinking about it.

203
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,620
But if we crossed swords...

204
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,684
I mean traded shots,

205
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:42,571
I'm sure I'll find the answer.

206
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:46,025
I can't dodge all those bullets.

207
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:54,229
At this rate, I'll never get closer to him.

208
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,466
Maybe if I could use my sword to
deflect the bullets, I could get closer.

209
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,634
They're flying too damn fast, though.

210
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,919
There's no way I can predict
the trajectory of each bullet.

211
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,902
No, I can do this.

212
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:28,699
The bullet lines tell me exactly
what path the bullets are traveling.

213
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:31,261
Now!

214
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:23,786
Holy crap!

215
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:26,932
Just a little further.

216
00:18:12,823 --> 00:18:13,614
Damn it.

217
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:20,700
Oh, man.

218
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:32,037
I can't believe I have to do this four more times.

219
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,235
I wonder where Sinon is.

220
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:58,890
Are you the Real Deal?

221
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,062
The Real Deal?

222
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,649
What do you mean by that?

223
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:24,849
Who are you?

224
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:39,848
I saw your match.

225
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,190
You took him out with a sword.

226
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:43,883
Yeah. So what?

227
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,893
It's not against the rules, is it?

228
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:49,021
I'll ask you again.

229
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:52,902
Are you the Real Deal?

230
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:54,722
Wait.

231
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,856
Does he know me?

232
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:00,927
No way.

233
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:03,286
We have met before.

234
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:07,082
We've been face‐to‐face like this,

235
00:20:07,646 --> 00:20:11,112
but where? Where do I know him from?

236
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:26,577
With that name

237
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:29,536
and your sword skills,

238
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:33,235
are you the Real Deal or what?

239
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:45,600
If he knows me, I should know him.

240
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:49,590
That's it.

241
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:53,267
He's an "SAO" survivor.

242
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:00,073
Who is he,

243
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:03,100
and where did we meet in "SAO"?

244
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:38,433
Next time: "Showdown in the Wilderness".
