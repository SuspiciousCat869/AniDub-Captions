1
00:00:12,126 --> 00:00:13,309
What's wrong, Yui?

2
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:18,433
I have a feeling there's a lot
more at stake here than we think.

3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,698
This will require some explaining.

4
00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:26,233
While all VRMMOs originate from the seed program,

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,153
there's a difference between them and "Alfheim Online."

6
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:35,391
You see, a stripped‐down version of the
cardinal system runs the other active VRMMOs,

7
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:39,462
but the one that operates this game
is a copy of the full‐spec version

8
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:41,067
that ran "Sword Art Online."

9
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:42,750
Full‐spec version?

10
00:00:43,282 --> 00:00:48,047
The original cardinal system had a feature
which could automatically generate quests.

11
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:53,583
It would log on to the net and search for
various legends and folklore from around the world.

12
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:56,976
Then it would take the stories it found, adapt the data,

13
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,019
and use it to generate an infinite number of quests.

14
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:02,742
How about this quest, then?

15
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:05,364
Is it autogenerated by cardinal, too?

16
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:08,923
After seeing how that NPC was acting just now,

17
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,510
I have a feeling it is.

18
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:13,839
If that is the case here, then no matter what you do,

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,394
this quest will end the same way the myth does.

20
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,664
Just now, I ran a quick check on my archives.

21
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:25,925
According to my data and taking into
account the norse mythology "ALO" is based on,

22
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,975
this quest must end in a final war event.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,260
The frost giants from Jotunheim and Niflheim
aren't the only ones who want to attack Arun.

24
00:01:35,856 --> 00:01:39,074
Below Niflheim is a fiery realm called Muspelheim,

25
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:40,585
where the flame giants live.

26
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:41,911
According to the myth,

27
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,454
they will attack the world tree and burn it to the ground.

28
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:49,406
Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods.

29
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:52,147
Uh‐uh. I don't buy it.

30
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:55,337
I can't believe this game system
would destroy its own maps on purpose.

31
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,785
It's gotta be a mistake.

32
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,717
I'm sorry, but there's no mistake about it.

33
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:04,777
The cardinal system has the authority
to destroy its maps if it wants.

34
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:10,492
I know this, because the original cardinal
system's last task was destroying Aincrad,

35
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,169
the floating castle of "Sword Art Online."

36
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:15,666
No way.

37
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:19,789
There goes my blacksmith's shop.

38
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:24,773
There go my chances of ever meeting my soul mate.

39
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:28,520
Even if this ragnarok thing happens and it all deletes,

40
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,494
can't the server be rolled back the way
it was from one of the backups it's made?

41
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,191
The system has an autobackup
feature, but those files won't help.

42
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:41,950
It only saves player data, not field
data, so you can't restore everything.

43
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:45,928
Oh, I got it!

44
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't got it.

45
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,198
You can say that again.

46
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,708
Stop razzing me.

47
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,748
I was trying to call a GM to see if he knew about this.

48
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:57,521
It ain't happening now.

49
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,332
It's after hours.

50
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:00,767
Support's closed.

51
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:02,197
That figures.

52
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:04,516
It's Sunday morning just before new year's.

53
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:05,467
Kazuto,

54
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,011
we're running out of time.

55
00:03:08,581 --> 00:03:09,299
Yeah.

56
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,483
Let's hurry and get to the last level.

57
00:03:13,007 --> 00:03:13,790
Right!

58
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:09,834
Damn it.

59
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:17,945
Damn.

60
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,913
This isn't looking good.

61
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,110
The gold one's tough. Nothing we do is slowing him down.

62
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,019
Yeah.

63
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:29,413
This sucks. If we only had a mage
who can cast attack spells in our party.

64
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,545
That's hilarious coming from you.

65
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:37,573
It wouldn't help, anyway, 'cause the dude in the back
with the high resistance to magic would just move up.

66
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,856
Could this get any tougher?

67
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:45,235
Shockwave attack coming up in three,

68
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,199
two, one!

69
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:04,367
Soo filla hail‐agool oustool!

70
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:06,762
Plot subahl bahni!

71
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:13,805
Kirito!

72
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,273
We've only got about 2 1/2 minutes

73
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:17,752
before I'm out of MP!

74
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:18,901
'Kay.

75
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:22,977
Kazuto, more than 2/3 of this medallion's gone dark.

76
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:26,758
If we die now, we won't have time
to start over from the save point.

77
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,851
Thanks. Good to know.

78
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,195
Hey, guys,

79
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:33,510
there's one thing we haven't tried yet.

80
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:38,282
If we use sword skills with magic, we
might do some damage to this gold bastard.

81
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:40,286
It'll leave you wide open, though,

82
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,476
it's do‐or‐die time!

83
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:46,562
So what do you say we focus our attack and wipe him out?

84
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:47,925
Hell, yeah.

85
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,670
Just say the word, and his ass is grass.

86
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:59,595
Silica, time for your bubble spell.

87
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:00,301
Right!

88
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,116
Ready, and...

89
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:04,272
Hit it!

90
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,333
Pina, bubble breath attack!

91
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,401
Go!

92
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:00,810
Kirito!

93
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,347
We locked up!

94
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:08,110
This is it.

95
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:28,484
Yah!

96
00:09:57,692 --> 00:09:59,829
Aww. We killed your pal.

97
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,266
Too bad, for you.

98
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,401
Okay, what the hell was that move you just pulled?

99
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,848
You don't want to know.

100
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:26,218
Oh, come on. That was totally a new skill.

101
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,278
Well, it's not really a skill.

102
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:29,958
It's skill connect.

103
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,811
Skill connect?

104
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:33,743
Remember the last update?

105
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:37,125
You know it brought a bunch
of sword skills to "ALO", right?

106
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:43,036
Well, even though we got those, we didn't get
unique skills like Dual‐Wielding or the Divine Blade.

107
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,779
Hang on a sec.

108
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,693
You were Dual‐Wielding just now.

109
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:49,096
Technically, that wasn't Dual‐Wielding.

110
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:49,742
Huh?

111
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:54,295
I was using one‐handed sword skills
with each hand and alternating between 'em.

112
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:59,125
If I'm lucky, I can keep it going
without any lag maybe three or four times.

113
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,004
Hmm. Eh?

114
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,624
No, it's nothing, Yui,

115
00:11:03,702 --> 00:11:05,222
just deja vu, is all.

116
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:07,822
You're not off the hook either.

117
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:09,606
What the hell'd you do just now?

118
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,507
I don't think you want to know.

119
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:16,130
Oh, come on. I've never seen anything like that before.

120
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,887
It's an extra skill I picked up,

121
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,635
Dual‐Wielding.

122
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,281
Don't pop a blood vessel.

123
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:29,453
All right. We can't stand around chatting all day.

124
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,232
Leafa, how much time we got left?

125
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,430
Oh, right.

126
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,447
At the pace we're going, we
should have maybe another hour or so.

127
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,620
That's it?

128
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:43,163
Yui, do you know how big these
last couple of floors are gonna be?

129
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:47,655
Yes. The third floor is about 70% the size of the second,

130
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:50,512
and the fourth floor is pretty much just the boss room.

131
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:54,435
I figure the last boss fight
will take us 30 minutes to finish.

132
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:57,770
That means we only got about
30 minutes to get to his room.

133
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:58,582
That settles it.

134
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,812
The clock's ticking, and the king of giants is waiting.

135
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,078
Let's get the lead out and kick his giant ass.

136
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:04,683
Daddy!

137
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:15,386
You heard her. As soon as everyone's got their
HP and MP restored, we'll hit that third floor!

138
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:16,599
Right!

139
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:42,989
Hyah!

140
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,124
Come on, guys! The last boss is waiting!

141
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,442
Please, help me.

142
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:32,594
Let me out of here.

143
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:37,361
It's a trap.

144
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:38,378
It's a trap.

145
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,030
It's so a trap.

146
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:43,295
Well, maybe it is.

147
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:45,248
Maybe it isn't.

148
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:46,923
What do you think, Yui?

149
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:51,767
She's an NPC. Her core programming is
connected to the language engine module,

150
00:13:51,825 --> 00:13:53,066
just like Urd's,

151
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,612
although there is one difference between them.

152
00:13:56,854 --> 00:13:59,035
This one has an HP gauge.

153
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,232
Yeah, that's a big red flag.

154
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,059
If she's got an HP gauge, we might have to fight her.

155
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:06,296
A trap. Totally a trap.

156
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,030
Obviously a trap.

157
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,626
It might be a trap. It might not. I don't know.

158
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,090
Either way, we can't afford to take the chance.

159
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:15,084
We can't waste any more time.

160
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:17,025
We gotta get to Thrymr asap.

161
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:19,134
Oh, right. Yeah.

162
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,933
We got a job to do.

163
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:26,196
Do not leave me, please.

164
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,450
I beg you.

165
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:31,979
Eh?

166
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:34,476
I know it's a trap.

167
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,953
I'm not stupid.

168
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,635
But even if it is a trap,

169
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,332
even if I know it's a trap,

170
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,449
I don't care!

171
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,961
I can't just turn my back on someone if they need help!

172
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,472
Even if... even if it means we fail the quest

173
00:14:51,662 --> 00:14:53,688
and even if Arun gets destroyed,

174
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:56,690
if I got a chance to do some good for someone, I will,

175
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,560
'cause that's what being a samurai's all about!

176
00:15:01,682 --> 00:15:03,712
Don't worry, Princess! I'm coming!

177
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,408
I'm free.

178
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:14,168
Thank you, faerie swordsman.

179
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:18,134
No worries.

180
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,640
Let me help you up.

181
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,994
No, I can manage it.

182
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:28,904
Whoa.

183
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,747
The way out's kind of far, dollface.

184
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,205
You gonna be okay to make it on your own?

185
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:36,410
Hmm?

186
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,678
I could,

187
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,652
but I'm afraid I cannot leave the castle just yet.

188
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:46,321
For, you see, I must first retrieve my
people's treasure, which king Thrymr stole.

189
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:48,495
If you would, faerie swordsman,

190
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,191
please let me accompany you to Thrymr's room.

191
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:56,840
This is beyond fishy, don't you think?

192
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:57,873
Uh‐huh.

193
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,377
Hey, uh, Kirito...

194
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,776
All right. I can't stand seeing you beg.

195
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,163
Since we only got a little further to go before the end

196
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,272
and seeing as how we don't know for sure it's a trap...

197
00:16:14,313 --> 00:16:15,946
Yes!

198
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,046
You hear that?

199
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:18,880
You're coming with us, gorgeous.

200
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:20,980
We'll help you beat that jerk Thrymr.

201
00:16:21,086 --> 00:16:23,805
We're in the same boat now, so let's get wet together.

202
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:26,282
Oh, thank you, faerie swordsman.

203
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:34,102
Delete Klein's last comment from your memory, Yui.

204
00:16:34,387 --> 00:16:35,118
Huh?

205
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,250
Name's Klein.

206
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:40,170
Freyja.

207
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,433
Huh. She must be a mage.

208
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:44,953
Her MP's really high.

209
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,077
With the way they got this dungeon laid out,

210
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,875
the final boss room should be down those stairs.

211
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,144
Remember, he's the last boss, so he's
gonna be way stronger than the other ones.

212
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:01,484
When you hit him, hit fast, and hit hard.

213
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,897
Until we can figure out his attack patterns,

214
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,229
we'll be on the defensive,

215
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:08,357
so no one moves on him till I say.

216
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:11,717
One last thing. If you see
his Gauge drop to yellow or red,

217
00:17:11,741 --> 00:17:14,809
his attack patterns are gonna
change big‐time, so watch out.

218
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:15,429
Mm.

219
00:17:15,931 --> 00:17:17,157
This is it, guys.

220
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,241
Get in there, and give it all you got.

221
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:20,075
Right!

222
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:48,341
Seh‐aah, filla, skeana, haggle, hogg, margle, ill‐toh!

223
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:57,540
Oath, narza, fiyohl, leggin, tinarda, valindle, yotun!

224
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:04,372
She boosted our maximum HP

225
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,971
I didn't know a spell could do that.

226
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:28,895
Cha‐cha‐ching.

227
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,562
Wonder how much yuld's here?

228
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,592
Coochie‐coochie‐coo.

229
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:37,802
Who let the flies in?

230
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,635
Hmm?

231
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:45,117
The buzzing of their wings is so irritating.

232
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,505
Hmm.

233
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:54,885
I shall crush them all

234
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:59,254
before they annoy me any further.

235
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:30,084
Winged Alfheim insects.

236
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:34,563
Have you burrowed down here on
the whims of Urd, the trollop?

237
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,811
Wretches, how dare you enter here?

238
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,417
Did you think you could steal my treasure?

239
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,822
If you tell me where I can find that woman,

240
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:45,149
I shall give it all to you gladly.

241
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:48,461
Ha! You think a samurai gives a damn about gold?

242
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,968
Well, you can stick that treasure right up your ass.

243
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,971
Better yet, let me give you a hand.

244
00:20:01,238 --> 00:20:02,883
Lady Freyja.

245
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:06,182
How good of you to grace us with your presence today.

246
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:12,699
I see you have left your cage. Shall I take it you
have come to your senses and agreed to become my wife?

247
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:15,631
She's supposed to marry you?

248
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,379
Yes, she is.

249
00:20:17,814 --> 00:20:20,014
That is why she came to this castle.

250
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,198
Isn't that right, my dear?

251
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:27,976
However, the night before our wedding banquet,
I caught her sniffing around my treasure vault.

252
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:31,937
As punishment, I locked her in a cage of ice.

253
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,195
Hey, Kazuto... hmm?

254
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,388
I know this story.

255
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,361
I read it before, Thrmyr and Freyja,

256
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:44,082
a stolen treasure, and something else, too,

257
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,122
but what?

258
00:20:45,182 --> 00:20:46,961
I will not become your wife.

259
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:51,207
These warriors and I are here to
put an end to your reign of evil.

260
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,573
Return my treasure immediately!

261
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,610
Yes, that's the spirit, my lovely.

262
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,534
I would expect nothing less from the woman whose
beauty and valor are known throughout the land.

263
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,853
And as they say, the more noble the
flower, the more satisfying it is to pluck.

264
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:11,030
After I've snuffed the life from these insects,

265
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:14,257
I shall shower you with extra affection.

266
00:21:21,753 --> 00:21:23,620
You bastard.

267
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,432
Over my dead body!

268
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:29,131
I, Lord Klein, won't let you lay a finger on lady Freyja!

269
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,412
Listen to the angry little fly buzzing away.

270
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,995
Now, then, it is time I began
celebrating my conquest of Jotunheim.

271
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:43,207
I shall start by crushing the life from you.

272
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:49,938
Heh.

273
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,358
It's on!

274
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:53,295
Listen to Yui, guys!

275
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,099
Don't attack till she says!

276
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,136
You got it!

277
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:38,907
Next time: "Excaliber".
