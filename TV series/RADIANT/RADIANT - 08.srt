Huh? Why?
What do you mean by that?

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,916
The channeling of Fantasia
into magic

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,875
is something between
a science and an art!

49
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,291
But you'd never know it from
watching your haphazard

Would you like to know
how your gloves were ruined?

52
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:03,791
You gathered more Fantasia
than you could handle,

53
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,916
and tried to brute force
it into magic without thinking!

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,875
Which tells me the time I spent
on you has been wasted.

What are you trying to say?

56
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,125
Sure, I don't know
how to use it yet,

57
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,958
but if I can gather lots of
Fantasia, that's a good thing.

00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,625

your mind now?

There's nothing wrong
with acquiring power in itself.

But nor is there
any intrinsic good in it.

67

it's wielded.

tell me something, spit it out!

and at the time,

479
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,416
I didn't expect
to make exceptions.

480
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,375
[MELIE and SETH gasp]

481
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,750
Considering the circumstances,
I'll give you a pass this once.

482
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,416
[MELIE and SETH gasp]

483
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,708
I get to stay on!

484
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,833
Congratulations!
That's awesome!

485
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:51,833
Well, Boy.

486
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,208
Huh?

487
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,875
Have you figured out
what you lost sight of?

488
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,958
I have!

489
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,875
All right.

490
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,666
In that case, I've got
something for you.

491
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
Here.

492
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,875
[SETH]
Cool.

493
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,041
[YAGA] There was enough
intact fabric left for me

494
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,750
to remake your gloves
into a fingerless design.

495
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:13,833
While you're still an amateur

496
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,750
when it comes
to wielding Fantasia,

497
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,375
that's not really why you've
been struggling to gather it.

498
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:19,541
[SETH]
Uh--

499
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,291
You see,

500
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,958
while most sorcerers can only
gather Fantasia with a conduit,

501
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,708
you can only do it
with your skin.

502
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,583
So, you've been gathering
Fantasia with your arms,

503
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,458
and trying to force it
into your gloves,

504
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,750
causing most of it
to disperse in the process,

505
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:35,791
and making your magic
far weaker than it could be.

506
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,875
But why would Alma give me
gloves that made my magic worse?

507
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,666
I can assure you, she knew
what she was doing

508
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,250
and acted with your
best interest at heart.

509
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,208
There are two ways that you
could've attracted

510
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,250
the Inquisition's attention.

511
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,750
By using magic bare-handed,
or by giving the world

512
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,875
a demonstration
of your full potential.

513
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:56,000
So you're saying, she held him
back to protect him?

514
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,375
[SETH exhales]

515
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,875
Those gloves have been
patched up many times.

516
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,625
That woman must care
a great deal for you.

517
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,375
[SETH]
Yeah.

518
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,041
Now that you've been provided
with fingerless gloves,

519
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,708
you should be able
to make better use

520
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,375
of the talent
you were born with.

521
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,458
Here goes.

522
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:18,666
Hm...

523
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,333
Ahh--!

524
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,875
That's amazing.

525
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,291
Not too shabby.

526
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,541
You can expect your training

527
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,958
to get a lot harder
from this day on.

528
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,291
Sounds good.
Do your worst, old man!

529
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

530
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,958
I'm so glad
everything worked out.

531
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,500
That said,

532
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,500
I feel like there's something
we're forgetting.

533
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:42,666
Meh.

534
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,791
Who cares? Let's go.

535
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,666
[SETH yells, distant]
Yaga!

536
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,833
[MAJESTY laughing]

537
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,583
Stopping those thieves wouldn't
have been easy on the purrse

538
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:54,333
if those kids hadn't whiskered
them away for me.

539
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,041
Neow instead of paying
to formally deploy the troops,

540
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,041
I only have to reduce
their debt by a little.

541
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,833
I'm pawsitively robbing
the sweet fools.

542
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,083
Looks like my meowsterful plan
paid off.

543
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,375
Ahh-- mmm...

544
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,458
Nothing's better than
a shaved ice snack

545
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,958
when you're feline good
about your choices!

546
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,750
[MAJESTY exclaims]

547
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,500
-[DOC groaning]
-[wheel moving]

548
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,500
What the heck kind of machine
is this, anyway?

549
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,000
And how long do
I have to crank it for?

550
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,958
Neow seconds!

551
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,333
[NARRATOR] Dragunov's
laid-back style of command

552
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:13,750
causes one of the new recruits
to doubt the captain's ability.

553
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,625
Then, his unit receives
an emergency message,

554
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:19,000
a request for aid
from an allied vessel,

555
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,458
which was shipwrecked
in a Nemesis attack.

556
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,250
Faced with a difficult truth,

557
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,583
Dragunov is forced
to make a choice.

558
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,458
Next time on "Radiant,"

559
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,541
"Those Who Hunt Heretics."
