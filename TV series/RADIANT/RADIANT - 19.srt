-[DOC] Wait! No!
-[MELBA and MAN laughing]

159
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,166
[DOC] Don't do this, please!
Don't go with him!

160
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,375
Come back to me!
Come back to me!

161
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,875
We can dance just fine
if I stand on your shoes!

162
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,291
I say we should do it!

163
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,916
We could learn quite a lot
from seeing the food

164

they serve at the castle.

165
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,708
You can be social
while I handle the espionage.

-[DOC sobbing]
-Sounds great.

167
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,750
-I would love that.
-Then, it's decided!

168
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,416
Let's go to the party together
and have a great time!

[giggles]

171
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,541
I guess this means I should
pick out a nice outfit.

[SETH]
Ahhh...

174
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,250
Look at what you're doing!

175
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,583
You're gonna eat
Mister Boobrie!

176
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,666
[MELIE] Put the sandwich
down right now!

177
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,250
Mister Boobrie is not food!
Not food!

178
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,833
-Let him go!
-Mm-ahh...

[MELIE]
Look at all these people!

181
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,708
[MELIE giggles]

182
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,500
And they're all dressed
so beautifully, too.

183
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:16,791
[MISTER BOOBRIE
chirps in agreement]

184
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,250
So... why do I have
to wear this stuff?

185
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,791
-[DOC] Huh?
-Because it looks great on you!

186
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,083
[MISTER BOOBRIE
chirps in agreement]

187
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,541
Thanks, but I feel like
I'm suffocating.

188
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,666
Hey, you stop with the
complainin', will ya?

189
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,500
I'll have you know that's
the best dang suit I got!

190
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,208
-Oh, by the way.
-[DOC] Huh?

191
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,333
Is it me, or did you get
a little bigger?

192
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,250
It took this long to notice?!

193
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, actually...

194
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,333
[MELIE]
You sure about this?

195
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,958
You're a really cute baby.

196
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,583
[DOC] I know I am, but I need
to dance with Miss Melba,

197
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,125
and I can't
when I'm like this!

198
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,791
Uh... could you ever?

199
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:49,333
My point is that I need to grow
up again, whatever it takes!

200
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,000
[SHOPKEEPER]
Hi! Are you customers?

201
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,500
[ALL gasp]
Huh?

202
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,833
Sure are! Hook me up
with a growth potion, will ya?

203
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,291
We have those in stock,

204
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,458
but perhaps such things
are not for you!

205
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,208
They're expensive,
you baby!

206
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,208
Heh! You want money?

207
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,500
Here!

208
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,833
[SHOPKEEPER]
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

209
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,375
Just a moment, please!

210
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,916
[MELIE] Hey, Doc.
Where'd you get that money?

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,708
[DOC]
It's my emergency stash.

212
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,416
[SHOPKEEPER] Thank you
for waiting, good sir!

213
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,625
Here's the growth potion
requested. Enjoy!

214
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,208
Nice!

215
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,125
Once I drink this,
I can reclaim my manhood!

216
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,416
And when Doc is back...

217
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,291
[DOC chuckles, charmingly]

218
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,916
Good evening, beautiful.

219
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,916
You have the charm
of a watermelon,

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,416
and all the fragrance
of a ripe banana.

221
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,583
It would be my honor
if you graced me with a dance.

222
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,750
Yes! But of course!

223
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,375
From now on, I'm your princess
and you're my prince.

224
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,500
[PAPA]
He's our prince.

Oh...

Hang in there, Doc.
Just try to be strong.

232
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,541
It'll all be over soon,
probably.

[roaring]

234
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,708
Yup.

235
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,166
That's how that little
cookie crumbled.

236
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,250
You didn't explain why
Doc's still a kid, though.

237
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,166
Well, apparently, the growth
potion's effect

238
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,791
is completely random.

239
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,875
-You're kidding.
-Nah, it's true.

240
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,541
There's no tellin' what age
those things'll take you to.

241
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,000
Huh...
well, then it sounds to me

242
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,916
like you should've just taken
another potion.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,583
What?! You think
I could do something

244
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,208
that scary two times?!

245
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,916
Besides! What if the next potion
I drank aged me too much?

246
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,083
I could've ended up becoming
a doddering old man!

247
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,958
These old bones can still dance.

248
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,041
Yeah, fair point.

249
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,541
I gave it my best shot,

250
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,666
but I'm still too small
to go dancin' with Melba.

You're okay, don't let it
get'cha down, Doc.

Hey! I bet sweets'll
cheer you up.

Just look at all these pastries!

But then, to his great fortune,

00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,833
this hapless bumpkin
was lucky enough

299

to meet the great and benevolent
leader of Artemis!

in awe.

that you went
to Rumble Town when you did!

and all, but--

470
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,583
Well, that's a surprise!

471
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,000
The hero of Rumble Town

472
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,458
remembers who I am.

473
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,583
Well, then.

474
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:05,500
[SETH grunts]

475
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,041
[ALMA]
Care to explain

476
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,500
why you haven't tried
to get in touch

477
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,458
even once since you left,
you idiot?!

478
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,166
Do you even know how long
it's been since you ran off?!

479
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,041
For all I knew, you were dead
in some back-alley dumpster.

480
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,708
And then, when I make
the trek out to visit,

481
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,500
ya can't even be bothered
to gimme a decent greeting.

482
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:22,791
Honestly!

483
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,125
I'm starting to think
your head's gotten

484
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,500
even emptier
than it used to be.

485
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,791
-Am I right?
-[SETH] I'm sorry, Alma.

486
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,166
-[ALMA] Admit it!
-[SETH] You're right!

487
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,916
-[ALMA] That's better.
-[SETH] You're right!

488
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,541
[SETH sighs]

489
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,125
Your friend Melie is the only
reason I'm here right now.

490
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,041
I had no idea
what had become of you.

491
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,625
You talked to Melie?

492
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.

493
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,791
She seemed to think
that you'd need my help

494
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,041
coming to your senses.

495
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,166
[ALMA]
I like her.

496
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,458
She's a nice girl.

497
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,000
[SETH]
Yeah.

498
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,041
[ALMA] Sounds like Rumble Town
gave you a hard time.

499
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,875
[SETH] When they call me a hero,
and I think of Hameline,

500
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,333
I feel sick.

501
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,916
I didn't "liberate" anything.

502
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,916
I just turned into a monster
and went berserk.

503
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,541
[ALMA sighs]

504
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,458
So, since I left Pompo Hills,
what have I been doing?

505
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:11,083
Feels like...
I was just causing trouble.

506
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,500
-[thud]
-[SETH screams]

507
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,791
[ALMA] Enough! Quit acting
like a spoiled brat!

508
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,125
Alma! Ugh!

509
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,833
Why do you gotta keep
trying to hurt me?!

510
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,041
-[ALMA] Hm...
-[SETH] Uh--

511
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,458
I got this letter.

512
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,583
You need to read it.

513
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,625
Mm--
"Dear Seth..."

514
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,750
Wait! It's from Taj!

515
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,708
[TAJ]
Hi Seth.

516
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,500
It's been pretty crazy here
since everything that happened.

517
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,708
But after you took out Konrad,

518
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,458
things actually changed.

519
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,500
The people here came around.

520
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,083
All of us are thinking
for ourselves now.

521
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,916
We're working together to build
a new Rumble Town.

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,916
A kinder one.

523
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,416
And I promise,

524
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,250
we'll never forget who it was
that saved us.

525
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,333
That showed us a better way.

526
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,833
So, thank you, Seth.

527
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,916
Someday...

528
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,625
I'll go to Artemis, too.

529
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,416
And I'll become
an amazing sorcerer,

530
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,666
exactly like you.

531
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,291
When that day comes,

532
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,125
you'll see me again.

533
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,416
Till then...

534
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,166
Taj.

535
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,916
[SETH exhales]

536
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,458
[ALMA]
Look, Seth.

537
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,333
It's true that there will
always be people

538
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,375
who you just can’t save.

539
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,166
But it's also true that things
have changed for the better

540
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,708
because of your actions.

541
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,250
[SETH]
Huh?

542
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,375
I saw the same change
in the people of Pompo Hills.

543
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,916
After seeing what you did
for them,

544
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,916
they've been downright
friendly toward me...

545
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,291
at times.

546
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,833
Things are nothing like
what they were before.

547
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,083
[SETH]
Seriously?

548
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,750
And then there's
your friend Melie.

549
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,208
[SETH]
Huh?

550
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,458
[ALMA] She was injured herself
after Rumble Town,

551
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,208
but she put off treating her
own wounds to look after you.

552
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,625
[SETH]
But why?

553
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,291
[ALMA]
I asked that, too.

554
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:49,125
She said,
"Because he saved me."

555
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,791
[SETH exhales]

556
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,458
[ALMA]
Well, Seth?

557
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:57,583
Are you gonna reply with another
pointlessly gloomy comment?

558
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,125
[SETH]
No, I'm all right now.

559
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,125
Thank you for coming, Alma.

560
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,458
I'll destroy Radiant
and change this world.

561
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,333
No matter how hard the journey.

562
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,250
Well, that's nice, but before
you get into that,

563
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:13,166
take some time to thank the
people who got you this far.

564
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,833
[SETH]
Melie! Doc! Boobrie!

565
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,583
[chuckles]

566
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,125
[ALL excited, chattering]

567
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:22,625
[SETH]
I feel a whole lot better now!

568
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,125
Sorry for makin' you
guys worry so much.

569
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,875
[MELIE annoyed, tense]
Huh? Say what?

570
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,041
I wasn't worried at all!

571
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,250
[DOC]
Look Seth, I've already got

572
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,875
my heart set on
someone else, so let go!

573
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,875
[MELIE] Why would I care
how you feel? You’re a punk!

574
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,750
[NARRATOR] Trust in
the Inquisition has wavered

575
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,666
since Konrad's misdeeds
were exposed.

576
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,041
This takes its toll
on Captain Dragunov

577
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,041
when he's unable
to restock his supplies.

578
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,041
Meanwhile, the fall
of Rumble Town

579
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,333
has also affected their trade
and distribution networks.

580
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:27,208
And so Doc takes on a desperate
mission to acquire coffee beans.

581
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,125
Next time on Radiant,

582
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,666
"Omen."
