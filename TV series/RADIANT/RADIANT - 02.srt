00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:12,083
[NARRATOR]
This world is overflowing with

2
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:14,916
a power known as Fantasia.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,916
Those who wield this power

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
can become either heroes
or villains.

5
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,916
Here, terrifying monsters
fall from the sky.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,041
Is this divine retribution?

7
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,583
Demonic malice?

8
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,791
Or a symptom
of Mother Nature’s wrath?

9
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,208
The one thing known for certain
is that these monsters,

10
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,541
called The Nemesis,
leave disaster in their wake.

11
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,083
They are terrifying to behold

12
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,083
and can kill
with the lightest touch.

13
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,916
Those few humans who cross
their paths and survive

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,583
are forever cursed.

15
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,875
But along with their curses,
they receive power.

16
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:56,541
The power to stand against
The Nemesis.

17
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,166
Now, these tainted humans fight.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,708
And at times, they can be
even more fearsome

19
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,000
than the nemeses themselves.

20
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:07,166
They’re known as sorcerers.

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,166
This is the story of a boy

22
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,791
who strives to become a great
sorcerer and save the world.

[NARRATOR]
Seth is a young sorcerer,

25
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,583
staying near the village
of Pompo Hills.

26
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:01,666
He was training hard, hoping to
be accepted by the townspeople,

27
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,791
and by Alma,
the sorcerer who raised him,

28
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,333
when a fearsome Nemesis
appeared in the village.

29
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,000
While protecting
his friend Tommy,

30
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,916
Seth risked life and limb.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,625
Just as all seemed lost,

32
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,250
he was saved by an
unfamiliar group of Sorcerers.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,625
Whoa, they must be-- I guess
you guys are sorcerers, too?

34
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,458
Yeah! What gave it away?

35
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,291
The brooms, maybe?

36
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,208
Perhaps we should talk once
we’ve dealt with that big guy.

37
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,166
You're up, boys!

38
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,166
Right, Boss!

39
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,791
They made it stop moving.

40
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,500
Way to go.

41
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,125

for a good while.

You’re s’posed to turn
to the right!

are everything, you numbskull?

-Ya gotta calm down, boss!
-Yeah, he’s right!

The seal won’t last long,

Sure.

Just do exactly as we say
and no one has to get hurt.

63
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,500
Or at least none of you
will end up dead, probably.

64
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:57,916
We men of the Bravery Quartet
have arrived to save the day!

65
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,583
I’ve never met another
sorcerer before.

Aside from Alma, that is.

00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,875
I’d like to fight with you guys.

Please let me help!

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,625
Oh, would you now?

71
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,375
I know I got a little
careless earlier,

72
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:17,000
but I’m a full-fledged sorcerer,
so I’m sure I can help you out!

73
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,541
I’ve been training
really hard lately

74
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,166
to prepare myself
to take down my first Nemesis.

75
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,083
If you give me a chance
to put my training to work,

I swear I won’t
let you down!

79
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,791
You seem to be
on the young side.

Ya know what,
you’ve impressed me already!

The bravitude you showed
by squaring off

with that Nemesis by yourself,
has earned you my respect!

Bravitude?

86
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,083
I think it must’ve been
the will of God

00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,583
that our path’s should’ve
crossed in this place.

mean “partners.” That right?

91
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,666
Yeah, “partners,”
that’s what I said!

At any rate, I like the cut
of your jib, kid.

So what say we handle
this together?

As you can see, the youngster

will ensure that all civilians
are evacuated safely!

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,125
But while we’re doing that,
we’ll need someone to act

119
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,083
as a decoy
to hold the beast’s attention.

at just being a decoy?

You can’t brute force your way

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,416
-I’ll have your heads!
-See what I mean?

323
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,458
You just took the beating
of a lifetime

324
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,291
in order to protect this town.

325
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,208
You did your best
to keep them safe,

326
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,833
and all they do now
is threaten you.

327
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,666
They’re not the least
bit grateful.

328
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,416
Don’t tell me you honestly
believe that regular humans

329
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,041
would want to coexist
with people like us, kid.

330
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,500
I guarantee that as far
as they’re concerned,

331
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,083
we’re no better than the beast
that trashed their town.

332
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,916
You can either
take my words to heart

333
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,416
or you can work yourself
to death

334
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,916
for people who hate you.

335
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,833
This is no world for heroes.

336
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,083
The fools who try end up
persecuted and betrayed.

337
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,208
You’ve seen enough
to know I’m right.

338
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,958
Haven’t you?

339
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,166
Take it from me.

340
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,583
If you wanna survive,

341
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,000
you gotta be smart about
the choices you make.

342
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,791
And nothing’s smarter
than making sure

343
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,041
ya got plenty of money to burn.

344
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,416
Boss!

345
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,625
I think it’s about time
we got outta here.

346
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,666
There’s no tellin’ when
that Nemesis will show up

347
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,375
and tear this place apart.

348
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,875
Ah, right you are.

349
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,750
Farewell, my young bird
of a feather.

350
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,166
A parting gift.

351
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,541
Can’t have people saying the
Bravery Quartet

352
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,000
doesn’t repay its own kind.
[laughing]

353
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,958
[BOTH]
He punched the boss!

354
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,166
Disgusting.

355
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,875
You guys are pathetic!

356
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,250
Why, you little punk!

357
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,166
I’ll show you exactly...

358
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,041
what kind of
sorcerer-- I wanna become,

359
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,750
and it’s nothing
like you losers!

360
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,708
[SETH shouts]

361
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,750
No, Seth!

362
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,083
Good grief.

363
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,208
That magic’s more terrifying
every time I see it.

364
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,166
I know I’ve said
this before, but,

365
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,916
if you weren’t such a moron,

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,875
you might’ve been
the boss, Jiji.

367
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:06,958
[JIJI]
Mm.

368
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,583
Serves the brat right.

369
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,416
So, what do we do now?

370
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,250
Should we finish ‘im off, boss?

371
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,208
No.

372
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,250
He should learn his mistake
soon enough.

373
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,208
The world’ll wear him down,
and he’ll see I was right.

374
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,208
Like it or not, we’re still
birds of a feather.

375
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,291
We’ll all be hated the same.

376
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,833
I am nothing like you,

377
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,916

-Uh?

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,750
Great!

381
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,666
The Nemesis must’ve found us
thanks to Jiji’s magic blast.

382
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,000
Time for us to move, boys.
Giddy-up.

383
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,333
Hey, wait!

384
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,208
You can’t just
leave us here tied up!

385
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,666
We’ll all be killed
by the nemesis.

386
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,291
At least let us go!

387
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,500
[DON BOSSMAN]
Shut up!

388
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,416
This is it, normies!

389
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,791
Maybe we’ll meet again
in the afterlife.

390
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:12,708
No, please!

391
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,625
And as for you,

392
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,625
if you’ve got the strength to
crawl, then you better start.

393
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,500
No sense in you dying here.

394
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,083
Leave these people for dead
and get out while you can.

395
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,333
Untie us, please!

396
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,625
I don’t wanna die today!

397
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,000
Please, just save my son!

There’s no escaping now!

401
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,750
It’s not fair,
I’m too young to die!

402
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,791
[SETH]
It’s gonna be okay.

403
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,375
Trust me.

404
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,291
You’re safe, Tommy.

405
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,416
I’m not gonna leave you here.

406

Like it or not, we’re still

We’ll all be hated the same.

408
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,333
I’m nothing like those four.

409
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:43,458
I’m going to become
an amazing sorcerer.

410
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:48,583
Courageous and with the power,
to protect everyone!

411
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,208
[BRAVERY QUARTET B]
That was a strong blast. Wow.

412
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,500
I hate to say it, but everyone
in that bank is toast now.

413
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,666
Hmph. That stupid kid
shoulda run.

No.

418
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,500
It can’t be.

419
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,250
This is impossible!

420
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,958
I thought he could barely
even wield fantasia!

421
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,750
Just what is with this kid?

422
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:10,250
[NARRATOR] The Bravery Quartet
turned out to be villains

423
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,208
who were deceiving
the villagers.

424
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,791
Now, Seth is conflicted.

425
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,041
What is right?

426
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:16,875
And what should
he do moving forward?

427
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:20,666
If the Nemesis ceased to exist,
would all the fighting end, too?

428
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,833
As Seth makes a rash decision,

429
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:25,041
Alma can’t help
but be concerned.

430
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:28,041
Just how are these sorcerer’s
histories intertwined?
