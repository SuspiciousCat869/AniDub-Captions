This world is overflowing

2
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,833
with a power known as Fantasia.

3
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,833
Those who wield this power,

4
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,875
can become either
heroes or villains.

5
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,875
Here, terrifying monsters fall
from the sky.

6
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,875
Is this divine retribution?

7
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,833
Demonic malice?

8
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,833
Or a symptom of
Mother Nature’s wrath?

9
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,875
The one thing known for
certain is that these monsters,

10
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:46,833
called the Nemesis, leave
disaster in their wake.

11
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,875
They are terrifying to behold

12
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,875
and can kill
with the slightest touch.

13
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:54,833
Those few humans who
cross their paths and survive

14
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,791
are forever cursed.

15
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:59,833
But along with their curses,
they receive power.

16
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,791
The power to stand
against the Nemesis.

17
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,875
Now, these tainted humans fight.

18
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:08,833
And at times, they can be
even more fearsome

19
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,875
than the Nemeses themselves.

20
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,916
They’re known as sorcerers.

This is the story of a boy,

00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,000
But Alma!

167
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,708
Talking isn’t gonna do us
any good at this point.

168
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,791
Understand?

169
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:31,958
Now, let’s go.

170
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,500
[MAN 1]
That isn’t good enough!

171
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,875
And as for you.

172
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,000
I’m sorry you had to put up
with this idiot.

173
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,333
You there!

174
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,750
Why’d they have to go
and blame you?

175
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,625
It was me that screwed up.

176
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,708
Uh huh.

177
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,625
It was all your fault.

178
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,000
Problem is, these things are
far more complicated than that.

179
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,583
How many times have I told you?

180
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,250
It’s fear that drives them
to act the way they do.

181
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,666
This is stupid!

182
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,125
What’s the point of
cleaning outside the house?

183
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,833
I should hear a lot less whining

184
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,916
and a lot more scrubbing.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,875
I just punched a rock.

186
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,875
You punched a boulder which
was large enough

187
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,583
to wreck an entire cattle ranch.

188
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,208
And let’s not forget that
it caused the cattle to stampede

189
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,458
through the village,

190
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,166
turning every person in it
against us.

191
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,875
And this is after you
started the plantation fire

192
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,458
that dried out a whole lake.

193
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,125
I’m banning you from setting

194
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,375
so much as a foot on that
island for a while.

195
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,875
Aw, for how long?

196
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,958
Until I’m convinced that you
won’t be a menace.

Mess up badly enough and
they’ll send someone

198
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,416
from the royal capital to
arrest and execute you.

199
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,291
Also, If you think I didn’t
notice that you’ve been stealing

200
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,833

201

-No more of that either.
-But--

202
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,625
I only borrowed them because
I wanna become

203
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,833
a respectable sorcerer as soon
as I possibly can!

204
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,333
Quiet!

205
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,250
You haven’t even become
a respectable person yet,

206
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,875
all right?

207
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,583
Well, if you’d stop treating
me like a little kid.

208
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,083
And why should I?

209
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,791
If you wanna
get treated like an adult,

210
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,875
then stop groaning
and earn your keep.

211
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,958
Fine.

212
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,291
-Alma?
-Huh?

213
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,041
Why did you let those
villagers pin the blame on you?

214
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:37,916
You’re an amazing sorcerer,
they should respect you!

215
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,583
To them, there’s little
difference between us sorcerers

216
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,291
and a Nemesis that wrecks
their lives.

217
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,750
We’re monsters too, the way
they see it.

218
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,875
But they’re wrong,

219
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,666
you’re not a monster!

220
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,083
I’m sure they’re kind to each
other, but...

221
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,791
these towns folk
want nothing to do

222
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,583
with what they can’t understand.

223
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,458
But you’re one of the people who
protects them from the Nemesis!

224
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,458
How can they not
understand that?

225
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,833
I suspect that if all the
damn things were to disappear.

226
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,000
I’d be telling you a completely
different story right now.

227
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,458
So, if I could only...

228
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,416
Don’t’ cha go getting any
funny ideas!

Nothing good has ever come out
of you tryin’ to use your head.

Hey, that’s mean!

00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,708
Just shut up and finish your
work already.

232

[ALMA]
Come on.

233
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,458
Not again.

235
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,416
What now?

236
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,791
Could you pull me up
for a second?

237
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,208
I really gotta take a leak.

238
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,750
So do it.

239
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:39,250

[SETH]
“Don’t get any ideas.”

241
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,416
That’d fix it.

242
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,416
If we could get rid of
The Nemesis.

243
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,416
It’d solve just about everything

244
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,666
and the sorcerers wouldn’t
have to fight any longer.

245
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,166
Well, that pretty much
settles it then.

246
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,166
I’ve gotta become
a super-powerful sorcerer

247
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,541
so I can start kickin’ butt!

This is it.

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,541
I really found the answer.

It burns! It burns! It burns!

254

You’re supposed to show up where
my hand is pointing,

00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,625
not right on top of it!

256

-Hey Seth?
-Stupid fire.

257
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,375
Maybe you should stop
trying to do this.

258
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,625
I mean didn’t Alma yell at
you about it just yesterday?

259
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,750
But that’s why I’m doing this,

260
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,083
to prove to her that I can
handle it!

261
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,916
Anyway, I was talking to my mom

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,250
and she said... that I shouldn’t
play with a sorcerer after all.

263
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,625
Huh? Why would she say that?

264
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,250
I don’t get it either.

265
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,833
But she said that all
of the other grown-ups

266
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,625
had a problem with it so...

267
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,750
That’s just because they don’t
understand

268
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,666
how awesome magic can be.

269
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,875
I’ve been watching you use
magic for a while now,

270
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,916
and I still don’t know if it’s
awesome or not.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,416
Well, I’m still training

272
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,458
but I’m gonna get way more
impressive later.

273
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,458
After all, if I wanna take down
a whole bunch of the Nemesis,

274
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,000
I’ve gotta become a powerful
sorcerer first.

275
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,416
Wait, so do you wanna become
a Nemesis hunter?

276
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,416
Well yeah, ‘cause if all
of those guys are gone,

277
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,416
then everyone’ll be
happy, won’t they?

278
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,416
So the way I see it, a Nemesis
hunter is the thing to be!

279
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,541
Thing is,

280
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,375
I’ve never actually even
seen one,

281
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,541
so I don’t really understand
what you’d be hunting.

282
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,875
They are awful monsters that
fall from the sky

283
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,833
and attack people
all over the world.

284
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,541
Alma’s been fighting them for
a really long time now.

285
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,458
And someday, I’ll be
strong enough to beat up

286
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,541
every last one of them!

287
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,250
It’d be pretty lame of me to
stand around

288
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,625
and let Alma deal with them
forever, y’know?

What do you think that is?

291
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,000
It looks like a Nemesis Egg!

straight for the village.

325
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,250
That woman! Let’s make her
deal with it!

326
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,750
[MAN 1]
Good thinking,

327
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,791
that’s what sorcerers
are for, right?

328
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,625
[MAN 4] They’re already
infected, so contact with

329
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,208
a Nemesis won’t kill them!

330
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,375
The least they could do is
make themselves useful now!

331
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,625
It’s dangerous! We have to run--

332
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,625
[crash, rumbling]

333
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,083
Whoa...

334
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,375
What was that?

335
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,208
Great, don’t tell me
another one fell.

336
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,166
Oh... man.

337
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,125
For a second there, I thought
I was a goner.

338
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,458
[MAN 2]
It’s that Seth kid!

339
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,916
[MAN 1] The same brat who
wrecked our ranch!

340
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,500
Hey guys!

341
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,500
Now that I’m here,
your worries are over!

342
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,458
Just point me
to the Nemesis, okay?

343
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,291
[MAN 1]
Look under your feet!

344
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,875
The Nemesis egg!
You’re standing on it, genius!

345
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,250
[CROWD exclaiming]

346
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,916
[SETH]
Whoa! You're right!

347
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,416
This really is the Nemesis Egg!

348
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,750
[MAN 1]
Where’s that woman sorcerer?

349
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,291
Nobody asked for you to come!

350
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,083
I don’t need Alma’s help,

351
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,458
I can take care of this sucker
all by myself!

352
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,791
[MAN 1]
Don't do it!

353
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:58,250
I just need to get it away
from here, right?

354
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,791
It hasn’t hatched yet, so it’s
round enough to roll.

355
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,791
Bet I can just push it off
the edge of the island.

356
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,375
[cracking]

357
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:06,791
[MAN 2]
Look! The egg’s cracking!

358
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,916
[SETH]
Run!

359
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,458
It ended up hatching.

360
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,541
Well then, let’s see how it
likes an explosion to the face!

361
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,208
Nailed it.

362
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,166
Uh?

363
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,958
It's not even hurt.

364
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,000
All right, fine.

365
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,083
Magic sword, you’re up!

366
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,708
It punched him
right into my shop!

367
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,083
-[TOMMY] Seth!
-It's dangerous, come back!

368
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,000
Not too shabby.

369
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,666
Think I might have to
stop goin’ easy on ya.

370
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,250
Oooh.

371
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,291
[TOMMY]
Are you okay?!

372
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,250
[SETH]
Tommy?

373
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,250
Oooh.

374
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,750
Tommy, run!

375
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,166
[gasps]

376
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,166
[whimpering]

377
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,708
You saved me.

378
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,000
Are you okay, Tommy?

379
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,000
That was a crazy thing to do.

380
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,000
I’m sorry.

381
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,000
I thought that--

382
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,000
Go somewhere safe.

383
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,041
I can hold it.

384
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,541
[TOMMY] But--

385
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,500
Just get out of here.

386
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,791
Don’t think about me!

387
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,291
Help him!

388
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,666
He can’t take on
that thing by himself!

389
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:20,625
Get your big,
fat fist off my back!

390
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,000
I can’t let this be the end.

391
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:27,000
This is my chance to show
them that sorcerers aren’t bad.

392
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,666
We’re the good guys!

393
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,166
If Alma were here,
she would show them!

394
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,333
But she can’t.

395
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,000
I’m sick of seeing her get
treated like a monster

396
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,750
just because they don’t
understand.

397
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,166
Sorcerers risk their lives to
protect people!

398
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,958
I have to make them see!

399
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,625
Ahh!

400
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,750
He’s losing!

401
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,583
It’ll crush him.

402
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,125
Someone help.

403
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,166
Somebody save my friend!

404
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:07,458
Bravery Destroyer!

405
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,041
Where did that come from?

406
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,500
An impressive display!

407
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,000
You faced a Nemesis on your own,

408
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,000
risking your life to defend
the people.

409
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,625
Brave stuff.

410
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,958
But even the bravest
of sorcerers

411
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,875
need a little back-up
now and then.

412
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,958
So, you’re sorcerers?

413
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:10,958
[NARRATOR] The Nemesis, monsters
that wreak havoc on mankind.

414
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:12,958
Only those humans
called sorcerers,

415
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,000
who wield Fantasia,
can fight them.

416
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,125
A mysterious
band of sorcerers

417
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,625
called the Bravery Quartet

418
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,958
has appeared before young Seth.

419
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,958
But who exactly are they?

420
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,625
In the chaos to come,

421
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:27,666
Seth will have to decide who
and what he’s fighting for.

422
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,833
Next time on "Radiant":

423
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,958
“True Courage.”
