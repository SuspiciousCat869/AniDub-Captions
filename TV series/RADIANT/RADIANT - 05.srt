happened to me

so recklessly stupid!

I’ve gotta tell ya Doc,
you don’t look so good.

d’ya think that is?

Don’t worry. Doc’s pretty
much always like that.

I was skeptical at first, but...

Yeah, you can say that again.

All the people here

Hmph, it’s about

into a cauldron, sir?

Pardon, but might I ask
who you are, sir?

344
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,625
I’m nobody that’s worth
knowing by name.

345
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:38,958
But I heard that you kids

346
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,125
are looking for someone
named Yaga, right?

347
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,875
Yeah, do you have any idea
where he might be?

348
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,791
I might be willing
to share that with you,

349
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,208
but first I’d like
to ask you a little question.

-Ask away.
-Just what do you think

Lord Majesty has built here?

Hm?

You really wanna know
what I think?

Well, that cat’s a total creep.

355
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,041
But... this is the first town

356
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,083
I’ve been to where nobody
called me “infected,”

357
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,083
or treated me like crap.

358
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,291
I can be myself here.

359
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:13,083
And use magic without
getting suspicious looks.

360

Everything costs way
too much money,

but the people who
live here are smiling.

Hm, interesting.
Do you have any idea

363
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,625
why Majesty tries to squeeze all
that money out of his subjects?

364
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,041
I thought he said,
that it’s for research

365
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,000
on how to break
our curses, right?

powerful force in this country,

of mobilizing our forces,

It was no consequence, really.

This is the power

If you wish to help sorcerers,
then there’s

a far more realistic
approach you could take.

Prejudice has no place
here in Artemis.

And it’s well out of
the Inquisition’s reach.

if Radiant actually exists.

471
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,958
[SETH]
Huh?

472
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,666
You’ve passed your first test.

473
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,458
Come with me.

474
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,333
Oh, so I guess this means you’re
gonna take me to meet Yaga now?

475
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,708
Have you still not
figured it out, you fool?

476
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:12,666
Huh?

477
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,541
It’s me.

478
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,250
I’m Yaga.

479
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,125
[ALL]
Huh?

480
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,250
[ALL]
What?!

481
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,291
[TORQUE]
How unexpected.

482
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,125
It’s a rare thing indeed

483
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,208
when a sorcerer manages
to escape your watchful eye.

484
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,875
Sir.

485
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,541
While it’s true
that Artemis interfered,

486
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,166
I still failed.

487
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,291
I will accept any punishment.

488
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,083
No. Reprimanding you
now would be pointless.

489
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,083
But I will ask you
one final time

490
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:53,208
if you’re certain that this
sorcerer used magic barehanded.

491
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,416
Yes. I know exactly
what I saw, sir.

492
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,208
[DRAGUNOV]
Hmm...

493
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:02,208
I want you to watch all traffic
to and from Artemis.

494
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,250
If you see him again,
inform me at once.

495
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:09,125
And for the time being,
keep this matter confidential.

496
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,958
As you command.

497
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,000
So, he found a sorcerer boy
with horns,

498
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,875
who can use Fantasia barehanded.

499
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,041
We are both well aware
of the danger

500
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,916
that this sorcerer could pose.

501
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The boy must be captured.

502
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,083
[NARRATOR]
The sorcerer Yaga

503
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,833
tells Seth he won’t accept him
as a pupil

504
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,000
unless he can prove his skill.

505
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:16,125
Melie offers to help Seth train,
but unfortunately,

506
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,041
neither of them are especially
versatile sorcerers.

507
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,541
Just how far will Seth have to
go to earn Yaga’s approval?

508
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:27,041
The next phase of his training
gets off to a rocky start.

509
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,666
Next time on Radiant.

510
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,500
“Drops of Friendship.”
