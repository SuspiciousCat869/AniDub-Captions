No, Grimm does not

Well, Hameline.

391

I must inform you that the
Inquisition does not negotiate

with heinous criminals
such as yourself.

That might be
your official position.

But the fact that someone
like you bothered coming here

395
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,708
must mean the boy's important.

396
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,250
And furthermore, it's obvious
that letting him die

397
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,791
isn't an option for you.

crushed us all by now.
