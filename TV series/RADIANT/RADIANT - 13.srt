is that if that mark is glowing,

it means the Nemesis is being

Stop with your taunts.

163
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,791
Exactly whose side are you on,
Captain Dragunov?

164
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,166
It's my sworn duty
as an Inquisitor

165
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,875
to protect the people
at all costs,

166
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,833
and that's what
I intend to do.

167
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,000
So when you speak
of protecting "the people"

168
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,916
you mean the ones
who aren't immigrants.

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,833
Right?

170
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,375
Obviously!

171
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,541
Ugh, immigrants shouldn't
be protected any more

172
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,916
than the infected are.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,833
[DRAGUNOV] This town is
under your jurisdiction.

174
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,875
So I won't interfere.

175
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,291
However...

176
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,125
I'll ask you one last question.

177
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,166
You aren't so preoccupied
with immigrants

178
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,666
that you're letting a Nemesis
roam the town freely, are you?

179
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,625
[KONRAD nervously grunts]

180
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,333
Because if you were,

181
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,666
then I would feel compelled to
ask whose side it is you're on.

182
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,208
Would a defender of the people

183
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,000
let a monster
stalk their streets?

184
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,041
[KONRAD laughing]
Don't be ridiculous.

185
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,708
You have no proof
of this theory.

186
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,791
No sir.

187
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,083
I don't.

188
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,666
Please forgive me.

189
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,333
I almost forgot to tell you
something quite important.

190
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,625
[KONRAD]
Mm?

191
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,125
[DRAGUNOV]
You should expect General Torque

192
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,041
and his Thaumaturges
to arrive in town by tomorrow.

193
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,791
What's the general want here?

194
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,333
What's he after?

195
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,458
[DRAGUNOV] They're coming for
the same reason I did.

196
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,291
It's the horned sorcerer
I've been pursuing.

197
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,875
General Torque is gravely
concerned about the danger

198
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,958
he could pose.

199
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,458
I'm sure that when the General
sees what you've been up to,

200
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,250
he'll reward your efforts.

201
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,166
That is, if you've been
doing your job.

202
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,208
Have you?

[KONRAD]
This is bad.

205
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,916
The last thing I need now
is a suspicious Dragunov

206

207
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,750
[DRAGUNOV]
You aren't letting a Nemesis

208

roam the town freely,
are you?

But...the man is perceptive.

215
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,958
Also, with General Torque

216
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,583
and the Thaumaturges
arriving tomorrow,

217
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,666
it may prove difficult to keep
this secret any longer.

[fist clenching]

219

Even if I have to use
a bit of force,

220
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,291
just as I did 15 years ago.

221
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:10,083
I need to advance my plan
to its final stages.

And if you saw right,

there's also a

my best shot.

But I'm done takin' on jobs

This stuff's
too dangerous for me.

I understand that, but maybe
you should stay here

don't forget what I said.

252
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,250
There's something off
about the Inquisitors here.

253
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,791
It's as though
they're deliberately

ignoring the Nemeses.

bringing them to Artemis

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,875
We should be safe up here.

Where are your parents,

[TAJ gasps]

Not really.

487
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,416
They were taken away by the
Inquisitors for sheltering me

488
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,666
when I got infected.

-[SETH gasps]
-That's horrible.

490
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,583
[haltingly]
It's just so messed up.

491
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,458
None of us did anything wrong,
did we?

492
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,791
So why?
Why did this happen?

You're right.

00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,333
You didn't do anything wrong,
and you don't deserve this.

00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,625
You don't.

498
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,208
It felt like that mob
came from nowhere,

499
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,250
but something tells me
that's not true.

500
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,375
The people weren't
this angry before.

501
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,875
It's like someone riled them up.

Captain Konrad.

He's behind this!

I'll make him regret it.

They already found us?

That was way too fast.

If these idiots really wanna
pick a fight with us,

517
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,083
then I'm gonna give them
the fight they want.

518
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,875
I'm about to blow
these thugs sky high.

519
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,166
Whoa!
Just hang on a sec!

[MELIE]
Calm it down?!

522

The bastards were about to
burn this kid alive.

523
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,583
So, they can't complain
if I do the same to them.

524
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,833
[SETH] But think about what
you were saying before!

525
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,083
If that Konrad guy's the one
who got them to do it,

526
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,625
then we just need
to get rid of him!

527
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,250
So, they're guilt-free just
cause they had orders?

528
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,625
Don't be stupid, these guys
would kill us if they could.

529

That doesn't matter.

530

You had better let go of me!

-Seth!
-Shut up!

If I put you down,

00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,166
you'll go ballistic
on everything in sight!

538
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,166
These people are
only acting like this

539
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,625
because they're scared of us!

540
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,125
They're not evil.

They're just afraid of what
they can't understand!

If we attack them now,

543
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,333
we'll only be confirming
their fears were justified.

That's not an option.

There's only one way
we can end this.

We find Captain Konrad.

You will surrender quietly.

And if you refuse,
