The only humans
who can stand against them

4
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,750
are those called sorcerers.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,458
However, sorcerers are seen
as tainted by most,

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,250
and are regarded
with fear and distrust.

Seth left Alma,
the woman who raised him,

and set off
in search of Radiant.

00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,000
But in this world of adversity,
there’s no telling

we’ll soon enter the airspace
described in the report.

18
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,916
As for the sorcerer
we caught on the way,

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,208
what would you
have us do with her?

20
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,083
Well, we can hardly
toss her overboard.

21
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,125
So, we’ll just have
to keep her for now.

It took me forever to find it.

[ALMA] I contacted Artemis
three days back.

29
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,666
Would it kill you people
to at least send word

if you’re gonna be late?

31

Huh? But I did send word.

32
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,375
My assistant was s’posed
to let you know I was coming.

-Not in the slightest.

get lost again?

-What’s that?
-Oh. I’m just talking to myself.

So, listen.

My traveling expenses
were pretty substantial.

00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,666
And once you’ve delivered
the Nemesis corpse to Artemis,

42
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,041
you’ll be paid plenty.

Did you really think
I wouldn’t know that?

44

You greasy little miser.

47
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,166
maybe I should go

Just as we’d decided to pick
him up for questioning,

he collided with us.

If word of the law has yet
to reach the hinterlands,

All of us present have witnessed
your use of magic.

Which means that, unless you can
show us identification,

94
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,583
and the requisite permit,

95

we shall be forced
to arrest you.

You can’t arrest me.

What’s going on?

123
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,500
First off,
it’s a black silver cage,

124
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,416
designed to block Fantasia.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,791
And secondly, we’ve taken
your gloves away, remember?

126
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,500
We’re well aware
of how to deal with your kind.

127
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,458
So what are you
gonna do with me?

128
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,875
You’ll spend the next ten years
in the capital dungeon.

129

But if you put me in a dungeon

then I won’t be able
to look for Radiant!

Just a fairy tale that’s grown
popular among sorcerers.

but I feel compelled
to tell you, for your own good.

That’s not a word you should be
tossing around lightly.

-And to whom.
-Huh?

You’d do well to stop talking,

so as not to add
to your list of crimes.

but I only wanted to ask you:

157
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,416
Are sorcerers really cursed?

158
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,833
[VICE]
Of course they are!

159
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,916
That’s why we inquisitors
have to watch them.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,416
Indeed.

gotten us in enough trouble?

319
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,708
What the heck possessed you

320
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,375
to tell the Inquisition
what we were up to?

321
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,458
-Well. They asked me.
-Why did I even send you?!

322
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,333
Tryin’ to rush this job along
definitely backfired on me!

[sighs]

324
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,041
There’s no gettin’
out of this one.

325
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,500
Wait a second.

326
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,125
Were you at Pompo Hills earlier?

327
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,583
Huh?
Depends who’s asking.

328
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:28,250
Well, my name’s Seth!

329
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,375
And I’m the hunter that beat
that Nemesis you picked up.

330
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,125
-What?
-So, I guess you must be

331
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,791
an Artemis sorcerer
just like Melie, right?

332
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,791
I’m a researcher,
and I’m good at my job.

333
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,250
It’s as simple as that.

334
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,916
I heard I could get
some remains on that island.

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,416
So I went down
and picked ‘em up.

336
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,125
What did you plan
to do with them?

337
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,291
Turn them in.

338
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,250
A solid corpse
is worth good money.

339
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,416
That said...

340
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,833
this one was
pretty much shredded!

341
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,041
Which means it’s worth
practically nothing!

342
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,083
Oh, too bad.

343
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,291
That part wasn’t me though.

344
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,750
[groans]
My poor wallet.

345
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,625
So. Why don’t you just

346
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,625
-hunt them yourself, then?
-Huh?

347
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,375
Then, you could sell
a whole bunch.

348
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,791
I don’t hunt The Nemesis,
‘cause I don’t wanna die.

349
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:06,958
[SETH]
Mm?

350

[DOC]
Giving my all. Taking risks.

351
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,750
Getting rocks in my shoes.

352
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,791
I can’t stand
that sort of thing!

353
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,416
I’m perfectly okay

354
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,041
leaving that type a’ work
to sorcerers like you.

355

Monsters fall
from the sky like rain,

356
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,083
and all you Nemesis Hunters
can do is play catch-up.

357
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,083
That’s just the way
of the world, kid.

358
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,166
You track down and destroy
The Nemesis one at a time.

359
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,000
It’s a never-ending task,

360
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,583
but doin’ it’s the only reason
sorcerers are even tolerated.

00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,583
[wind rushing]

480
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,416
What the heck was
that all about?

481
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,958
-It’s her curse.
-Huh?

482
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,458
[DOC] When Melie comes
under extreme stress,

483
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,250
her personality does
a total 180.

484
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,375
-[SETH] Really?!
-[overjoyed chirps]

485
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,250
I’ll torment you all
you want later, Boobrie,

486
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,375
at the moment
I’m busy with these jerks.

487
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,375
Showing your true colors, witch?

488
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,375
Give us back our ship now.

489
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,125
Or I’ll grind you
into a pulp.

490
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,333
We of the Inquisition
shan’t falter.

491
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,750
It is our sacred duty

492
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,250
to stand against cursed
beings like yourself.

493
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,625
[MELIE]
Oh, really?

494
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,416
You’d best watch
your step, then.

495
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,916
Huh? Wait. What’s going on?

496
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,541
Brace yourself.

497
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,875
Not that it’ll help.

498
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,000
[echoing]
Ignis Rumpere!

499
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,000
-[explosion]
-[SOLDIERS scream]

500
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,250
You’ll pay for that,
you scoundrel!

501
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,208
Who’s grabbing me?!

502
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,416
[SOLDIER #1]
Sorry, sir!

503
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,791
[SOLDIER #2]
Vice Captain!

504
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,125
Please don’t let go!

505
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,541
[VICE] Just wait till
I get back up there!

506
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,791
[whimpers]

507
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,458
They’ll put a price
on all our heads!

508
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,541
So cool!

509
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,000
[SETH]
Hey! My stuff!

510
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,291
-Hm.
-[DRAGUNOV] A curse, eh?

511
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,458
This is the problem
with you sorcerers.

512
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,791
No sense of accountability.

513
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,083
You should’ve kept
your true nature hidden.

514
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,708
Blame your curse
all you want,

515
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,416
I don’t care why you tried
to murder my men.

516
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,291
By this miracle of God,

517
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,833
I sentence you to death
by this arrow.

518
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,000
[screaming]

519
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,791
This day could not
get any worse!

520
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,625
-Hey, you!
-[BOTH] Huh?

521
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,333
[SETH] Get away from Melie
right this second!

522
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,250
[DOC]
Don’t do it, Seth! Calm down!

523
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,291
Let’s just all
apologize together!

524
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,708
Titan...

525
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,291
Punch!

526
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,958
[ALL gasp]

527
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:41,250
[ALL yelling]

[grunts]

529
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,166
[SETH]
Doc! Melie! Let’s go!

530
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,000
[DOC panicking]

531
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,583
I’m gonna need you guys
to hang on tight, okay?

532
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,041
[air whooshing]

533
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,708
[MELIE] Don’t tell me
what to do, ya damn brat!

534
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,958
[DOC screams]

535
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,083
[DOC yelling]
This isn’t my fault!

536
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,291
I’ve done nothing wrong!

537
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,708
[DRAGUNOV]
Not bad.

538
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,083
They win this round.

539
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,500
-[VICE] Captain!
-Hmm?

540
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,166
The cannon is ready.
Shall I shoot them down?

541
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,375
[DRAGUNOV]
Forget it.

542
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,375
They’re well out of range.

543
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,666
[VICE groans]

544
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,625
Considering how close
we are to Artemis,

545
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,625
we can’t do anything too bold.

546
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,625
That horned boy...

547
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,750
He used magic
with his bare hands.

548
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,666
[chirp]

549
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,291
[normal voice] Sorry.

550
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,000
Whenever
I get too worked up,

551
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,625
my personality takes a turn.

552
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,791
It’s okay.

553
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,291
And that’s the trouble
with you.

554
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,125
It’s why you’re never
gonna be a true sorcerer.

555
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291
[MELIE cries]

556
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,208
Yeah. I’ll try to
do better, sir.

557
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,708
Are you kidding?
That was awesome!

558
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,291
Huh?

559
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,041
You kicked those guys’ butts!
They all went flying.

560
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,250
You’ve gotta teach me
that spell sometime!

561
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,541
Uh. Okay.

562
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,416
Really? Aw, yeah!

563
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,250
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
-Oh no, wait! I should tell you

564
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,583
that normally I only use
defensive magic.

565
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,125
-[whimpers]
-[SETH] I wanna learn somethin’

566
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,416
that hits with a bang!

567
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,833
You’re weird. And funny.

568
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,583
Oh hey! Doc?

569
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,916
How much longer’s it gonna be
until we reach Artemis anyway?

570
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,916
We’re close.

571
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,041
You should see it any second.

572
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,958
[SETH]
Huh?

573
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,875
[chuckles]

574
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,916
[gasps]

575
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,958
[SETH]
So that’s the Artemis Institute!

576
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:31,375
The city of Sorcerers!

577
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,541
[NARRATOR] Seth and company
finally arrive at Artemis,

578
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:12,208
the city of Sorcerers.

579
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:15,250
At first glance, it looks like
a wondrous, dazzling place.

580
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,458
But in reality,
it’s a cutthroat town

581
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,625
where everything
comes at a price.

582
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,458
After getting conned
into taking on a massive debt,

583
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:24,125
how will Seth find the resolve

584
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,375
to press forward
in his adventure?

585
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,958
Next time on Radiant.

586
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:31,375
“A Paradise
of Wisdom and Hope.”
