[HAMELINE]
A little over 15 years ago,

29
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,583
the Inquisition took custody
of a group of infected children.

30
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,916
The plan was to train them
as soldiers against The Nemesis.

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,833
Hans, Poucet, Gretta,
and Hameline.

32
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,000
These children were dubbed
the "Nemesis Defense Force."

33
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,208
And after receiving
a warm welcome

34
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,875
from the people of Rumble Town,

35
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,750
they were quartered in a prison,

36
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,583
to live alongside
heinous criminals

37
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,083
and illegal immigrants.

38
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,000
Every day they spent
in that prison was hell.

39
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,583
But at least they weren't alone.

40
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,625
The children supported
one another

41
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,666
and tried their best to live.

42

[YOUNG HAMELINE] Rumble Town
suddenly found itself

164
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,208
facing an insurmountable threat.

165
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,875
The Nemesis had come.

[OXUMARE]
Hm?

167
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,625
Excuse me, sir,
we've confirmed the appearance

168
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,666
of multiple Nemeses...
what should we do?

169
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,166
Our first duty is
to protect the people.

170
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,833
We must get the civilians
to safety.

171
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,041
Yes, sir.

172
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,458
Perhaps we could house
the residents

173
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,416
of the Northeastern District
right here?

174

[OXUMARE]
That's absurd, this is a prison!

175
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,291
But it's built like a fortress,
which makes it far safer

176
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,375
than anywhere else
in District 13.

177
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,833
And furthermore,

178
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,958
I think we should deploy
the Nemesis Defense Force.

179

Don't be a fool.

180

Only one of them is alive.

What hope would that child
have in a battle?

"that child" has a better chance
than we do.

If you're that concerned
for her life,

then perhaps you could protect
her in battle personally, sir.

00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,791
[laughs]

482
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,541
It's been my distinct pleasure
to personally send

483
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,958
everyone who's dared
defy me to their grave!

484
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:10,541
Now, you're about to join their
inglorious ranks, sorcerer!

485
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:14,750
[gasping]

486
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,750
[chain rattling]

487
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,833
[laughs]

488
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,250
You were doomed from the start.

489
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,666
For you face Konrad de Marbourg!

490
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,625
I am the champion
of Rumble Town,

491
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,000
the unbreakable wall
it counts on to defend it!

492
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,500
[laughs]

493
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,541
[gasps]

494
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,833
-[chain rattling]
-Mmm!

495
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,541
[KONRAD] He's absorbed
the tip of my lance.

496
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,541
Just like that one did
with the cannonballs!

497
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,333
If you wanna call yourself
a wall, that's fine.

498
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,208
'Cause I'm gonna smash
right through it either way!

499
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,708
Skull Burst!

500
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,166
[screaming]

501
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,750
[growling]

502
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,958
[KONRAD]
I... am a champion.

503
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,916
All my life, I've fought
for my ideals,

504
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,291
for beauty,

505
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,375
nobility,

506
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,708
strength.

507
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,125
-I am Rumble Town's wall.
-[cracking]

508
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,416
[KONRAD]
I can never be broken.

509
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,958
[SETH screaming]

510
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,750
[KONRAD screaming]

511
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,500
[KONRAD]
I am righteous.

512
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,583
I am the wall.

513
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:32,458
[booming crash]

514
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,875
[NARRATOR]
A man brings Seth

515
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,458
inside the clocktower,

516
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:13,083
where he asks Seth questions
about what he fights for,

517
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,666
and where his future
loyalties might lie.

518
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,000
Meanwhile,

519
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,833
Hameline and her Nemeses
move to bring about

520
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,666
the destruction of Rumble Town.

521
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,291
And even working together,

522
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:25,916
Seth, Grimm, and Melie will be
hard-pressed to stop her.

523
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,458
Next time on Radiant.

524
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:30,916
"Fly High and Pierce
Through the Storm."
