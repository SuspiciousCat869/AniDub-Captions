he did make significant strides
as a sorcerer in the process.

482
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,166
[GRIMM]
You have talent with Fantasia,

483
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,375
and good instincts for combat,

484
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,583
but your skills
are unrefined.

485
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,000
It’s time you accept defeat.

486
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,625
-[SETH coughs]
-[GRIMM] The difference between

487
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,791
your strength and Grimm’s
is clear.

488
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,250
-[SETH groaning]
-[GRIMM chuckles]

489
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,791
Still standing, eh?

490
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,916
[growls]

491
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,958
That was nothing!

492
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,541
-[SETH yelling]
-[GRIMM] Huh?

493
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,416
Take this.

494
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,333
Skull Attack!

495
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,416
[GRIMM gasps]

496
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,791
Veneficium Revelare!

497
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,333
[MELIE]
What was that?

498
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,125
Wait a sec.

499
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,833
Is Seth--?

500
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,291
[SETH grunting, groaning]

501
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,875
[GRIMM]
Do you understand now?

502
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,041
Good.

503
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,208
Then answer.

504
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,958
Why have you come to this town?

505
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,875
[MELIE]
Ignis Rumpere!

506
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,458
[SETH exhales]

507
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,833
Thank you, Melie.

508
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:16,750
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

509
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,791
Glad I could help.

510
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,791
You good?

511
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,833
Yeah...

512
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,416
now that you’re here.

513
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,708
Wait, where’d he go?

514
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,208
I think I got a good hit on him,

515
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,666
so he might’ve run away.

516
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,666
[GRIMM] So she’s the one
you’re working with.

517
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,750
[ALL gasp]

518
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,625
[MELIE]
He's not hurt at all!

519
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,375
[SETH]
That’s impossible.

520
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,833
[GRIMM] After all the commotion
that’s been made,

521
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,000
there’s no doubt
that people will come to see

522
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,333
what’s happening.

523
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,500
And since Grimm
is the shy type,

524
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,000
that means this is goodbye.

525
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,125
Too scared to keep fighting?!

526
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,500
[GRIMM]
Believe what you will.

527
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,250
But if you’re still after
that Nemesis,

528
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,333
you and your friend
can rest assured

529
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,625
the both of you will be seeing
Grimm again very soon.

530
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,375
[SETH]
Hey, get back here!

531
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,500
[MELIE]
Wait!

532
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,458
Let’s not take this too far!

533
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,458
[SETH sighs, frustrated]

534
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,458
[SETH]
The mummified freak is gone.

535
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,750
[MELIE]
But, Seth...

536
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,208
do you have any idea
who that guy was?

537
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,541
[SETH]
None at all.

538
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,916
He was strong, though.

539
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:14,416
I don’t think I could’ve
beat him by myself.

540
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:16,750
[ALL gasp]

541
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,375
[running footsteps]

542
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,666
[SOLDIER A] We heard
explosions, what happened?

543
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,416
[SOLDIER B] Hey, you two!
What are you doing up there?

544
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,083
[MELIE] Inquisitors, and it
looks like they’re onto us.

545
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,208
Let’s run for it!

546
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,208
-[MELIE] Right.
-[SOLDIER A] Hey!

547
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,416
Hold it right there!

548
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,416
[SOLDIER B]
They’re getting away!

549
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,708
We need to inform the captain!

550
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,708
[SOLDIER B running, panting]

551
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,958
[SOLDIER B]
Excuse me, sir!

552
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,500
Captain Konrad!

553
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,625
[KONRAD]
What is it?

554
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,125
Why do you look
so damn panicked?

555
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,541
Just how many times
must I tell you?

556
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,625
It’s an Inquisitor’s duty
to remain calm,

557
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,875
no matter the circumstances.

558
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,375
I want 10,000 push-ups!

559
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,833
Right! My apologies, sir!

560
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,750
[grunting]

561
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,958
[KONRAD]
Good.

562
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,166
Now, tell me what
you came to report.

563
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,958
[SOLDIER B grunting]
Yes, sir!

564
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,000
[grunts]
A building on 12th street...

565
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,791
[grunts]
was destroyed by...

566
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,750
[grunts]
unknown sorcerers.

567
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,541
[grunts] Several others
were damaged, sir.

568
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,875
[grunting continues]

569
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,958
Any casualties?

570
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,875
[grunting continues]
None, sir.

571
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,000
The area...

572
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,291
[grunts]
was empty at the time.

573
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:22,416
[KONRAD scoffs]

574
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,958
[KONRAD]
That’s too bad.

575
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,416
With a few martyrs,

576
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,916
we could be passing out
torches and pitchforks.

577
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,541
But an investigation
will do for now.

578
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,000
Let’s hunt some sorcerers.

579
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,000
[NARRATOR]
Having fended off an attack

580
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,833
by the sorcerer, Grimm,

581
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,875
Seth and Melie set out
to investigate

582
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,750
the Nemesis presence
in Rumble Town,

583
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,750
in order to aid
a local family.

584
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:18,833
Why are the Nemesis
attacking here?

585
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,041
And who are the shadowy figures
tied into this mystery?

586
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,000
The bell that echoes
through the town

587
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,250
heralds a brutal battle
to come.

588
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,666
Next time on Radiant,

589
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,875
“The Shadow Lurking
in the City.”
