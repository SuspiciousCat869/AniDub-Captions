The only humans
who can stand against them

00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,541
are those called sorcerers.

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:21,250
However, sorcerers are seen
as tainted by most,

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,041
and are regarded
with fear and distrust.

Ah, Melba, my beloved.

Your hair is darker
than squid ink pasta.

Your lips redder
than marinated octopus.

For this weary soul,

Yeah, feels like
I haven’t eaten all day.

How are ya, Melba?

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,833
Could I get some milk
and a bunch’a bread?

40
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:28,250
And do you think you could
get me an iced coffee, please?

Sure!

00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,958
So, Seth, you’ve been

How’s it going?

44
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,666
That old man’s idea of training
is completely insane.

Yeah of course.

break outta jail one time,

attached to ya for life.

00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
So, I take it you won’t
be eating today, Doc?

65
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,250
Well, how about
some more coffee then?

66
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,166
I’ve got another
new blend available.

then it's coffee...you made?

69
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,958
[DOC] It’s gonna taste every bit
as bad as her herbal tea.

70
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,916
But, if I can choke it down,

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,083
then Melba might like me more.

There’s no avoiding it!

Ah. It’s an unexpected flavor,

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,166
and yet all too familiar.

90
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,916
Like greeting a long-lost friend
with your tongue.

91

It’s unique, but not
aggressive about it.

a definite winner.

I’ve found some happiness.

to go my way!

[SETH]
Got any idea what that was?

111
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,416
Can’t say I do, but it looked
all squirmy and slimy.

112
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,708
[SETH] Wait. You don’t think
it was a Nemesis?

113
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,583
[YAGA]
That beast was no Nemesis.

[MELIE and SETH]
Ahh!

115

show up outta nowhere!

Yeah, you’ll end up
scaring someone.

117

[YAGA]
I know you’re amateurs,

118
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,625
but can’t you at least tell
“that thing” from a Nemesis?

119
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,750
Huh?

120

[YAGA]
As chance would have it...

121
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,291
I happen to know
exactly what the thing

122
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,416
that abducted
your friend is called. Here!

123
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,375
It’s a creature
thought to be near extinction,

124
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,541
and has the combined features
of a squid and an octopus.

125
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:39,750
The beast is known
as a Devilfish Kraken!

126
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,916
Devilfish what now?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
What’s a Kraken?

[MR. BOOBRIE chirping]

129
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,250
How do you think
it even got down there?

130
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,958
[YAGA]
Fair question.

131
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,833
You see,
the subterranean waterworks

132
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,583
have become something
of an unofficial

133
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,291
dumping ground
for Artemis sorcerers

134
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,958
looking to get rid
of the creatures

135
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,791
they used
for their experiments.

136
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,208
There could be all manner
of freakish castaways

137
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,958
lurking in those depths.

138
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,750
'Kay...have any idea why that
Devilfish thing went after Doc?

139
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,041
Wait, you don’t think
it’s gonna eat him, do you?

140
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,708
[YAGA] Not likely.
They don’t eat people.

141
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,083
The Devilfish Kraken
has a peculiar trait.

142
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:18,333
-It absolutely loves coffee.
-[ALL] Huh?

143
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,416
Aw, that’s kinda cute.

144
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,708
[PAPA] I now see why it
showed up beneath our café.

145
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,083
Then it only kidnapped Doc

146
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,833
to get the coffee
he was holding?

147
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,041
Oh, in that case.

148
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
He’s got nothin’
to worry about.

149
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,500
Well, maybe.

150
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,875
But Doc does drink
an astounding amount of coffee,

151
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,583
and on a daily basis.

152
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:38,000
Which means that the man reeks
of coffee at any given moment.

153
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,541
Well, that’s what
I was thinking.

154
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,583
So the creature
might get confused.

155
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,458
And with any luck,
it’ll eat him.

happen, though.

[MELIE]
Right, it's an octopus!

160
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,458
There’s no way it would eat
a whole person

00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,916
You expect me to leave Doc
to die in some sewer?

321
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,125
[MELIE]
Seth...

322
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,375
There are very few
tasks as difficult

323
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,791
as fighting a powerful
wild animal in its element.

324
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,666
If you hope to succeed
as an ambush hunter,

325
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,166
you should keep that in mind.

326
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,666
My mistake.

327
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,166
[YAGA] And besides,
the Devilfish Kraken

328
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,166
isn’t the only danger
lurking in the waterworks.

329
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,083
Who knows what you’ll encounter
if you venture too deep?

330
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,416
[SETH]
None of that matters right now.

331
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,416
I’m still going down there,
and I’m still saving Doc!

332
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,708
Oh. So you can best
the Kraken after all?

333
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,791
Who cares if I can or can’t.

334
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,958
I have to, and so I’m gonna.

335
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,833
Because I help my friends
no matter what,

336
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,625
not just when its easy.

337

[MELIE]
Seth.

338
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,125
Hm, you’re right!
Let’s do it!

339
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,833
As much as I admire
your determination,

340
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,041
if you rely on brute force,
you’ll lose.

-What should I do?
-[MELBA] Tell you what.

342

As long as you're
brainstorming,

343
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,708
why don’t you all
refresh yourselves

344
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,708
with my newest special blend?

345
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,375
Thanks so much for offering
but I couldn’t possibly.

346
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,125

have to pass too.

It’s gonna be sink
or swim for sure,

351
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,791

I think I have a good plan.

What kinda torture do you plan
to put me through this time?

360
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,333
Just leave me alone already,
stop tryin’ to help!

361

What? There’s no way you
actually mean that, is there?

362
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,958
Even if I do make it back,

363
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,000
Melba’s never gonna
give me the time of day.

364
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,083
I tried to find peace,
but all I got was disaster!

365
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,833
So, I’ll stay down here,

00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,875
and I’ll live out the rest of
my days with this slimy monster!

What if it decides to eat you?

370
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,333
He would never do that to me!

371
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,000
This guy knows we share
a love of coffee,

372
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,958
and because of that,
he recognizes me as an equal.

[DEVILFISH grumbles]

00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,833
I can’t believe it.

377
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,583
He actually managed
to make a friend!

378
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,875
There’s no nice way
to put this, Seth.

379
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,416
But the bottom line
is that nothin’ good

from having you around!

just how weak you are.

479
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,750
-About time.
-[SETH exhales]

480
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,208
Yes, I have.

481
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,250
So please, make my training
even more difficult!

482
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,791
I was planning
to do just that.

483
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,833
Don’t throw in
the towel quite yet.

484
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,708
Right.
Wouldn’t even dream of it.

485
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,958
Everything going okay over here?

486
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,250
-Oh, how’s it goin’ Melba?
-Hi!

487
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,541
I didn’t get a chance
to tell you this yesterday,

488
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,958
but this special blend of yours

489
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,750
is the best coffee
I’ve ever had.

490
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,750
-Yeah? I’m so glad!
-[PAPA] Hmm?

491
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,750
Yeah. The thing is...

492
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,250
I feel like it’d be the dream
if I could just...

493
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,500
I dunno.

494
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,958
Like...have this coffee
back at home.

495
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:58,708
Yup, I could live
with whoever made this.

496
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,291
It’s good to know
you enjoyed it so much!

497
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:05,041
-Did you hear that, Papa?
-Yeah!

498
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,500
Hold on.

499
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,750
It wasn’t you?

500
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,833
Oh, uh...did you
think I made that batch?

501
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,291
No, that coffee
was my special blend.

502
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,250
But I'll tell ya what, boy.

503
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,666
Since you love it so much,

504
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,666
I’ll make all your coffee
myself from now on,

505
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,916
and you’ll never touch anything

506
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,750
that was made
by my daughter again.

507
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,083
[giggles]

508
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,208
I guess now you two
are gonna be friends.

509
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,791
[PAPA]
Looking forward to it.

510
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:28,916
[DOC screams]

511
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Why does this stuff
always have to happen to me?

512
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,125
[NARRATOR]
Seth excels at his training,

513
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:13,291
and rapidly improves
at manipulating Fantasia.

514
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,000
But ever the harsh teacher,

515
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,750
Yaga prohibits him
from using magic.

516
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:21,166
Meanwhile, the Bravery Quartet
approaches Artemis.

517
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,875
Without access to the magic
he once relied on,

518
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:25,916
how can Seth bring an end
to their plot,

519
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,333
and save the city?

520
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:29,250
Next time on Radiant.

521
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,083
“Proof of Strength.”
