00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,416
[NARRATOR]
Beasts known as The Nemesis

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,583
wreak havoc on mankind.

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,833
The only humans
who can stand against them

4
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,583
are those called sorcerers.

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:21,291
However, sorcerers are seen
as tainted by most,

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:24,041
and are regarded
with fear and distrust.

7
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,541
Seth arrived at Artemis,

8
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,166
the so-called
Sorcerers Paradise.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,666
While searching for
the sorcerer Yaga,

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,500
he met a strange old man.

11
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,250
Around the same time,
the Inquisition arrived,

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,208
intending to arrest Seth
and his friends.

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,500
But the day was saved by the
floating city’s military might,

14
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:47,666
and Master Lord Majesty’s
political influence.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,958
Witnessing this renewed
Seth’s determination,

16
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:54,583
and at last, the old sorcerer
revealed his true identity.

17
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,958
Yes, the strange old man
was Yaga all along.

18
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:08,708
Ah! Talk about
a beautiful morning!

19
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,250
Don’t you agree?

20
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,250
Gudule?

21
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,958
Gertrude?

22
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:15,916
[MELIE giggles]

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,583
I feel like this is gonna be
a really wonderful day!

Head’s up, Melie!

26
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,583
-[SETH] Ahh!
-[MELIE screams]

27
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,541
No, Gudule!

29
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,333
Sorry for dropping in
so suddenly.

30
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,666
I need you to help me
learn magic, sound good?

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,000
[gasps]

[NARRATOR]
“Drops of Friendship.”

33
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,416
[MELIE] So, where is
all this coming from?

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Why do you need me to help you?

35
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,083
Mostly cause of what Yaga said.

36
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,833
[YAGA] So tell me.
Who the heck are you?

37
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:23,458
You said you know
Alma somehow, right?

38
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,666
I’m Seth!

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,541
And Alma taught me
everything I know.

40
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,750
She told me to come out here
and look for you.

41
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,250
Here! She wrote you a letter.

42
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,833
Hmm...

43
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,333
[SETH] Okay, you’re one
of the strongest sorcerers

44
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,708
around here, yeah?

45
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,000
I was hoping you could
help me find Radiant.

46
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,041
Hm.

47
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,125
What a waste of time.

48
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,500
-Ow, ow. No, no, no, no, no, no.
-Oh no! Careful.

49
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,250
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

50
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,916
What’d you go
and do that for?

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,416
Alma wrote that to tell you
how great I am!

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,083
I don’t care if Alma
thinks you piss rainbows, kid.

53
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,708
If you can’t demonstrate
your strength,

54
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,708
then I have nothing
to teach you.

55
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,500
So if my help
is what you’re after,

56
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,541
then I suggest you prove
you’re worth my time.

57
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,500
Sure.
I can do that.

58
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,375
I’ll show you
my most powerful move.

59
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:09,291
Titan... Punch!

60
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,166
[crash]

61
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,833
Oh yeah, you’re impressed.

62
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:15,750
Ahh!

63
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,833
Stupid fool!

64
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,041
All you did was gather Fantasia
in your fist and punch with it!

65
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,250
That doesn’t even
qualify as a spell!

66
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,958
Wait, really?!

67
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,458
If you’re not even
competent enough

68
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,083
to master a basic offensive
spell like Meteor Drops,

69
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,041
then you have no business
searching for Radiant.

70
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,958
Come back to me
once you’re stronger, boy!

71
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,333
[SETH]
So, yeah.

72
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,500
That’s why I could use
your help.

73
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,541
Oh. That does make sense.

74
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,333
Anyway, I need you to teach me

75
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,416
some of those awesome
attack spells of yours.

76
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,666
[SETH] I saw you use
a whole bunch of them

77
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,416
on the day we first met.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,875
-You remember?
-Yeah...

79
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,458
that may be true, but--

80
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,875
Would you mind teaching me
how I can do the same thing?

81
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,375
[MELIE]
Mm...

82
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,875
Look, Seth,

83
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,291
it makes me happy to know
that you have faith in me.

84
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,291
It means a lot.

85
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,000
More than you would think.

86
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,833
But I can’t help you!

87
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:07,125
I’m really sorry.

88
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,458
[MELIE]
I used those spells after

89
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,708
my personality
switched, remember?

90
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,333
As I am now, I’m terrible
at offensive magic.

91
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,083
I can barely use it at all.

92
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,500
[SETH]
You’re kidding.

93
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,916
I’m still pretty good
at defensive spells,

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,500
but that’s it.

95
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,208
[SETH sighs]

96
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,958
Oh! Maybe, you could
help me get better

97
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,375
-at gathering Fantasia then!
-[MELIE] Huh?

98
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,750
I guess I could try.

99
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,041
Yeah. Okay!

100
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,583
So when the Fantasia
goes like “fwooo!”

101
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,125
You hold it and kinda
go like “schwoop!”

102
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,041
See?

103
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,000
I’m really not following.

104
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,000
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

105
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,416
Come on!

106
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,708
Don’t look at me like that,
Mister Boobrie.

107
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,875
you’re hurting my feelings.

108
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,291
I did my best, didn’t I?

109
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,416
I’m sorry I couldn’t
help you out, Seth.

110
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,458
[laughs]
Nah, don’t sweat it.

111
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,500
I’m sorry for buggin’
ya so early.

112
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,041
I’ll just go and practice
on my own.

113
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,166
[BOTH sigh]

114
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,208
-[MELIE] Hey! Wait a second!
-[SETH] Mm... hmm?

115
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,583
I can’t help much,

116
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,833
but I do know someone who can!

117
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,791
[MELIE]
He should be around here.

118
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah! There he is!

119
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,708
[SETH]
Huh? Isn't that...?

120
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,083
Although this rose pales
compared to your beauty,

121
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:27,166
I hope that you’ll accept it
as a token of my undying love.

122
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,791
All right, Doc, game face.

123
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,375
-It’s time you made your move.
-[MELIE] What’s up, Doc?

124
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,000
[DOC]
Ahh!

125
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,208
For you! Take it! Please!

126
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,125
Wow, it’s so pretty!

127
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,000
[DOC]
Huh?

128
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,500
Wait, Melie?

129
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,291
And Seth’s with you, too?

130
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,083
You got me a flower?

131
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,791
Aw, that’s so sweet of you, Doc.

132
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:45,833
What?

133
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,166
Why would I get a rose for you?

134
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,000
This is obviously
for my beloved--

135

[WOMAN]
Welcome to Kettle Coffee!

-Good Morning!

Nice to see you, Doc.

138
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, and you brought Melie too!

139
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,833
Yeah, uh, how are ya, Melba?

140
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,041
It is a good morning, I mean
just look at this weather!

141
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,625
Yeah, what Doc just said!

142
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,875
How’s life, Melba?

143
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,791
Well, every day’s
a new adventure.

144
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,750
Say, I don’t think
I’ve met your friend yet.

145
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,166
Hi there, my name’s Melba.

146
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,708
What’s up, I’m Seth!

147
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,083
I’ma be a famous hunter
before long.

148
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,666
Oh!
[chuckles]

149
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,750
Well, I’m not much
for fighting Nemeses myself.

150
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,208
I just serve up drinks.

151
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,375
But it’s nice to meet you.

152
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah, right back at’cha!

153
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,375
Seth here is new to town,

154
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,750
he only just registered
as a citizen.

155
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,125
[MELBA]
That’s great!

156
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,875
This is a wonderful place
for young sorcerers.

157
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,541
Please feel free to visit us
at the café anytime!

158
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,083
-[SETH] Sure!
-[DOC] My beloved Miss Melba

159
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,083
looks as beautiful as ever!

160
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,208
Her big brown eyes
are like the cocoa

161
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,041
beans that grow

How dare you leer
at my little girl like that?

His name is Mister Melba Papa.

He’s a wonderful cook
and a doting father

Really, you’re gonna scare away
all of our customers!

that thinks he can steal

I’m sorry, Doc.

When Papa gets worked up like
this, there’s no stopping him.

I wouldn’t worry
too much about him.

Thank you for treating us.

[MELIE] Yeah, I haven’t had

[MELBA]
I’m glad you liked it.

So, Seth,

00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,208
you said you came here
from Pompo Hills.

204

Looking to get
your curse removed, I’ll bet.

00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,833
-[SETH] Nope!
-[MELBA] Huh?

206
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,208
I wanna find out
where Radiant is,

207
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,500
so I can destroy it.

208
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,083
[MELBA]
What’s Radiant?

209
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,958
[MELIE] It’s apparently where
the Nemesis come from.

210
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,333
-[MELBA] Oh! You don’t say!
-[DOC] Hmph.

211
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,333
Of course a kid like him
would believe in fairy tales.

212
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,333
Talk about a stupid
waste of time.

213
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,625
-[MELBA] That’s amazing, Seth!
-Huh?!

214
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,625
And really brave of you.

215
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,208
I bet most people
would be too scared

216
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,708
to go to a place like that.

217
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,166
That’s true, but not me!

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,250
[DOC grumbling]

219

We just ate.
Are you still hungry?

220
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,250
That chair can’t
actually taste good.

221

It tastes like wood!

[SETH] Thing is, before I
can get to Radiant,

223
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,333
I need to learn
some new offensive magic.

I really wanted to help him,

225

but I don’t know
that much myself.

226

So, we’re in a rut.

00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,666
[MELBA]
Oh, I see. Rough.

228
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,458
[SETH] But then Melie suggested
that I get you to help me, Doc!

229
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,375
[DOC spews, coughs]

230
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,333
And what makes
you think I can help?

231
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,083
[SETH] Well, you’re
a researcher, so you know...

00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,666
-[DOC] Huh?!
-[MELIE] I figured you’d’ve

233
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,708
learned a lot about
magic from your studies.

234
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,625
[SETH] Yeah, so I’ll be
counting on you!

235
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,875
[DOC] I can’t believe you had
the nerve to show up here,

236
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,375
let alone ask me to take time
from my day just to help you.

237
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,208
I could make a list of crap
you’ve done to me

[MELBA] That’s just wonderful!

Huh?

244
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,875
Not only have you uncovered
the secrets of sorcery,

245
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:21,041
you’re also generous enough
to share your wisdom freely.

It’s like you’re
one of the great sages

they talk about in legends.

Yeah! That’s just how I do.

00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,125
I mean, It’s my civic duty.

252
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,333
When you’ve got as much
worldly wisdom as I have,

253
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,041
you must save future generations
from their own ignorance!

Offensive magic, eh? Rest easy.

255
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,750
Once I finish teaching you,

256
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,833
you’ll be slinging spells you
never even realized existed.

my own support as well.

00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,041

of my special herbal tea!

Oh wow! Cool!

266

for this batch is roast beef.

as the last blend?

This herbal tea of yours
is just incredible.

to start his training

-But your tea.

around here for, kid?

a shame, though!

I told Melba I would,
and I keep my word.

319
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,500
That said! I’m not touchin’
any Fantasia myself,

320
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,083
and I’m not about
to spar with you.

321
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,416
The most I’ll be able
to do for you

322
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,833
is maybe read out loud
from some grimoires.

323
00:12:57,916 --> 00:12:59,208
That sounds good to me!

324
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,791
For starters,
how ‘bout you teach me

325
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,333
what I gotta to do
to cast Meteor Drops?

326
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,541
[sighs]

327

-[MELIE giggles]
-[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

328
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:11,291
Let’s see.
Meteor Drops, Meteor Drops.

329
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,291
It’s around here
somewhere... ah!

330
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,291
Okay. Here it is.

331
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,750
So... first, you close
your eyes.

332
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,208
Then, take a deep breath,
nice and slow.

333
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,125
[DOC]
Next, release that breath

334
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:28,291
as if you’re expelling
all impurities from your body.

335
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,125
Once that’s done,

336
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,625
and you’re left empty,

337
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,958
open your consciousness
to the outside world,

338
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,166
and expand your senses.

339
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,875
You should feel Fantasia
all around you,

340
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,500
pressing against your body,
like a warm breeze.

341
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,250
Gather the Fantasia
in your magic tool.

342
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,208
Guess that’s
your gloves... yeah.

343
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,916
Gather it all in your gloves,

344
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,958
and clearly visualize the form
of the magic you want to create.

345
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,250
Focus your entire
being on this image.

346
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,791
[SETH] Visualize the form
of the magic.

347
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,083
Once the image
is formed in your mind,

348
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,416
shout the name of the spell.

349
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,250
Well, here goes nothing.

350
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:05,458

-[Doc] Uh...
-Aw, man!

353
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,083
What the heck was that?

354
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,125
Why didn’t it work?

355
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,916
I did it just like you told me!

356
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,708
-Come on!
-[DOC] I don’t know!

357
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,916
I gave you the instructions
straight out of this grimoire.

'Kay!

359
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,000

Ya can’t brute force your way
through everything, kid.

366
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,583
Ahhh!

-You killed Doc!
-I killed Doc!

373

[SETH]
Get over it.

374
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,666
I said I was sorry,
so stop your grumbling.

375
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,875
You shut up!

376
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,416
I don’t care what you say,

377
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,708
I’m never gonna help you again,
and that’s final!

378
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,458
But Doc,
if you won’t help him

379
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,833
then there’ll be nobody left
to teach him magic.

380
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:14,000
Sounds like a “him”
problem to me.

-[DOC grumbling]
-[MELIE whimpers]

[MELIE] Oh no.
Doc seems really upset.

383
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,125
If Seth can’t train, then
he’ll never find Radiant.

384
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,916
And I can’t help at all!

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,708
The heck’s my problem?

386
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,458
No matter how hard I try,
I can’t seem to do magic right.

387

Heh. I say, you just
don’t have the talent.

That’s so mean!

If you wanna know
what your problem is,

390

I can tell you right now.

the answer into you

you never forget it!

actually tryin’ to kill me.

Pathetic.

Well, of course you did.
So cool!

Oh, I’m fine.

to stay away, I get it.

be thanking you!

After all,
if you hadn’t pushed me,

I wouldn’t’ve been able
to use Meteor Drops!

Because as long as I was able
to be helpful to you,

you kinda sent Doc flying.

481
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,916
-We should prob’ly find him.
-[MELIE] Ahh!

482
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,958
[DOC]
Hey!

483
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,208
Help me!

484
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,041
Someone get me down!
[cries]

485
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,000
[SETH]
Meteor Drops!

486
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,666
See that? What’cha think?

487
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,916
Well...

488
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
you could stand to gather
more Fantasia,

489
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,666
but I’ve seen worse.

490
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,583
[chuckles]

491
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,000
Way to go, me!

492
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,000
Now, I’m ready
to take on Radiant!

493
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,125
-[whack]
-Ow!

494
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,291
Ow! What was that for?

495
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,291
You really don’t understand
a thing, do you?

496
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,458
That blasted Alma dumped
a complete rookie on me.

497
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,458
-Huh?
-Listen well.

498
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,833
Radiant is
a forbidden territory.

499
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,041
[YAGA] Many of the world’s
most notable sorcerers

500
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,000
have tried long
and hard to locate it.

501
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:27,000
And not a single one of them has
ever come close to that goal.

502
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,666
How would a feckless punk
like you stand a chance

503
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,916
where they failed?

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,875
I’m not saying it’s impossible.

505
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,416
Just that if you wanna do it,

506
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,791
you have to train hard,

507
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,583
and become
a first-rate sorcerer.

508
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,333
Luckily for you,

509
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,041
I happen to know a sorcerer who
can bring you to their level.

510
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,541
[SETH gasps]

511
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,875
Yaga!

512
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,333
Please take me on as your pupil!

513
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,250
I just might,
but before that...

514
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,625
Uh...

515
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:00,166
Cauldron. Crash!

516
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,166
Eeee...

517
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,291
-No way!
-[DOC 

518
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,333
-Exactly as I thought.
-What was that for?!

519
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,833
You said your name
was Seth, right?

520
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,833
Uh, yeah. Did you forget?

521
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:24,333
You’re going to have to learn
a lot more control,

522
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,791
especially considering
those frail hands of yours.

523
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,333
I warn you now,

524
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,750
my training is both strict
and demanding.

525
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,458
Uh...

526
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,291
Right!

527
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,750
[sighs]
Wow, what a beautiful morning!

528
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,708
Don’t you agree?

529
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,708
Gudule.

530

[MELIE giggles]

532
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:00,958
I feel like this is gonna be
a really wonderful day!

533
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,333
[SETH]
Watch out Melie!

534
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,500
Not again!

535
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,000
-[MISTER BOOBRIE screams]
-Oh no!

536
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,625
Gudule, your head!

537
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,125
Melie.

538
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,166
Sorry for dropping in like this.

539
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,375
The thing is, I need you
to let me live in your house.

540
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,125
-Huh?
-I’m sorry.

541
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,791
I was staying in the park
and that was fine for me.

542
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,250
But Doc tells me
I can’t even sleep there.

543
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,708
Well, not for free.

544
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,791
You’re a real piece
of work, kid!

545
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,791
You just keep runnin’ up
my debt don’t’cha?

546
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,875
Between café repairs
and street repairs,

547
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,500
and walkway fees and now this,
it’s pilin’ up so much

548
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,166
I can’t even afford to go
to Kettle Coffee anymore!

549
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,875
[SETH]
Oops. My bad...

550
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,125
If you get that it’s your fault,

551
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,125
then hurry up,
and find a place to live!

552
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,416
-Yeah
-Oh.

553
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,000
So what do you say?

554
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,041
Please let me stay here!

555
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,250
I suppose.
I do have a spare room

556
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,000
that I’m not using
for anything else really.

557
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,166
So...

558
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,750
You could use it if you want.

559
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,583
-You’re serious?
-Totally! Why not?

560
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,000
I mean, I always
have a lot of fun

561
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,916
when you’re around,
so let’s do it!

562
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,583
The idea of having my own
roommate is kind of exciting.

563
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,916
[giggles]
So move on in!

564
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thanks, Melie,
you’re a lifesaver.

565
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,583
-I’m glad we’ll be roomies!
-Thank you!

566
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:12,708
-I feel exactly the same, Seth.
-So... hey,

567
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,916
I’ve been wondering
since I last flew in here...

568
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,416
[MELIE]
Hm?

569
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,916
What’s the deal with
that doll lookin’ thing?

570
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,750
[MELIE]
Oh! That’s uh--

571
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,125
Well it’s a he, and he’s um...

572
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,000
you know. I guess
you could say...

573
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,416
he’s my friend.

574
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,083
[SETH]
Wait. What?

575
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:32,958
-Does he talk to you?
-[MELIE] Kinda?

[NARRATOR] Danger stalks
the streets of Artemis.

One seemingly
peaceful afternoon,

578
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:15,916
Doc is taken away
by a mysterious creature.

579
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,291
To save Doc,

580
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,583
Seth and Melie venture
deep into the sewers.

581
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:24,166
There, in the darkness,
they encounter a fearsome beast

582
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,583
that the Titan Punch
cannot harm.

583
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,250

Underground Water System”
