The only humans who
can stand against them

are those called sorcerers.

However, sorcerers are seen
as tainted by most,

with fear and distrust.

I was chasing
a bunch of Nemeses

attacked me out of nowhere!

Then again, if we do manage
to pull it off,

[SOLDIER 5]
Come on! Keep it movin'!

319
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,500
Hurry up! Before the ground
falls out from under you!

320
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,833
Hey, twerp!

321
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,666
Didn't you look
at the day's clock map?

322
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,375
The shelter's back
on 5th Street.

323
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,666
[SOLDIER 6] 15 years behind bars
to any non-compliants!

324
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,791
Head to Gate 12,
on the double!

325
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,125
What's the deal?

326
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,666
Why are they making
everyone evacuate?

327
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,666
I don't think this is just
some random earthquake.

328
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,041
Wait, I know!

329
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,208
All these years of mining
deep into the ground

330
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,041
have made the island unstable.

331
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,791
So when the place
gets out of balance,

332
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,791
they have to move the residents
around to prevent a collapse.

333
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,083
Gotcha.

334
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,458
And that would explain
where everyone was

335
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:32,375
when we first got to town.

336
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,000
[DOC]
Yeah.

337
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,333
And I bet that clock tower's
givin' people their orders.

338
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,500
All right, we'd better move too!

339
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,208
-[MELIE] Right!
-[SETH] No, wait.

340
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,875
[DOC and MELIE gasp]

341
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,250
Didn't you hear what I just
said, this area is dangerous.

342
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,708
The first place we went
was evacuated,

343
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,708
and that's where
we found the echoes.

344
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,916
Wait a sec, do you think
the Nemeses are waiting

345
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,083
until everyone leaves
to come out?

346
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,583
Can't say for sure.

347
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,583
But still, there's a chance
they'll show up again.

348
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,333
There's also a chance
we'll be crushed by the rubble.

349
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,583
Not if we keep watch
from the sky, there isn't!

350
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,875
[ALL breathe nervously]

[CITIZENS indistinct chatter]

353
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,708
[MR. ZEDA] We cannot get
separated again, all right?

354
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,000
Yessir.

355
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,000

[SETH]
Bingo! See 'em?

359
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,166
[MELIE] It looks like
there are more than 15.

360
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,458
[DOC] No way we can handle
all these things on our own.

361
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,875
[SETH]
They're coming this way.

362
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,416
Can't we do something
about those three at least?

363
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,166
[MELIE]
Yeah, if we corner them somehow.

364
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,083
[SETH]
Hmm...

365

Kid's off his rocker.

00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,166
Hey, Seth, can you hear me?

368
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,583
You okay?

00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,458
Yeah!

372
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,833
Ha-ha-ha! We just put these

[MELIE]
Seth! Are you hurt?!

381
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,000
[SETH]
I'm fine.

382
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,750
[DOC] It looks like you scraped
up your face pretty good.

383
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,833
[SETH] Forget that,
deal with the echoes!

384
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,208
Don't let them get away!

385
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,041
If you hold them in place for
a few moments, I can trap them.

386
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm on it!

Whaddaya think, Melie?

389
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,958
Will this work?

Yes!

of the circle now!

Yeah!

400
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,750
We bagged ourselves
one, two, three!

401
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,000
We caught three Nemeses alive!

402
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,583
We can make a fortune
off these things!

403
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,416
And when Melba finds out...

404

Wow, you really caught
three of them, you're so brave!

That's right,
we just turned ‘em in.

406

It was no big deal though,

407
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,500
at least not for a natural
born hunter like myself.

408

Ah! Then I want to
marry you three times!

409

And buy three houses!

410

And bring up
three beautiful babies!

Whoa, buy me a drink first,

Or just bring me one
from the shop, ha-ha.

Ahh, if we really
get rich after this,

416
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,875
I know what I wanna do.

So eat your hearts out!

Yeah, of course you can
have seconds, Gertrude,

you are one of my many
dear friends, after all.

[SETH]
Nice!

426
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,291
After this, we can
pay off our debt!

Yeah!

428
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,083
And I can start to eat somethin'
aside from wild plants!

429
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,125
Let's get these echoes
captured for real

430
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,958
so we can have a party
every single day!

431
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,708
Huh? I thought that part
was already done.

432
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,083
No, we still need to seal them

433
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,333
inside of those magical
scrolls I brought.

434

It's not the easiest
spell to do,

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
so I'll really need to focus.

gettin' away, is there?

they should feel too heavy
to run anywhere.

Plus, they're all connected
so I don't think one of them

440

would leave the others
even if it could.

Come back here!

479
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,125
Aw, crap!
He got away so easy!

480
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,000
[MELIE]
It's okay!

481
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,791
I was able to put a mark on him,

482
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,250
so he won't get
the drop on us again.

483
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,000
-[SETH] Awesome!
-[DOC] All right!

484
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,458
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

485
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:33,333
This journey has been
both long and unpleasant.

486
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,916
Forgive Grimm for that.

487
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
But it's all over now.

488
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,000
You can finally rest.

489
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,916
[ZOMBIES muffled grunting]

490
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,458
Gentlemen.

491
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,958
Please, treat your new guests

492
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:08,000
just as gently
as Grimm once treated you.

493
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,666
[NARRATOR]
When Konrad of the Inquisition

494
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,166
fills the citizens
of Rumble Town with fear,

495
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,875
they riot in the streets,

496
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,416
calling for the expulsion
of all immigrants.

497
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,375
Needless to say, this is
exactly as Konrad had planned.

498
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,666
The people grow violent.

499
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,333
Can Seth bring an end
to the chaos to come?

500
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,041
Next time, on "Radiant,"

501
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:30,708
“Overture of Turbulence.”
