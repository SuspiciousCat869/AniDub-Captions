-[MELIE crying]
-[SETH] Oh--

163
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,541
You're good.
What happened, Melie?

164
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,458
[MELIE]
It's Doc, Seth. He was--

165
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,500
-He's gone.
-[SETH] Huh?

166
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,208
What do you mean?

167
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,125
I've got Doc right here
in this pouch.

168
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,125
[MELIE]
Huh?

169
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,375
See?

170
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,875
He turned into a baby.

171
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,625
[BOTH scream]

172
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,083
Yeah, I sensed
some weird Fantasia earlier,

173
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,833
so I decided
to follow the trail.

174
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,125
[panting]

175
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,375
[SETH] And, well,
before I'd gone too far,

176
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,375
I found Doc lyin' on the ground.

177
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,500
[SETH screams]

178
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,583
Hey Doc, ya takin' a nap?

179
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,250
Come on, Doc, snap out of it
and say something back!

180
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,125
Wait a second,
why is he so still?

181
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,916
-Holy crap! Something's moving!
-Ah, that's better!

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,541
I thought I was gonna
suffocate down there!

183
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,666
That was almost
lights out for me.

184
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,500
Hey, Seth,
good to see ya.

185
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,208
So did one of those
Inquisitor types

186
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,916
decide to cover me in a blanket
of rubble, or somethin?

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,750
Sheesh. Hm?
Uhh...

188
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:04,500
Oh, no, someone killed me!

189
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,541
[SETH] So, yeah, that's how
it all happened.

190
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,583
[DOC] It looks like
my curse is molting.

191
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,000
Who woulda guessed it?

192
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,875
[SETH] Tough break,
that's a really gross one.

193
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,125
What's wrong with you?!

194
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,000
[MELIE]
I'm so glad you're safe!

195
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,625
-[DOC grunting, struggling]
-That really is you, right?

196
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,875
I'm so sorry for leaving you.

197
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,416
I honestly thought
you were dead!

198
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,666
Look! If you keep squeezin' me
like this, I will die!

199
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,333
[MELIE]
Not only do I get you back,

200
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,250
you're a cute lil baby now!

201
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,333
[DOC]
Stop swingin' me around!

202
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,666
My baby bones can't take it!

203
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,708
I'm really gonna snap! Really!

204
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:34,791
Ahh--
hey look, there's a light.

205
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,833
What's that about?

206
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,375
My mark spell.

207
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,916
It should only go off like that

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,750
if Grimm is somewhere nearby.
[gasps]

209
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,333
[GRIMM] An impressive use
of marking magic.

210
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:51,750
-[MELIE and SETH gasp]
-[GRIMM] You may be wary,

211
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,416
but Grimm is not your foe.

212
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,208
Grimm has come to warn you all.

213
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,458
Warn us of what?

214
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,291
[GRIMM] The Domitor and her
Nemeses are powerful.

215
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,833
Fighting them is beyond
your capabilities.

216
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,208
[SETH gasps]

217
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,000
[GRIMM] You should take
advantage of this chaos,

218
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,625
and flee the island.

219
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,958
You think you can
beat her by yourself?

220
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,666
[GRIMM]
Not without killing her.

221
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,083
-[MELIE gasps]
-Not a chance, I won't let you!

222
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:16,750
[GRIMM] Do you have
an alternative in mind?

223
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,583
I'll think of something.

224
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm not just gonna watch,
that's for sure!

225
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,791
Um. I might have an idea.

226
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,166
-Wanna hear it?
-Huh?

227
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,708
If you distract them,

228
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,666
then I can drain the strength
of the Source Nemesis.

229
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,458
And by doing that,
it'll free you two up

230
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,333
to deal with the Domitor.

231
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,333
[GRIMM] You truly have
the ability to drain

232
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,958
a Nemesis of its strength?

233
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,000
Using what?

234
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,333
An item.

235
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,375
The only catch is that
I have to get close.

236
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,375
[GRIMM] Grimm still has work
to do in this world.

237
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:45,375
Throwing this life away
is not an option.

238
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,500
However, if you're
confident in your plan,

239
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,208
then Grimm will assist you.

240
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,500
-[SETH] Nice!
-[MELIE] Oh, cool!

241
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,958
Hey! Hold on for a minute!

242
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,625
You don't plan
to take me, do ya?

243
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,791
That's not safe, I'm a baby!

244
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,166
I'm a little bit worried
about Mister Boobrie, too.

245
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,250
[MISTER BOOBRIE chirps]

246
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,208
[GRIMM]
Not a problem.

247
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,458
Grimm has a place where the...

248
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,833
less formidable members
of your party

249
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,458
can be kept safe
from any danger.

250
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,875
Um... is it off
of this island?

251
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,500
'Cause that's where
I'd like to be.

252
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,291

[rumbling, crashing destruction]

254
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,916
They gave no mercy.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,583
So treat them in kind. [gasps]

256
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,916
Ah... so you've thrown in your
lot with those that despise you.

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,583
Very well.

258
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,333
If you protect this island,
then I'll destroy you with it.

[SETH and MELIE gasp]

260
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,333
[GRIMM]
Seems the Domitor was keeping

261
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,416
more Echo Nemeses concealed.

262
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,416
Are they heading for us,
or for the town?

263
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,708
Doesn't matter.

264
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,791
Cause I'm gonna
take 'em all out!

265
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,291
[MELIE]
Seth, wait!

266
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,916
Here goes!

What just happened?

279
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,625
Man, that hurts.

280
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,125
Am I inside the tower?

281
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,750
I need to get back.

282
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,375
-[PIODON] I'm surprised at you.
-[SETH] Hm?

283
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:02,458
You'd be dead if I hadn't
enhanced your guard.

284
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,166
[SETH]
Who are you?

[gasps]

286
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,375
Let's just say I'm a friend.

287
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,833
Seth no!

288
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,916
[GRIMM]
Don't worry. He's alive.

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,791
How such a miracle
occurred is unclear.

290
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,208
But Grimm can still detect
Seth's heartbeat

291
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,791
through the feather bandage
Grimm wrapped around his arm.

'Kay.

We can't allow any more of those
Echoes to attack the town.

294

The plan can still work,
let's keep fighting.

If you insist
on protecting them,

then you will share
in their fate.

00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:54,666
How dare you ask for anything?

323
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,458
You slew my brothers.

324
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,583
The only beings I care
about in this world!

325
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,541
I didn't realize those
Echoes were your friends.

326
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,666
I was only trying to stop them
from attacking the city.

327
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,041
I'm so sorry.

328
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,458
Stop talking as though
you understand my pain!

329
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,500
But I... I feel like...

330
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,625
I do understand
some parts of it.

331
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,625
At least I know
what it's like to be lonely.

332
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,541
To miss the warmth of a friend.

333
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,875
But, look,

334
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,583
you're only spreading
more of that misery!

335
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,458
Don't talk to me
about misery!

336
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:27,208
The people of this city
took everything I had!

337
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,708
The kids they killed,
they were my family!

338
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,750
And the only man
that showed us kindness

339
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,458
was murdered
by the bastard they obey!

340
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:35,875
And now it's their turn.

341
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,333
I'm gonna take everything
from them too!

342
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,875
[MELIE gasps]

343
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,458
I had to try.

344
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,125
Are you planning to fight me
together this time?

345
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,666
Or, let me guess,

346
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,625
you're picking her up
so you can flee on your broom.

347
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,208
[GRIMM]
There's no cause to flee.

348
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,375
This young sorceress
did her part,

349
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,250
and now Grimm will do his.

350
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,666
[scoffs]
No idea what that means.

351
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,208
But my brother's wounds
have healed.

352
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,583
And there's no one
in this world

353
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,125
who can stand against
our strength combined!

354
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,625
[whimpering gasp]

355
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,458
What happened to my Fantasia?

356
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,708
You won't be able to cast
any more spells at us.

357
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,750
I have bound you
to the Plundering Lamp.

358
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,041
Any Fantasia you attempt
to gather for yourself

359
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,916
will be diverted
and used as fuel for its flame!

360
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,750
I see it now.

361
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,375
So that's what she was doing.

362
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,541
You can no longer make use
of any kind of magic.

363
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,041
Which means you can
no longer command

364
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,416
those Nemeses to help you!

365
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,041
[GRIMM] Your Nemeses
are feral beasts now.

366
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,833
They're nothing to be feared.

367
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,333
They're far more than that,
don't underestimate our bond!

368
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,041
We'll destroy you both.

369
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,750
Exactly like we did to your
little friend with the horns!

370
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,833
[GRIMM]
I take it you mean Seth.

371
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,416
He is unharmed.

372
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,333
The boy was adamant
that Grimm should not kill you.

373
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,625
The hell are you getting at?

374
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,583
[GRIMM]
Nothing really.

375
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,166
Grimm is no longer capable
of taking human life.

376
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,541
[BOTH gasp]

377
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,166
[GRIMM]
You had best keep your distance.

378
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,041
Kannibal is a fine weapon,

379
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,541
but it requires a great
deal of space to wield.

380
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,583
[BOTH gasp]

381
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,166
[GRIMM]
Now then... it begins.

382
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,791
[gasping, grunting]

383
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,958
[HAMELINE gasps]

384
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,750
[GRIMM] You needn't fear,
Grimm won't slay you.

385
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,916
Only the Nemeses
in your thrall.

386
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,916
[SETH]
Really though.

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,125
You gonna tell me who you are?

388
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,916
[PIODON] For the time being, you
may as well just call me Piodon.

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
-[SETH] And what do you want?
-[PIODON] Not a whole lot.

390
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,625
Let's just say
I'm a spectator

391
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,500
who enjoys observing
this world's mechanisms.

392
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,666
-[SETH] Huh?
-[PIODON] Well, it's your turn.

393
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,125
-What should I call you?
-Uh... I'm Seth.

394
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,583
It's nice to meet you.

395
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,666
So, tell me, Seth.

396
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,333
What made you decide
to keep that sealed away?

397
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,250
Sealed away?

398
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,583
Are you talking
about my bandage?

399
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,500
[PIODON] You can't fight at full
strength while it's on, right?

400
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,250
I'm not sure what you mean.

401
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,875
This bandage
is covering up a scar

402
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,458
I got from being attacked
by a Nemesis when I was a kid.

403
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,666
It's what keeps my curse
from spreading any further.

404
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,750
Hmm?

405
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,833
[SETH]
Alma-- [sighs]

406
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,625
The sorcerer
who raised me told me that.

407
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,750
It's not anything weird
like a seal, okay?

408
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,083
[PIODON]
Mm...

409
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,291
I get it.

410
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,916
Guess your understanding
of Fantasia

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,083
leaves a lot to be desired,

412
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,375
but that's hardly your fault.

413
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,041
Listen, Seth.

414
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,333
The way you are at the moment,
you're only able to access

415
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:47,291
a small fragment
of your real potential.

416
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,333
[SETH]
Hmm?

417
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,500
[PIODON]
I'd love to do something

418
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,666
about that pesky seal for you,

419
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,208
but I doubt
you'd even let me try.

420
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,083
Hey, you do wanna be powerful,
don't you, Seth?

421
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,416
[SETH]
Huh?

422
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,458
What kinda question is that?

423
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,458
[PIODON] I can understand
why you'd be cautious.

424
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,416
You don't know if
I'm a friend or foe yet.

425
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,666
Well, Seth,
why don't you tell me?

426
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,833
Which side would ya say
that you're on?

427
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,208
[SETH]
Huh?

428
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,208
[PIODON] Who is it
that you're fighting for?

429
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,291
Fancy yourself a defender
of the defenseless?

430
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:16,583
Sounds nice...

431
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,750
but those are the same people

432
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,750
that treat
the infected like dirt.

433
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,666
Even kill 'em sometimes.

434
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,416
So, maybe... you'd rather fight
for the infected?

435
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,791
If so...

436
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,166
Do you plan to act
like that Domitor

437
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,250
and massacre those
who would persecute you?

438
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,250
You know,

439
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,458
you could always fight
for the Inquisition.

440
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,000
But if you did,

441
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,708
there's little doubt
that you would have to work

442
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,875
with people like Konrad
at some point.

443
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,375
[SETH exhales]

444
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,000
[PIODON] I'll ask once again:
where do you stand?

445
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Why and for whom,
do you fight?

446
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,166
-I'm fighting for--
-[rumbling crash]

447
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,000
[gasps]
They need my help.

448
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,208
[SETH grunts]

449
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,583
Where ya goin'?

450
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,208
I'm not done talkin' to ya.

451
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,083
[SETH yelling out]
I owe you one!

452
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,458
I didn't really follow much
of what you were saying,

453
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,875
but thanks for the save!

454
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,041
I'll catch ya later!

455
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,833
[PIODON] Huh. The kid's
certainly full of energy.

456
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,708
Ah, well, I'll be seeing him
again soon enough.

457
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,500
You better not die
on me, okay, Seth?

458
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,625
You don't even know
that we're family yet.

459
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,416
We can't end it like that.

460
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,750
[GRIMM] Without their Domitor,
these Echoes have no direction.

461
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:31,541
Hunting them
will be a simple feat.

462
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,833
Hm?

463
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,833
[HAMELINE] I don't call them
my brothers for no reason.

464
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:41,375
You people have no idea
how powerful our bond is!

465
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,250
[GRIMM]
She saved the Nemeses

466
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,291
by recalling them
into that scroll.

467
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,958
[MELIE]
Ah!

468
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:53,833
[GRIMM] Grimm's control of
Kannibal is at its limit.

469
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,291
I can only bind
the Plundering Lamp

470
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,125
to one enemy at a time.

471
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,416
She's using
the Nemeses' Fantasia now.

472
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,166
So the Lamp doesn't have
any way of absorbing it!

473
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,958
[GRIMM] Grimm failed
to account for this.

474
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,750
Now, I'll blow everything away,

475
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,916
and there's nothing
you can do to stop me!

476
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,708
Please don't do this, Hameline!

477
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:19,083
These people wronged you,
but they don't deserve to die!

478
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:20,708
If you don't like
what we're doing,

479
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,583
then you should come
and make us stop.

480
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,958
That's assuming you can get
close enough to try.

-Ah, there we go.

I'm finally here.

[NARRATOR] As the battle
reaches its final stage,

487
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:14,000
Hameline brings all of her rage
to bear against Seth.

488
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,833
But it isn't her attack
that causes Seth to waver.

489
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:20,000
It's her tragic past, and how
it resonates with his own.

00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,250
"Swear you won't
become a monster."

491
00:24:23,333 --> 00:24:25,958
Will Seth's voice be able
to reach Hameline's heart?

00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,708
Next time on Radiant,

"To Stop the Sound
of the Wind."
