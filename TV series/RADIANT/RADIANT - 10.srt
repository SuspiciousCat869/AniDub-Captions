00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,458
The only humans who can stand
against them,

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,250
are those called sorcerers.

5
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,958
However, sorcerers are seen
as tainted by most

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,666
and are regarded
with fear and distrust.

Seth is a sorcerer in training.

I had a dream.

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,125
It started like a nightmare...

12
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,333
from my childhood with Alma.

13
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,958
People’s fear of the Nemesis
made them scared of me.

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:54,041
Which was strange, because only
a sorcerer like me

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:57,375
could’ve protected
them from one.

16
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,250
Except I was just a kid.

17
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,166
All but powerless.

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,875
Alma was the strong one.

19
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,541
She was the protector.

20
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,083
I’ve met a lot of sorcerers
since then,

21
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:09,958
but she’s the greatest by far.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,333
Someday, I’ll be just like her,

23
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,041
and then I’ll show the world
that sorcerers are amazing!

They put on a festival here

whenever Master Lord Majesty
feels like throwing one, really.

33
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,083
So he can put on a massive
festival like this

34
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:27,291
on just a whim?

Huh...
that’s actually impressive.

There’ll be a ton of stalls
and what not to check out, too.

It should be a lot of fun.

Majesty throws these festivals
to raise cash.

48
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,708
Tourists flock in from around
the world,

with other countries.

54
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,208
Which means that if
the Inquisition

wants to come after Artemis,

56
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,541
they’ll have to consider the
diplomatic repercussions first.

going for him,

As a matter of fact, I’ve been
told you were her apprentice.

Are you saying you
know her, too?

No, but I do know of her.

[NICK]
They say she’s quite capable,

137
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,833
but she refused to work
with Artemis

138
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,708
in order to keep her
lone-wolf image intact.

139
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,791
I’ve only heard rumors,
so personally, I have my doubts

140
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,166
about how talented
she really is.

141
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,583
I can’t think of any good reason
for a sorcerer

142
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,583
to refuse to join our city.

143
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,333
Although, I suppose it might be
that she’s just a cheapskate.

[SETH huffs]

145
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,833
But what I think’s
even more likely,

146
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,875
is she’s afraid someone’ll
see her in action,

147
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,458
and realize how weak she is!

148

[SETH] She might look like
a grumpy old hag,

154
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,333
and she’s definitely twice
as mean as she looks.

So don’t talk crap about her.

Especially when
you’ve never met her!

00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:39,166
Well if she’s as powerful
a sorcerer as you claim,

161
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,708
why not prove it yourself
as her apprentice?

162
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,041
You could do it by taking me on
in this broom race.

163
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,125
Manage to defeat me,
and I’ll take it all back.

164
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,041
You’ve got yourself
a match, jerk!

165
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,083
But the money...

166
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,583
[chuckles]
Well,

167
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,875
I’ll leave you to practice
begging for mercy.

168
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,958
[NICK laughs]

169
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,666
That was a super cool exit line!

170
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,583
[HENCHMAN B] Yeah, your laugh’s
the best, Nick!

171
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,166
Man, that guy really knows
how to make me angry!

172
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,708
What the heck gives him
the right to make fun of Alma?!

173
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,333
If you don’t mind me saying so,

174
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:08,833
it’s sweet how much faith
you have in your old master.

175
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,000
You think?

176
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,250
So, what was she like
as a person?

177
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,166
Oh... I guess I never told ya
too much about her.

178
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,791
Hmph.

179
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,583
Alma was...

180
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,750
well...

181
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,291
[SETH]
This is stupid!

182
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,750
What’s the point of cleaning
outside the house?

183
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,541
I should hear a lot less whining
and a lot more scrubbing.

184
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,125
I just punched a rock!

185
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,750
You punched a boulder,

186
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,833
which was large enough to wreck
an entire cattle ranch.

187
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,791
And let’s not forget
that it caused the cattle

188
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,541
to stampede through the village,

189
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,583
turning every person
in it against us.

190
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,166
And this is after you started
the plantation fire

191
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,041
that dried out a whole lake!

192
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,750
I’m banning you
from setting so much

193
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,916
as a foot on that island
for a while.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,458
[SETH]
Aw, for how long?!

195
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,333
Until I’m convinced
that you won’t be a menace!

196
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,250
Mess up badly enough,
and they’ll send someone

197
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,958
from the royal capital
to arrest and execute you.

198
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,291
[SETH grunting]

199
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,916
[ALMA] Also, if you think
I didn’t notice

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,208
that you’ve been stealing
my grimoires, you’re wrong.

201
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,625
No more of that either.

202
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,000
But, I only borrowed them
because I wanna become

203
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,208
a respectable sorcerer
as soon as I possibly can--!

204
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,875
-[ALMA] Quiet!
-[SETH whimpers]

205
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,708
[ALMA] You haven’t even become
a respectable person yet,

206
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,291
all right?!

207
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,833
[SETH groans]

208
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,416
Well, if you’d stop treating me
like a little kid.

209
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
[SETH]
Hmm...

210
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,291
Mmm? Mm?

211
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,375
Hmm.

212
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,041
All right!
The coast is clear.

213
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,625
[SETH chuckles]

214
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,791
Just where do you think
you’re going?

215
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,208
Uh-- I--

216
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,541
I just thought
I’d take a stroll!

217
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,916
I already know
what this is about,

218
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,666
so don’t bother
trying to hide it.

219
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,833
[SETH groans]

220
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,166
You’re determined to go?

221
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,416
Yeah.

222
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,875
There’s no point
in trying to stop me.

223
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,083
I have no intention
of making you stay.

224
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,125
Huh?

225
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,458
But where do you plan to start,

226
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,291
it’s not like
you have any leads.

227
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,375
Well, I don’t have leads...

228
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,208
-but I do have plenty of spirit!
-[ALMA groans] Ugh...

229
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,000
[ALMA]
You won’t leave with nothing.

230
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,541
Take this stuff with you.

231
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,583
You’ll need it.

232
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,958
Wait a second.

233
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,208
You’re not seriously
giving me your broom?

234
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,291
Don’t you need it?

235
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,583
I’d rather you took it.

236
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,250
What’s a sorcerer
who can’t fly, right?

237
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,541
You’ll never really look
the part

238
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,750
if you don’t even
have your own broom.

239
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,625
Thanks, Alma.

240
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,125
But, um, maybe I should--

241
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:21,875
Also, let me see your hand.

242
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,791
[SETH exhales]

243
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,083
[ALMA]
Seth...

244
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,250
-promise me something.
-Huh?

245
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:33,500
Swear you won’t
become a monster.

246
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,875
[gasps]

247
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:38,000
I won’t become a monster,
you have my word.

248
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,333
All I’m gonna be

249
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,625
is the greatest sorcerer
in the whole world!

250
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,583
[softly chuckles]
Is that so?

251
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,125
I won’t worry then.

252
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,166
All right.

253
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,083
I’ll see ya!

254
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,333
[SETH panting]

255
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:53,708
[SETH panting slows, stops]

[SETH crying]

[SETH crying continues]

258
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,083
Hey, Alma...

259
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,416
thank you.

260
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,041
[ALMA]
Take care of yourself, you hear?

261
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:20,125
[SETH crying, sniffling]

262
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,125
All right, then.

263
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,416
I’m shoving off.

264
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,791
So do it.

265
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,458
Go on, you’re burning daylight.

266
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,625
[SETH softly laughs]

00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,875
[SETH grunts]

268
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,000
[MELIE]
Oh, cool!

269
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,875
So that broom was Alma’s
before she gave it to you.

270
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,541
Yeah, she’s awesome.

271
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,500
She’s also super scary
when she’s mad.

272
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,250
Seriously, I’d take on a Nemesis
over her any day of the week!

273
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,750
[giggles]
Okay, but even if she’s scary.

274
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,750
I can tell she means
a lot to you.

275
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,583
Right, which is why
I can’t lose.

276
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,958
I gotta do her proud.

277
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,416
[MAJESTY]

fur-vently waiting for.

The climax of our Festival.

281
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,166
The Artemis Broom Race
will begin meow-mentarily!

282
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,500
That's it?
I guess my awesome broomstick

283
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:29,291
must’ve scared everyone else
outta the race...huh?

00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,000
Whoa! What is that thing?

285
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,208
What do you think?

286
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,291
You ever seen
a racing broom before?

287
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,166
[SETH gasping for air]

288
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,708
[NICK] I’m surprised you didn’t
lose your nerve and back out,

289
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,166
bumpkin.

290
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,000
[SETH]
Hey! Was it “Neck?”

291
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,041
It’s Nick,
and don’t you forget it!

292
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,250
His broom is the latest model,
that’s been heavily customized.

293
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,541
The design had to be widened

294
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,333
to accommodate two
additional sub-boosters,

295
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,208
but it’s still super aerodynamic
thanks to its streamlined shape.

296
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,625
Everything about it
screams that he has

297
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,041
a need for speed
and money to burn!

298
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,416
That’s one rich-boy broom!

299
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,541
I can’t say I understood
much of that.

300
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,958
But you’re pretty much
just saying

301
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,833
that his broom
cost lots of money, yeah?

302
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,666
[NICK laughs]

303
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,583
If you’re hoping to get one for
yourself, you can’t afford it.

304
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,083
Why would I want a goofy
lookin’ broom like that?

305
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,166
[NICK laughing]

306
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,958
It’s so like you
to say that, Nick!

307
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,041
You’re on a roll
today, it’s amazing!

308
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,750
That boy.
His name was Seth, was it?

309
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,541
I hear the odds on him
are one in ten thousand.

310
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,916
Definitely a dark horse,

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,958
but looks like
Nick’s got him marked.

312
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,333
[SETH growling]

313

-[MELIE] Seth!
-Huh--

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,583
Huh? Melie?

315
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,750
Why are you here?

316
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,125
I figured I’d join
the race, too!

317
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,541
-Huh?
-Lookit,

318
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,958

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,333
-[MELIE screams]
-[SETH grunts]

481
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,333
Thanks for the save.

482
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,958
I know that you’d do
the same for me.

483
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,166
Yeah, but it’s not over.

484
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,541
Leave me behind so you
can win the race.

485
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,958
You can still catch up
with Nick and his friends.

486
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,750
There’s no way
I’m leaving you behind!

487
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,500
We’ll finish this together.

488
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,333
Thank you.

489
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,875
Well, this race
is nearing its end,

490
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,250
and it looks like
Nick’s gonna win

491
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,458
for the third year
in a row, easy!

492
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,500
I take everything back, the kid
with one in 10,000 odds

493
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,750
is comin’ in hot!

494
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,916
Do whatever it takes, Seth!

495
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,333
Your buddy Doc needs
his coffee money back!

496
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,250
Dammit... how’s that old
dust broom even flying?

497
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,041
It’s not an old dust broom!

498
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,875
It used to belong
to a Nemesis Hunter,

499
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,375
the strongest one in the world!

500
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,708
It’s an antique!

501
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:26,666
And my broom’s the latest model!

502
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,333
Let me show you just
how big the difference is!

503
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:33,375
-You two ready?
-[HENCHMEN] Yeah! Lead the way!

504
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:34,833
Hang on tight,
we’re gonna speed up!

505
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,000
[MELIE]
Right!

506
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,083
[MC]
Incredible!

507
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,708
They’re almost neck and neck!

508
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,916
The boy with one in 10,000
odds is gaining on Nick fast!

509
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,875
Ugh!

510
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,666
I just have to push harder!

511
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,750
I can’t let this punk win!

512
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,625
-[HENCHMEN] Ahh!
-[SETH gasps]

513
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,166
[MC]
Nick wins!

514
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,625
[CROWD cheering]

515
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,208
And let that be a lesson
to you, kid.

516
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,125
Uh--

517
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,500
[MC]
What’s this?!

518
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,041
The one in 10,000 kid
is nowhere to be seen!

519
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,916
[NICK]
Uh...

520
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,208
[SETH grunts]

521
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,625
[MC]
Look at that!

522
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,166
He quit the race to save
his fallen competitors!

523
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,250
[gasps]

524
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,416
Uh, thanks a bunch.

525
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,833
Thought we were s’posed
to be your rivals.

526
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,666
Don’t worry about that.

527
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,291
Alma wouldn’t have let you
fall either.

528
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,083
[MC] He gave up the race
to rescue his opponents!

529
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,791
Talk about a good sport!

530
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,458
[NICK]
How could you give up the win

531
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,250
just to help your opponent?

532
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,166
[MAJESTY]
Nick is our Champion once again!

533
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,458
Thank you both
for a "supurrb" match!

534
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,583
And special thanks to all
of our spectators "fur"

535
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,791
making this event "pawsible" by
litter-ing us with your money!

536
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,458
[CROWD cheering]

537

[pounds fist on table]

538
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
[DOC]
What?!

539
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:40,208
No prize money if you don’t
cross the finish line?!

540
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,875
[MELIE sighs]

541
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,375
And after we put in all that
effort, it’s just too bad.

542
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,958
Yeah...right...

543
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,625
I really wanted to beat Neck.

544
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,791
We were close though!

545
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,750
Don’t take this so lightly!

546
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,625
Those exorbitant entry fees
were just added onto our debt!

547
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,208
How can I get this
through your thick skulls?!

548
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,291
I get it, but with all the debt
we have, what’s a little more?

549
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,541
You've got to learn
the value of money!

550
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,375
[giggles]
At any rate,

551
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,708
I was thinking...

552
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,375
we should probably
start looking for work.

553
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,583
[DOC]
Are you listening to me?!

554
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,375
[giggling]
I’m down!

555
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,166
[GRIMM]
Rumble Town...

556
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,541
it’s been quite a few years

557
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,958
since Grimm has worked
in a city this large.

558
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,166
With humans crammed into
every fetid corner,

559
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,500
there may well be
a few casualties.

560
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:29,791
Secrecy will be of
the essence here.

561
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,916
Luckily...

562
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,958
that’s how Grimm works best.

563
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,416
[NARRATOR]
Doc receives a job request

564
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,125
involving an unknown Nemesis.

565
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,583
When Seth and Melie find out,
they harass Doc

566
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:17,125
until he agrees to take the job,
and bring them along to...

567
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,833
Rumble Town.

568
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,416
Here, the Inquisition’s presence
has awakened discrimination

569
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,625
against both sorcerers
and immigrants.

570
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:27,083
Leading to the rise of some
irrational political policies.

571
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,625
Next time on Radiant.
