Seth believed the Bravery

But in reality, they were
cruel opportunists.

of Pompo Hills,

and in front of a crowd.

It’s not right!

Isn’t it enough that we have to
fight those monsters for them?

That we risk our lives
to keep them safe?

Why do we have to get treated
like bad guys too?

165
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,208
-Uh--
-That’s enough

166
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,375
talking for right now.
Drink this and get some sleep.

167
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,750
You need it.

168
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,250
[sighs]

169
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,291
Jeez, kid.

170
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,166
Were you this stubborn before
I met you, or is this new?

171
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,875
We’ve traveled together
for about 10 years now.

172
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:43,458
And the earliest memory that
I still have is stained in red.

173
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:48,291
The ravenous red of
an all-consuming fire.

174
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,041
[groans]

175
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,166
Where am I?

176
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,208
[MALE DOCTOR]
Oh, good.

177
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,875
You’ve regained consciousness.

178
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,875
But what happened to me?

179
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,333
I was hoping
to ask you that, actually.

180
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,791
You were found unconscious,
and gravely injured.

181
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:17,416
I can’t remember... anything.

182
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,708
Well, do you know this boy?

183
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,125
[gasps]

184
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,000
[DOCTOR] When they found
you, you were holding him

185
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,791
in your arms,
as if to protect him.

186
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,250
I assumed he was your son, but,
if you don’t recognize him...

187
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,208
[ALMA]
I had lost everything.

188
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,666
Everything except for a child
I had no recollection of.

189
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,583
That child, of course, was Seth.

190
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,000
With him in tow,

191
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:53,041
I set out on a journey
to find myself.

192
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,041
It took some time,
but my injuries did heal.

193
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:25,458
Not knowing where
I should start,

194
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,708
I wandered about
all-but aimlessly,

195
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,583
asking everyone I met
if they remembered me or Seth.

196
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:45,041
But not one person did and so...
we pressed on.

197
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,583
Damn it.

198
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,375
I feel like most
of the people say “no”

199
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,791
before they even understand
what I’m asking them.

200
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,791
-[thud]
-[grunts]

201
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,791
Are you okay?

202
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,666
Alma?

203
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,625
It’s just the headache
I get from my curse.

204
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,166
Nothing to fuss about.

205
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,041
Yeah, but-

206
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,375
[ALMA]
Just let it go, all right?

207
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,958
[ALMA] They say sorcerers
like me are “cursed”.

208
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:19,333
And in some ways, they’re right.

209
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,541
I survived an encounter
with a Nemesis.

210
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:29,500
Was tainted by it, and gained
the ability to use Fantasia.

211
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:33,750
In this world, sorcerers are
largely regarded as heretics,

212
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,916
and persecuted.

213
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,916
Young as he is,

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Seth’s a sorcerer, too.

215
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,333
In the early days.

216
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:46,333
I saw Seth as little more
than another burden.

217
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,958
I thought of leaving him
behind a hundred times.

218
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,916
But I needed to find out
who I was,

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,416
and he was the only lead I had.

220
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,458
When I thought
about it that way,

221
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,750
leaving him behind
ceased to be an option.

222
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,750
So, that’s how we carried on.

223
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,583
Until the incident...

224
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,541
All right.

225
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,541
I’ve got a Nemesis to deal with.

226
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,041
You stay here and keep quiet
till I get back.

227
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,541
Mm... you be careful.

228
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,708
See you soon.

229
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,083
[ALMA] I had just honed
my skills to the point

230
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,500
I could begin
supporting myself and Seth

231
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,250
by working
as a Nemesis Hunter.

232
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,541
My hunts frequently took me
to distant islands,

233
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,041
which meant leaving Seth alone.

234
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:35,041
[SETH humming]

235
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,708
[whimpers]
Ow!

236
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,625
Hey! Let’s play a game.
[laughs]

237
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,916
[laughing]

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,833
-[thud]
-[SETH] Ah!

239
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,166
[MALE CHILD] Let’s play
inquisitors and sorcerers!

240
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,500
[FEMALE CHILD]
We finally caught you, Sorcerer!

241
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,333
Just leave me alone!

242
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,083
I never did anything
to you guys!

243
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,333
Yeah?
Tell that to our parents.

244
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,208
Everyone knows it’s ‘cause
of you nasty sorcerers,

245
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,083
our livestock dropped dead!
Now you’re gonna pay!

246
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,750
What? No, that was ‘cause
of the Nemesis!

247
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,333
-I had nothing to do with it!
-Shut your mouth!

248
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,708
-We’re gonna kill you, monster!
-Ah!

249
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,416
It’s a sorcerer hunt!

250
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,375
[kicking and punching]

251
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,416
[SETH]
Stop! It hurts!

252
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,416
Lemme go! Please!

253
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,250
[MALE CHILD]
I don't think so!

254
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,625
We’re inquisitors, it’s our job
to deal with you sorcerers!

255
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,833
[MALE CHILD 2]
Yeah, what he said!

256
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,125
[SETH]
Stop it!

257
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,708
Go away!

258
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,250
Go away!

259
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:24,083
[SETH screams]

260
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,875
Where’s Seth?

261
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,625
[crying]

262
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,541
We need to do away with
this monster immediately.

263
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,458
I thought we were supposed to
hold him prisoner

264
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,000
and wait for the inquisition to
send someone to deal with him.

265
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,750
[MALE VILLAGER 1]
We can’t take that risk!

266
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,125
If this “thing” so much
as touches us,

267
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,958
we might end up cursed too!

268
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,791
There’s no choice
but to put him to the torch!

269
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,000
Huh?

270
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,791
[MALE VILLAGER 1]
Wait, what happened?

271
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,458
Was that the wind?

272
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,083
[VILLAGERS worried chatter,
indistinct]

273
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:03,791
Uh!

274
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,250
I just endowed you
with the curse of sorcery.

275
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,791
Can you feel the infection
coursing through you?

276
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,166
[grunts, freaks out]

277
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,416
You think a touch from one of
us’ll make you infected,

278
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,916
isn’t that right?

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,708
In that case,
I think I might start

280
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,583
a little epidemic in this town.

281
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,833
[VILLAGERS panicked chatter]

282
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:25,875
[MALE VILLAGER 2]
Someone help!

283
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,458
Hey, wait for me!

284
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,916
Don’t leave me behind!

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,875
[MALE VILLAGER 3]
Stay away from us, you monster!

286
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,541
I don’t wanna be infected!

287
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,625
[MALE VILLAGER 1]
No, I’m not cursed!

288
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,000
you have to believe me!

289
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,708
I’m not infected, I swear!

290
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:40,166
Hm. I’ve heard lots of
superstitions about sorcerers

291
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,666
through the years,

292
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,166
but that one might just
take the cake, you idiots.

293
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,708
[whimpering]

294
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,500
It’s okay, Seth, you’re safe

295
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,416
It was so scary.

296
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,625
[cries]

297
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,666
They can’t hurt you now.

298
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,416
I won’t let them.

299
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,416
[SETH crying]
'Kay.

300
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,958
[ALMS] As I held his fragile,
wounded body,

301
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,041
I realized for the first time

302
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,708
just how small
and helpless Seth was.

303
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,541
I swore to myself
that I’d protect him.

304
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:17,041
That if anyone tried to
treat him like a monster again,

305
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,583
they would find a monster in me.

306
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,416
I’d made my choice.

307
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,750
Now, let’s go.

308
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:32,125
My wanderings became
a little less aimless then,

309
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,375
which isn’t to say I’d given up
trying to find

310
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,666
who I used to be completely.

311
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,666
But, I’d found a goal that
was even more important.

312
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,125
What I needed was a place
where I could keep Seth safe.

313
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:50,333
Where no one could threaten
or hurt him, ever again.

314
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,083
So toward that end,

315
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,750
I got us our very own
flying castle.

316
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,666
The people we encountered
continued to run us off,

317
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,958
the same way they always had.

318
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:12,125
But then, we just let the wind
take us on a new journey.

319
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:17,000
Someday, we’d find a place
where we could live in peace.

320
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,375
That’s what we told
ourselves, laughing,

321
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,958
as we sailed
across countless skies.

322
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,083
Just look at how much
you’ve grown.

323
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,708
All right.

324
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,916
The coast is clear.

325
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,333
Just where do you think
you’re going?

326
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:12,125
Uh, I thought I’d take a stroll.

327
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,625
I already know
what this is about,

328
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:16,333
so don’t bother
trying to hide it.

329
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,416
[SETH groans]

330
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,416
You’re determined to go?

331
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,833
Yeah.

332
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,166
There’s no point
in trying to stop me.

333
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,666
I have no intention
of making you stay.

334
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,708
Huh?

335
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,333
But where do you plan to start?

336
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,125
It’s not like
you have any leads.

337
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:36,458
Well... I don’t have leads,
but I do have plenty of spirit!

338
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,833
[ALMA groans]
Ugh...

339
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,666
You won’t leave with nothing.

340
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,958
Take this stuff with you.
You’ll need it.

341
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,333
Wait a second.

342
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,541
You’re not seriously giving me
your broom?

343
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,750
Don’t you need it?

344
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,208
I’d rather you took it.

345
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,791
What’s a sorcerer
who can’t fly, right?

346
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,083
You’ll never really
look the part

347
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,125
if you don’t even
have your own broom.

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Thanks, Alma.

349
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,791
But, um, maybe I should--

350
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:07,833
Also, let me see your hand.

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,875
[gasps]

352
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,916
Seth,
promise me something.

353
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,125
Swear you
won’t become a monster.

354
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:22,583
I won’t become a monster,
you have my word.

355
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,916
All I’m gonna be

356
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,250
is the greatest sorcerer
in the whole world!

357
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,416
[chuckles]
Is that so?

358
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,791
I won’t worry then.

359
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,750
All right.
I’ll see ya!

360
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,791
Yep.

361
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,375
[SETH panting]

362
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,875
[crying]

363
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,791
Hey, Alma?

364
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,958
[SETH]
Thank you.

365
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,750
[ALMA]
Take care of yourself, you hear?

366
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,166
All right, then.

367
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,583
I’m shoving off.

368
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,916
So, do it.

369
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,666
Best get goin’,
you’re burning daylight.

370
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:41,041
[starts to cry]

371
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,625
Good riddance.

372
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:48,458
You were always a hell
of a burden, you crazy kid.

373
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,750
[crying]

374
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,458
Huh?

375
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,500
[gasps]

376
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,125
You’d better get ready, Radiant!

377
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,625
You hear?

378
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,916
Cause this sorcerer’s
comin’ straight for ya!

379
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,375
It's true! Our last hunt
went even quicker.

380
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,375
The little rats
barely put up a fight.

381
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:02,375
I’d honestly rather sit here and
listen to Colonel Santori snore,

382
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:05,166
than pretend to be impressed
by your incessant bragging.

383
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,125
[TEPPES]
Huh?

384
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:07,833
Please show some decorum.

385
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:10,625
We’re expected to be paragons
of righteous living,

386
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,791
not to squabble with each other.

387
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,166
Now then, let us calm our minds,

388
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,625
and study the words
of the Holy Scripture.

389
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,625
[snoring]

390
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,208
-Wake up!
-What?!

391
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:26,166
[chuckles]
Please forgive me, Ullmina.

392
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,625
But I assure you that I heard

393
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,500
and understood every last word
you said, my dear.

394
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:32,875
I swear it
by this very beard, I do.

395
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,791
[MAN]
It’s a pleasure to see you all

396
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,166
once again.

397
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,958
[TEPPES]
General Torque.

398
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,625
[GENERAL TORQUE]
You who uphold order.

399
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:49,333
You Thaumaturges who serve
as the blades of justice.

400
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:53,333
I’m sure you can guess
why I’ve gathered you here.

401
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:56,833
Yesterday, near the town
of Pompo Hills,

402
00:23:56,916 --> 00:24:00,916
a sorcerer with horns
was found at sea.

403
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:10,166
[NARRATOR] Just as his adventure
in search of Radiant begins,

404
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,041
Seth is apprehended
by an airship

405
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,750
belonging to the Inquisition,

406
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,250
who regard sorcerers
as dangerous.

407
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,541
Along with a puzzling girl
named Melie,

408
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:22,333
and an oddball researcher named
Doc, Seth plots his escape.

409
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:25,083
But between the newly formed
trio and their freedom,

410
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:28,166
stands Dragunov,
a powerful inquisitor.

411
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,000
Next time on Radiant:
“A Meeting in the Sky.”
