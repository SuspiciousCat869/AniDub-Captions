if we can't find an island
to set down on.

159
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,666
-[thunder booms]
-Huh?

160
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,625
Did I imagine that?

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,875
[sighs]

162
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,166
Can't believe it.

163
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,541
We were patching up
the ship all night.

164
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,000
I knew this job would be hard,

165
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,000
but I thought it'd be
a bit more glamorous.

166
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,791
We're supposed to be defending
the people

167
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,791
against evil sorcerers.

168
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,625
[SOLDIER] Oh hey, did you hear?
The rumor, about Rumble Town?

169
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,583
Yeah, apparently the local
inquisitors

170
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,708
are about to launch
another full-scale witch-hunt

171
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,166
to mop up whatever heretics
are left there.

172
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,666
[SOLDIER 1]
That sounds like Captain Konrad.

173
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,416
Bet he'll be promoted again.

174
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,375
Captain Konrad.
I've heard of him.

175
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,916
People call him the
"Champion of Rumble Town."

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,208
[sighs]

177
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,458
At least his men
get some action.

178
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Such manual labor
is beneath your station.

179
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,291
My apologies sir.

180
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,333
It's nothing.
I'm glad to help.

181
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,125
Let's finish this as quickly
as we can

182
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,583
-and get some lunch in us.
-Sir.

183
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,208
[SOLDIER]
Captain Dragunov!

184
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:01,750
We've picked up an emergency
signal from an allied ship.

185
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,708
"Forced to crash-land
on a local island

186
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,291
"after sustaining
massive damage.

187
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,416
Requesting
immediate assistance."

188
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,750
Furthermore,

189
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,916
the damage was inflicted
by a flying Nemesis.

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,416
[VICE]
What?!

191
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,000
[SETH]
What are you getting at, Yaga?

192
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,291
Do you really think that there
could be some good guys

193
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,583
in the Inquisition?

194
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,125
Indeed I do.

195
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,666
And this idea applies to more
than the Inquisition.

196
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,166
In your travels, you're bound
to encounter good and bad

197
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,041
people amongst sorcerers
and regular civilians.

198
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,875
Rather than assuming
that someone's evil

199
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,333
because they're
in a certain group,

200
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,750
try waiting till you know
that person for yourself.

201
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,291
I guess that makes sense.

202
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,791
[YAGA] Start shoving people
into labeled boxes,

203
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,875
and you're no better
than those who fear

204
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,666
and discriminate
against sorcerers.

205
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,458
Yeah. I gotta say,
you make a good point.

206
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,000
Although I should mention
that all the inquisitors

207
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,416
I've come across so far
have been self-righteous dimwits

208
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,166
who treated me like dirt.

209
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,000
-So much for that.
-[giggles]

210
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,041
He's right. Most inquisitors
might be mean to us,

211
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,041
but there's probably
a nice one somewhere.

212
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,208
Let me thank you in advance
for your assistance, sir.

213
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:15,250
It's an honor to finally
meet you, Captain Dragunov.

214
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,916
You're kind to say so,
Captain Edmund.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,666
I've been told that your ship
was attacked

216
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,125
by an airborne Nemesis.

217
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,416
I'm relieved that you
and your men are safe.

218
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,416
Yes, we were on our way back
from a mission

219
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
when a Nemesis that easily
dwarfed our ship

220
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,958
attacked us without warning.

221
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,791
It was every bit as strong
as its size would imply.

222
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,250
Our ship took some
rather serious damage.

223
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,083
But I kept a cool head
of course,

224
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,416
and under my leadership,
we were able to repel

225
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,083
the brutish leviathan.

226
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:44,041
Huh. Have you any idea where
the Nemesis might be heading?

227
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,833
[EDMUND] I don't see
what that would have to do

228
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,250
with me at this point.

229
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,833
My priority is to deliver
the fruits of my mission

230
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,791
to headquarters with all haste.

231
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,375
And what does that mean?

232
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,625
I take it you have
some sort of cargo?

233
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,333
Well, you're helping us.

234
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,375
I may as well let you see it.

235
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,416
Huh?

236
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,625
Wait. Prisoners?

237
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,125
[EDMUND] An impressive haul,
don't you think?

238
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,958
They're all sorcerers captured
by yours truly.

239
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,625
[DRAGUNOV]
All of them? You're certain?

240
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,041
Of course I'm certain!

241
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,250
I caught the lot of them
in the act of harassing

242
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,541
our country's good citizens
with their ungodly magic.

243
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,666
[EDMUND laughing]

244
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,708
That's amazing!

245
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,041
You captured this
many sorcerers at once?

246
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,750
But of course.

247
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,583
That's only to be expected of
any inquisitor worth his salt.

248
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,375
You can find
sorcerers everywhere

249
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,750
if you know
how to look for them.

250
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,041
Wow.

251
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,750
So tell me, how exactly
would you like us

252
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,291
to assist you, Captain?

253
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,541
I had imagined that much
would be obvious to you.

254
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,083
[hammers pounding]

255
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,083
As if having to repair
our own ship wasn't bad enough.

256
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,583
[SOLDIER] I get that Captain
Edmund's men can't work

257
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,166
because of their injuries,
but... [sighs]

258
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,916
[SOLDIER 2] Yeah, did he have
to be so smug about it?

259
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,541
[SOLDIER 3]
Can't blame him.

260
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,708
He's earned a name for himself
in practically no time.

261
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,333
He's already brought in
more sorcerers

262
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,750
than some captains will
in their whole careers.

263
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:06,125
[ROOKIE]
That's true.

264
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,875
He's got a bunch of them
in his brig right now.

265
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,416
I don't know how he did it.

266
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,625
[SOLDIER] I hear he used
to serve under Captain Konrad,

267
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
before he got his own command,
that is.

268
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,333
[ROOKIE]
Wait. The Captain Konrad,

269
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,625
-champion of Rumble Town?
-[SOLDIER 2] The very same.

270
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,875
You know our own captain
used to be his superior,

271
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,208
back in the day.

272
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,750
[ROOKIE]
Is that a good thing?

273
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,958
Or does it just mean he lost
in the race to the top?

274
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,500
-[VICE] Enough chatter!
-Huh?

275
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,583
[VICE] All I wanna hear
outta you boys is grunts

276
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,625
-and the pounding of wood!
-[SOLDIERS] As you command, sir!

277
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,125
[ROOKIE]
I've heard enough.

278
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,000
If this captain won't lead me
where the action is,

279
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,625
then I'll find one who will.

280
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,958
Once we get back
to headquarters,

281
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,583
I'll ask to be reassigned.

282
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,875
I want to fight like
a real Inquisitor!

283
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,500
[ROOKIE]
Captain Dragunov.

284
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,916
We've finished patching up the
breach in Edmund's ship, sir.

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,791
I'm sorry you've had to spend
your first mission

286
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,416
working like a glorified
carpenter, but well done.

287
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,125
Oh, I don't mind it, sir.

288
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,583
Greetings!
How go the repairs?

289
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,458
I trust you've not had trouble.

290
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,833
[DRAGUNOV] The breach has been
patched, yet there's more to do.

291
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,916
But you should be airborne
by tonight.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,916
Oh, well done,
that's wonderful news.

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,958
-[rumbling]
-Huh?

294
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,375
-Huh?
-Huh?

295
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,333
[gasps]

296
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,083
What the heck is that thing?

297
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,666
[whimpers] That's the very beast
I spoke of!

298
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,000
The leviathan Nemesis
that attacked my ship

299
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,916
and caused us to wreck!

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,750
[ROOKIE]
That's a Nemesis?

301
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,250
[soldiers murmuring]

302
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,625
[whooshing]

303
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,375
[ROOKIE]
It's enormous!

304
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,708
It's tracked us down
to finish what it started!

305
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:44,250
Judging from its movements,
I believe you're mistaken.

306
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,208
It doesn't seem to have
any interest in us.

307
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:50,041
[EDMUND]
So, we've been spared?

308
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,291
[DRAGUNOV]
I believe there's a town

309
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,250
in the direction it's heading.

310
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,125
[ROOKIE]
You think it plans to attack it?

311
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,958
Well, that certainly works
to our advantage.

312
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,458
The Nemesis are known to be

469
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
You're a real lifesaver Melie,
I mean it!

470
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,000
I felt like I was gonna get
blown to the next island over.

471
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:01,125
You know we have a front door,
right?

472
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,583
I get that climbing through
the window's

473
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,958
a little faster for you,

474
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,958
but maybe don't use it
at night, in the rain.

475
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:07,625
Yeah, sorry about that.

476
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:10,208
Oh, by the way, I passed Doc
while I was flying here.

477
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,125
He's still outside
of Kettle Coffee.

478
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,458

479
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,666
[DOC chuckling]

480
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,833
Ah! What an elegant evening!

481
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,833
If my favorite café is gonna
stay open even in this weather,

482
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,666
then of course I'll come and pay
my dues as a loyal customer!

483
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,958
No regrets here.

484
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,958
I'm just as happy
as a Devilfish!

485
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,750

[NARRATOR]
On the day of a grand festival,

487
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,958
a young man who knows Alma

488
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,625
makes some disparaging
claims about her to Seth.

489
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,791
Being possessed
of a fiery spirit,

490
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:19,000
when Seth hears the boy
call his old master

491
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,833
a fake, he's enraged.

492
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,666
To defend his mentor's name.

493
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,875
Seth accepts the naysayer's
challenge to a race in the sky.

494
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,500
Next time on "Radiant,"

495
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,958
"Broom of Memories."
