So instead, I'll salt the soil,

483
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:15,208
and let it be the foundation
of a beautiful, purified,

484
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:16,541
Rumble Town!

485
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:20,166
[evil laughter]

486
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,291
Oh, how I've waited
for this day! Finally!

487
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,833
[HAMELINE scoffs]

488
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,791
After all this time,
the day has arrived.

489
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,666
Now,

490
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,083
let the final act begin.

491
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,083
[NARRATOR]
Hameline takes the stage

492
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:13,041
at last, resolved to force
Rumble Town to pay the piper.

493
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:15,375
The Domitor
and her monstrous allies

494
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:17,458
seem hell-bent on revenge.

495
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:22,041
But before she acts, she tells
the true story of District 13.

496
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:25,583
A cruel and tragic tale,
15 years in the making.

497
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,500
Next time on "Radiant,"

498
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:31,000
"With Fists
Like Shooting Stars."
