Nonsense! I've only had one.

Wha--?! But you've killed like a
hundred of these guys!

You've been fighting all day!

00:07:53.185 --> 00:07:54.953 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah because I'm a hornet!

00:07:55.587 --> 00:07:58.257 position:5% line:83% align:start
But you shoot poison and launch
stingers...

00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.224 position:5% line:89% align:start
All hornet.

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:00.959 position:13% line:83% align:start
And what about your striking

00:08:00.993 --> 00:08:01.326 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hornet!

00:08:02.327 --> 00:08:04.029 position:7% line:83% align:start
And those things poking out of
your elbows?

00:08:04.062 --> 00:08:05.330 position:5% line:89% align:start
Those are hornet mandibles...

00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:10.537 position:5% line:83% align:start
But... this handsome face, that
my friend is all natural.

What?! No I'm fine uh...

uh...

Huh? I have no idea what he's
talking about.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.408 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know EXACTLY what I'm
talking about!

00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:23.177 position:52% line:89% align:start
It's strange...

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.910 position:44% line:89% align:start
huh?

00:09:25.412 --> 00:09:29.450 position:5% line:77% align:start

aren't what we initially thought
they were.

00:09:29.483 --> 00:09:30.517 position:83% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:31.952 --> 00:09:34.588 position:5% line:77% align:start
Think about it... What's the
strangest part of our current
predicament?

00:09:36.657 --> 00:09:38.092 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're not fighting roaches.

00:09:38.459 --> 00:09:39.694 position:44% line:89% align:start
That's right Ivan.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.395 position:27% line:89% align:start
No one is chasing us....

00:09:41.428 --> 00:09:43.030 position:21% line:83% align:start

Alright, let's say the pyramids
aren't that important to the
roaches?

00:09:52.139 --> 00:09:53.508 position:19% line:89% align:start
What does that mean for us?

00:09:53.541 --> 00:09:55.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
What does that mean for our
mission?

00:09:55.577 --> 00:09:56.944 position:5% line:89% align:start
The mission remains the same.

00:09:57.579 --> 00:09:58.580 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:10:00.247 --> 00:10:03.351 position:5% line:77% align:start

they must be hiding something
