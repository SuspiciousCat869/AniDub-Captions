I'm calling about my husbands

Yes?

That's all on her, she deserves
it.

That slut left Adolf with no

I most certainly am not!

00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:47.598 position:5% line:83% align:start
Then make sure to treasure that
relationship!

You know what they say, right? A

strong woman makes a man truely
a man.

But then again, life's a bitch.
