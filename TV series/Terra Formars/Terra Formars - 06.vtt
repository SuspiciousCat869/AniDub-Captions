00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:37.460 position:13% line:89% align:start

00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:53.906 position:5% line:83% align:start
the Bugs 2 locust was way more
of a bad ass than you.

[wincing in pain]

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.636 position:7% line:5% align:start
Your intelligence and strength
are serious threats, I'll give
you that.

00:18:31.537 --> 00:18:35.573 position:5% line:5% align:start
But when it comes to fighting,
you're nothing but rookies.

00:18:35.607 --> 00:18:37.040 position:16% line:5% align:start
Nothing compared to me!

Hey...

00:18:45.013 --> 00:18:46.047 position:58% line:89% align:start
What's wrong?

00:18:47.616 --> 00:18:50.050 position:5% line:5% align:start
Having trouble trying to kick me
this close?

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.787 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let me show you how it's done!

00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:03.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
The first year of training is
about form and flexability.

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:05.430 position:24% line:89% align:start
Your basics suck!

00:19:06.932 --> 00:19:09.767 position:27% line:89% align:start
[losing balance]

 <i>this vehicle.</i>

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.081 position:10% line:83% align:start
 <i>I adjusted the length, just</i>
 <i>in case.</i>

00:19:29.017 --> 00:19:31.050 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not that I'm doubting MIchelle's
skill.

00:19:31.718 --> 00:19:35.153 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's an officer, she must have
made it out in time.

00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:38.056 position:21% line:89% align:start
And if not, well...

00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:48.798 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ah, Akari, you clever bastard.

00:19:56.872 --> 00:19:58.139 position:21% line:89% align:start
Time's up! Let's go!

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, standing might not be a
good idea.

00:20:14.552 --> 00:20:15.954 position:21% line:89% align:start
And that's called inertia.

00:20:16.554 --> 00:20:17.989 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ya know, science?

00:20:18.957 --> 00:20:22.158 position:16% line:77% align:start
It's something your leader
likely hasn't gotten around to
teaching you yet.

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:24.760 position:7% line:89% align:start
You can see it's pretty useful.

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:41.808 position:10% line:71% align:start
A jumping grasshopper is one
thing, but a cockroach flying
with open wings, that's a
bullseye.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:45.711 position:35% line:89% align:start
Heads up!

Difficult to learn, even harder
