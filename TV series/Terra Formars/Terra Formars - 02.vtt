(SHICHISEI) <i>Human disease has</i>
 <i>many causes.</i>

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:18.364 position:19% line:77% align:start
 <i>Of course, as you all</i>
 <i>know, there are microbes such</i>
 <i>as bacteria and viruses.</i>

00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:20.366 position:16% line:89% align:start
(JOSEPH) <i>Not to mention,</i>

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:21.901 position:24% line:89% align:start
...love, as well.

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:25.004 position:24% line:89% align:start
As I was saying...

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:30.875 position:7% line:77% align:start
Bacteria can be parasitic in
nature, residing inside host
organisms.

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:37.082 position:5% line:77% align:start
And, as living things, they are
capable of migrating, dividing,
and multiplying.

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:42.087 position:5% line:83% align:start
Viruses, however, have no way to
reproduce autonomously.

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.023 position:5% line:83% align:start
Instead, they have to parasitize
another organism's cells.

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:51.528 position:10% line:83% align:start
They must use host cells in
order to replicate themselves...

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:54.131 position:5% line:83% align:start
...and that often destroys those
cells in the process.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.739 position:10% line:71% align:start
 <i>In other cases, viruses from</i>
 <i>different animals can mutate </i>
 <i>suddenly and then infect humans</i>
 <i>as well.</i>

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.582 position:19% line:71% align:start
 <i>In situations such as</i>
 <i>those, the virus can destroy</i>
 <i>its new, unfamiliar home, the</i>
 <i>human cell.</i>

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:18.587 position:5% line:77% align:start
 <i>The immune system of the human </i>
 <i>host may then respond</i>
 <i>disproportionately...</i>

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:22.090 position:5% line:83% align:start
 <i>...resulting in the emergence of</i>
 <i>illness.</i>

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:33.533 position:5% line:71% align:start
There you have it. All of these
are the basic mechanisms of
infectious diseases in human
beings.

00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:37.771 position:5% line:83% align:start
And now, the reason that you're
all here.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:52.951 position:5% line:89% align:start
 <i>This is the Alien Engine Virus.</i>

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:56.789 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's a new form of virus
that could wipe out humanity...

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.193 position:5% line:83% align:start
...since the mortality rate is
one hundred percent...

00:02:02.593 --> 00:02:04.896 position:5% line:83% align:start
Its existence has not yet been
made public.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:15.472 position:7% line:71% align:start
 <i>Even a new virus will usually</i>
 <i>have a closely related strain</i>
 <i>that can be found residing in</i>
 <i>another plant or animal host.</i>

00:02:16.274 --> 00:02:20.644 position:16% line:77% align:start
 <i>But the Alien Engine, or</i>
 <i>A.E., Virus is a different</i>
 <i>story.</i>

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:24.480 position:24% line:89% align:start
Heh. Interesting.

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:27.818 position:24% line:89% align:start
(SHICHISEI) <i>May I?</i>

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.558 position:5% line:71% align:start
 <i>It appeared suddenly forty-two </i>
 <i>years ago. Then twenty years</i>
 <i>ago, it began multiplying</i>
 <i>rapidly.</i>

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:35.991 position:35% line:89% align:start
 <i>Meaning...</i>

00:02:36.826 --> 00:02:38.493 position:10% line:83% align:start
that it's all the captain's
fault!

Hey, how cool!...

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:30.753 position:13% line:77% align:start
