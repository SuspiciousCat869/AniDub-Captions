Let's all breathe it out.

I know he's the enemy,

And we're gonna need
to take him with us,

Thought I'd come by

Mr. Bear wanted
to shake his paw.

00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,000
I feel like I'm more excited to
meet him than he is to meet me!

00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,500
[ISUZU]
Probably true.

Look, this isn't a good time

Oh, I get it.

I'm back.

Some guy in a sports

Anyway, you shouldn't
be so naive.

I signed a Dragons

I wanted to return
the joy he's given me.

All right. Get well.

You used to love to play catch.

00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,583
You'd always bug me
to play with you.

00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,333
I never wanted to.

Uh?

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,166
[ISUZU] You threw the ball
like a raging ape.

48
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,791
I was afraid you'd
hit me in the face,

and I have a great jawline.

But if it wasn't
for this war, I'd...

Quit ruining this for me!

00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,291
If they're gonna hand out balls,

53
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,333
they need to include
the little bat stand!

Where'd all this sticky

Gross! It's gonna stain.

I just put my tongue
on this napkin.

Agh! I think I ate lint!

Ew. I have to throw up.

Hold on.

If you're getting wet wipes,
go with the unscented kind.

From now on you will

I've surpassed the original

Wait, Beyond!

to accompany such
massive strength.

for me, Hades Durandal.
