[NARRATOR] Gimlet, the new
weapon of the People of Metus,

00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:58,541
(and a delish gin cocktail
flavored with lime and syrup),

00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,083
plowed through the Union

4
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,208
steadily expanding the war zone.

00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,291
Mm, who's thirsty?

6
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:08,375
Meanwhile, the <i>Tiramisu</i> was
positioned near Jupiter

7
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,083
when it received an SOS signal

8
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,750
from a broken-down
civilian transport.

9
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,541
The battleship agreed to take on

10
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,625
the transport's passengers
temporarily. Long enough

11
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:21,208
to ferry them to safety in
the neutral country of Europa.

12

[SUBARU]
My new power is awesome.

13
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,291
[SUBARU] It's like lifting
weights with my mind.

14
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,000
[NARRATOR] Indeed, Subaru's
concentration in battle

15
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,833
was approaching
superhuman levels,

16
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:37,125
and he was quite pleased.

17
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,000
You sure are good at that.

18
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,666
We were just admiring your
wonderful driving skills.

19
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,750
But you're civilian people!

20
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:47,291
[NARRATOR] His concentration was
so strong that he didn't notice

21
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,958
two of the stranded civilians
looking for adventure

22
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,250

in his cockpit.

23

[SUBARU]
How'd they get in here?!

24

[SUBARU]
Okay, everyone pause.

25

Why are you in my cockpit?

26
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,375
[PAC2-AR] They came in while you
were having a pooper party

27
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,208
in the little spaceman's room.

28

Don't you judge me!

29
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,583
And why the hell
didn't you stop them?

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,833
[PAC2-AR] Kick out a sweet
granny and her grandson?

31
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,041
Who hurt you?

32
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,833
Do you get to drive this
spaceship every day?

33
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,916
Why don't you be a dear
and let this sweet boy

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,458
take it for a spin?

35
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,666
[SUBARU]
Uh!

[GRANDMOTHER]
Look at all those asteroids!

37
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,541
I know he would love to do
a few laps around those!

38
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,750
And I bet you're
the perfect mentor!

39
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,333
It doesn't work like that!

40
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,708
No to asteroid laps!

[SUBARU]
You don't "drive" a spacecraft.

42

Animals.

43
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,875
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to see the boy smile.

44
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,666
His parents divorced.

45
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,458
His mom's on Earth and his
father works long hours

46
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,000
on Europa. It breaks my heart.

47
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,458
And here we go
with the guilt trip.

48
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,375
I guess he can sit in
the seat for a few minutes.

49
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,625
[GRANDSON]
Sweet!

50
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,833
[SUBARU] You know what'll
make it really fun

51
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,125
is if you don't touch anything.

52
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:48,958
'Kay!

53
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,833
Aww, the little guy gets me!

54
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,833
What happens if you
press this button?

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,458
Then you waste ammo!

56
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,583
That's the head volley cannon!

57
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,208
He's having so much fun
with that cannon!

58
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,291
Let him enjoy himself
and I'll give you

59

this yummy dried persimmon
for your tum-tum!

62
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,791
What's this thing do?

63
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,375
Nothing!

64
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,750
It transforms the ship using a
secret code only adults know!

65
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,208
Don't touch!

66
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:18,000
[GRANDMOTHER] Teach him well
and let him lead the way.

67
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,416
[SUBARU]
It requires a sequence!

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,833
This is why we can't
have nice things!

69
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,125
Sounds like a party up there.

70

[SUBARU] Stop! I'm using
my serious voice!

Don't piss me off, kid!

[NARRATOR] Although he didn't
know it at the time,

73
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,708
Subaru changed a life that day.

74
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,375
The boy you see here went on to
become a seasoned Union warrior

75
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,125
known as "The Dancing
Grim Reaper."

76
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,458
Their security's still
a tragic mess.

77
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,958
I can't believe they let a
bunch of civilians aboard

78
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,583
without even questioning them.

79
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:55,208
I'm all good if they want
to make it easy on us.

[ISUZU] Look at these beautiful
anti-mobile weapon bombs.

Hello, my precious.

00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,916
These have the
power and precision

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,083
to destroy the new Durandal

84
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,291
without harming anything
else in its path.

I'm holding in my
hand right now?

89
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,041
[NARRATOR] Isuzu and
Maybach used the civilians

90
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,250
as cover to sneak
aboard the <i>Tiramisu</i> .

91
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,041
This is double-sided tape, bro.

92
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,208
That's how they expect
us to attach it.

93
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,166
Double-frickin-sided tape.

94

You're kidding.

95
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,375
[NARRATOR] Never trust
double-sided tape, kids. Never.

96
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,166
That's not possible!
Bombs always come with magnets!

97
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,416
Everyone knows that!
Read the box!

98
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,666
You better not have thrown
it away! Did you? Hey!

99
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,958
[MAYBACH] No, Drama Pants,
it's right here,

100
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,541
and this is the one
for the detonator.

101
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,166
You can't just tape a bomb.

102
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,375
There's gotta be a hook thingy
or a mount or something.

103
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,625
No universe exists where
an object this heavy

104
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,333
stays in place with tape.

105

Plus, how janky does that look?

Uh...

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,875
You did not just tell me
to go buy batteries!

108
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,625
[sighs] Well, I'm over it.

109
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,166
Do you want to reschedule?

[MAYBACH]
No, stupid.

111
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,583
Look.

112
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,583
This bomb is designed
with a switch on it

113
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:11,541
that lets you set it off
even without a detonator.

114
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,375
We'd just have to GTFO.

115
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,708
I could do that.

116
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,541

Finally, let's get the one

117
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,000
that's already open
in the Durandal.

You came through just

But how annoying was that?

I'm gonna write to the

You should.

[SUBARU]
You mean a real one?

162
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,750
Like "Grim Reaper," or "Golden
Finger" or "Dark Crimson Wave?"

163
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,916
[VULGAR] Nah. I was thinkin'
"Steel Virgin." Ha, ha!

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,375
Get it? Like "still a
virgin," but "Steel"?

165
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,041
[SUBARU]
Why are you so mean to me?

166
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:18,041
[VULGAR]
Shut up.
