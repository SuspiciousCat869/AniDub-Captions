1
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:01,500
[KOENIG]
Hey. Let's be honest, guys.

2
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,958
Do you think your lives
are on the right track?

3
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,125
You ever feel like something's
a little lacking?

4
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,875
Want that to change, you've
gotta take action, like me.

5
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,500
[SUBARU] Ensign Koenig
seems kinda different.

6
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,333
[KOENIG] All you gotta do
is listen, no pressure.

7
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,750
Now, I wouldn't tell
just anyone about this.

8
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,791
But you guys are my
comrades-in-arms,

9
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,041
and I wouldn't feel right

10
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,250
if I didn't share this
life-changing secret.

11
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,166
[SUBARU]
What's he talking about?

12
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,000
[KOENIG] We're all just
lowly soldiers here.

13
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,958
Never know when
death might claim us.

14
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,208
Don't know about you guys,

15
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,750
but I'm a person first
and a soldier second.

16
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,125
I mean, just think about it:
why shouldn't we be able to do

17
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,666
what we want and live our
best lives, you know?

18
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,541
Well, yeah, sounds great, but...

19
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:41,958
That's easy for you to say,

20
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,541
but I don't exactly have time
to "live my best life."

21
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,583
[SUBARU] And "doing what you
want" can be expensive, too.

22
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,166
You're absolutely right!

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,625
Living the life you deserve and
finding the kind of happiness

24
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:54,291
we all crave takes a
real time investment.

25
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,958
And I think we all know that
it doesn't come cheap, either.

26
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,708
What if we said there
was a way to eliminate

27
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,875
those pesky worries
about time and money,

28
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:03,000
would you want to hear it?
I'm betting so.

29
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,000
Hold on, is there a way?

30
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,416
One look at me and the ensign

31
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,041
should answer that
question for you.

32
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,500
[SUBARU]
Now I'm curious.

33
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,583
The paychecks we bring in
aren't too bad for pilots,

34
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,333
but we're sick to
death of the job.

35
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,375
And who knows when that might
literally be true, am I right?

36
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,291
[MEN laughing]

37
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,083
[MAN 17D]
Truth, man.

38
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,041
[NARRATOR] Subaru found
himself irresistibly drawn

39
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,875
to Koenig's promises
of wealth and happiness.

40
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,250
[KOENIG] The fact is, friends
allowing the Earth Union

41
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,250
to use us as pawns and
throw our lives away

42
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,833
in their war is
pretty damn pathetic

43
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,708
[SUBARU]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

44
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,208
[KOENIG]
Gotcha!

45
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,333
And we aren't the only ones
who think that way, either.

46
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,458
Right, Subaru?

47
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,541
Uh?

48
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,041
[MAN 17A]
Is that true, Lieutenant?

49
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,833
[SUBORDINATE 17A] Do you want
to talk about it, Subaru?

50
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,833
Sometimes I don't feel like I'm
in control of my own destiny.

51
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:57,500
Like all I'm doing is carrying
out someone else's orders.

52
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,625
Hey, you do more than that.
You're always saving our asses.

53
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,375
And you might be an incredibly
awkward, antisocial spaz

54
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,500
who's got an unhealthy
obsession with his cockpit,

55
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,833
but that's kind of your charm.

56
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,458
The <i>Tiramisu</i> wouldn't
be the same

57
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,000
without you and the Durandal.

58
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,416
We should all count ourselves
lucky that you're here.

59
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,833
He is right.
This job's really rough.

60
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,500
But I'm grateful that I met you,
Lieutenant Ichinose.

61
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,291
[SUBARU]
Grateful?

62
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,541
[MAN 17B]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

63
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,583
[SUBARU] These guys are
actually good people.

64
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,875
Have I been distancing myself
for no reason all this time?

65
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,416
Let's go, Subaru.

66
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,708
I'll teach you the secret to
controlling your own destiny.

67
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,708
[MEN laughing]

68
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,833
[NARRATOR] That's right:
they were all shills.

69
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,500
[SUBARU]
UHK. Isn't this

70
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,041
the Space Broadcasting
Corporation building?

71
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,583
[KOENIG] Yep. And the place
we're headed is nearby.

72
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,875
Doesn't get much more
legit than this, right?

73
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,791
[SUBARU]
Yeah. Totally legit.

74
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,583
[KOENIG] Trust me, Subaru,
you're in good hands.

75
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,625
Since this is your first time,
I'd like to demonstrate

76
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,916
some of the various products
that are available.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,708
I get to try out all this stuff?

78
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,833
[KOENIG] Exactly. If you don't
know it's high-quality,

79
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,416
you can't recommend
it to others, right?

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,208
If we know our products
and can stand by them 100%,

81
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,500
then more people will join our
ranks and spread the word,

82
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,291
which benefits everybody.

83
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,291
Take this hand cream,
for example.

84
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,833
It's easy to mistake for
something sold in stores,

85
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,916
but it's actually a smash-hit
product of ours.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,458
It's made entirely of
natural ingredients--

87
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,750
none of that artificial junk you
see so much of these days.

88
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,625
Well? Do you feel
the difference?

89
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,083
Yeah, totally. It's awesome.

90
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,708
I mean, I've never used hand
cream before, but still.

91
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,000
[SUBARU] This is the purest air
ever to caress my cheek!

92
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:47,000
That little baby's our top
seller in the Mars region.

93
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,708
A bit pricey,
but worth every cent.

94
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,750
[SUBARU] It's a completely
different color!

95
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,708
This cleaner's another of our
popular all-natural products.

96
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,958
And, hey, if you get thirsty...

97
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,541
[SUBARU]
No way!

98
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,166
So I just need to recommend
these amazing products

99
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,041
and get people to buy them?

100
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,083
I dunno, it seems practically
criminal for me to keep

101
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:17,458
a life-altering secret
like this to myself!

102
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,333
Lieutenant Leroy!

103
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,708
Whoa, you look rough.

104
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,583
[SUBARU] Listen, Lieutenant!
These pills are amazing!

105
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,250
They promote health and beauty--

106
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,166
I'm not interested.

107
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,916
No, wait, come back!

108
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,750
[SUBARU]
Vulgar. Hey, Vulgar! Vulgar!

109
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,083
What the heck's
gotten into Subaru?

110
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,458
Oh hey, Romeo! Perfect timing!

111
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,041
See this?

112
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,541
It's an organic pilot suit made
entirely of natural materials!

113
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,416
There's capsaicin infused
in the fabric,

114
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,208
which helps to
induce perspiration!

115
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,875
It'll make your skin as
soft as a baby's...

116
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:51,333
[ROMEO]
Something's very wrong here.

117
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,708
Wait. Is this one of those scams

118
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,750
they've been warning
people about?

119
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,083
You should come to
our next orientation!

120
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:58,500
[ROMEO]
Lieutenant!

121
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,041
[SUBARU]
Are you in?

122
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,458
If you bring a friend along with
you, the prices go way down.

123
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,291
Please, just listen to me.

124
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:07,291
I am honored to work with
you as your subordinate,

125
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,125
but I am not your friend, sir!

126
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,333
Uh?

127
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,458
[ROMEO]
It would be presumptuous

128
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,583
to consider myself
Subaru's friend.

129
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,833
But I'm sure that there are
people who can help you.

130
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:20,208
Who can steer you from this
dark path. Your real friends.

131
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:25,375
Uh. My... real... friends...?

132
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,666
[SUBARU] There's no one.
I don't have any friends!

133
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,708
[KOENIG] Come to think of it,
he's always alone.

134
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,291
[SUBARU gasping]

135
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,750
[KOENIG] It was cruel of me to
do this to you. You're free now.

136
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:48,041
[SUBARU cries]

137
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,458
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,083
[NARRATOR]
After coming to his senses,

139
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,416
Subaru decided to avoid
all human contact.

140
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,458
Friendless and alone,
he withdrew

141
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,208
even more deeply into the
sanctuary of his cockpit.
