00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:51,041
[NARRATOR] After a hard-fought
battle on Europa,


2
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:52,958
Vulgar was promoted
to Lieutenant,


3
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,166
and Subaru was promoted
from Ensign to LTJG.


4
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,333
[PAC2-AR] Congratulations!
This is a huge deal!

5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,958
[SUBARU]
Meh, ranks don't mean that much.

6
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,708
Besides... I suck.

7
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,666
I didn't do anything.

8
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,750
Not even tell him what
a whack job he was.

9
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,416
[SUBARU grunts] I shouldn't
even be a pilot--

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,000
much less a Lieutenant.

11
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:18,250
[PAC2-AR] Well, you're a Junior
Lieutenant, but you earned it!

12
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,833
Oh, that reminds me.

13
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:23,208
The first mission given to the
LTJG is the ship newsletter page

14
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,708
and I'm pretty sure
it's due today.

15
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,458
[SUBARU]
Yeah, yeah. I know.

16
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,250
[PAC2-AR] I'm so excited to see
what topic you cho-- Uh!

17
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,333
[NARRATOR] Subaru had begun
to doubt himself as a pilot.

18
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,333
He felt a comic
with no real point

19
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,166
would be appropriate
and symbolic.

20
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,208
Kinda like this show...

21
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,000
Reading it was so torturous
that even PAC2-AR,

22
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,500
Subaru's loyal supporter,

23
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,333
couldn't read it
without shuddering.

24
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:45,666
Done-zo.

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,000
Could you scan that and
send it off for me please?

26
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:49,000
[PAC2-AR]
Okay.

27
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:50,166
[NARRATOR]
However,

28
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,250
Subaru's "Floating Boy
Zero George" comic

29
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,083
was a hit with the crew.

30
00:01:55,166 --> 00:02:00,083
Turns out the stress of war
slows the mind down just enough.

31
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,291
[CREWMEMBER 8A]
Hey, there's Mr. Funny Britches.

32
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,416
--[SUBARU] Huh?
--Love your comic!

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,375
I'm obsessed!
You're so talented!

34
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,041
You better not die before
you finish the series, man!

35
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,416
[SUBARU gasps]

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,750
[SUBARU]
No way. Do I have talent?

37
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:17,958
[NARRATOR]
Thought Subaru.

38
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:21,041
And so he drew and drew
and drew some more!

39
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,500
He even started writing real
storylines--with plots.

40
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,750
Before he knew it, his cockpit
had become his studio.

41
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:33,041
Look who's here.

42
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,708
You takin' a day off
from sorties?

43
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,083
Where the hell have you been?

44
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,916
Uh, no. At the supply vessel.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,208
Are you kidding?!

46
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,333
This is all because princess
needs his snacks?

47
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,458
Look, no one likes that
mecha on steroids, all right?

48
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,041
But a battleship isn't
the place to have

49
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,416
your little slumber parties!

50
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,458
I'm not gonna do
your job for you!

51
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,666
And neither is anyone
else on this ship!

52
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,583
Got that... Junior Lieutenant?

53
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,000
[SUBARU]
Uh...

54
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,750
Oh, you think I can't do more
than one job at a time?!

55
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:02,416
Whatever, just leave me alone!

56
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,291
Run to mommy!

57
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,541
[SUBARU] He may have a
higher rank than I do,

58
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,250
but that doesn't
give him any right

59
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,458
to take away a man's dreams!

60
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,125
[NARRATOR] Subaru headed
straight to a manga publisher

61
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,291
on a nearby planet

62
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,625
to submit his manuscript...
unsolicited.

63
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,250
[EDITOR 8A]
There he is!

64
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,500
Your manuscript was a trip.

65
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,083
I thought it was
another space fantasy,

66
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,875
but then I was like, "oh,
this is some serious drama."

67
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,708
That's why I'm writing as
Hoshigahara, it's serious.

68
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,083
[EDITOR 8A]
And that spazzy one!

69
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,333
He cracks me up!

70
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,875
Every time he says this,
I die. I absolutely die!

71
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,250
Thank you so much, sir.

72
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,958
[EDITOR 8A]
But it's not enough.

73
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,250
I need more than a catchphrase

74
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,875
with some "feeling"
moments, ya know?

75
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,291
Your world design isn't
fully flushed out.

76
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,041
And where are
the hot chicks? Seriously.

77
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,750
I need a clear target audience,
and you're not givin' it to me.

78
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,083
[gasps]

79
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,708
Mr. Hoshino, your resume
says you're a pilot, so--

80
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,833
Hoshigahara.

81
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,875
[EDITOR 8A]
Tomato, tomata.

82
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,833
Point is, isn't being a pilot
a "cool" job? You know...

83
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,500
[NARRATOR]
After his dreams were crushed,

84
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,333
and his eyes became those
of a dried-out fish,

85
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,791
Subaru found release by
destroying 20 enemy craft

86
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,666
on his way back to base.

87
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,458
It's close-quarters combat now.

88
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,416
Big girl time.

89
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,708
That's probably the only way

90
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,125
to subdue them
without casualties.

91
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,125
[VULGAR]
Yeah, so don't mess yourself.

92
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,000
[SUBARU] No matter how
much experience I have

93
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,291
with close quarters,

94
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,916
I'd still rather not fight
outside my cockpit.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,208
[gasps]

96
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,250
[SUBARU grunts]

97
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,708
I swear, if you got hit--

98
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,375
[SUBARU]
I didn't! Shut up!

99
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,625
[VULGAR]
We're goin' on my signal!

100
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,166
Roger that!

101
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,000
[SUBARU]
Mother of pearl!

102
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,541
Those jerks ripped my suit!

103
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,625
Great, the needle's missing.

104
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,375
Ready, Powder Puff?

105
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,708
[SUBARU]
No! How am I gonna do this?

106
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,291
[VULGAR]
Three! Two!

107
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,208
[SUBARU]
Just hold on! BRB!

108
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,291
[VULGAR]
Are you kidding?!

109
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,416
You can't leave!
I didn't give the order!

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,583
I'm coming back, just chill!

111
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,416
[SUBARU]
All right, Subaru.

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,791
Make it quick!

113
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,000
[NARRATOR] He put the battle
on pause while he fled

114
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,666
to a pilot suit store
on the nearest planet.

115
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,041
[SUBARU] Literally anything
in my size will work.

116
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,083
Please say they have my size!

117
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,750
[SUBARU]
Uh?

118
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,166
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE]
Welcome, sir.

119
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,250
If you tell me what you need,
I can help you find it.

120
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,666
I just need a new top.

121
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,791
But I need it right away.
Think you can you help me?

122
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,583
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE] Absolutely.
We got this one in yesterday.

123
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,458
Its blend of fabrics that
gives a lot of movement...

124
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,375
I don't need it to move,
I just need it to fit!

125
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,625
Hurry, throw it on!

126
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,625
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE]
You got it!

127
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,500
[SUBARU gasps]
For real?

128
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,125
I didn't mean literally.

129
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,333
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE] Looser tops
are so hot this season.

130
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:44,375
Everyone who's anyone is
wearing it loose, amiright?

131
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,458
[SUBARU]
That slimy sack of tin.

132
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,208
He's just saying
that so I'll buy it!

133
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,333
It doesn't even match my pants!

134
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,666
[SUBARU]
Be honest!

135
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,958
Which one of these
would best match my top?

136
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,500
Crap! It has to match
or I'll look like a tool,

137
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,375
but thinking of Vulgar
snarling while waiting

138
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,625
gives me tummy knots.

139
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,500
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE]
Ohh, excellent choice!

140
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,000
I have both pairs at home
and I love them!

141
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,416
[SUBARU gasps]

142
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,333
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE] We call
those a "closet convenience,"

143
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:09,500
because they're so convenient
to have in your closet--

144
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,083
they go with everything!

145
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,958
[SUBARU] You don't wear pants,
you're not even a real boy!

146
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,375
Look, I need a suit! Now!

147
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,208
My comrade's waiting for me!

148
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,416
[NARRATOR] Hold on a second,
did he say "comrade"?

149
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,083
Was that a mistake...?
I-I'm staying out of it.

150
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,833
[SUBARU] Nah, I'm using
this dressing room!

151
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,750
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE]
Ooh...

152
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,375
--So, what do you think?
--[SUBARU] What the...?!

153
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,083
Go away! I didn't say
you could come in!

154
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,833
What are you staring at?!

155
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,750
[NARRATOR] The machine
at the store couldn't read

156
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,958
Subaru's membership QR code.

157
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,291
His items were packed
with excessive care,

158
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,500
and time continued
to waste away.

159
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,458
[SUBARU] You're like a
mechanical slug, I swear.

160
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
Here, it's fine. I'll carry
it myself, thank you!

161
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,000
[SUBARU grunting]

162
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,541
[SUBARU]
Great, what now?

163
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,291
[ROBOT EMPLOYEE] Allow me to
carry this to the exit for you.

164
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,875
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Vulgar
gave up on waiting for Subaru.

165
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,291
And managed things on his own.

166
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,916
[VULGAR] All right, Pee Pants,
I've got a new nickname for ya.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,166
[SUBARU]
Good. Just remember,

168
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,333
it needs to be cool and
have a space-like vibe.

169
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,500
[VULGAR]
You got it, Princess.

170
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,000
How about "Our Little
Space Slugger"?

171
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,375
[SUBARU]
What? I'm not freakin' nine!
