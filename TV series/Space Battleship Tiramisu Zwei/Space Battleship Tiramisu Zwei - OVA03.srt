1
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,583
The buildings around
here look so similar,

2
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,750
it's starting to bum me out.

3
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,375
Shall I tear them to the ground

4
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,250
and rebuild this city
to more my liking?

5
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,291
Huh?

6
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,250
[BEYOND]
Hold on. Wasn't I just here?

7
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,541
[NARRATOR] On his first
authorized excursion outside

8
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,000
the safety of the lab, Beyond
visited a convenience store,

9
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,583
and got lost on the way home in
the maze of identical buildings.

10
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,166
[BEYOND laughs]
How fascinating.

11
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,750
So this is what it
means to be "lost."

12
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:31,875
They must've given me
such a haphazard map

13
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,625
so I could have
this novel experience.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,333
[BEYOND]
Hm? What's this line for?

15
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,916
Ah, this must be the
infamous Ramen Saburo.

16
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,041
[BEYOND]
Oh, goodie!

17
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:48,166
I've been simply
dying to try it.

18
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,375
[NARRATOR] Beyond spent
a disproportionate amount

19
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,416
of his time reading
local restaurant reviews

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,000
on obnoxious foodie websites.

21
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,416
We'll see if this plebian
fare is suitable

22
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,250
for the palate of a god.

23
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,291
Hm?

24
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,666
[BEYOND] "Black oolong tea."
Heh, heh. Excellent.

25
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,041
[laughing] Perfect
beverage for a being

26
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,833
who drowns all around
him in blackest darkness.

27
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,041
[thud]

28
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,125
[EMPLOYEE A]
Welcome!

29
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,416
[BEYOND]
Another line? Ugh. Lame.

30
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
[EMPLOYEE A] Please buy a ticket
before you get back in line.

31
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,166
[BEYOND]
Ah, yes, I did read that Saburo

32
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,916
uses the ticket system.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,125
[laughs] As if such
a feeble little trap

34
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,000
could trip up someone
with my divine abilities.

35
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,250
[BEYOND]
"Small"? I think not.

36
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:40,208
There's nothing
"small" about me.

37
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,083
For real?

38
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,333
Obviously a newbie.

39
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,666
Maybe he can't read?

40
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,083
[NARRATOR] Maybach was out
for a nice solo lunch,

41
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,791
so when he saw an acquaintance,

42
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,500
he scrupulously avoided
making eye contact.

43
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,666
[MAYBACH]
This is no place for a novice.

44
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,208
And he's making the same
mistake as Captain Suzie!

45
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:02,291
[BEYOND] Seems like a
typical ramen shop to me.

46
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,166
I see the water is self-service.

47
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,375
[BEYOND] They even make
their customers clean up?

48
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,250
Such arrogance!

49
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,375
And yet, he did it
without complaint.

50
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,500
Is that an indicator of
just how good this ramen is?

51
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,458
Here's my ticket.

52
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,875
[BEYOND laughing]

53
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:26,250
[BEYOND] Well, balls! I totally
forgot to present mine.

54
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,625
And now,

55
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,583
time to chant the
sacred incantation.

56
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,458
Bestow upon me a Large Veggie
Spicy Garlic Fat Mashi Mashi!

57
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,041
[MAYBACH grunts]

58
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,208
[NARRATOR] Maybach felt
every bit of embarrassment

59
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,541
that Beyond was too
oblivious to feel.

60
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,708
[MAYBACH]
Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

61
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,791
The dude is a clone of
Captain Suzie's little bro.

62
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,041
I'll take a Large Veggie
Spicy Garlic Fat Mashi Mashi.

63
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,208
[MAYBACH] They're screwin'
up in all the same ways!

64
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,541
Say how many noodles
and how al dente.

65
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,666
[BEYOND]
Huh?

66
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,041
Say how many
noodles and how al dente.

67
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,708
[BEYOND]
Uh, um... Uh, regular?

68
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,375
Okay, but... You sure
you want a large?

69
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,750
That's a lot. Can you finish it?

70
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,125
Uh. Heh, heh!

71
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,458
Do they not teach you
simpletons a god's stomach

72
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,625
is a black hole made
to devour anything?

73
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,583
Fine, don't say I
didn't warn you.

74
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,625
[BEYOND]
Hm?

75
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,583
Spicy!

76
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,708
Ugh. Yuck!

77
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,125
[EMPLOYEE A]
Sir?

78
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,458
Your order?

79
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,166
[BEYOND]
Uh... I...

80
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,875
[BEYOND] Do I do the toppings
incantation now?

81
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,125
Well, I'll, um, have...

82
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,791
[BEYOND] Bad time for
performance anxiety!

83
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,208
--[EMPLOYEE A] Sir.
--[BEYOND] Uh?

84
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,250
Were you still wanting to
order the large veggie

85
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,083
spicy garlic fat mashi mashi
like you said before?

86
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,625
Um, actually,
I'll just take a...

87
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,958
...regular.

88
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,708
[EMPLOYEE A grunts]

89
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,916
Uh?

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,416
[BEYOND] Huh? What the hell
is "regular" about this?

91
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,166
There are so many veggies
I can't see the noodles.

92
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,041
And what is that supposed to be?

93
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,750
Chashu? It's more than half fat!

94
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,625
[MAYBACH] Can't blame him
for gettin' the yips.

95
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,333
It's pretty daunting
for a Saburo virgin.

96
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:17,291
Even I worry about whether I can
finish, and I order the small!

97
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,458
Light on the noodles. Al dente.

98
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,833
[BEYOND] Maybe it's easier
to eat than it looks.

99
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:24,041
There was a woman
here, after all.

100
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:27,458
[MAYBACH] Oh, no!
He's making a rookie mistake!

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,333
Universe... Sense!

102
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,708
[BEYOND gasps]

103
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,166
[MAYBACH]
Listen to me, Beyond,

104
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,666
because I'm only
gonna say this once.

105
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,833
[BEYOND]
You!

106
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,375
[MAYBACH]
Don't start with the veggies.

107
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,416
Start with the noodles that
are absorbing the soup.

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,291
[BEYOND]
What? The noodles?

109
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,333
[gasps]

110
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,541
[EMPLOYEE A]
Here you go. One small ramen.

111
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,625
[BEYOND]
Uh.

112
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,291
Very interesting.
I believe I understand now.

113
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,666
Thank you for your assistance,
bulbus, hairy man.

114
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,375
[BEYOND]
This is good!

115
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,916
[MAYBACH] That's right.
Don't stop or your done for!

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,750
You just gotta keep eating!

117
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,291
[EMPLOYEE A]
Thank you, sir.

118
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,625
[BEYOND]
I've barely even made a dent.

119
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,708
You don't have to finish
all of it, you know.

120
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,541
No. I can finish a
single bowl of ramen.

121
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:29,750
I'm a damn god!

122
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,625
You really don't have
to prove anything.

123
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,666
[BEYOND gasping]

124
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,375
That's right, get outta
here, ya damn newbie.

125
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,041
[BEYOND cries]

126
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,666
[NARRATOR] At the first ramen
shop he had ever visited,

127
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,500
Beyond learned just how
harsh our society can be.

128
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:49,041
[BEYOND]
They don't know. I'm a god!

129
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,541
[ISUZU humming]
My god!

130
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:54,666
Who made messy? Seriously! Gah!

131
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,958
[NARRATOR]
And was forced to suffer alone,

132
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,833
haunted by a garlic stench that
lingered well into the next day.

133
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,583
[ISUZU]
That smell! Bleh!
