[VULGAR]
Move your ass, Princess.

00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,291
We're goin' to the Ashigara!

4
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,958
[LIGIER] Yeah, we can
head there together.

5
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,250
I can't just leave in the middle

6
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,708
of Durandal's
maintenance routine.

7
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,541
I'll meet you there later.

But you don't want to
miss out on all the fun!

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,833
Yeah, jeez. Is it hard to hear
with your head up your ass?

10
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:14,666
[SUBARU sighs]

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,833
Uh.

12
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,458
Hold on. What's this?

13
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,041
[SUBARU gasps]

14
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,791
[SUBARU]
It's looks like... a bouquet?

15
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,791
[NARRATOR] That's right.
Today, September 2nd,

16
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:30,000
was ace pilot Subaru
Ichinose's 20th birthday.

17
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,166
[SUBARU]
Those sneaky sneak-faces!

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,833
That's why they wanted me to
come with them to the Ashigara.

19
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,291
They usually know
to give me my space,

20
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,750
so obviously this is
for a special occasion.

21
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:46,208
[NARRATOR] The Ashigara was a
supply vessel-slash-party barge

22
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,666
equipped with restaurants
and event spaces.

23
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,541
[SUBARU] And... done. I've
finished my maintenance,

24
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:56,083
so I guess I'll just be heading
over to the Ashigara now.

25
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,041
[SUBARU] They've clearly
calculated the perfect degree

26
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,875
of surprise-i-tude.
This way, it's still exciting,

27
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,583
but I won't get all freaked out
when they spring the trap.

28
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,333
Those guys are the best!

00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,500
[bell chimes]

[CLERK 14A]
Be right with you!

31
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,291
[SUBARU]
This is the perfect spot.

32
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,583
I'll just stand here,
casually reading a comic,

33
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,458
and wait for them to see me.

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,208
[SUBARU]
No one's come to get me.

35
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,458
It's mean to keep me
in suspense for so long.

36
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,375
I wonder what's wrong.

37
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,750
Maybe they set aside a special
first legal drink and Vulgar

38
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,041
chugged it himself then started
hitting on women and got

39
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,291
punched in the face then
passed out in his own sick.

40
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,208
That's it. I'm going
to go check on them.

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,000
[SUBARU]
I didn't see them anywhere.

42
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,875
What's going on?

43
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,708
Was I totally off-base?

One of those flash-mob things!

a dance number just for me!

If this is my birthday surprise

looking at me?!
