He's what?

His Universe values

And now is on his way to Europa.

00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,000
[SUBARU]
Aw, crap!

158
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,375
I forgot my thoughts
are audible now!

159
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,625
I'm so sorry!

160
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,916
[MAYBACH] And yesterday
you thought they looked

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,541
like bird beaks. Rude.

162
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,708
[SUBARU] That wasn't me!
I thought acorns!
