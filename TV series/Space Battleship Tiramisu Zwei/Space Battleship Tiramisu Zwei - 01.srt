many battles during
his time assigned

to the space battleship,

He had been reunited with
his long-lost brother,

but they became adversaries

faster than you could say,
"space place saves space."

Then destiny-slash-gravity led
these two bickering brothers

[ISUZU]
So Li'l Soob made it out.

It's too bad about
your Durandal.

Good scrap metal, though.

He's got a cockpit addiction.

You really do hate the Union.
How enlightening.

160
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,791
[SOICHIRO] My, how the two of
you have grown over the years.

161
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,333
You look well.

162
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,125
[ISUZU, SUBARU]
Papa?!

163
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,041
[SUBARU]
What's happening?

164
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,791
[ISUZU]
I'm ego-surfing, little bro.

165
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,208
[SUBARU]
Gross. Stop that.

166
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,583
[ISUZU] You've got some
fans out there, too.

167
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:12,958
[SUBARU]
Wow! People are really

168
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,458
into this adaptation,
aren't they?

169
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,125
[ISUZU] As they should be,
Soob. As they should be.
