00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,000

[NARRATOR] In the beginning,
Subaru only played at night

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,791
to avoid being seen and judged.

42
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,375
Then realized he had
no time for secrecy

43
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,458
and started skipping meals
and sleeping in the simulator.

44
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,833
As one does.

45
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,083
And eventually,

46
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:34,208
Subaru earned the title
of "Simulator Spook."

Excuse me, Lieutenant?

Where am I?

This isn't my cockpit.

[NARRATOR] It is said that
space-time distortions

cause those with

a few days later, Subaru had
absolutely no memory of them.

This worked out well
for Petty Officer Alfa

who found the Great
Sim carving creepy,

91
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,125
and tossed it out into space.

92

[ROMEO]
This is so not a video game.

93
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,791
It's a real war zone,
not a simulator.

This is what it feels
like to be scared.

would be so terrifying.

I don't see him anymore.

So it's possible
that I imagined it.

meaning to talk to you

on the ceiling a while ago,

what it could be.

I think about it...

Lieutenant? Please don't cry!

160
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,041
[NARRATOR] Mechanics repaired
the Neo Durandal as soon

161
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,541
as it was received, and returned
it with a vibrant new look.

162
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,333
It was purified
with sage and salt.

163
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:01,458
And adorned with an odd amount
of charms and "good luck" things

164
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,625
at Subaru's insistence.

165
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,500
[SUBARU]
Romeo! Hit it! Now!

166
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:06,833
[ROMEO]
I can't do it, Lieutenant!

167
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,166
I just... I can't!

168
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,166
[SUBARU]
Don't be a powder puff!

169
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,083
It's comin' right at you!

170
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,083
[ROMEO]
No, I'm not good enough!

171
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,833
[UMPIRE 9A]
Strike! Batter out!

172
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,250
[SUBARU]
What is wrong with you?
