Just that he's adapted

It probably won't

Why didn't I take them out
<i>before</i> I added the water?

162
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,083
What on Earth is wrong with me?

163
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,791
Well, for one, I'm seeing
everything in slow motion,

164
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,166
and I can't figure out
how to turn around.

165
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,916
For 'B,' what am I gonna
have for Cockpit Lunch?

The eyes of a hero, huh?

[NARRATOR] As the heroic eyes
of Subaru Ichinose

170
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,583
gazed upon a rainfall
of yakisoba,

171
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,250
they wondered at its beauty
and flavors untasted.

172
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,625
[SUBARU] Hey Maybach,
how long have you been

173
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:06,791
working for my brother?

174
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,500
[MAYBACH]
Whoa. Subaru, right?

175
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,666
[SUBARU]
Oh. Yes.

176
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,125
[MAYBACH]
Hey. My eyes are up here, Bro.

177
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,291
Up here.

178
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,833
Quit checkin' out my
pencil eraser nips.

179
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,791
[SUBARU] I'm not!
They're just in the way!
