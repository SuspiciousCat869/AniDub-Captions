00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,275
[SUBARU]
Dad?

3
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:13,275
That isn't like him.

4
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:17,483
[yawns]

5
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:23,983
[ISUZU] The old man?
I'll just ignore it.

6
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:25,775
We're gonna get in there
and cut off their supplies

7
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:29,733
to the front lines. Things are
gonna go "boom," people.

8
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:33,233
Our missions are never easy,
and this one's no different.

9
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:35,608
So grab those nuts
and get ready to man up.

10
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,483
Ensign Aixam, you and I will
take a team and infiltrate

11
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:42,483
the Union base, then stand
by at these locations.

12
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,192
Captain Suzie,
you'll plant time bombs

13
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:45,775
on their underground
energy pipes.

14
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:49,067
That's the "boom" part
I was talkin' about.

15
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,650
The rest of us will
create a diversion

16
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,108
to buy time while you escape.

17
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,150
Get in. get out--
quick, like lightning.

18
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,858
Got it? Hello?

19
00:01:58,692 --> 00:02:01,358
Come on, We're in a freakin'
meeting here, Suzie.

20
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:02,567
If you're gonna dick
around on your phone,

21
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,108
at least have the
decency to hide it.

22
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,692
[MAYBACH] I've sent the field
data to each of your devices,

23
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:17,442
so take a sec to confirm
you received them.

24
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,025
[phone vibrating]

25
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,858
[MAYBACH] Check the video files
to make sure you can play them.

26
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,608
If you can't, then
obviously you're an idiot

27
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,858
who doesn't know how
to operate a smartphone.

28
00:02:24,942 --> 00:02:26,442
[ISUZU growls]

29
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,150
[STICKER VOICE]
Arf! Gotcha!

30
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,317
[gasps]

31
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,858
Now, moving on.

32
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:38,567
[ISUZU]
Damn you, you old bitch.

33
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,025
[STICKER VOICE]
Arf! Gotcha,

34
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:41,233
If you're gonna send a sticker,

35
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,858
pick one that's not some
freaky unicorn dog.

36
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,858
[ISUZU] Both of you, talk about
this stuff in a different chat!

37
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,900
The notifications
are driving me crazy,

38
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,817
and you're draining my battery.

39
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,650
Man, Isuzu types really fast.

40
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,442
Mad skills.

41
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,942
[STICKER VOICE]
Arf! Gotcha.

42
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,442
[sighs]

43
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,900
[ISUZU]
All right, it's time.

44
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:47,192
[ISUZU] Maybach, how will we be
communicating in the field?

45
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,483
We're just gonna use our phones.

46
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,067
Less chance of making mistakes

47
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,192
if we've got devices
we know well.

48
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,442
Understood. Let's get this
show on the road, then.

49
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:57,817
Yes sir.

50
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,317
[MAYBACH]
I'm in position. Standing by.

51
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,358
[ISUZU]
Done.

52
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:35,442
I've placed the bombs. All hands
begin diversionary tactics.

53
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:41,317
What now?

54
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:43,608
[SUBARU]
The hell?!

55
00:04:46,608 --> 00:04:48,775
What are you doing, Isuzu?
Bomb jokes aren't funny.

56
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,233
Totally not cool.

57
00:04:57,192 --> 00:05:00,817
[ISUZU] Balls! I accidentally
sent that to Subaru instead.

58
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,233
[STICKER VOICE]
Arf! Just kidding.

59
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,108
[ISUZU]
He fell for it!

60
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,900
[ISUZU] Damn it! I still
had the group chat open!

61
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,567
[ISUZU]
Not good!

62
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,025
[ISUZU]
I have to do something!

63
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:52,233
[STICKER VOICE]
Arf! Gotcha!

64
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:53,733
What the--?!

65
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,192
You traitor!

66
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,650
Ha, got it! How long's
that thing been up there?

67
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,150
I think somethin' went wrong.

68
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,900
Union troops are pouring
in all over the damn place.

69
00:06:12,983 --> 00:06:15,483
We gotta get out of here. Now!

70
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:20,692
[ISUZU]
Idiots! I want a new family!

71
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:23,275
The way they came out
of nowhere like that,

72
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:25,858
it was like they knew exactly
what we were up to.

73
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:29,733
I hate to say it, but I think we
may have a spy in our midst.

74
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:31,275
Captain Suzie?

75
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,483
[ISUZU] The op failed thanks
to your meddling, Dad.

76
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,275
You better make this up to me!

77
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:39,567
[SOICHIRO] A parent's gotta
stop his son from villainy!

78
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,692
[ISUZU]
Oh, now you're a parent?

79
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:44,567
[MAYBACH]
My superior officer is the leak?

80
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,442
[NARRATOR] Maybach decided to
pretend he'd never seen Isuzu's

81
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,692
messages and that the whole
thing had never happened.

82
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,483
[sighs] What ev's.

83
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,150
[STICKER VOICE]
Arf! Bye-bye!
