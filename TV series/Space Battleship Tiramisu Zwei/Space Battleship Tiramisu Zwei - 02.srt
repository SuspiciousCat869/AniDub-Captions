What are you doing here?

00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,541
[SOICHIRO] I heard you'd
descended nearby.

00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,708
I might've had something
to do with that.

00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,833
I also brought something
to show you.

Ignore him, Subaru!

Like he ignored us!

That's awkward.

What if I told you

I think you'll be pleased to see

with two fusion engines.

We trespassed into
forbidden territory,

but it was worth it
for an invention

162
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,000
Give it here. Lemme
show you how it's done!

163
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,208
Sometimes, you just
gotta open up the lid

164
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,708
and pull another one
through the hole.

165
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,750
Like life. See?

166
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,958
[gasps]

167
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,625
I need everyone out of
the Durandal, right now.

168
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,291
Isuzu...

169
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,458
What the hell?

170
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:58,125
[ISUZU] It appears that this
mobile suit has a new master.

171
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,458
Meaning the People of Metus.

172
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,333
[SOICHIRO]
Listen, Subaru.

173
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,083
[SUBARU]
Whoa, the Durandal can talk?

174
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,458
[SOICHIRO]
Before you sortie,

175
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,500
there's something important
you need to hear-andal.

176
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,916
[SUBARU] Hold on, do all your
sentences end that way?

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,416
[SOICHIRO]
Is that a prob-andal?

178
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,375
[SUBARU]
It's what makes you special.
