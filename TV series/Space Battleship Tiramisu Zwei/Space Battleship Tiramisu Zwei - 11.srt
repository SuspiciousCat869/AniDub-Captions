[NARRATOR] After Cadillac's
public address,

3
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,333
fighting between the Earth Union
and the People of Metus

4
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,333
grew fiercer each day.

5
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,333
What's happening?!

6
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,791
Your piloting sucks.
You're way too stiff.

7
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,666
[ROMEO]
Right! Okay!

8
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,833
[ROMEO] I messed up and
now Subaru's mad at me.

9
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,291
Balls.

10
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,666
Get it together.
It's my job to support him!

11
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,458
Their stronghold's over there.

12
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,958
We're gonna end this
with the Durandal Riser.

13
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,500
No time for a dry run.
Can you handle it?

14
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,833
Yes, sir. I can.

15
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,416
On it!

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,416
[NARRATOR] While battling the
new "People of Metus" weapons,

17
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,125
the Earth Union
had launched a plan

18
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,250
to strengthen the Neo Durandal.

19
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,083
Lieutenant!

20
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,458
Get ready!

21
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,958
[NARRATOR] With the D Riser
as its support mecha,

22
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,916
the Neo Durandal gained
new capabilities.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,666
[ROMEO] All right, time for
some "awesome sauce"!

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,125
I'll whip this D into
Subaru's wings!

25
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,750
[NARRATOR]
But his "D," as the kids say,

26
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,625
looked more like a
random protrusion

27
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,958
than a pair of wings.

28
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,333
I guess where I go when
we combine is already set.

29
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,375
That's good to know.

30
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,750
[ROMEO] Hey Lieutenant,
do you actually need me here

31
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,375
or are you good?

32
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,375
No one told me it would look
like this when we transform.

33
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:17,416
[SUBARU] Like what?
A huge space robo dong?

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,375
Listen, If you're wienering out,

35
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,083
can you transfer flight
control to me?

36
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,208
Um, well, I...

37
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,333
[ROMEO]
What do I do?

38
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,583
Leave? Or stay?

39
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,208
[ROMEO gasping]

40
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,750
[ROMEO]
What's wrong with me?!

41
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,708
I need to watch
and learn from him!

42
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,541
It's the only way I'll
become a first-rate pilot!

43
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,041
Screw that! I'm seein'
this through to the end!

44
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,250
[SUBARU]
Atta girl!

45
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,083
Preparing to fire
the Mega-Photon Canon.

46
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,625
I'll count down from three
and we'll pull our triggers

47
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,458
at the same time!

48
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,166
Roger that!

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,750
[SUBARU] The Durandal
will handle piloting

50
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,875
and attitude control.
You adjust the coordinates!

51
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:54,750
[ROMEO]
Yes, sir!

52
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,791
[SUBARU]
Here we go!

53
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:56,875
[ROMEO]
Please let me hit the mark.

54
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,833
Shut up. Mother says
to be confident!

55
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,916
And go!

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,958
[ROMEO]
Uh?

57
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,541
What? "Go"?

58
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,375
He never said there was a "go"!
I thought we pulled after "one"!

59
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,375
[NARRATOR] While they did
manage to fire the cannon.

60
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,125
The shot was completely
off due to bad timing

61
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,541
and some early triggering.

62
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,583
If I had a nickel...

63
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,916

00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,958
Why is my ass so damn hot?

This sucks!

While those two were pondering

72
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:39,208
the temperature of their asses,
Isuzu received a new model

73
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,458
of his personal mecha,
the Kerukeion Two.

74

I hope you're ready,
Captain Suzie!

75
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,333
It's finally done.

Very good work, Axium.

00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,083
Let's go check this beast out.

78
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,583
[ISUZU] I can do it by myself,
you know.

79
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,250
[MAYBACH]
And I believe in you,

I'll make you look

Hey, don't freak out. I was
just keepin' it warm for ya.

[ISUZU]
While plugged in?

85
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,250
Well, what do you think of it?

86
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,375
Aw man, if I called it awesome,
it wouldn't be enough.

87

One machine,

controlled by three minds,
plugged into headless devices.

Sounds like some kind of
mythical, three-headed dragon.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,166
This whole cockpit's
like one bad-A monster

with zero blind spots.

00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:24,500
I guess we are, too.

93

Now that we've got these
sweet, sweet implants.

That right there is
what's frickin up!

It like, takes all of your fear

97
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,583
and evaporates it right
before a battle.

98
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,291
You feel so invincible.

99
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,666

100
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,125

he's not even plugged in!

00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:50,708
Is he using his device to
hang his damn receipts?!

Please, no.

You didn't have
the implant surgery?!

109
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,416
I'm freakin' out!

110
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,916
Please don't.
I wasn't feeling it.

I'm sorry, okay?

115
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,708
Yeah. Sorry doesn't
really solve this.

Hey. What's goin' on, bros?

117
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,250
This nipple-baby got
scared of some pictures

and didn't get a plug-in.

Are you serious right now?!

Look. I didn't just
get scared, you guys.

121
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,250
I also find it extremely unfair

122
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,125
that our insurance
won't cover it.

123
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,125
Can you actually hear
yourself right now?

124
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,625
I think I might have to puke.

125
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,083
For real.

126
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,250
We all knew about the insurance
issue from the start.

127
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,625
Yeah, but you probably
didn't read that nightmare.

128
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,583
It didn't bother you you
can't roll on your back

129
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,958
for three days after?

130
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,833
Aixam and I both slept
on our stomachs

131

and lived to tell about it!

132
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,541
The only reason we synced
like this in the first place

133
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,500
is because you
aren't Universing!

Uh?

Fine! You're right,

Gimme it! You're right!

00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,625
The team motto has become,
"it's just the way he is."

161
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,458
All right. Let's go!

162
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,083
[AIXAM, MAYBACH]
Yes, sir!

163
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:06,000
[SUBARU]
Hurry Romeo, time's almost up!

164
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,500
[ROMEO]
I know! I just...

165
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,416
I can't do it!

166
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,416
[SUBARU]
Hey. I believe in you.

167
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
[ROMEO]
You do?

168
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,291
[SUBARU]
Sure. Say it, "I know I can."

169
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,000
[ROMEO]
Okay. I know I can.

170
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,208
I know I can...

171
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,083
[ROMEO, SUBARU]
...I can flip this pancake!
