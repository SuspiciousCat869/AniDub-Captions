straight toward Earth.

[BEYOND] Heh. You're all making
this such a pain in my ass.

All lower forms of life should
give it up and go take a nap.

Meanwhile...

00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:49,041
Subaru had found what appeared
to be a controller of sorts.

38
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,250
It even came with a manual.

[PAC2-AR] What is that thing?
It looks vintage.

It's a controller for
the enemy mech.

[PAC2-AR] Ooo, Scandalous!
Should we tell the others?

You think we're all trying
to die out here, Pee Pants?

We'll do whatever we can
to protect our planet.

44

I mean, we gotta
at least try, right?

[SUBARU]
Forget it! I can't tell them!

48
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,416
They've invested so much time
and anxiety in this battle.

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,791
I can't say, "hey guys, I think

I can move it a
little bit at a time.

That way no one will
get butt-hurt about it.

[LAMBDA] It looks like we're
veering off course.

Excuse you?

62
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,833
Attention, all units.
The enemy's course has begun

63
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,041
to shift slightly.
Keep fighting.

Everything from here
on out is in your hands.

Guess that means we can
hit the bars soon, right?

Uh, not yet. We're staying in
it until this job is complete!

That which was given
to the People of Metus!

70

Too bad no one ever asked me.

71
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,708
I'd never allow some
stupid plan to destroy Earth.

Uhm. I can't.
