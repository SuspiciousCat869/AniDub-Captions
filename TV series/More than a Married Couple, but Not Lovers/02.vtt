Um, Jiro? You awake?

[JIRO grunts]

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.358 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shiori? You're soaking wet,
what happened to you?

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:26.628 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Oh, Jiro!

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:29.062 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasping]

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:30.632 position:27% line:89% align:start
I feel so alone.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:34.669 position:33% line:83% align:start
Please, Jiro,
will you stay with me?

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:37.471 position:41% line:89% align:start
Always.

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:39.541 position:38% line:89% align:start
My hero.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:45.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Yakuin? Yo,
I'm talking to you! Yakuin!

00:00:45.847 --> 00:00:47.682 position:27% line:89% align:start

[grunts]

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.385 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Damn it.
Why is it always a dream?

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.621 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] It's not like
you need beauty sleep.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:55.757 position:21% line:89% align:start
Open the door, dork.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.459 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Don't you terrorize me
enough during the day?

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:03.565 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just for tonight,
stay with me, okay?

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.800 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:45.365 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Steve?
Where did you go? Come out.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:47.101 position:30% line:89% align:start
Steve, please.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.672 position:33% line:89% align:start
[STEVE moans]

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:56.144 position:27% line:83% align:start
Steve? Is that you
in there? You okay?

[AKARI screaming]

00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:04.451 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Why'd you decide to watch
this crap at the dead of night?

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.954 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's gonna help
boost us to A-rank.

00:03:07.088 --> 00:03:08.455 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.190 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Natsumi told me
if you snuggle up and

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:14.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
watch horror movies with your
partner, you get hella points.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.631 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh?! Why did you
turn it off, Buzzkill?

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:20.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Come on, there's
no way this is gonna work.

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:21.268 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Stop it!

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.402 position:30% line:89% align:start
What do I stop?

00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:23.905 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Being a weenie!

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.907 position:19% line:83% align:start
Let's conquer our fears
and score some points!

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.476 position:7% line:83% align:start
We've gotta work hard for this,
or we won't make A-rank!

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.379 position:19% line:83% align:start
You wanna get with Miss
Childhood Bestie, yeah?

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:34.515 position:30% line:83% align:start
I thought I had
made that obvious.

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.284 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Awesome, then let's
kick it up a notch, champ.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.620 position:33% line:89% align:start
Put this on!

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:43.490 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look, matching jammies!
I even got them on sale!

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:44.859 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Absolutely not!

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:46.160 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? What's your damage?

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:47.695 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're my damage!

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.764 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] They're like the
couple-iest thing ever!

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.833 position:10% line:83% align:start
Apparently, we'll get points
just by wearing them.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.802 position:13% line:83% align:start
And check it! Side by side,
they make a heart!

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I'm amazed you
found something this corny.

00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.840 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] If going overboard
is what it takes,

00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:00.440 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm on the Titanic.

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:01.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunts]

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:02.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hurry up and put it on.

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.113 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jeez...

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:09.183 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She spent her own
money on these? It's weird.

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:13.788 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's been all fired up since
she went to karaoke with Tenjin.

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:17.658 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I had to guess, something
happened between them.

00:04:17.792 --> 00:04:19.660 position:24% line:83% align:start
Not that it would
matter either way!

00:04:19.794 --> 00:04:23.064 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't give a crap
what she does.

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:25.867 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm? What? Need something?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.669 position:19% line:83% align:start
Turn around real quick.
I've gotta change also.

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:31.839 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?! In this room?

00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:33.273 position:19% line:89% align:start
Duh. Better look away.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:35.810 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasping]

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.912 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Well, damn,
that's a gyaru for you.

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:40.081 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess so many guys
have seen her bahoobies

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:41.448 position:19% line:89% align:start
she's not even phased.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.085 position:21% line:83% align:start
Whatever, I'll change
in here, too.

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:48.022 position:19% line:83% align:start
I doubt that she thinks
of me as a man, anyway.

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:49.690 position:33% line:89% align:start
[AKARI yelps]

00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:56.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
A blackout? Whoa,
I can't see anything.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:05:01.368 position:21% line:83% align:start
You there, Watanabe?
Are you o... kay?

00:05:02.402 --> 00:05:04.972 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?! Ahhh!

00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:06.373 position:10% line:89% align:start
Damage Report! Contact? Yes.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:07.275 position:30% line:89% align:start
Softness? Yes.

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:08.242 position:30% line:89% align:start
Firmness? Yes.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.644 position:21% line:89% align:start
Warmth? Immeasurable.

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.879 position:13% line:83% align:start
Calculating. System error.
Wait, is that...?

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:13.413 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, no, I'm a goner!

00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:16.784 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I don't get my hips out of
here, my little Jiro might...

00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:19.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't beep at me,
this is a crisis!

00:05:19.452 --> 00:05:22.990 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh? Watanabe?

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:26.727 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] The chick is scared,
you creep, do something.

00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:28.763 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Just a second. I'll turn
on my cell phone light.

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:30.832 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
No, wait! Don't look at me!

00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:31.833 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:35.770 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasping]

00:05:35.903 --> 00:05:38.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
You perv! Don't look
at me while I'm crying!

00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:41.843 position:10% line:83% align:start
Big whoop, the dark freaks me
out! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!

00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:43.978 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Give it I rest! I didn't see!

00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:47.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wasn't looking at
your face, trust me!

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.819 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO grunts]
It's not working.

00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:55.590 position:13% line:83% align:start
We can't get into our rooms
until the power comes back.

00:05:55.723 --> 00:05:57.892 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hurry. If you can't fix it,

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:00.661 position:19% line:83% align:start
then at the very least
come over here by me.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.930 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Fine, I'm coming.

00:06:03.865 --> 00:06:07.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Even when she's
terrified, she bosses me around.

00:06:07.168 --> 00:06:11.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
She uses me whenever
its convenient, huh?

00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:14.041 position:21% line:83% align:start
Still... It's rare to
see her so helpless,

00:06:14.175 --> 00:06:16.844 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I might as well
enjoy it. Also...

00:06:16.978 --> 00:06:18.713 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why is she so freakin' close?

00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:20.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
Like, tell me a funny
story or something.

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.951 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Women and their inane demands!

00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:25.620 position:21% line:89% align:start
C'mon dude, let's go.

00:06:25.753 --> 00:06:28.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
B-T-dubs, a bore-on
without any good stories

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.690 position:16% line:89% align:start
could never bag a hottie.

00:06:29.824 --> 00:06:31.926 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO growls]
What a jerk.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:35.129 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] What's wrong, virg-y?
Give it to me!

00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:37.965 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Once upon a time
in a land far, far, away...

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.601 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Are you for real? A fairy tale?

00:06:40.735 --> 00:06:42.837 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] An elderly couple
discovered an old well

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.640 position:27% line:83% align:start
on their property
and for some reason,

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:48.542 position:27% line:83% align:start
they didn't dare
get anywhere near it.

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:50.177 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh-- Hang on...

00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:53.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Good thing, because
soon they heard the legend--

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:55.349 position:21% line:83% align:start
that on stormy nights
when thunder rolls

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:57.118 position:19% line:89% align:start
and lighting crashes...

00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.987 position:19% line:83% align:start
There, beside the well,
where no one should be,

00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:03.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
stands the ghost of
a terrifying woman--

00:07:03.324 --> 00:07:06.227 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey. Are you listening?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.662 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on.

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:09.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've never seen you
be this quiet before.

00:07:09.697 --> 00:07:11.098 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lemme guess,

00:07:11.232 --> 00:07:12.867 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're gonna suddenly scream
and try to freak me out.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.003 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't tell me that lame story
actually scared you!

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.606 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Virgin! Listen!
When death knocks, let him in!

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:21.709 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
The gyaru's got bars!

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.144 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm sorry.

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:24.412 position:21% line:83% align:start
You were freaking out
and I couldn't help

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:26.981 position:5% line:89% align:start
but mess with you a bit. My bad.

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:29.016 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Minami never would've done that.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
He would've seen I was
upset and tried to help.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.821 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, I get it, I'm sorry.

00:07:33.955 --> 00:07:35.356 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Think about it.

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:38.326 position:5% line:83% align:start
The only person that can be here
for me right now is you.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.695 position:41% line:83% align:start

00:14:58.065 --> 00:14:59.701 position:27% line:89% align:start
Cool. Thank you.

00:14:59.834 --> 00:15:03.738 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Anytime. I'm just glad
to see you're getting better.

00:15:03.872 --> 00:15:05.774 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, can I use your kitchen?

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.408 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.654 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] If she keeps being
this nice to me,

00:15:19.788 --> 00:15:25.660 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna get the wrong idea.
Just like I did back then.

00:15:25.794 --> 00:15:28.395 position:16% line:83% align:start
In middle school, Shiori
had to change schools

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.464 position:21% line:83% align:start
because her dad got
transferred at work.

00:15:30.598 --> 00:15:34.602 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wanted to confess my feelings
for her before she left.

00:15:34.736 --> 00:15:38.205 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] So, you're transferring
to a private school, huh?

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:40.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
--[SHIORI] Mm-hm.
--Shiori, there's--

00:15:40.441 --> 00:15:42.176 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Um, so Jiro?

00:15:42.309 --> 00:15:44.746 position:10% line:89% align:start
Even if we're farther apart,

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:48.415 position:19% line:83% align:start
do you think that we'll
be friends for always?

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:52.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah. Of course.

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:58.225 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Nothing is going to change.

00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:00.862 position:30% line:83% align:start
I chickened out
and didn't confess.

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:02.664 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was mad at myself
in the moment,

00:16:02.797 --> 00:16:05.867 position:30% line:83% align:start
but in the end,
maybe it was for the best.

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:09.403 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You all good?

00:16:09.537 --> 00:16:12.306 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry, must've zoned out.
Now what were you saying?

00:16:12.439 --> 00:16:15.008 position:16% line:83% align:start
That I made rice porridge
if you think you can eat.

00:16:15.142 --> 00:16:16.376 position:38% line:83% align:start
--For me?
--Yeah!

00:16:16.511 --> 00:16:19.980 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, I can eat!
And I'll savor each bite!

00:16:20.113 --> 00:16:22.082 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Ah, Shiori's cooking!

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:24.919 position:24% line:83% align:start
The best thing I've
tasted in my entire life!

00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:28.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look at you! I thought you
might need help to eat it.

00:16:28.222 --> 00:16:30.491 position:35% line:89% align:start
Huh?! Uh--

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.459 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ahhhh!

00:16:32.894 --> 00:16:34.228 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Curse you stomach!

00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:35.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I hadn't pigged out
like a menace,

00:16:35.996 --> 00:16:37.799 position:10% line:89% align:start
she so would've fed it to me.

00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:39.266 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Are you okay?

00:16:39.399 --> 00:16:43.805 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, great. Just overwhelmed
by deliciousness.

00:16:43.938 --> 00:16:46.373 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI gasps]
Yay, I'm glad!

00:16:46.508 --> 00:16:48.308 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO sighs]
Thank you for the porridge.

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:51.011 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Thank you for liking it so much.

00:16:51.144 --> 00:16:52.881 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Tenjin's a lucky man.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.717 position:21% line:83% align:start
He gets to enjoy your
cooking all the time, huh?

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.218 position:21% line:83% align:start
Actually, we've been
rotating who cooks.

00:16:58.352 --> 00:16:59.754 position:13% line:89% align:start
We switch it up every day.

00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:03.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wow. So, Tenjin is some
incredible chef, too?

00:17:03.725 --> 00:17:06.561 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's no wonder Watanabe
likes him so much.

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:09.162 position:24% line:83% align:start
My cooking is what
you'd call an abomination.

00:17:09.296 --> 00:17:11.566 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's best I leave
that stuff to her.

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:14.067 position:21% line:83% align:start
She doesn't look it,
but she's a good cook.

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:15.369 position:33% line:89% align:start
Weird, right?

00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.005 position:16% line:83% align:start
I do other chores around
the house though,

00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:19.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
so I'm not completely worthless.

00:17:19.172 --> 00:17:20.875 position:16% line:89% align:start
Ha, that's pretty cool...

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:24.244 position:13% line:83% align:start
Things are going super well
between you guys, aren't they?

00:17:24.378 --> 00:17:27.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh! So, um, I don't
mean to be nosy,

00:17:27.782 --> 00:17:30.250 position:19% line:83% align:start
but I saw your ranking
the other day.

00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:32.954 position:10% line:83% align:start
If there's anything I can do
to help just let me know

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.356 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I'll do it, promise.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.859 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm the worst.

00:17:37.992 --> 00:17:40.762 position:13% line:83% align:start
This "help"-- This kindness
I'm showing her

00:17:40.895 --> 00:17:43.163 position:21% line:89% align:start
is entirely selfish.

00:17:43.297 --> 00:17:46.066 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's all because I want
to be with her.

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:47.802 position:19% line:89% align:start
That means a lot, Jiro.

00:17:47.936 --> 00:17:51.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's just that I don't feel
comfortable around boys.

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:53.641 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm trying, but he
makes me anxious.

00:17:53.775 --> 00:17:56.978 position:10% line:83% align:start
I guess my defense mechanism
is to put distance between us,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.313 position:5% line:89% align:start
and that distance adds up quick.

00:17:59.446 --> 00:18:00.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I see.

00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.382 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's too bad.

00:18:02.517 --> 00:18:04.686 position:5% line:83% align:start
My life would be a billion times
better if you were my husband.

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:06.420 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:07.522 --> 00:18:08.957 position:19% line:89% align:start
Only kidding of course!

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:14.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
I should really clean up
before the old wife gets home!

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:15.362 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
You've got this!

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:17.665 position:5% line:89% align:start
You... you can be a great wife!

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:20.001 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shiori, I believe in you!

00:18:20.133 --> 00:18:21.401 position:19% line:89% align:start
I've known you forever!

00:18:21.536 --> 00:18:23.705 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've seen how amazing
you are firsthand.

00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:26.708 position:16% line:89% align:start
Have a little confidence!

00:18:26.841 --> 00:18:29.043 position:27% line:83% align:start
--Wow, thank y--
--[JIRO yelps] Sorry!

00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:31.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Crap! That totally
weirded her out!

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:33.881 position:10% line:83% align:start
She probably thinks I'm some
obsessive, fanboy creep!

00:18:34.015 --> 00:18:37.317 position:16% line:83% align:start
You can't just say stuff
like that! I suck with girls!

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:40.555 position:19% line:83% align:start
Guess I'll stay in bed
the rest of my life.

00:18:45.793 --> 00:18:48.563 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Who cares...
It's not like she likes me.

00:18:48.696 --> 00:18:51.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's here because
Watanabe asked her to be.

00:18:51.899 --> 00:18:53.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
Once she gets comfortable,

00:18:53.367 --> 00:18:55.302 position:21% line:83% align:start
things will work out
with Tenjin.

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:59.607 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she can move past her
anxiety, then I'm sure...

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:05.212 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hey, Jiro? You asleep?

00:19:05.345 --> 00:19:08.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
You called me by my
first name earlier.

00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:14.287 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was so happy,
I kinda froze. Um, so Jiro?

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.492 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's something...

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:24.899 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] Have you heard the
hot gos about Sakurazaka?

00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:27.969 position:24% line:83% align:start
Rumor has it she's
been avoiding Minami.

00:19:28.102 --> 00:19:30.872 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's got the whole adorable
and pure thing going on.

00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:33.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't guess she's uber
comfy talking to guys.

00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:36.744 position:10% line:83% align:start
Akari's hubby's no lady killer
and they get along pretty well.

00:19:36.878 --> 00:19:39.013 position:27% line:83% align:start
You know, prolly
because they bang.

00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:40.380 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
No way!

00:19:40.515 --> 00:19:42.583 position:27% line:83% align:start
Little virgin boy
doesn't have it in him!

00:19:42.717 --> 00:19:44.886 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm a teensy worried
about Minami.

00:19:45.019 --> 00:19:47.855 position:7% line:83% align:start
That cutie's gonna be dangerous
once she's used to him.

00:19:47.989 --> 00:19:49.891 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's like that
classy type of pretty.

00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:52.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
What dude wouldn't
fall for all of that?

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:53.027 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ooooh.

00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:54.461 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whatcha gonna do, homie?

00:19:54.595 --> 00:19:57.297 position:24% line:83% align:start
Prim and perfect is
about to steal your man.

00:19:57.431 --> 00:20:01.836 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yeah. Maybe she is.

00:20:06.741 --> 00:20:12.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't. I know.
He's not even my partner.

00:20:12.814 --> 00:20:17.151 position:19% line:83% align:start
Do you think that we'll
be friends for always?

00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:20.121 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah. Of course.

00:20:20.253 --> 00:20:22.824 position:13% line:89% align:start
Nothing is going to change.

00:20:22.957 --> 00:20:25.126 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ah! Good to hear!

00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:28.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
We aren't moving far,
so I should be able visit.

00:20:28.696 --> 00:20:31.532 position:24% line:83% align:start
Maybe you could even
come see me sometime.

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:34.001 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, uh, you know how they
put up all those pretty lights

00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:36.938 position:10% line:83% align:start
around the train station when
it gets close to Christmas?

00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:39.907 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was thinking how sad it would
make me if I didn't see them.

00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:43.978 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, this year, um,
if you wouldn't mind,

00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.513 position:24% line:89% align:start
maybe you could...

00:20:45.646 --> 00:20:47.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Sorry. I, uh,
remembered there's something

00:20:47.548 --> 00:20:50.051 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have to take care of.

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:53.688 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh. I'll see you!

00:20:53.821 --> 00:20:58.693 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Back then, I wasn't
so sure that I actually would.

00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:00.762 position:27% line:89% align:start
But here we are.

00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:03.765 position:16% line:83% align:start
If I try my very hardest,
do you think that you could

00:21:03.898 --> 00:21:06.834 position:30% line:83% align:start
hear me out to
the end this time?

00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:13.674 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I'm back.

to be sick or something?

00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:30.423 position:30% line:89% align:start
You scared me!

00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:33.761 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh, sorry. Real quick.
I wanted talk with you.

00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:35.428 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Well, aren't you chipper?

00:21:35.563 --> 00:21:36.964 position:7% line:89% align:start
I guess you're feeling better?

00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:43.204 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, I am. All thanks to you.
Shio-- Sakurazaka.

00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:45.305 position:30% line:83% align:start
You asked her to
come here, right?

00:21:45.438 --> 00:21:49.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Well, duh,
I figured a baby like you

00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.512 position:24% line:83% align:start
would need a mommy
to take care of him.

00:21:51.646 --> 00:21:55.716 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll, uh... I'll be the best
husband I can be.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.018 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:21:57.151 --> 00:21:58.418 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I'll do whatever it
takes to make things

00:21:58.553 --> 00:22:02.422 position:5% line:89% align:start
work out between you and Tenjin.

00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:03.791 position:5% line:89% align:start
Even though it was pretty brief,

00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:06.127 position:24% line:83% align:start
you helped me live
out a dream today.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.562 position:27% line:89% align:start
Thanks for that.

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:09.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
I feel good enough
to go to school,

00:22:09.362 --> 00:22:12.700 position:27% line:83% align:start
so I'm gonna get
to bed. Goodnight.

00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:22.043 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Well, that's
all good stuff, right?

00:22:22.176 --> 00:22:26.714 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then why the hell
am I feeling so angry?

00:23:58.139 --> 00:24:00.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Shiori is hard
to be around lately.

00:24:00.908 --> 00:24:03.443 position:30% line:83% align:start
All she does is
worry about Yakuin.

00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:06.547 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why does she tell me
about him? I don't care.

00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:07.915 position:16% line:89% align:start
When we finished talking,

00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:10.450 position:16% line:83% align:start
she had this reenergized
look about her.

00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:12.153 position:24% line:89% align:start
It was really cute.

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:14.288 position:5% line:89% align:start
Guess that made it all worth it.

00:24:14.422 --> 00:24:17.758 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Next time, "Broken Up,
and Not Rekindled."
