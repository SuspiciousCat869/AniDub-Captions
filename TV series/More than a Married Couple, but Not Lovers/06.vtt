[knocking]

00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:11.345 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
You're good!

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:12.112 position:44% line:89% align:start
Heyo.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.147 position:21% line:89% align:start
Good morning, Yakuin.

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.885 position:19% line:83% align:start
The curling iron's hot,
so don't cook yourself.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.151 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Got it.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.053 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Did she use my last name?

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.489 position:24% line:83% align:start
Been a while since
she's done that.

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:24.258 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Bad news, Yakuin.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.729 position:10% line:83% align:start
We ran out of coffee, so it's
hot milk or zilch, 'kay?

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:30.030 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.933 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Last name basis confirmed.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:36.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
She doesn't seem angry,
but it's definitely intentional.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.606 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Hold up, today's the day.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.742 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're gonna post
midterm updates, yeah?

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.511 position:16% line:83% align:start
Think so. I heard they're
coming through the app.

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:45.813 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] We studied our
butts off for those tests.

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:48.550 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm not too worried this time.

00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:49.416 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:51.953 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Uh, yikes, dude.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:55.088 position:19% line:83% align:start
Gnarly case of bedhead.
Poor boy.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.357 position:13% line:89% align:start
Lemme fix it for you later.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.927 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, okay.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.762 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Oh! Almost forgot!

00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:03.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Besides the whole
name thing, she seems fine.

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.768 position:5% line:89% align:start
She actually seems really happy.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
Look! My girl Sachi gave
me chocolates yesterday.

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.272 position:21% line:83% align:start
Supposedly, they're,
like for rich people.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.976 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's crack 'em open tonight!

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.376 position:44% line:89% align:start
Cool.

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:17.779 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI laughs]
Choco heaven here we come!

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:21.381 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] What's she doing?
Why's she being so nice?

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:57.779 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Huh? Are you hiding something?

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.180 position:30% line:83% align:start
Weird search for
a bro with no ho.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.249 position:30% line:83% align:start
You'd know if I
had a girlfriend.

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.052 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is about Watanabe.

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.854 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Huh. Mighty Jiro
turns to info sourced

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:08.623 position:5% line:89% align:start
 by us screen-dwelling lowlifes?

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:10.591 position:27% line:83% align:start
The class traitor
comes crawling back.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.695 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can never tell
whose side you're on.

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:16.698 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe you can help,
do you and your wife ever argue?

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:19.266 position:33% line:83% align:start
Course we do.
She got the ol' tatas

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.368 position:19% line:83% align:start
in one hell of a twist
not too long ago.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:23.303 position:19% line:83% align:start
When I lovingly patted
her tumtum and asked if

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.140 position:19% line:83% align:start
she was on her period,
she iced me out.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:29.177 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I can't think of a faster
way to make a woman hate you.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.211 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Send me to the Olympics, I say!

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:34.782 position:7% line:83% align:start
You know, it's also her fault
for never telling me anything.

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:37.618 position:10% line:83% align:start
If she said she wanted me to
leave her alone, I would've.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.287 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I wish girls would just
tell us how they felt.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.623 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Preach, brother.

00:03:42.757 --> 00:03:43.925 position:38% line:89% align:start
[exhales]

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:47.628 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MEI] I should've noticed.
I'm sorry I didn't.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
But still, I just don't
see you in that way.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.301 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MANAMI]
I'm not asking for anything!

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.537 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just know that I love you, Mei!

00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:59.239 position:24% line:83% align:start
Check it. Guess the
rumor's true, bro.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.808 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
What rumor?

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:03.111 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] That Mei Hamano
is a total heartthrob,

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.779 position:7% line:89% align:start
ultra-successful, lady killer.

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:07.347 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was the spiciest
gossip a while back.

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.717 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh... Hang on. We look like

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.621 position:10% line:83% align:start
the biggest degenerate creeps
in the world right now.

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:16.423 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Means a lot that a girl
like you loves me.

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:18.860 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thank you so much
for your honesty.

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:21.829 position:7% line:83% align:start
Hey, if you can just smile big
and be yourself, I'm sure

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:24.832 position:16% line:83% align:start
that you'll find someone
better than me in no time.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.702 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MANAMI]
Before I go, just this once,

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:29.837 position:10% line:89% align:start
will you call me by my name?

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:32.073 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Absolutely,
but once I let you go,

00:04:32.206 --> 00:04:35.143 position:13% line:83% align:start
you have to be okay for me.
All right, Manami?

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.678 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MANAMI]
All right.

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:39.981 position:33% line:83% align:start
Homie pulls.
Homie pulls in a way

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:41.883 position:5% line:89% align:start
that just murked my self-worth.

00:04:42.016 --> 00:04:43.618 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm with you.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:51.025 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] "I should've noticed,
I'm sorry I didn't?"

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:57.297 position:21% line:83% align:start
This sucks! I've been
replaying everything all day.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.968 position:10% line:83% align:start
What the heck is it that I'm
supposed to notice exactly?

00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:04.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
Is it the "Yakuin" thing?
What's with that?

00:05:04.404 --> 00:05:07.074 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MANAMI]
Will you call me by my name?

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
And if that ever happens to me,

00:05:08.943 --> 00:05:12.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
it'd help if you'd
call me by my name.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Nah, that can't be it.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.620 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
There's no way, right?

00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:21.522 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I'm back!

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:23.825 position:33% line:89% align:start
[phone dings]

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:25.626 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I could always try.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.995 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll use her first name to see
if that's what she wants.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.463 position:19% line:83% align:start
If I'm wrong, I'll only
die of embarrassment.

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:33.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
--Yo! Did you see? We rule!
--What?!

00:05:33.768 --> 00:05:35.402 position:7% line:83% align:start
What would rule is if you could
give me some privacy!

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.171 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Peep our ranking!

00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:39.073 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh? Eighth?

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:40.074 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sick, yeah?

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:41.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
--Really?
--Really!

00:05:41.408 --> 00:05:42.475 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's legit?

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.913 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yes, it's legit, you dork! Yay!

00:05:46.047 --> 00:05:49.150 position:30% line:83% align:start
Dude! We did it
for realsies! Go us!

00:05:49.283 --> 00:05:51.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
Woo, yay, we rule...

00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:53.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
But before we celebrate,
can I take my shower?

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:55.422 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Eh?

00:05:57.258 --> 00:05:59.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
I definitely made the right
choice on the shampoo.

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:01.229 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yum, don't you agree?

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:04.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
And it says on the bottle
it'll make your hair all silky.

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:07.835 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you had big hair,
then I'd call you Yak-uin.

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.371 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Great, we've moved
into last-name-related puns.

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:15.176 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mention it 'cause
I love my name.

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:18.112 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't flip, the dryer gets loud.

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:19.280 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari...

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:21.816 position:5% line:89% align:start
You can yell if it gets too hot.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:22.984 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akari...

00:06:23.117 --> 00:06:25.319 position:19% line:89% align:start
Say something, Yakuin?

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.955 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari.

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:29.422 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akari.

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:33.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? What the...?
Wait! That was for me!

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:35.963 position:35% line:89% align:start
Jiro, I...

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:39.166 position:27% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh, did I
actually figure it out?

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.401 position:19% line:89% align:start
That's what was wrong?

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:43.638 position:38% line:89% align:start
A-Akari.

00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:46.240 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
What is it, Jiro?

00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:49.076 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She just wanted me to
call her by her first name?

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.147 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's all it took?
Well, let's see...

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:54.849 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari.

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:57.852 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Dude, unless you need
something, chill with that.

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:01.055 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Crap, I'm gonna lose it.

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:02.623 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari.

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:05.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
Stop, and don't look at
my face for a sec, please.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.130 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, there's no need
to be embarrassed.

00:07:09.263 --> 00:07:10.831 position:21% line:89% align:start
Good, cause I'm not!

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:13.567 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're not embarrassed! I get
it! So, quit frying me now!

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:15.269 position:35% line:89% align:start
[groaning]

00:07:15.403 --> 00:07:18.973 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I mean, come on, we've
been married for like ever.

00:07:19.106 --> 00:07:22.510 position:13% line:83% align:start
It'd be cool if you'd keep
calling me "Akari."

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:25.746 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's how I like it.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.551 position:24% line:83% align:start
Okay? We don't have
much more time together.

[JIRO]
She's right.

00:07:35.723 --> 00:07:38.592 position:19% line:83% align:start
Pretty soon things will
go back to how they were.

00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:41.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
And she'll just be
my classmate Watanabe.

If you don't get it together

00:07:59.246 --> 00:08:01.481 position:16% line:83% align:start

could lose this guy for good!

He's gonna be booed up

People like Yakuin typically
go wherever they're pushed.

00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:15.229 position:10% line:89% align:start
If you really wanna date him,

00:08:15.363 --> 00:08:17.298 position:10% line:83% align:start
you'll just have to push him
harder than his wife.

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:20.034 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but that's a lot
easier said than done.

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.602 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
There's a pretty decent chance

00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:23.204 position:21% line:83% align:start
that they've at least
kissed already.

If you keep taking
a back seat in this,

00:08:25.373 --> 00:08:26.707 position:10% line:89% align:start
they might end up doing more.

00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:29.310 position:24% line:83% align:start
More? Do you really
think they would?

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:33.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't know, but from now on,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.030 position:7% line:83% align:start
Not sure, she's in the nurse's
office. Go check up on her.

Got something better to do?

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.634 position:7% line:89% align:start
I mean, no, of course I don't.

00:08:53.768 --> 00:08:55.703 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's just weird,
don't you think?

00:08:55.836 --> 00:08:57.304 position:19% line:89% align:start
I have no reason to go.

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your friend got hurt, that's
reason enough. So what?

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:02.343 position:10% line:83% align:start
Are you just too embarrassed
to worry about her?

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:03.944 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.013 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MEI] If you don't want to go,
that's a different story.

00:09:06.147 --> 00:09:07.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
But if this is some
weird pride thing,

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:09.884 position:27% line:83% align:start
swallow that crap
and go see her.

00:09:10.017 --> 00:09:12.920 position:7% line:89% align:start
Here, this can be your reason.

C'mon, Shiori.

No, I feel good.

Huh?

arguing with you too, someday.

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:44.111 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
And why's that?

00:10:44.245 --> 00:10:46.615 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Because I've known you
for a billion years now,

00:10:46.747 --> 00:10:49.783 position:13% line:83% align:start
and in all that time I've

00:11:10.204 --> 00:11:12.607 position:10% line:83% align:start

around me keep getting

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
more and more mature, and
I'm still just a little kid.

I'd be too scared to
do anything out of

the fear of being
terrible at it.

The bed was taken,

Like, I wasn't snooping

00:21:44.672 --> 00:21:46.007 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Like it would've been so bad.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.375 position:13% line:83% align:start
You should be disappointed
we didn't do it.

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:51.012 position:19% line:83% align:start
You serious? Of course
I'm disappointed.

[AKARI grunts]

00:21:52.713 --> 00:21:55.482 position:24% line:83% align:start
Because now you can
keep calling me virg.

00:21:56.184 --> 00:21:58.920 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Sorry!

00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:00.788 position:19% line:83% align:start
How foolish to think a
goddess would copulate

00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:03.390 position:21% line:83% align:start
with a mere peasant!
Forgive me, m'lady!

00:22:03.524 --> 00:22:06.493 position:10% line:89% align:start
Not that! I'm a good person,

00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:09.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna mess this up
for you and Sakurazaka.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.599 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh? What did you just say?

00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:13.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're not fooling me, dude,

00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:14.969 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know good and well that
you're secretly relieved.

00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:16.637 position:21% line:83% align:start
You wouldn't want to
waste your first time

00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:18.005 position:5% line:89% align:start
on me when it could've been her.

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:19.841 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have
to move your hands!

00:22:19.974 --> 00:22:21.609 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why can't you just
be honest with me?

00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:24.111 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I can't hear you!

00:22:24.245 --> 00:22:27.615 position:21% line:83% align:start
I freakin' hate you,
do you know that, dude?

00:23:58.806 --> 00:24:00.574 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
What a happy feeling.

00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:02.543 position:7% line:89% align:start
Makes me wanna go night-night.

00:24:02.677 --> 00:24:05.445 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's count Jiros. Ready?

00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:06.847 position:10% line:83% align:start
--[SHIORI] There's one Jiro.
--[JIRO] Shiori.

00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.016 position:21% line:83% align:start
--Ooo! And two Jiros.
--Shiori!

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.319 position:13% line:83% align:start
--Three Jiros, all for me!
--Shiori...
