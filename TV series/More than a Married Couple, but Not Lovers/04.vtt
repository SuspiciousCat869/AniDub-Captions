[STUDENT A]
Get ready!

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? You got boosted
to B-rank? No way.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.384 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's all my partner.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.419 position:33% line:83% align:start
To be honest,
he's like a total try hard.

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.255 position:33% line:83% align:start
Bet more than
his trying is hard.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.324 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sick nasty. Ixnay on
bumping and grinding,

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.793 position:5% line:89% align:start
we both have real life partners.

00:00:25.927 --> 00:00:28.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
If we get to A-rank,
we'll switch anyway.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:31.866 position:21% line:83% align:start
Scary! This switching
and ditching?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.201 position:13% line:83% align:start
If Ryou went to our school
I would literally die,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.270 position:24% line:83% align:start
come back to life,
and die again!

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.573 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like, imagine if my bunny
got to A-rank and lived with

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.109 position:7% line:83% align:start
a whole variety pack of chicks!
I would explode for reals!

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.478 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nat-simp-mi cleanup
in aisle gym.

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:46.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
Homie, you're into Ryou
like too much.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.182 position:21% line:83% align:start
Even if he went here,
A-rank is impossible to get.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.619 position:16% line:83% align:start
I seriously doubt Ryou is
enough of a goody-goody

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:54.789 position:16% line:83% align:start
to be Mister Perfect for
a bunch of total randos.

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:56.758 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you're right.

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:00.028 position:7% line:89% align:start
Ryou, your sexiness terrifies!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.397 position:7% line:83% align:start
Watch the game, ladies, this is
gym class, not giggle time!

00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.499 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay.

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.536 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A]
Over here! Cover!

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.205 position:5% line:83% align:start
You'd rather stare at Sakurazaka
than talk to your bro?

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:15.275 position:30% line:89% align:start
Earth to Jiro.

00:01:17.879 --> 00:01:18.880 position:35% line:89% align:start
Chill out.

00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:19.814 position:24% line:89% align:start

[KAMO]
Dayum! So cool!

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:33.628 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grumbles]

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.538 position:21% line:83% align:start
A dude like that guy
has gotta be

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:46.507 position:21% line:83% align:start
different from us on
a biological level.

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:50.177 position:16% line:83% align:start
You heard the rumor about
Sakurazaka, didn't you? Woof.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.447 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm? What rumor?

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just spill! What's this
gossip about Minami?

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.778 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, like, my sources
aren't uber verified.

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:34.015 position:16% line:83% align:start
But word is that Tenjin's
not gonna swap partners.

00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:35.415 position:24% line:89% align:start
I heard that, too.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.250 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I figured it was bogus
cause pretty much

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:38.820 position:27% line:83% align:start
everyone who hits
A-rank switches.

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:41.288 position:13% line:83% align:start
It high-key makes sense to
because you get to combine

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:43.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
all your points from
your previous pairings.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.593 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like, they make us do the
practical so we can have

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:47.360 position:5% line:89% align:start
the best future possible, right?

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:48.996 position:19% line:83% align:start
By switching, we learn
what type of guys

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.832 position:16% line:89% align:start
we want that future with.

00:03:50.965 --> 00:03:54.401 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but... We're in
a marriage simulation.

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:55.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
In real marriage,
you shouldn't drop

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.972 position:24% line:83% align:start
and pick up spouses
over and over.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:03:59.272 position:5% line:89% align:start
Girl, I hate to break it to you,

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:00.775 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I don't think
it's that deep.

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:03.443 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not to freak you, but
it's gonna be totes fine

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:07.815 position:21% line:83% align:start
if it happens, 'kay?
If those two, you know...

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.717 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Everything's chill.

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:12.385 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're still only
in the first month.

marry me, you cutie!

00:04:17.424 --> 00:04:19.127 position:16% line:83% align:start

playing wedding planner!

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:20.928 position:7% line:89% align:start
Throuple or nothing, snitches!

00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:23.564 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] C'mon, guys!
Give it a rest, will you?!

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:26.234 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TEACHER A] The one who needs
to give it a rest is you!

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.170 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Naughty, naughty Natsumi
speaks of throuple?

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.639 position:7% line:89% align:start
What a glorious gym class. Hm?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.978 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, why so sad? There's a
pretty obvious upside, bro.

00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.913 position:19% line:83% align:start
Being the wife of cool
guy McGee over there

00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:41.314 position:10% line:83% align:start
is leagues better than being
with your nerdy self!

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.950 position:16% line:89% align:start
Major win for Sakurazaka!

00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:45.485 position:13% line:83% align:start
Who the hell's side are you
supposed to be on again?

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.655 position:30% line:83% align:start
C'mon, my man,
I thought I made that clear.

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.293 position:13% line:83% align:start
The lady's of course! For I

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:42.656 position:27% line:89% align:start
Things are good.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
We've been getting along
pretty well lately.

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:50.598 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Look at that.

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:55.269 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess I am in love
with him after all.

00:08:57.671 --> 00:08:59.106 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Watanabe?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Gosh, I'm sorry!
It's like crazy dusty in here.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:05.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
I must've managed to get
some of it in my eye.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.355 position:24% line:89% align:start
What are you doing?

00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:15.956 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Don't worry.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.293 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hold still and look right at me.

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:24.131 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Jiro? Broski?

00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:25.466 position:27% line:89% align:start
What a tool bag.

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:29.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
He was supposed to help me
close all the windows.

00:09:30.337 --> 00:09:33.841 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Aha! Jiro--

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:39.580 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Brooooo.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.919 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hmm. I guess I don't know.

00:09:45.052 --> 00:09:46.153 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:46.287 --> 00:09:48.089 position:16% line:83% align:start
Switching partners isn't
something I can decide

00:09:48.222 --> 00:09:49.390 position:27% line:89% align:start
to do on my own.

00:09:49.524 --> 00:09:51.892 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Yeah! Of course!
That makes perfect sense.

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.994 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry for the stupid question,
and I mean,

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:56.864 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tenjin's the best,
why would you?

00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:01.503 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe, if things were different,
and we were both

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:05.372 position:27% line:83% align:start
in A-rank at the
same time, we could...

00:10:05.507 --> 00:10:08.375 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oops! We need to change
before our next class starts.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.777 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm gonna skedaddle.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shiori! I'll...
I'll make it to A-rank!

00:10:12.713 --> 00:10:15.049 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just wait! And then...

00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:22.423 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you're in A-rank, too...
Well. Shiori, will... Will you--

00:10:22.557 --> 00:10:25.493 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Brooooooooooooooooooo!

00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:26.994 position:19% line:89% align:start
This is freakin' huge!

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:28.662 position:24% line:83% align:start
As huge as buying a
mega-pack of trading cards

00:10:28.796 --> 00:10:31.265 position:30% line:83% align:start
and exclusively
pulling secret rares!

00:10:31.398 --> 00:10:33.033 position:24% line:89% align:start
Pay attention! Ahh!

00:10:33.167 --> 00:10:35.570 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you don't get the hell out
of here in the next 30 seconds,

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:36.871 position:13% line:89% align:start
the hugest thing on campus

00:10:37.004 --> 00:10:38.672 position:21% line:83% align:start
is gonna be the crowd
at your funeral.

00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:40.774 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Bros don't threaten bros!

00:10:40.908 --> 00:10:42.743 position:27% line:89% align:start
Everything okay?

00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:44.411 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Kamo, kamo.

00:10:44.546 --> 00:10:47.681 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sorry about that.
It wasn't anything important.

00:10:47.815 --> 00:10:49.416 position:44% line:89% align:start
Cool.

00:10:49.551 --> 00:10:51.352 position:10% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Wait, were you guys in
the middle of something, too?

00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:52.720 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yes, we were.

00:10:52.853 --> 00:10:54.288 position:21% line:83% align:start
And what the hell do
you mean by "too"?

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:56.924 position:5% line:83% align:start
Get this, bro, I just saw Tenjin
and Akari sharing a--

00:10:57.057 --> 00:10:59.660 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Sharing a what now?

00:10:59.793 --> 00:11:01.662 position:5% line:89% align:start
What're you guys talking about?

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:04.398 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Oh, nothing at all.

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:11.305 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Wait. Something's wrong.

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:14.408 position:19% line:83% align:start
What happened to cause
all this tension?

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:20.781 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? What terrain
faces me today?

00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:23.083 position:19% line:83% align:start
Duelist Kamo has been
caught by a trap card!

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:26.887 position:16% line:83% align:start
The only option is for me
to summon a monster!

00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:30.357 position:10% line:89% align:start
Quick Joke the Forbidden One!

00:11:30.491 --> 00:11:32.159 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hold on, there are
females around.

00:11:32.293 --> 00:11:34.361 position:19% line:83% align:start
If my joke card fails,
I'll ruin my reputation

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:35.996 position:13% line:89% align:start
as the charming, funny guy.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:40.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Next time: "I Die Inside!"
Kamo Sadaharu, standing by!

00:11:40.968 --> 00:11:42.836 position:16% line:83% align:start
Four eps deep and I think
that's the first time

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.838 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've heard my full name
in this anime.

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:46.840 position:30% line:83% align:start
Kamo Sadaharu.
I've been lookin' for you.

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:48.342 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KAMO grunting]

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:51.845 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait. I'm sorry you're
not Kamo, then? My bad.

00:11:51.979 --> 00:11:54.748 position:5% line:89% align:start
No, no! I am the Kamo you seek.

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.685 position:19% line:89% align:start
Great. Just one second.

00:11:56.817 --> 00:11:58.620 position:24% line:83% align:start
Coach wanted me to
give you the closet key,

00:11:58.786 --> 00:11:59.887 position:5% line:89% align:start
he says you're on PE committee.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.423 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, okay, that makes sense.

00:12:03.891 --> 00:12:06.427 position:13% line:89% align:start
She's all yours. Bye, Kamo.

00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:08.530 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
My heart.

00:12:08.663 --> 00:12:10.297 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Oh yeah, Shiori.

00:12:10.431 --> 00:12:12.601 position:10% line:83% align:start
Did you turn in the form that
says we'll keep being partners?

00:12:12.733 --> 00:12:14.235 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oops, I forgot, I'm sorry.

00:12:14.368 --> 00:12:15.903 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
That's okay, I forgot, too.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:17.905 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Maybe we can
go together at lunch.

00:12:18.038 --> 00:12:19.473 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's due today, isn't it?

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.409 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] Yeah, I think I
remember hearing that.

00:12:22.544 --> 00:12:25.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bye, Jiro. We're going to
head on over to class.

00:12:25.813 --> 00:12:28.182 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, bye.

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:29.883 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
I have work after school today.

00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:32.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Gotcha. So you
won't need dinner, right?

00:12:32.453 --> 00:12:35.289 position:13% line:83% align:start
I mean, I could always drop
something off if you get hungry.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:40.794 position:7% line:83% align:start
Adieu! It's time for Mama Kamo
to take care of baby closet key.

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:54.542 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Eh... What kind of
expression is that? Freaky.

00:12:54.676 --> 00:12:55.776 position:30% line:89% align:start
Whatever it is,

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:59.013 position:27% line:83% align:start
may the force be
with you, brother.

00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:02.816 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, uh, Watanabe?

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.353 position:21% line:83% align:start
We should get going.
We're gonna be late.

00:13:07.788 --> 00:13:09.390 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Right.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.997 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Yo, have you seen Akari?

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:18.432 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
She totally dipped out.

00:13:18.566 --> 00:13:20.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
She says if anybody asks,
say she has a cold.

00:13:21.068 --> 00:13:23.270 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Hooker playin' hooky!

00:13:25.072 --> 00:13:27.808 position:27% line:89% align:start
So she just left?

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:43.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Wander, wander.
Wander, wander, wander.

00:13:43.658 --> 00:13:46.894 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wander, wander, wander,
wander, wander.

00:13:48.563 --> 00:13:50.264 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh?!

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.968 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Yoohoo...

00:13:55.102 --> 00:13:57.271 position:16% line:89% align:start
What do you want from me?

00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:02.276 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I just think it's curious
that Tenjin stuck around.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:05.312 position:7% line:83% align:start
Jeez, if I hear one more person
talk about "Tenjin" I'm gonna

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:07.981 position:24% line:83% align:start
"Ten-jam" a pencil
through my freakin' skull!

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:11.118 position:30% line:83% align:start
Bro. You don't
understand what I saw.

00:14:11.251 --> 00:14:12.886 position:7% line:89% align:start
Never mind, I shouldn't gossip

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.055 position:16% line:83% align:start
since he was nice enough
to know my name.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:17.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
Plus he smelled like
my hopes and dreams.

00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:19.293 position:27% line:83% align:start
I smell great and
know your name, too!

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.128 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kamo, Kamo, Kamo,
Kamo, Kamo, Kamo--

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:23.565 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have a hankering for fish,
perhaps, Kisu?

00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:24.833 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:14:24.965 --> 00:14:26.801 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:14:26.934 --> 00:14:28.536 position:21% line:89% align:start
[KAMO clears throat]

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:34.041 position:7% line:89% align:start
Bro. I saw the smoochy smooch.

00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:35.876 position:24% line:89% align:start
Wait. You smooched?

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:38.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please! I can't even
kiss my family's cat

00:14:38.613 --> 00:14:39.614 position:21% line:89% align:start
without being mauled.

00:14:39.748 --> 00:14:41.816 position:27% line:89% align:start
So... Who kissed?

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:43.283 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Tenjin and Akari!

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:45.219 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:48.956 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] I saw the deed!
But I missed the buildup

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:50.891 position:19% line:83% align:start
and couldn't get a read
on their romance.

00:14:51.024 --> 00:14:52.960 position:5% line:89% align:start
Akari seemed embarrassed after.

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.896 position:13% line:83% align:start
No way I was hallucinating.
Smooch city.

00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:56.831 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
So what?

00:14:56.964 --> 00:14:58.332 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Hm-- Huh?

00:14:58.465 --> 00:15:00.901 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
If that's true, so what?

00:15:01.034 --> 00:15:04.572 position:33% line:83% align:start
C'mon, that's
your wife, so...

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.542 position:24% line:89% align:start
Nah, I'm with you.

00:15:07.675 --> 00:15:11.546 position:16% line:83% align:start
This isn't your problem,
so why would you care, right?

00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:22.289 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I get it. That's what
you've wanted this whole time.

00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:26.493 position:16% line:83% align:start
Congrats. I'm real happy
for you, Watanabe.

00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:35.202 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Whatever, I'm not
Team Lancia anyway.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.077 position:13% line:83% align:start
[HOST A] Today, we're going
to take a deep dive...

00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:46.447 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm back.

00:15:52.252 --> 00:15:53.487 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've got a cold, huh?

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:55.355 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HOST A]
It's great for toning the skin.

00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:57.191 position:10% line:83% align:start

her hair on the darker side,

its lavender

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:01.128 position:21% line:83% align:start
to make my face glow
and hair pop.

00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:03.096 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just wait! Our next

You and Tenjin. I hear you had
a big moment after class.

Congrats. I'm really
happy for you.

Why are being weird about it?
Like yeah, I talked to him.

That made me happy,
too, I guess.

Making out in a supply closet

Yeah. I'm serious.

checking for dust in my eye!

If I'm acting weird,

00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:35.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
it's cause I found out he's
not switching partners.

Why would you believe that?

I freakin' wish.

00:17:42.764 --> 00:17:44.799 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm trying hard because
I can barely get him

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:46.066 position:10% line:89% align:start
to acknowledge my existence.

00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:48.302 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay, sure, I understand that,

00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.337 position:24% line:83% align:start
but a little action
seemed reasonable,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.509 position:19% line:83% align:start
especially at the rate
you're going.

Dumb-dumb of the decade.

out of your chest.

you only dressed like that

Aw, that's actually
kinda adorable.

I only kiss you.

00:21:29.724 --> 00:21:31.659 position:30% line:83% align:start
For the sake of
marital transparency,

00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:34.461 position:27% line:83% align:start
that was actually
my first kiss ever.

FYI that was not cool!

00:21:38.065 --> 00:21:40.735 position:5% line:83% align:start
You can't just surprise somebody
with a full-mouth kiss.

00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:43.004 position:21% line:83% align:start
It literally screams
"Yo, I'm a virgin!"

00:21:43.137 --> 00:21:44.672 position:5% line:89% align:start
A horndog virgin, no less, dude!

00:21:44.806 --> 00:21:46.439 position:13% line:83% align:start
It was like, way too much,
way too fast!

00:21:46.574 --> 00:21:47.742 position:16% line:89% align:start
What a crappy first kiss!

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:49.210 position:24% line:83% align:start
And I'm never gonna
get a do-over

listening to me?

act like freakin' human being!

Don't get the wrong idea, me!

00:22:03.858 --> 00:22:05.293 position:27% line:83% align:start
She just ended up
paired with me,

and it just happened
to be her first.

00:22:07.929 --> 00:22:10.164 position:27% line:83% align:start
And it's totally
possible that it

00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:12.767 position:5% line:89% align:start
could have been some other guy.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.703 position:13% line:83% align:start
I bet she's never confessed
that to anyone else.

00:22:15.837 --> 00:22:18.539 position:27% line:83% align:start
I said, don't get
the wrong idea here!

00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:23.544 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is just a practical.
That's all it is!

Uh-oh, I feel crazy happy.

Yeesh, good thing
I didn't play that,

00:24:11.018 --> 00:24:13.888 position:5% line:89% align:start
I would've looked like a weenie!

00:24:14.021 --> 00:24:15.589 position:35% line:83% align:start
Next time,
"More Than a Nosebleed,

00:24:15.723 --> 00:24:17.758 position:10% line:89% align:start
but Less Than a Kiss." Spicy!
