[SHIORI]
And we haven't really had

00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:16.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
a chance to talk since
it all went down.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.458 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] How much longer
will we be like this?

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ugh, no way things'll stay
like this forever, will they?

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:45.680 position:21% line:89% align:start
Seems like overkill.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.119 position:5% line:89% align:start
Can't a man just play his game?

00:02:38.993 --> 00:02:42.830 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Uh. Sure you're ready?
You want me to look?

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI grunts]

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.568 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here goes!

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:51.371 position:21% line:89% align:start
Kill me. We're 13th.

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.373 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Three places short?

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:56.376 position:30% line:83% align:start
So dang close,
and yet so dang far.

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.912 position:16% line:89% align:start
Our competition's tough.

00:02:58.046 --> 00:03:00.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
The couple in fifth
started dating in real life.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:05.385 position:7% line:83% align:start
For real? No way we could beat
that lovey, mushy crap, huh?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.789 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, it's whatevs.

00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:11.726 position:7% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm counting on you for
another month. Cool, hubby?

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.628 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:03:17.131 --> 00:03:19.734 position:21% line:89% align:start
I dunno, is it cool?

00:03:20.735 --> 00:03:23.071 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I never found out
what happened that day.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:27.508 position:7% line:83% align:start
Akari just went back to normal
without saying a word.

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.744 position:30% line:83% align:start
Even though she
was clearly crushed,

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:31.411 position:30% line:83% align:start
she seems more
determined than ever to

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:35.248 position:19% line:83% align:start
switch partners. Guess
Tenjin's worth the tears.

00:03:35.382 --> 00:03:40.454 position:27% line:89% align:start
Jiro! Emergency!

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:43.791 position:33% line:83% align:start
What's wrong?
You hurt or something?

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] There's a creep
in there! Go get him!

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.030 position:21% line:89% align:start
Huh? Who's in where?

00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:50.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Please, just hurry up
and go get him!

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.533 position:30% line:83% align:start
Pretty please,
I'm begging you, Jiro!

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:56.037 position:16% line:83% align:start
I need you to calm down!
Who's in there?

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.305 position:38% line:89% align:start
A spider!

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:01.843 position:24% line:83% align:start
What? You barged in
on me over a bug?

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.611 position:19% line:83% align:start
In case you missed it,
I'm naked!

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.914 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shut up! I don't care!
Who would, pudding body boy?

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:08.516 position:24% line:89% align:start
A critical hit! Ow!

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.184 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI grunts]
Just help me!

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:12.720 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you don't get that creeper
out of our apartment now,

00:04:12.854 --> 00:04:14.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll have to stay
in here with you!

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.356 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just give me a second!

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
And something to cover
my dangly bits! Uh!

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:25.133 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Uh... We're here.
Where's the spider?

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:29.137 position:27% line:89% align:start
[AKARI whimpers]

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.038 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's planning a sneak attack!

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:33.541 position:5% line:89% align:start
Stay calm, okay? How big was it?

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:34.809 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Like this.

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:36.644 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
What? That's nothing!

00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:40.447 position:7% line:83% align:start
Any amount of spider is a huge
amount for me, capeesh?

00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
I understand they
freak you out, sorry.

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:44.118 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Speaking of huge amounts...

00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:47.688 position:13% line:83% align:start
It could pop out and attack
at any moment! Scawy!

00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:50.124 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She's cute when
she's timid like this.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:51.826 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yo, I'm mad hungry.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.227 position:38% line:89% align:start
Then eat.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.497 position:10% line:83% align:start
Let's mosey into the kitchen.
Yeah? C'mon! Let's go!

00:04:57.632 --> 00:04:59.934 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
So much for timidity.

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:05.540 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Ah, I'm all stuffed on
snacks and ready to do my nails.

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:07.340 position:30% line:83% align:start
Am I allowed to
go to my room now?

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.777 position:24% line:83% align:start
No way, duh. If the
spider comes back

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.546 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna need you
ready to catch it.

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:14.749 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, please. Call for me
and I'll come back out.

00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:17.384 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
This is me calling for you.

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:19.520 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't be alone
when it attacks.

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:21.421 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huge amounts!
Huge amounts on my leg!

00:05:21.556 --> 00:05:22.355 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huge amounts nearing my--

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.958 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI grunts]

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.726 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.397 position:35% line:89% align:start
Will you...

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.534 position:13% line:89% align:start
Um, protect me while I pee?

00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:35.636 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
For real?

00:05:36.838 --> 00:05:39.941 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Jiro? You're right there, yeah?

00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:42.243 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.045 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Cover your ears, okay?

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:45.613 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Homie gonna fry some chicken?

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:46.581 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Jiro?

00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:47.815 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I'm right here!

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.183 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Cover your ears, perv!

00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:50.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I was just about to!

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:52.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] This is madness.
Girls don't piss.

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:55.756 position:21% line:83% align:start
Girls. Do. Not. Piss.
Come out, Akari.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.359 position:21% line:83% align:start
Release me from this
golden nightmare.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:00.895 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:04.464 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:08.202 position:30% line:83% align:start
While I'm here,
I might as well go, too.

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:11.138 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, relax! I'll be quick!

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.745 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Welp, time to die!

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.814 position:24% line:83% align:start
How can I possibly
recover from this?

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:22.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the perv for asking him
to follow me to the bathroom!

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.586 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm done with this
"being perceived" crap.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.355 position:10% line:89% align:start
I mean, at least it was Jiro.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.422 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had a feeling he'd
be nice about it.

00:06:29.557 --> 00:06:31.325 position:27% line:83% align:start
Glad he's the one
here with me right now.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:36.030 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'd never be able to ask Minami
for something like that.

00:06:36.163 --> 00:06:38.866 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mm? [gasps]

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.338 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Here. Let's head back.

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:45.539 position:24% line:89% align:start
Did you wash that?

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:48.376 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm a very clean boy!

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.013 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI laughs]
Thank you.

00:06:55.182 --> 00:06:58.252 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] With that, all boundaries
are out of the door.

00:06:58.386 --> 00:07:00.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
I really am living with a gyaru.

00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:02.256 position:16% line:83% align:start
At first, I didn't think
there was a shot in hell

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.457 position:5% line:89% align:start
this would work out, but now...

00:07:04.592 --> 00:07:06.928 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yo, I wanted some of that, too.

00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:08.829 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Well, there's
more in the freezer.

00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:10.665 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Dude. If I go in there alone,

00:07:10.798 --> 00:07:12.967 position:16% line:83% align:start
the spider could get me--
plus I only wanted one bite.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
Okay, then I'll go
get you a spoon.

00:07:14.802 --> 00:07:18.072 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Don't! I couldn't hold it.

00:07:18.205 --> 00:07:21.075 position:13% line:83% align:start
What? Are you worried about
some indirect kiss crap?

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.944 position:19% line:83% align:start
I always forget you're,
like, twelve.

00:07:23.077 --> 00:07:25.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Clearly, she's
the one worried about it!

00:07:25.313 --> 00:07:28.983 position:21% line:83% align:start
Please. I want yours.
Put it in my mouth.

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:30.651 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hurry. Ahhh...

00:07:30.785 --> 00:07:35.423 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Commander Johnson!
Keep the troops at bay!

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:37.091 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Fine.

00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:39.727 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Ahhh...

00:07:41.696 --> 00:07:45.032 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI laughs]

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:46.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh, what's so funny?

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.704 position:13% line:83% align:start
You used to pick chocolate,
but now you're a vanilla man!

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:53.240 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're getting more alike,
don't you think so?

00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:55.810 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Wow, did you get
hit by the happy bus?

00:07:55.943 --> 00:07:59.613 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh? Let a girl have
some fun! Buzzkill.

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.481 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunting]

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:02.616 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.919 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, something's
been on my mind.

00:08:05.052 --> 00:08:06.787 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you and I had met
anywhere that wasn't this

00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
stupid practical,
what would've happened?

00:08:09.957 --> 00:08:12.927 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's easy, we wouldn't've
talked. Get real.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.830 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mean! You don't know!
I would've liked you,

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:19.200 position:24% line:83% align:start
this hypothetical,
non-husband version of you.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:20.701 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Why?

00:08:20.835 --> 00:08:22.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
You'd be funny! Your gloomy
ass would send me.

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:24.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
But the fact we have
jack in common

00:08:24.705 --> 00:08:26.240 position:7% line:89% align:start
might prevent anything deeper.

00:08:26.374 --> 00:08:28.943 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet the same can be
said for most every pair.

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:30.745 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Nah, the fifth-placers
would be dating.

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:34.148 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, maybe, but they're
an exception, so...

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:36.550 position:13% line:89% align:start
Should we try dating, too?

00:08:43.657 --> 00:08:45.226 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Get pranked!

00:08:45.359 --> 00:08:48.763 position:5% line:83% align:start
Not to brag, but my nails turned
out, like, lowkey bomb today.

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:50.765 position:10% line:89% align:start
It cool if I watch something?

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:52.466 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Of course.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.203 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Why did I legitimately
consider it for a second?

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:58.739 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's no way she
was being serious!

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.876 position:13% line:83% align:start
If she was, she wouldn't've
said it so casually.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:06.781 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she was, what answer
would I even have given her?

00:09:08.416 --> 00:09:10.918 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Maybe if we weren't
a married couple--

00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:15.022 position:7% line:83% align:start
and maybe if I didn't know he
was in love with someone else.

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.396 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI screams]
Spider! Spider! Spider!

00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:25.900 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Where? Show me!
That thing? But it's...

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:27.468 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's terrifying! Do something!

00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.505 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uhhh, woah, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Akari! Let go of me!

00:09:30.638 --> 00:09:33.040 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI gasping]
Jiro!

00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:35.042 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] My hand,
it's immersed in warmth.

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:37.611 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is so wrong,
but feels so right.

00:09:37.745 --> 00:09:39.814 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh... Akari?

00:09:39.947 --> 00:09:41.682 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Don't just sit there
and space out!

00:09:41.816 --> 00:09:43.717 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is life or death--
do something!

00:09:43.851 --> 00:09:47.822 position:19% line:83% align:start
I will! But I need you
to let go of me first!

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:53.227 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Check it. I'll go ahead
buy this for next time.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.029 position:19% line:83% align:start
--[AKARI] That's barf.
--And why is that?

00:09:55.162 --> 00:09:57.631 position:13% line:83% align:start
If I spray it and it dies,
I won't pick that crap up.

00:09:57.765 --> 00:09:59.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
Easy for you to say now,
but what will you do

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:01.435 position:5% line:89% align:start
if your next husband hates bugs?

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.872 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not worried. 'Cause if I
call for a certain someone,

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:08.909 position:7% line:89% align:start
he'll come and save me, right?

00:10:09.043 --> 00:10:10.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Don't go skipping
a beat there, heart.

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.279 position:7% line:89% align:start
She's messing with you, buddy.

00:10:12.413 --> 00:10:15.649 position:24% line:83% align:start
Goodnight! All this
terror's got me pooped.

00:10:15.783 --> 00:10:19.386 position:16% line:83% align:start
Night. Your exterminator
is clocking out.

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:23.691 position:19% line:83% align:start
Get some sleep, because
I'm counting on you, Akari.

00:10:23.824 --> 00:10:25.860 position:24% line:89% align:start
For now, at least.

00:10:57.725 --> 00:11:00.461 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
You're up late. Something wrong?

00:11:00.595 --> 00:11:02.163 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh...

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:03.998 position:13% line:83% align:start
If there's something on your
mind, I'd love to talk to you

00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:06.934 position:24% line:83% align:start
about it, though I
may not be much help.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:08.402 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Thanks a bunch.

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.271 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you remember that
friend I told you about

00:11:10.404 --> 00:11:12.973 position:24% line:83% align:start
who sorta reunited
with the boy she liked?

00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:14.241 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:15.976 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's a little update
on their situation.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.711 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:11:18.513 --> 00:11:20.549 position:24% line:89% align:start
They kinda kissed!

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.016 position:24% line:89% align:start
Don't get me wrong,

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.051 position:19% line:83% align:start
they aren't dating and
the kiss was on accident!

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:25.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now my poor friend
is too nervous

00:11:26.053 --> 00:11:27.688 position:13% line:89% align:start
to talk to this boy at all.

00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.390 position:5% line:89% align:start
I don't know how the boy feels.

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:31.926 position:7% line:83% align:start
I mean, my friend doesn't know
how the boy feels about her

00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:33.694 position:30% line:83% align:start
or their kiss,
like if he thought

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:36.997 position:21% line:83% align:start
it was weird or yucky
or awkward.

00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:39.833 position:30% line:83% align:start
The thing is...
all her worrying about it

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:42.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
made her realize she
really does love him.

00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:44.004 position:16% line:89% align:start
And that accidental kiss

00:11:44.138 --> 00:11:46.707 position:21% line:83% align:start
has been playing on
repeat in her brain.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.276 position:7% line:83% align:start
She doesn't know if she should
be honest and tell him how

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.682 position:16% line:83% align:start
she feels. She's scared.
Got any advice for her?

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.016 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh, Minami? Your tea!

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.019 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oops. I wasn't looking.

00:11:59.153 --> 00:12:01.088 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's fine. Didn't get
on the sofa.

00:12:01.222 --> 00:12:03.924 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Here! Have a towel.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.461 position:16% line:89% align:start
If your friend is scared,

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:10.364 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's because there's
something real on the line.

00:12:12.366 --> 00:12:15.503 position:19% line:83% align:start
And... if there's any
chance it'll work out,

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:17.838 position:19% line:89% align:start
she's gotta go for it.

00:12:17.972 --> 00:12:19.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's not confessing
to some stranger--

00:12:19.807 --> 00:12:21.242 position:13% line:89% align:start
it's the person she loves.

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:24.345 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she waits, she'll be
too late, just like I was.

00:12:24.478 --> 00:12:26.013 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sorry. I didn't...

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:29.216 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI laughs] No, it's fine.
I'm not looking for pity.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:31.418 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't want you--
I mean, your friend,

00:12:31.553 --> 00:12:33.354 position:5% line:89% align:start
to have any regrets about this.

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:37.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
Keep me updated and
I'll help wherever I can.

00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:38.959 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, sir!

00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:41.962 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thanks a ton. I'm so glad
you're my partner, Minami.

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:45.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
Idea! How about asking this
guy if he liked the kiss?

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:47.067 position:27% line:89% align:start
No way, I can't!

00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:49.870 position:13% line:89% align:start
Your friend can't? [laughs]

00:12:50.004 --> 00:12:51.472 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tell this friend
that Minami says,

00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:55.009 position:30% line:83% align:start
"have some more
confidence in yourself."

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.879 position:35% line:89% align:start
Okay. Sure.

00:13:01.148 --> 00:13:03.984 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Come on, dude.
You're hot, be more confident!

00:13:04.118 --> 00:13:05.953 position:21% line:83% align:start
The off-the-shoulder
look is sick!

00:13:06.086 --> 00:13:08.590 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yakuin's a horn-dog, this
would have him drooling!

00:13:08.723 --> 00:13:11.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ew! We're supposed to be
shopping for you by the way!

00:13:11.925 --> 00:13:14.995 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but we both know you'd
look extra adorable in this one.

00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:17.398 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] You would with a cute
skirt, you have the legs!

00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:18.866 position:21% line:89% align:start
You seein' my vision?

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.603 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Nah, I've got weird
tan lines from my shorts.

00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:24.171 position:24% line:83% align:start
See that next one?
The red would suit you!

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.206 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Don't worry about
what would "suit me."

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.842 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just pick out whatever
you like the best.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:30.844 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Huh? Why?

00:13:32.012 --> 00:13:33.981 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because it'll be you
who sees me in it.

00:13:34.114 --> 00:13:36.817 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll wear it the next time
we go to the movies.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.385 position:38% line:89% align:start
Promise.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.022 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll be whatever version of
myself you want me to be.

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:45.125 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI laughs] I can see
why you have a fan club!

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:47.928 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'll make some lucky person
very happy someday!

00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:49.698 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wish it was that easy, dude.

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.701 position:10% line:83% align:start
There are people I can't make
happy no matter how hard I try.

00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:54.569 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Well, those people
are just silly geese who

00:13:54.703 --> 00:13:57.137 position:16% line:83% align:start
don't know how absolutely
wonderful you are yet!

00:13:57.271 --> 00:13:58.872 position:5% line:89% align:start
Maybe I should go and tell them.

00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.341 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
You have better things to do,

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:02.109 position:27% line:83% align:start
like run into the
arms of your precious Yakuin,

00:14:02.242 --> 00:14:04.445 position:13% line:83% align:start
tell him you love him, and
that everything's fine!

00:14:04.579 --> 00:14:06.914 position:13% line:83% align:start
And once his guard is down,
jump his bones!

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:09.917 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Hush up!
We're in public you crazy!

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.452 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
Hamano!

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:12.920 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, need something?

00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:15.122 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey. The opposite,
I have a job interview,

00:14:15.255 --> 00:14:16.558 position:19% line:89% align:start
so I won't need dinner.

00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:18.560 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, nice. Same place
you mentioned before?

00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:21.261 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah. That star
place by the station.

00:14:21.395 --> 00:14:23.698 position:21% line:83% align:start
No way, Minami works
at a star place.

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:24.632 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
That's the one.

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:26.300 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yay!

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.168 position:5% line:83% align:start
I've been a teensy worried that
Minami has been working too hard

00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:30.270 position:10% line:83% align:start
lately, but I'll feel better
knowing you'll be with him!

00:14:30.404 --> 00:14:33.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, really, this dope is
surprisingly thoughtful.

00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:35.577 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE] A compliment
from my wife? Am I dreaming?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.144 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hey!

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:38.580 position:19% line:83% align:start
Real quick. I wanted to
tell you that Tenjin and I

00:14:38.713 --> 00:14:41.081 position:30% line:83% align:start
will be out all
night doing karaoke.

00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:43.150 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was thinking that you
two wives should link up.

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.285 position:16% line:83% align:start
You could have sleepover
at one of our places.

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:46.654 position:38% line:89% align:start
Sleep o--

00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:48.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
Spending the night together
could be really fun,

00:14:48.489 --> 00:14:50.592 position:19% line:83% align:start
think about it. You two
all by yourselves. No--

00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:51.925 position:13% line:89% align:start
I don't need you to help--

00:14:52.059 --> 00:14:54.128 position:35% line:83% align:start
How happy!
Come on, let's do it, Mei!

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:55.597 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's have a sleepover!

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.997 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:57.131 --> 00:14:58.700 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Oopsies,
do you have plans already?

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:00.401 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, it's just...

00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:03.203 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Surprisingly thoughtful?"
More like supremely thoughtful.

00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:05.072 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll make sure that's
the last thought you have!

00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:06.641 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I'm never
telling you crap again!

00:15:06.775 --> 00:15:09.544 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE] So, a sleepover
it is! Have fun ladies.

00:15:09.677 --> 00:15:10.978 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
That dork.

00:15:11.111 --> 00:15:13.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
It'll be nice! Whatcha
wanna do for dindin?

00:15:13.648 --> 00:15:15.650 position:24% line:89% align:start
Gosh, I don't know.

00:15:16.518 --> 00:15:20.087 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE] "I'll never ask
for anything again."

00:15:22.956 --> 00:15:24.992 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
Sweet!

00:15:26.561 --> 00:15:29.898 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now this is how
married life oughta work!

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.900 position:19% line:89% align:start
Husband slash wingman!

00:15:32.032 --> 00:15:36.403 position:5% line:83% align:start
[BROTHER] I'll tell you 'bout my
Minaman! Listen up, Teranishi.

00:15:36.538 --> 00:15:37.572 position:38% line:89% align:start
Terafune.

00:15:37.705 --> 00:15:39.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
This guy works his
freakin' cajones off

00:15:39.507 --> 00:15:41.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
so he can move out
once he graduates!

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.943 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why, you might ask?

00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:44.779 position:24% line:83% align:start
Lemme break it down
for you, newbie.

00:15:44.913 --> 00:15:47.849 position:21% line:83% align:start
My Minaman and his big
bro share a tragic fa--

00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.517 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, lay off the drinks.

00:15:49.651 --> 00:15:52.386 position:13% line:83% align:start
Besides, I've already told
Terafune about that junk.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.988 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. Yeah, it must be tough

00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.758 position:33% line:83% align:start
coming from a
cool guy bloodline.

00:15:56.891 --> 00:15:58.492 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like, sibling rivalry, much?

00:15:58.626 --> 00:16:01.295 position:10% line:83% align:start
That shiz makes us glad we're
normies, right Terashima?

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:02.730 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
It's Terafune.

00:16:02.864 --> 00:16:04.766 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tenjin, tell me about
your brother again.

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.166 position:30% line:89% align:start
What's he like?

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.669 position:21% line:89% align:start
He's pretty average.

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:09.236 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't say crap like that!

00:16:09.369 --> 00:16:11.271 position:16% line:83% align:start
If he's average, then what
the hell does that make us?

00:16:11.405 --> 00:16:13.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
Now pop a nip out and let
us suckle out some beauty!

00:16:14.107 --> 00:16:14.975 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right, Tracy?

00:16:15.108 --> 00:16:16.310 position:38% line:89% align:start
Terafune.

00:16:16.443 --> 00:16:17.712 position:21% line:83% align:start
My bros? Those little
weenies are about

00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:19.346 position:24% line:83% align:start
as close to average
as they come, so...

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.648 position:21% line:83% align:start
Excuse me? Can we get
some water, please?

00:16:20.782 --> 00:16:22.082 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, wait, they're below.

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:23.685 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
Cool, you have little brothers?

00:16:23.818 --> 00:16:26.353 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh yeah. One of them
is Kamo from school.

00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:29.156 position:21% line:89% align:start
Y'know, Yakuin's bud?

00:16:29.289 --> 00:16:31.291 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yakuin. Great.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:34.228 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Sure is a small world, isn't it?

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:37.030 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE] I didn't think there
was any way they'd work out.

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.233 position:13% line:89% align:start
How are they in 13th place?

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:40.869 position:21% line:89% align:start
I met Watanabe first!

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.437 position:13% line:83% align:start
What does this Yakuin tool
bag have that I don't?

00:16:43.571 --> 00:16:46.139 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, height and luck,
but that's it!

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:48.308 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ugh. I guess that's enough.

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:51.411 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is this an unrequited love
thing? Those stories rule!

00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:54.616 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] Okay boss,
time to drink some water.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.451 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's decided!

00:16:57.585 --> 00:16:59.152 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll be spending
the night at my house!

00:16:59.286 --> 00:17:00.922 position:27% line:83% align:start
And don't worry,
you can use the bed.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.657 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? No, you should
take your bed,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.992 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll be fine on the floor.

00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:06.126 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
No way, you're the guest. Wait!

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can just open up
the living room couch

00:17:08.596 --> 00:17:09.631 position:27% line:89% align:start
and sleep there!

00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:12.466 position:30% line:83% align:start
Like, us both?
Floor's fine, trust me.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.101 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] We can take
a bath together, too!

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:15.235 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MEI coughing]

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.905 position:19% line:89% align:start
Mei? Don't croak on me!

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.641 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MEI] I'm good. It just
went down the wrong pipe.

00:17:19.774 --> 00:17:21.141 position:35% line:89% align:start
No worries.

00:17:21.275 --> 00:17:22.810 position:21% line:83% align:start
Phew. The only problem
about going to my place

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:24.812 position:16% line:83% align:start
is that I can't check out
your old pictures!

00:17:24.946 --> 00:17:26.346 position:10% line:89% align:start
You still have those, right?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.582 position:10% line:89% align:start
Like the one from when we won

00:17:27.715 --> 00:17:29.349 position:30% line:83% align:start
that tournament
in middle school!

00:17:29.483 --> 00:17:32.085 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those aren't up anymore,
just some pics of family.

00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:33.688 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Aw, too bad.

00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:36.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
Do you have any old pictures?
I'd like to see 'em.

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:37.692 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Yeah, a couple.

00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:40.060 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MEI gasps] You've gotta
show me baby Shiori.

00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:43.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Fine. If I don't die
of embarrassment first.

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:47.001 position:16% line:83% align:start
To be honest, most of my
pics are me of and Jiro.

00:17:47.134 --> 00:17:50.572 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Ugh... Big shocker.

00:17:53.975 --> 00:17:55.242 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Huh? Oh, jeez.

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.612 position:30% line:83% align:start
My mom says she
needs me immediately.

00:17:57.745 --> 00:17:59.246 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've gotta run to
my parent's house.

00:17:59.379 --> 00:18:00.748 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Aw...

00:18:00.882 --> 00:18:04.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry! We can have our
sleepover another time.

00:18:04.384 --> 00:18:05.553 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Riddle me this.

00:18:05.687 --> 00:18:07.254 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why am I eating
with the same fool

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
whose fool face I see every day?

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:11.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
I don't know, you're
the one who invited me.

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.093 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
My loving wife kicked me out

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:15.128 position:5% line:89% align:start
and told me to find food myself.

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:17.031 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's conspiring
against me as we speak.

00:18:17.164 --> 00:18:19.634 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] But I thought things were
going okay between you two.

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:22.102 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, we're certainly
not as comfy cozy

00:18:22.235 --> 00:18:23.738 position:5% line:89% align:start
as the lovebirds at 13th place.

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:24.806 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Oh, great...

00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:26.106 position:5% line:89% align:start
And about that story you told--

00:18:26.239 --> 00:18:27.809 position:16% line:83% align:start
how do you "accidentally
kiss" someone?

00:18:27.942 --> 00:18:30.945 position:27% line:83% align:start
As far as I know,
we're not in a harem anime.

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
I don't know. Jeez.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.449 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yo, bro, so, it's almost summer,
you know!

00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:38.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't want a fake wife,
I want a girlfriend!

00:18:38.285 --> 00:18:39.621 position:13% line:89% align:start
Can a young Kamo find love

00:18:39.754 --> 00:18:41.355 position:30% line:83% align:start
in the world of
three dimensions?

00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:42.824 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, love is just a want.

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:45.026 position:21% line:83% align:start
Escaping the tyranny
of virginity is a need!

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:47.095 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] The more you need it, the
less you're gonna get it, man.

00:18:47.227 --> 00:18:50.665 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Silence, class traitor!
We were bros in suffering,

00:18:50.798 --> 00:18:52.734 position:13% line:83% align:start
but you've betrayed me and
crossed to the other side!

00:18:52.867 --> 00:18:55.202 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Are you drunk or just insane?

00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:57.471 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey? Hey. What're you doing?

00:18:57.605 --> 00:19:01.776 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just prepping to cancel out any
luck-based lewd escapades.

00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:02.910 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:13.487 position:13% line:83% align:start
Quit it brain! I don't want
to think about the--

00:19:23.531 --> 00:19:25.733 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not afraid to use
my lips to overwrite

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:26.834 position:16% line:89% align:start
your previous save data.

00:19:26.968 --> 00:19:28.670 position:33% line:83% align:start
That wouldn't
overwrite save data!

00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:30.505 position:10% line:83% align:start
That would crash the system,
you moron!

00:19:30.638 --> 00:19:33.608 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then just call it "accidental."

00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:38.211 position:27% line:89% align:start
Get off me! Huh?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.286 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:19:46.988 --> 00:19:47.889 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KAMO groaning]

00:19:48.022 --> 00:19:49.590 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Keep the change!

00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:54.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Signs that you're down
bad. You read "Chef's Kiss

00:19:54.862 --> 00:19:57.431 position:19% line:83% align:start
Marinated Maguro Bowl"
as "Kiss Bowl."

00:19:57.565 --> 00:19:58.833 position:44% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Shiori!

00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:00.601 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jiro?

00:20:00.735 --> 00:20:02.235 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] You've got it all wrong!
I promise it wasn't like that!

00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:05.272 position:27% line:89% align:start
Huh? You mean...

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:09.177 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't want you to
misunderstand anything.

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:11.344 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess you could
call it an accident.

00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:14.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I knew that much.
It's really okay.

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:16.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not bothered by
it in the slightest.

00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:19.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh good. I don't know how,
but I pissed

00:20:19.654 --> 00:20:21.522 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kamo off and he went
creep mode on me.

00:20:21.656 --> 00:20:24.158 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hm? What does Kamo
have to do with this?

00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:25.693 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh? That's who I was in the

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:27.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
weird position with
in the restaurant.

00:20:27.695 --> 00:20:30.131 position:10% line:83% align:start
You were in a weird position
in a restaurant?

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:31.231 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:32.834 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:34.736 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Huh.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.138 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oopsie daises,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:38.606 position:7% line:83% align:start
it appears as if we're talking
about two different things!

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
What a hilarious
and honest mistake!

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.944 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please forget all
that has happened!

00:20:44.712 --> 00:20:45.980 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Whoa. That looks heavy.

00:20:46.114 --> 00:20:48.549 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] It is. I bought
way too much stuff.

00:20:48.683 --> 00:20:51.451 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can help you. Uh, if
you don't mind, of course.

00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:54.321 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? Are you sure you want to?

00:20:54.454 --> 00:20:56.256 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah.

00:20:59.093 --> 00:21:00.695 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
If Shiori and I were married,

00:21:00.828 --> 00:21:02.530 position:13% line:89% align:start
it would be just like this.

00:21:02.663 --> 00:21:06.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
C'mon Jiro, there's no way
she's having those thoughts.

00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:08.236 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's sorta funny, isn't it?

00:21:08.368 --> 00:21:09.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is how it'd be
if we were marr--

00:21:10.004 --> 00:21:11.471 position:41% line:83% align:start
--Huh?
--Inside thought, oops!

00:21:11.606 --> 00:21:12.874 position:16% line:89% align:start
Come on, you can tell me.

00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:15.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, no, it was silly.
Thanks a bunch for

00:21:15.743 --> 00:21:19.881 position:19% line:83% align:start
carrying this with me,
Jiro. You're sweet.

00:21:20.014 --> 00:21:22.884 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh... About what happened
at the nurse's...

00:21:23.017 --> 00:21:26.353 position:19% line:83% align:start
I feel terrible! It was
totally my bad. I'm sorry.

00:21:26.486 --> 00:21:31.092 position:7% line:83% align:start
No! I need you to listen to me!
Please don't apologize.

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:32.126 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh...

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.661 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Please don't.

00:21:33.795 --> 00:21:39.734 position:19% line:83% align:start
'Cause, uh... I wanted
you to teach me how.

00:21:41.035 --> 00:21:46.107 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] And I actually
learned a lot from it.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.310 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah. So, now I know,
what a kiss feels like.

00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:51.612 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
It's all okay.

00:21:51.746 --> 00:21:54.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
It wasn't that I
didn't want you to.

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:57.919 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, uh... Thanks, Jiro.

00:21:58.052 --> 00:22:01.122 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She's saying all this
to me, but at the same time,

00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:04.926 position:19% line:83% align:start
she doesn't want to be
anything more than friends?

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.098 position:30% line:89% align:start
[CAT screeches]

00:22:11.232 --> 00:22:16.737 position:7% line:83% align:start
Heh... One toasty evening, eh?
We should head home!

00:22:17.437 --> 00:22:19.874 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Let's head home. C'mon, Jiro!

00:22:20.007 --> 00:22:22.643 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Pretty soon, it'll be summer.

00:22:22.777 --> 00:22:27.014 position:13% line:83% align:start
The third summer, in fact,
since Shiori came back.

00:23:58.339 --> 00:24:00.408 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm begging you, Kamo. Kiss me.

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:01.742 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
I must be dreaming!

00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:03.945 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh, his first kiss is
gonna be with me.

00:24:04.078 --> 00:24:04.912 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right, Daddy?

00:24:05.046 --> 00:24:06.714 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Oh, I am in to that.

00:24:06.847 --> 00:24:07.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
--Butt out, you hooker!
--You're the one that needs

00:24:07.848 --> 00:24:09.016 position:19% line:89% align:start
to butt out, Miss Virg!

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.318 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Wait one sec. Yes. Omigosh. Yes!

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI, AKARI]
Mwah!

00:24:11.886 --> 00:24:14.322 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Why did I wake up
before the spicy part?

00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:15.656 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI, SHIORI]

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.857 position:38% line:83% align:start
