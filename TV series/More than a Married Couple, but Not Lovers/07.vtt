So, bro? What went
down with the wife?

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:16.416 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh?! What do you mean?

00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:17.919 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've been pulling
evasive maneuvers

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:19.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
to this very spot
left and right.

00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.122 position:13% line:83% align:start
I figured you were evading
the ol' ball and chain.

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.958 position:21% line:89% align:start
No. We're just fine.

[KAMO]
Hm...?

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.329 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I mean, Akari's certainly
acting like we are.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.231 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, I know how to
take out this mofo.

Sleeping Cleavage?!

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.739 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
No! It's Sweeping Cleaver!

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:39.941 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sweeping Cleaver, you perv!

[SHIORI]
Uhh...

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oops, I might've bit off more
than a small Shiori can chew.

That's a ton of junk.
We'll help.

Ayo!

Oh my gosh, you guys saved me!

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.487 position:19% line:89% align:start
Thank you both so much!

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:56.390 position:10% line:83% align:start
No sweat, girl. Muscle mommy

Hey, you're helping too, skank.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.426 position:21% line:83% align:start
But for real, I can't
believe somebody

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.461 position:24% line:83% align:start
would dump all this
crap on one person.

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:05.132 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I wasn't super busy,
so I might've kinda volunteered.

Nice guys finish last, homie.

Yo, Slouchy! C'mere.

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.773 position:30% line:89% align:start
She means you.

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:13.240 position:30% line:89% align:start
She means you!

--[JIRO] That's still you!

your way to Notre Dame?

This is just great.

Could two hunchbacks really be
of service to you fine females?

00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.527 position:19% line:83% align:start
Duh, of course you can!
We're relying on you, man!

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.097 position:7% line:83% align:start

Takin' out the trash!

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.000 position:13% line:89% align:start
I devote my life to trash!

I seriously worry
for his future.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:42.770 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's that?

00:01:42.904 --> 00:01:44.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kick your ass into freakin'
gear, Mister Akari.

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:45.707 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.508 position:30% line:83% align:start
Okay gang, how
should we split up?

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:49.276 position:27% line:83% align:start
The two of us can
get three bags,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.713 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll get one, and Glasses
McGee will get two.

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:53.313 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.148 position:13% line:83% align:start
Dope. I should be able to
handle the two over there.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:58.452 position:5% line:83% align:start
That just leaves the big one for
Slouchy and Sakurazaka to grab.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:04.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
Uh, can I be with you, Takimiya?
That might be best.

What's up? Got the runs?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.067 position:10% line:83% align:start
You locked and loaded or have
you blasted your britches?

Heart not colon.

Eh?

Totes my b, who would
wanna pair up with a dude

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
for nasty trash duty?
You can be with me, Sis.

Uh?

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.545 position:21% line:89% align:start
Okay. Thanks a bunch.

Uh? Huh...?

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.668 position:19% line:83% align:start
My question is a longy,
so you can fire first.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:49.403 position:7% line:83% align:start
Not to be a major downer, but
mine isn't, like, light convo,

00:02:49.537 --> 00:02:50.805 position:24% line:89% align:start
you feel me? So...

00:02:50.938 --> 00:02:52.172 position:30% line:83% align:start
Bet my boobs my
question's way heavier.

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.075 position:10% line:89% align:start
As if, I'm serious for real.

Sup?

Shoot straight.

00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:08.388 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've gotta tell us what's
going on with Yakuin.

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:11.224 position:19% line:83% align:start
You avoid talking about
him like the plague.

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:15.195 position:7% line:83% align:start
But not cause you hate him. You
feel someway about him, yeah?

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.432 position:7% line:89% align:start
For real? Well, I... I mean...

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:19.734 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Worse than I thought.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.803 position:30% line:83% align:start
She's not even
denying it anymore.

C'mon girl. Besties,
yeah? Talk to us.

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
It hurts to see you on
the struggle bus like this.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.276 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's address the
Minami sitch first.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.179 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just seeing his name
on the class roster

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.213 position:7% line:89% align:start
used to make you totally flip.

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:37.118 position:21% line:83% align:start
Used to, but now he's
hitting it off with Sakurazaka.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:40.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like, I'm not trying to
get in the way of all that.

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.923 position:24% line:89% align:start
In the way of what?

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:44.726 position:5% line:83% align:start
Please, everybody's just trying
to look good for the practical.

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.094 position:38% line:89% align:start
Whatevs.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.228 position:7% line:83% align:start
Also, please don't think we're
trying to steer you away

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:49.897 position:10% line:89% align:start
from virgy-wirgy, you got me?

00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:51.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
We just don't want you
to get swept up

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
in the mood of this
practical jazz.

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:56.003 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeah, like, who knows,
Yakuin might've acted

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:58.806 position:13% line:83% align:start
the same way regardless of
who he was paired up with.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.843 position:21% line:83% align:start
Give it some thought
before you dive in.

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:05.546 position:10% line:83% align:start
He'd act the same regardless.
You're right.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.649 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Akari! Get hype right meow!

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:11.052 position:16% line:83% align:start
There're literally zero
reasons to be sad, yeah?

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:13.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
Tenjin and virgy are far from
the only fish in the sea.

00:04:13.988 --> 00:04:17.825 position:19% line:83% align:start
[laughs] No doy, you've
got a point about that!

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.461 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Deuces! I'll see you soon!

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:24.766 position:19% line:89% align:start
We'll see you soon, ho!

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:28.136 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yo, virgy-wirgy and Sakurazaka,
the two of them

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.571 position:19% line:83% align:start
aren't like officially
dating or anything are they?

00:04:30.705 --> 00:04:32.874 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know, but something
definitely went down

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:34.474 position:33% line:89% align:start
between them.

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.443 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't think Akari's noticed
Sakurazaka likes him.

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:38.146 position:24% line:83% align:start
And like, what are
we supposed to say

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.982 position:7% line:83% align:start
if she decides she really wants
to date that virgin dweeb?

00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:42.449 position:16% line:89% align:start
Easy, we'd say congrats.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.317 position:19% line:83% align:start
If she likes him, she
shouldn't abandon ship

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.686 position:5% line:89% align:start
just cause there's another girl.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.255 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whatever she does,
I hope she does it

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:49.891 position:7% line:89% align:start
with her own feelings in mind.

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:52.160 position:19% line:83% align:start
When she's not worried
about everybody else,

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.895 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wonder how she really feels.

00:04:54.028 --> 00:04:55.362 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Same.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.764 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] What she needs is
a big, decisive moment

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:58.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
that makes her realize
her true feelings.

00:04:58.533 --> 00:04:59.867 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wish we could
help her find that.

00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:02.770 position:21% line:83% align:start

be something.

[AKARI]
Dumb dumb, it's way too loose!

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:43.104 position:13% line:89% align:start
It should be so tight that

00:06:43.237 --> 00:06:44.805 position:24% line:83% align:start
you can only fit a
finger under the bow.

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, man up and pull it as
hard as you can, dweeb.

00:06:47.341 --> 00:06:49.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
Yeah, real easy for you to say.

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:53.648 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a virg.

00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.082 position:30% line:83% align:start
What does that
have to do with this?

I don't care, and I
just don't get why you

00:06:57.385 --> 00:06:58.953 position:5% line:89% align:start
felt the need to wear a yukata.

00:06:59.086 --> 00:07:01.421 position:19% line:83% align:start
Duh. Minami's gonna be
there and I'm not gonna

00:07:01.555 --> 00:07:03.423 position:21% line:83% align:start
pull up looking the
same as I always do.

[JIRO grumbles]
Even if he's there,

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:07.628 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'd be lucky to see him
for more than a second.

00:07:07.762 --> 00:07:11.032 position:13% line:83% align:start
Precisely why chicks never
get a second to chill.

00:07:11.165 --> 00:07:13.134 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] All she ever does
around me is chill.

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:15.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
Probably because she
doesn't see me as a real man.

00:07:16.003 --> 00:07:18.406 position:16% line:83% align:start
If she did, she wouldn't
be so exposed around me,

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:20.107 position:27% line:83% align:start
like with the bra
and panty crap.

00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:22.510 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I untied this bow,
I'd get a face full of booty.

00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:23.844 position:19% line:89% align:start
Does she realize that?

00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:25.413 position:41% line:83% align:start

Look and tell me which is cuter.

[AKARI]
Why the weirdness, weirdo?

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:29.817 position:16% line:89% align:start
What? No weirdness here.

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.419 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then why won't you
look me in the eye?

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:32.720 position:10% line:89% align:start
No comment on that one, pal.

00:07:32.853 --> 00:07:34.288 position:10% line:89% align:start
Quit goofing around and help!

My love life depends on
this fit, dude! Next step.

Which one do you dig?
And you can't say all of them.

00:07:41.662 --> 00:07:44.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? I don't know
about stuff like this.

00:07:44.632 --> 00:07:46.334 position:7% line:89% align:start
Maybe this ribbon-looking one?

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.837 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? That's so babyish!
Anything but that please!

00:07:49.971 --> 00:07:51.439 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why'd you even ask me, then?

00:07:51.572 --> 00:07:53.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Forgot you have
the taste of a 12-year-old.

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.009 position:13% line:89% align:start
Minami likes mature stuff.

00:07:55.142 --> 00:07:57.044 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo! Found the winner.
This, please!

00:07:57.178 --> 00:07:59.847 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Yes, my liege,
your wish is my command.

00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:01.282 position:13% line:89% align:start
Why am I doing this again?

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:03.317 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? Baby jealous?

00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:04.986 position:21% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Not at all!

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
Gag me with a spoon.
You're such a brat, dude.

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:09.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, we'll see who's jealous
when you're watching

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.726 position:24% line:83% align:start
the fireworks alone
from your window.

00:08:11.859 --> 00:08:13.194 position:27% line:83% align:start
And while you're
polishing your V-card,

00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.196 position:21% line:83% align:start
Minami and I will be
getting in the mood.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:16.864 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now tie me.

00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:19.533 position:13% line:83% align:start

lonely, don't bother calling.

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:22.670 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll be busy with
Minami, like, obvi.

00:08:23.704 --> 00:08:25.873 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm the brat?

00:08:26.907 --> 00:08:29.276 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah, I'm pretty sure that I'm
past the hardest part now.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.579 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that's left is to tuck
in the end pieces.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:32.947 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll turn it around to
your front, so you--

[AKARI]
Nah, you finish it off.

What's so confusing, dude?

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.020 position:27% line:89% align:start
[sighs] Nothing.

00:08:39.153 --> 00:08:40.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
Suck in your stomach
so I can get under there.

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:44.592 position:27% line:83% align:start
Wow, never tell a

You know what the big whoop is!

This fabric is so thin
I can feel everything.

it feels like it could snap.

Damn it! Am I the only
one affected by this?

True that.

00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.296 position:7% line:89% align:start
to get us extra dessert still?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.199 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hells yeah. Let's find
those tools. Wait right here.

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:14.201 position:38% line:89% align:start
No rush!

00:12:17.204 --> 00:12:19.608 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I wore this outfit
for Minami to see me in.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.343 position:13% line:83% align:start
Plus, I spent literal years
doing my hair and makeup

00:12:22.476 --> 00:12:26.113 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I could look as
good as possible.

00:12:26.247 --> 00:12:28.782 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought this was
gonna be my big chance.

00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:30.317 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like, if I saw him
in this context,

00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:32.486 position:30% line:83% align:start
something would
magically change.

00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.055 position:13% line:83% align:start
So why the heck did I feel
relieved when they told us

00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:38.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
he couldn't make it?
I don't understand.

00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:40.861 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm in love with Minami.

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:44.331 position:16% line:83% align:start
I wanna be able to chase
after him like I used to.

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:49.136 position:13% line:83% align:start
And Jiro's wife can just be
a role that I play sometimes.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.708 position:24% line:83% align:start
I, like, say that's
what I want, but...

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:55.376 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's still scary to me.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.311 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even though I'm neither
of their number one,

00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:00.948 position:7% line:83% align:start
if I take action, things will
never be just like this again.

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.584 position:24% line:89% align:start
[TERAFUNE gasping]

00:13:02.717 --> 00:13:05.352 position:19% line:83% align:start
Come on, man. Just give
this crap up already.

00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:06.721 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:08.355 position:24% line:83% align:start
I remember Watanabe
saying that she likes fish.

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:10.759 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure she meant
she likes fish to eat.

00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:14.596 position:7% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Get a grip! I can't get
all discouraged just yet.

00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:17.498 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've gotta do my best for my
friends that are cheering me on!

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:20.000 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ooo, thought! I'll stop
by his work in my fit!

00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:21.302 position:38% line:83% align:start
[WOMAN A]
Get a look at that guy!

00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:23.404 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A]
Whoa, he's crazy hot!

00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:24.972 position:24% line:89% align:start
Like a movie star!

00:13:25.105 --> 00:13:27.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
[STUDENT A] It's too bad
he's here with his girlfriend.

00:13:28.976 --> 00:13:32.980 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Minami? But he
said he was working.

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:35.416 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasping]

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:39.086 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
Ugh. Maybe I should bow out

00:13:39.219 --> 00:13:43.591 position:19% line:83% align:start
now while I still have
my dignity and all.

00:13:43.725 --> 00:13:46.927 position:10% line:89% align:start
But why? I've tried so hard.

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:56.103 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
We're back, Akari!

00:13:56.236 --> 00:13:58.339 position:21% line:83% align:start
And we come bearing
baby castella cakes!

00:13:58.472 --> 00:14:01.241 position:27% line:83% align:start
Babes? You look a
little depressed mode.

00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.579 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, oh. Sorry, it's just that...

00:14:04.713 --> 00:14:06.980 position:21% line:83% align:start
That I think I tied
my yukata too tight.

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.482 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
That's ouch.

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:10.050 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] You should
go home if you feel sicky.

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:12.554 position:30% line:83% align:start
Minami ditched,
so can you! Yeah?

00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:14.021 position:27% line:89% align:start
But don't freak.

00:14:14.154 --> 00:14:16.357 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll find you another
chance with the dude!

00:14:18.359 --> 00:14:20.394 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Thank you.

00:14:21.529 --> 00:14:23.997 position:5% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] That crowd was intense.
It might've been smart

00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:26.266 position:19% line:83% align:start
to go down a different
street. Sorry.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.969 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's okay. The speediest
route to the grocery store

00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:32.172 position:16% line:83% align:start
is almost always through
the shrine grounds.

00:14:32.306 --> 00:14:34.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
We'll have to split up,
my work is that way.

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:36.578 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen, I'm sorry you're
doing the shopping alone.

00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:39.413 position:13% line:83% align:start
How about I go and pick up
the heavier stuff tomorrow?

00:14:39.547 --> 00:14:42.216 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't worry! You can
leave it all to me!

00:14:42.349 --> 00:14:44.084 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're a married couple,
ya goober!

00:14:44.218 --> 00:14:46.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
We have to do our best
to help each other out!

00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:48.122 position:19% line:89% align:start
Plus, work is important

00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:50.190 position:21% line:83% align:start
and could affect your
college references.

00:14:50.324 --> 00:14:53.994 position:5% line:89% align:start
Thanks a lot. You're saving me.

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:56.497 position:21% line:89% align:start
Be super-duper safe!

00:14:59.734 --> 00:15:02.069 position:13% line:89% align:start
That festival looked nice.

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:05.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder if Jiro was
somewhere in the crowd.

00:15:11.245 --> 00:15:14.314 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO sneezes]
Oh, jeez.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.418 position:16% line:89% align:start
Did the hot bath murk me?

00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:19.219 position:27% line:83% align:start
And while you're
polishing your V-card,

00:15:19.353 --> 00:15:21.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
Minami and I will
be getting in mood.

00:15:21.656 --> 00:15:24.592 position:5% line:83% align:start
According to her, they should be
getting in the mood about now.

00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:26.293 position:38% line:89% align:start
Congrats.

00:15:26.427 --> 00:15:29.096 position:16% line:83% align:start
But what exactly are they
getting in the mood for?

00:15:29.229 --> 00:15:32.232 position:27% line:89% align:start
A kiss? Maybe...

00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:39.206 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Holding each other,
hugging, kissing...

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
We do all that, but if
she does it with him,

00:15:42.109 --> 00:15:43.578 position:5% line:89% align:start
will that mean they're a couple?

00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:46.346 position:10% line:83% align:start
Then what would happen to me?
If we change partners,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.651 position:19% line:83% align:start
I won't be her husband
anymore. Making me...

00:15:49.784 --> 00:15:50.984 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just a friend?

00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:55.222 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, I'd be back
to classmate status.

00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.424 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been spending
all my days with her,

00:15:57.559 --> 00:16:00.227 position:16% line:83% align:start
but without the practical
keeping us together,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.130 position:13% line:89% align:start
will we have anything left?

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:05.299 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even if she and Tenjin
do that stuff,

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:09.571 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll always know she
did it with me first.

[gasps] No, bad brain!

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:50.958 position:27% line:89% align:start
[AKARI grunting]

00:19:57.932 --> 00:19:59.567 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Almost done back there?

00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:02.570 position:16% line:83% align:start
They're gonna run out of
fireworks soon, butterfingers.

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:03.838 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hush, I'm trying.

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:06.607 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just my second
time doing this.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.285 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uh-oh.

00:20:18.418 --> 00:20:20.688 position:21% line:89% align:start
You boob! Bungle it?

00:20:20.822 --> 00:20:22.190 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, this is hard.

00:20:22.322 --> 00:20:24.192 position:10% line:83% align:start
I don't get what the hell I'm
supposed to after this step.

00:20:24.324 --> 00:20:27.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I think there's a
video version, too. Gimme.

00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:29.530 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:20:32.332 --> 00:20:34.669 position:33% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasps]

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:36.571 position:35% line:89% align:start
Close call!

00:20:36.704 --> 00:20:41.341 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO gasps]
This... This was... Oops.

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:44.612 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh. Dude, what's that about?

00:20:45.613 --> 00:20:50.017 position:13% line:83% align:start
Hey, Jiro? Stay right there
and say my name.

00:20:50.151 --> 00:20:51.318 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:53.121 position:5% line:89% align:start
Please, just call me by my name.

00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:57.024 position:19% line:83% align:start
If you do, I think I'll
be able to keep trying.

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:03.330 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Sometimes my confidence
starts to bottom out.

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:06.968 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari.

00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:11.271 position:33% line:83% align:start
[AKARI gasps]
Again.

00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:13.141 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:14.642 position:41% line:89% align:start
Again.

00:21:14.776 --> 00:21:17.111 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akari.

00:21:17.245 --> 00:21:19.479 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.852 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whoa, cute! That's sick.

00:21:24.986 --> 00:21:28.756 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, dang. Is it supposed
to be a peach or something?

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.058 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
You nerd. It's a heart, duh!

00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:32.160 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's just upside down.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:35.863 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Oh. Ohhh!

00:21:35.997 --> 00:21:38.166 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Jiro?

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:39.801 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:43.171 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm grateful you didn't ask
about what happened today.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.639 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, we're married.

00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:47.575 position:30% line:83% align:start
We should help,
no questions asked.

00:21:47.708 --> 00:21:51.846 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] The reason I didn't ask
is cause I didn't want to know.

00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:55.283 position:21% line:83% align:start
Of course I'm rooting
for her and Tenjin. So...

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.084 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo, another upside-down one.

00:21:57.218 --> 00:21:59.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] When I heard her
crying through the phone...

00:21:59.654 --> 00:22:02.256 position:24% line:83% align:start
When I realized she
had come home...

00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:05.259 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why did I feel relieved?

00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:07.995 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Maybe this one didn't
work out the way you wanted,

00:22:08.129 --> 00:22:10.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
but there'll be more
firework festivals this year

00:22:10.363 --> 00:22:11.398 position:16% line:89% align:start
and the year after that.

00:22:11.532 --> 00:22:14.302 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Those'll be better.

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:15.736 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
When you think of marriage,

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.005 position:30% line:83% align:start
you think of a
lifetime together.

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:19.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
But not for us.

00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:21.142 position:16% line:83% align:start
When this festival rolls
around next year,

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:23.544 position:10% line:89% align:start
we won't be married anymore.

00:22:23.678 --> 00:22:26.514 position:24% line:83% align:start
This firework show
from the balcony

00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:29.517 position:24% line:83% align:start
might be our first
and last together.

00:23:59.573 --> 00:24:02.843 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] FYI, I had a yukata
ready in case I was feeling it.

00:24:02.977 --> 00:24:04.645 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] That looks, like,
surprisingly good!

00:24:04.779 --> 00:24:06.247 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
What's so "surprising" about it?

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.182 position:24% line:83% align:start
[WAJIRO, TAKESHITA]
Hot! Breath takingly hot!

00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:10.084 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] Snooze you lose!
We're wrapping this shiz!

00:24:10.217 --> 00:24:13.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Uh, really quick--
I actually had one, too!

00:24:14.088 --> 00:24:16.123 position:24% line:83% align:start
[WAJIRO, TAKESHITA]
Cute! Heart meltingly cute!

00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:19.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Next time, "An
Entreaty, but No Reassurance."
