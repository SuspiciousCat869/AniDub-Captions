00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.478 position:33% line:89% align:start
[yelps] Hey!

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:48.115 position:7% line:83% align:start
I tripped and I couldn't stop!
So sorry, ma'am!

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.484 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh? It's you.

Hi, Watanabe.

00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:56.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Akari Watanabe
and Shiori Sakurazaka.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.458 position:16% line:83% align:start
I never dreamed these two
girls would be mixed up

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:01.529 position:5% line:89% align:start
into the life of a dork like me.

00:01:01.663 --> 00:01:03.798 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, are you here to
get some luck before

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:06.233 position:21% line:83% align:start
we're all paired for
the marriage practical?

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.705 position:30% line:89% align:start
As if! No way!

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.994 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
The marriage practical.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.796 position:10% line:83% align:start
The part of our high school's
curriculum that I can

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.932 position:16% line:83% align:start
only describe as bananas
is about to begin.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.435 position:13% line:83% align:start
Without any of our say, the
school pairs us up, and makes us

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.871 position:24% line:83% align:start
live together as a
mock-married couple.

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.608 position:16% line:83% align:start
Everyone in our class is
freaking out about it,

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:50.210 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I've got more important
things to worry about.

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.179 position:30% line:89% align:start
[KAMO exhales]

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:53.948 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm so freaking close!

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:57.719 position:13% line:83% align:start
Just a little bit more and
the princess is all mine!

00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:02.890 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do it for Chloris.
Do it for Chloris!

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:04.592 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hell yeah!

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.294 position:21% line:83% align:start
Enjoy that 2-D bliss
while you can, Jiro.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.129 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish I could still
get my rocks off

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.798 position:16% line:89% align:start
to a pixelated princess.

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.265 position:19% line:89% align:start
My rocks are on, dude,

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.369 position:19% line:83% align:start
and the crappy art lets
the mind roam free!

00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:17.572 position:30% line:83% align:start
Look, <i>RotoSaGa</i>
seven just dropped

00:02:17.705 --> 00:02:19.907 position:16% line:83% align:start
and all of its double D's
are in 3-D now!

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:24.746 position:10% line:83% align:start
Observe! Princess Chloris in
her multi-dimensional glory!

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.313 position:21% line:89% align:start
Woopty freakin' doo.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:30.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
I just prefer the simple
innocence of her OG model.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:33.353 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] I guess it does make it
easier to imagine things.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:37.457 position:16% line:83% align:start
But you can't romance the
heroine in the OG, right?

00:02:37.592 --> 00:02:38.793 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo, dweebs.

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.928 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO, KAMO]
Uh?

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.597 position:13% line:89% align:start
We're trying to walk here.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.866 position:33% line:83% align:start
[KAMO, JIRO]
Uhh...!

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.240 position:13% line:83% align:start
Anything for the beautiful,
sweet-smelling goddess,

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.710 position:30% line:83% align:start
Akari Watanabe!
She's a dime piece!

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.378 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hate girls who talk like
they're on a teen drama!

00:02:58.513 --> 00:03:00.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
And ones that show
too much skin.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:01.716 position:27% line:83% align:start
How she treats us
cements my desire

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.318 position:19% line:83% align:start
to stay as far away as
possible from her type.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.965 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, Minami! How'd it go?

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.299 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Minami Tenjin.

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.002 position:30% line:83% align:start
One look at him
and I'm blinded by

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:22.704 position:27% line:83% align:start
his otherworldly
coolness factor!

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:25.405 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't swing that way, but
this guy is the total package.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.941 position:10% line:89% align:start
For shadow dwellers like us,

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:30.044 position:13% line:83% align:start
there's nothing viler than
a Chad-type tool bag.

00:03:30.178 --> 00:03:31.411 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, but they should

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:33.548 position:21% line:83% align:start
because you're, like,
the coolest ever.

00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:35.850 position:5% line:89% align:start
You think so? You're too sweet.

00:03:35.983 --> 00:03:38.351 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:39.854 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well, the chick ain't subtle.

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.056 position:19% line:83% align:start
From harpy to heartache
in seconds.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.658 position:30% line:89% align:start
[bell ringing]

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:48.730 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aw, crap. I'll be back for
you soon, Sweet Chloris.

00:03:50.832 --> 00:03:52.166 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Hi, Jiro. Time for
the practical! Feeling okay?

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.574 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:02.543 position:5% line:83% align:start
To be honest, I'm super nervous.
You nervous, too?

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.947 position:5% line:83% align:start
Big-time, I'm not what you would
call good with the ladies.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.816 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] The one girl I can talk
to without being weird is her,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.952 position:24% line:83% align:start
my childhood friend
and first love.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:13.788 position:10% line:83% align:start
They say your first one never
works out, and that's okay

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.923 position:21% line:83% align:start
if things between us
can stay how they are.

00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:17.825 position:13% line:89% align:start
I get shy around strangers.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.729 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope that I'm paired
with a friend!

00:04:21.863 --> 00:04:23.931 position:35% line:89% align:start
Cool, cool.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:27.835 position:10% line:83% align:start
Class, I need your attention.
Eyes up front, please.

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.270 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'll each receive a partner
and a training dorm.

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:33.007 position:7% line:83% align:start
This is where you'll live for
the duration of the practical.

00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:35.943 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's fully furnished, complete
with a kitchen and sensors

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:39.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
that will be used to monitor
you and your partner.

00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:41.314 position:13% line:83% align:start
Installed at vantage points
around the living spaces,

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:45.352 position:7% line:83% align:start
these sensors will continuously
keep track of your lifestyle.

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.555 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, the most important
part of the lesson.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.757 position:35% line:83% align:start
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:51.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
Each space has two
locked bedrooms.

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:54.195 position:24% line:83% align:start
Your fingerprint is
your key. This ensures

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.832 position:7% line:83% align:start
that only the room's designated
occupant may enter.

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:06.107 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TEACHER A] We need you to keep
yourselves under control.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.909 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
She for real?

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:11.212 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then what's the point
of all this crap?

00:05:11.344 --> 00:05:12.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh? There's five classes,

00:05:13.014 --> 00:05:17.718 position:5% line:83% align:start
each with 15 guys and 15 girls.
So, I've got a 1-in-75 chance.

00:05:17.852 --> 00:05:20.453 position:30% line:83% align:start
I hope that I'm
paired with a friend!

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:22.056 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Who am I kidding?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.991 position:13% line:83% align:start
She has tons of friends and
she's not shy around me

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:26.060 position:24% line:83% align:start
because she doesn't
think of me as a man.

00:05:26.194 --> 00:05:29.462 position:5% line:89% align:start
But if we were to get paired...

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:31.032 position:21% line:89% align:start
Let's check my luck!

00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:33.668 position:10% line:83% align:start
If the hero defeats the boss
without taking damage,

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.837 position:24% line:83% align:start
he unlocks the side
route to the heroine.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.572 position:24% line:83% align:start
From there, you go
straight through

00:05:37.705 --> 00:05:39.740 position:10% line:89% align:start
the dungeon and sometimes...

00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:42.375 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.546 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Lancia? She's the worst!

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.182 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, maybe that was
my bad luck for the day!

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:50.918 position:5% line:89% align:start
Only good news from here on out!

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:55.756 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why?! I'm stuck with you?

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.093 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is not ideal,
Miss, believe me!

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.427 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI growls]

00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.163 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please release me, madam.
Calm yourself.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:05.266 position:13% line:83% align:start
Chill with the formal act,
robo-nerd, it's creepy.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:06.567 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry 'bout that.

00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:08.368 position:27% line:83% align:start
If you let me go,
I'll be cool, swear.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.271 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, like you're
capable of that!

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.173 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Let go.

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:15.910 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI sighs] The school set
me up with a barf bag, yuck!

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:18.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
How'd they come up with
this crap pairing anyway?

00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:21.381 position:21% line:89% align:start
It makes zero sense.

00:06:22.617 --> 00:06:24.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm a victim of this, too.

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:26.320 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
What?!

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:28.022 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh! Not that you
aren't just lovely,

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:30.524 position:10% line:83% align:start
but I kinda had someone else
I wanted to be partnered with.

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:32.560 position:27% line:83% align:start
And, based on how
you were acting today,

00:06:32.693 --> 00:06:34.394 position:5% line:89% align:start
you have someone you want, too.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:36.898 position:7% line:89% align:start
You wanted Sakurazuka, no doy.

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:39.100 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:43.436 position:24% line:83% align:start
Dude, it's obvious!
Sucks for you, though.

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.840 position:24% line:83% align:start
She'd never go out
with your lame ass.

00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:48.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Like you'd know
anything about her!

00:06:48.142 --> 00:06:50.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's sorta plain,
but she's a cutie.

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:51.846 position:16% line:89% align:start
How does it feel knowing

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:54.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
another man's all
up on yo crush?

00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:59.921 position:27% line:83% align:start
Promise you'll be
gentle with me.

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:01.055 position:35% line:89% align:start
Stop that!

00:07:01.188 --> 00:07:02.356 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm not gonna let you
disrespect her

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.025 position:10% line:89% align:start
with your wild speculations!

00:07:04.158 --> 00:07:05.092 position:38% line:89% align:start
Buzzkill.

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:07.528 position:10% line:89% align:start
At least I'm not an asshole.

00:07:07.662 --> 00:07:09.196 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.432 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] That's bogus! If we
don't get along, we lose points?

Cut the shit! You need to get
along with me! Right now!

00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:22.543 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's impossible when
you act like such a brat!

00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:24.378 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's up our points
and get to A-rank

00:07:24.512 --> 00:07:27.014 position:27% line:83% align:start
so we change our
pairing A-S-A-P!

00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:30.952 position:13% line:83% align:start
[groans] You say that like
it's an actual option!

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:33.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
Rad, I got paired with
the rare idiot nerd

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:34.555 position:16% line:89% align:start
who didn't pay attention!

00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:36.857 position:27% line:89% align:start

There's no way Minami will
be anything below A-rank!

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:52.472 position:16% line:83% align:start
So let's climb on up and
switch partners, yeah?

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.710 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wait a second, but
wouldn't that mean...

00:07:55.843 --> 00:07:58.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
Just think about it!
Not a chance!

00:07:58.512 --> 00:07:59.914 position:38% line:89% align:start
Why not?

then we would have to...

make it out of that alive.

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:17.865 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Is the idea of
being close to a woman

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
too much for you, virg?
So what if we have to get tight?

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:24.171 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's gonna be totally worth it!

you're okay with doing stuff

I'll take one strawberry milk.

Huh?!

00:08:53.434 --> 00:08:56.170 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're married now, so you'll
buy it for me, won't you?

00:08:56.303 --> 00:08:57.938 position:38% line:89% align:start
I guess.

00:09:05.479 --> 00:09:07.982 position:16% line:83% align:start

00:14:23.497 --> 00:14:26.166 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Do you mean Jiro?
Don't worry about that!

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
He's just a childhood
friend of mine.

00:14:28.202 --> 00:14:31.271 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're so cool, Minami,
I had almost forgotten him!

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:34.308 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] The imagination
is a cruel place.

00:14:40.648 --> 00:14:44.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
In retrospect, I definitely
should've packed that umbrella.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:46.554 position:19% line:83% align:start
Don't worry, I'll share
mine with you, broski.

00:14:46.688 --> 00:14:49.624 position:27% line:83% align:start
Awesome, I get to
snuggle up next to you?

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.225 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're lucky!

00:14:51.358 --> 00:14:54.328 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Jeez. When did our lives
get so damn boring?

00:14:54.461 --> 00:14:56.930 position:5% line:83% align:start
Life's great, my free gacha pull
this morning landed me

00:14:57.064 --> 00:14:59.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
a rare character in
a swimsuit skin.

00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.802 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Good thing I covered your shift!

00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.336 position:27% line:89% align:start
Buy me a reward.

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:05.439 position:19% line:83% align:start
No way, I just started
saving up for Marin today.

00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:06.674 position:27% line:89% align:start
Marin simp alert.

00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:08.643 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Put some respect
on my girl's name!

00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:10.277 position:35% line:89% align:start
Lady Marin.

00:15:10.411 --> 00:15:13.347 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thank you. In the story for
this event, my sweet Marin

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.650 position:27% line:83% align:start
cooks the player
delicious omurice!

00:15:15.784 --> 00:15:17.918 position:19% line:83% align:start
The tasty, egg-y nectar
filled my love meter

00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:19.386 position:13% line:89% align:start
all the way up to the brim!

00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:22.156 position:21% line:83% align:start
"But Kamo, you can't
really taste a JPEG!"

00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:25.058 position:7% line:83% align:start
An image is meant to be savored
with the occipital lobe!

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:26.260 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
You're insane.

00:15:26.393 --> 00:15:28.328 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
That part back there.

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:31.331 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Scram, dorks! You're in my way!

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:33.967 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm getting home late today.

00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:35.503 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's fine, but why?

00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:38.038 position:19% line:83% align:start
We're going to karaoke
and Minami is coming with!

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:39.808 position:21% line:89% align:start
So, he can sing, too?

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.276 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Deuces!

00:15:42.409 --> 00:15:45.580 position:13% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Hold on just a sec!

00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:47.047 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:48.516 position:21% line:83% align:start
I remember now, teach
wants to talk with us

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.218 position:19% line:83% align:start
in the faculty office.
It's about the practical.

00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:54.923 position:24% line:83% align:start
Okay, I guess that
should take priority.

00:15:55.055 --> 00:15:56.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
Psych! You handle it, dweeb!

00:15:56.558 --> 00:15:58.593 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey!

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:00.093 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is she for real?

00:16:00.227 --> 00:16:02.329 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just when I thought my
day couldn't get worse.

00:16:02.463 --> 00:16:04.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you not see how
crazy lucky you are?

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:06.333 position:30% line:83% align:start
You've got your
cinnamon roll crush

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:08.903 position:13% line:83% align:start
and your hot, gyaru wife--
you're double-fisting females!

00:16:09.036 --> 00:16:10.572 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're a harem anime protag!

00:16:10.705 --> 00:16:11.840 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, shut up.

00:16:11.972 --> 00:16:13.173 position:24% line:83% align:start
I bet I could live
off of Akari's

00:16:13.307 --> 00:16:15.242 position:24% line:83% align:start
beautifully exhaled
carbon dioxide.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:18.479 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've been feeling exactly
like carbon dioxide lately.

00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:19.647 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh...?

00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:21.649 position:21% line:83% align:start
And that blond haired
jock is oxygen.

00:16:21.783 --> 00:16:24.218 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TEACHER A]
It's absolutely necessary.

00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:26.420 position:21% line:83% align:start
This practical isn't
about having fun

00:16:26.554 --> 00:16:29.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
or making a new friend.
It's very important coursework.

00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
Your score has remained
at a steady zero for an

00:16:32.527 --> 00:16:36.296 position:7% line:83% align:start
entire week now. At this rate,
you won't be able to graduate.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.833 position:10% line:83% align:start
Talk with Watanabe and figure
out how you can become

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:41.268 position:16% line:89% align:start
a happily married couple.

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:44.639 position:13% line:89% align:start
You sound like a total pro!

00:16:44.772 --> 00:16:46.875 position:10% line:83% align:start
And your English is awesome,
I'm impressed.

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:48.543 position:27% line:89% align:start
I appreciate it.

00:16:48.676 --> 00:16:51.245 position:7% line:83% align:start
Unfortunately, that was one of
the few songs I'm good at.

00:16:51.378 --> 00:16:53.180 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you know what song
you'd like to do?

00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:55.382 position:24% line:83% align:start
Of course, I know,
Kana Higashino!

00:16:55.517 --> 00:16:59.353 position:21% line:83% align:start
Here. I've heard you
sing and you're great.

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:04.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
Think so? Then I'm gonna
do my best just for you.

00:17:06.326 --> 00:17:09.396 position:24% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Is it gonna
rain forever?

00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:11.733 position:10% line:83% align:start
Try being a happy couple when
the one you're supposed to be

00:17:11.866 --> 00:17:15.737 position:10% line:83% align:start
happy with is running around
with her real love interest.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:21.208 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Hey. I'm a little
worn out from singing

00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.477 position:19% line:83% align:start
Can we take a breather
in the next room?

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:27.715 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO screams]
Curse you, brain!

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.484 position:24% line:83% align:start
Get me outta here.
I'll suffer through the rain,

00:17:30.618 --> 00:17:32.720 position:16% line:83% align:start
grab a convenience store
dinner, and head home.

00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:34.789 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Hi, there!
You're up here pretty late.

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:38.458 position:7% line:83% align:start
Huh? Shio-- I mean, Sakurazaka?
What are you doing here?

00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:42.195 position:13% line:83% align:start
We had a committee meeting
today. May I sit by you?

00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:44.264 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah, sure.

00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:49.202 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's no end in sight,
is there?

00:17:49.336 --> 00:17:51.204 position:35% line:89% align:start
Think not.

00:17:51.338 --> 00:17:53.206 position:21% line:89% align:start
I forgot my umbrella.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.241 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO screams]

00:17:54.374 --> 00:17:56.176 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Ah, I see.

00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:57.745 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI yelps]

00:17:57.879 --> 00:18:02.617 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.688 position:13% line:83% align:start
Uh? Oops, my bad. I thought
that was a real bug.

00:18:06.821 --> 00:18:08.723 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Fair, it's a very
lifelike doodle.

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:12.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
[sighs] When I first got
here, there was a huge one.

00:18:12.894 --> 00:18:15.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought it was back
to get me. Sorry.

00:18:15.362 --> 00:18:17.632 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's all good,
just surprised me.

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:20.500 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm? Wait, then maybe...

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.038 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BUG A]
Gonna get ya!

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:26.440 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey, so, uh, Sakurazaka?

00:18:26.574 --> 00:18:31.144 position:24% line:83% align:start
Jiro. You know me.
Use my first name.

00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:37.051 position:13% line:83% align:start
Call me "Shiori." Just like
you did when we were young.

00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:38.720 position:30% line:89% align:start
Would you mind?

00:18:38.853 --> 00:18:41.455 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] What is this? Is she
trying to tell me something?

00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:43.357 position:5% line:89% align:start
I have no idea what's going on,

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.225 position:24% line:83% align:start
but if there's one
thing I'm sure of,

00:18:45.359 --> 00:18:48.161 position:10% line:89% align:start
this is the time to be brave!

00:18:48.295 --> 00:18:49.931 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sh-Sh-Shio--

00:18:50.064 --> 00:18:50.965 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Shiori.

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.000 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.134 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Minami?

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:59.473 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're done? I thought you'd
be out late doing karaoke.

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:01.042 position:19% line:89% align:start
Brought your umbrella.

00:19:01.174 --> 00:19:03.243 position:13% line:83% align:start
It occurred to me I saw it
sitting in the entryway

00:19:03.377 --> 00:19:05.680 position:5% line:89% align:start
this morning. It's pretty small.

00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:07.115 position:16% line:89% align:start
You two should go ahead!

00:19:07.247 --> 00:19:09.282 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm not very busy tonight,
so I think I'll wait it out

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:10.685 position:13% line:89% align:start
a little while longer here.

00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:12.152 position:38% line:89% align:start
You sure?

00:19:12.285 --> 00:19:16.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
Absolutely, I'll be A-okay.
See ya, Sakurazaka. Be safe.

00:19:17.091 --> 00:19:18.593 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:41.248 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo.

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:46.486 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm saving you.
Look happy, please.

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:50.758 position:27% line:89% align:start
Ugh, this sucks!

00:19:50.892 --> 00:19:53.761 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sharing an umbrella is supposed
to be flirty and romantic.

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:56.064 position:13% line:83% align:start
You screwed up the perfect
opportunity to run off

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
with your crush and have
some lovey-dovey alone time.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.902 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you weren't such a
complete and utter weenie,

00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:04.271 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd be sharing an umbrella
with Minami right now.

00:20:04.404 --> 00:20:05.873 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:20:06.007 --> 00:20:07.542 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're gonna have
to grow a pair quick

00:20:07.675 --> 00:20:09.877 position:10% line:89% align:start
if you wanna date this girl.

00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:13.246 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.186 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, sir! Giving up
is not allowed!

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:21.823 position:13% line:83% align:start
For the both of our sakes,
you're gonna give it your all.

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:22.690 position:38% line:89% align:start
Got that?

00:20:22.824 --> 00:20:23.791 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yesh.

00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:26.293 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who's a good boy?

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:28.896 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Jeez. I get the feeling
that was her way

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.800 position:21% line:83% align:start
of trying to help me.
I really am a weenie.

00:20:32.934 --> 00:20:34.902 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Rain's chilling out.

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.236 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Looks like it.

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:38.606 position:21% line:83% align:start
Not to be complain-y,
but I'm starving.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.308 position:10% line:89% align:start
Same. Convenience store food?

00:20:41.441 --> 00:20:42.944 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Mm-mm.

00:20:45.046 --> 00:20:46.848 position:27% line:89% align:start
I've got a plan.

00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:52.486 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Dinner's ready!

[JIRO]
Non-JPEG omurice!

00:20:55.422 --> 00:20:56.791 position:27% line:89% align:start
Looks yummy, huh?

00:20:56.924 --> 00:20:58.893 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh... uh-huh!

00:20:59.827 --> 00:21:03.898 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh! Hold on! You've gotta
take the ketchup slow.

00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:07.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
It gets messy when it
spurts out too quick.

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:11.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, not there! Be a
little more gentle.

00:21:11.706 --> 00:21:14.307 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes, that's so good...

00:21:18.613 --> 00:21:23.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
Every bite is filled
with my love. Eat up.

00:21:23.483 --> 00:21:27.688 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks! Of course I will!

00:21:27.822 --> 00:21:29.023 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yum!

00:21:29.157 --> 00:21:33.194 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm, like, a rockstar chef.
I'll chow down, too.

00:21:33.326 --> 00:21:34.629 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Wait!

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:40.034 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just say "ah."

00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:45.006 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yeah, no, I'm not gonna do that.

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:46.808 position:19% line:89% align:start
Dude! Go along with it!

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:49.644 position:33% line:83% align:start
This is super
embarrassing for me!

00:21:49.777 --> 00:21:53.014 position:13% line:89% align:start
Jeez, I'm done being sexy.

00:21:58.119 --> 00:22:01.155 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's seriously good--
I told you I rock!

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:02.890 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:09.362 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:22:09.496 --> 00:22:10.898 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasps]

00:22:12.432 --> 00:22:17.071 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] That's sick. Lady Marin
made you curry omurice?

00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:18.405 position:21% line:89% align:start
Thanks for the save.

00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:19.707 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
The save from what?

00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:21.976 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
What was that? Why is my...

00:22:22.109 --> 00:22:25.445 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Why is my heart
pounding so fast?

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.782 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
I don't understand.

00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:00.775 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Every night before taking
a bath, Watanabe emerges

00:24:00.908 --> 00:24:02.777 position:19% line:83% align:start
from her room with an
even sexier expression

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.512 position:7% line:89% align:start
than usual. Why could that be?

00:24:04.645 --> 00:24:06.414 position:5% line:89% align:start
The mystery was quickly solved.

00:24:06.547 --> 00:24:08.416 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasping]

00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:10.117 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Th-That voice.

00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:12.320 position:5% line:83% align:start
My body moved of its own accord,
despite knowing it was wrong.

00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:13.955 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course that's it!

00:24:14.088 --> 00:24:15.690 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm embarrassed at myself
for imagining differently!

00:24:15.823 --> 00:24:17.725 position:35% line:83% align:start
Next time:
"Imagined, but Not Real."
