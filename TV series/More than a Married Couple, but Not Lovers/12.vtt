[AKARI]
Sorry to bug you guys again,

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:24.692 position:16% line:89% align:start
but remember when I asked

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:26.460 position:33% line:83% align:start
for your help
with that one dude?

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:29.062 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I've got a new target.
This feels last ditch,

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.466 position:27% line:83% align:start
but ya girl needs
some divine intervention.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.171 position:19% line:83% align:start
Mama can read this man
like a book and the book says

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.009 position:24% line:83% align:start
they were deep into
some hanky panky.

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:43.210 position:33% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasps]

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:51.653 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll do all that I can.
Please, just help a sister out.

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:59.126 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI sighs]

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:00.562 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good grief.

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.766 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can't go an hour
without remembering it.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.637 position:10% line:83% align:start
If Akari really isn't special
to you, show me something.

00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:15.977 position:13% line:83% align:start
A side of you so hidden...
even your wife doesn't know.

00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:19.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why'd my dumb-dumb brain
make my dumb-dumb mouth say

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.815 position:19% line:89% align:start
such dumb-dumb things?

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:24.819 position:21% line:83% align:start
At least it happened
at the end of the trip.

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:28.556 position:30% line:83% align:start
That was a lot,
and I kinda panicked.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.359 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was super special.
You were my first.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:35.162 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, uh, was that
the same for you?

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:39.232 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh! Well, I mean...

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:44.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Our kiss in the
nurse's office wasn't his first.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.608 position:30% line:89% align:start
So that's that.

00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:51.746 position:19% line:83% align:start
I tried not to see it,
but now it's so obvious.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.219 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jiro's wife always has
been and will be Akari.

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:01.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
Does that mean I'm just
his childhood friend

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:02.724 position:27% line:89% align:start
and nothing more?

00:02:02.857 --> 00:02:07.160 position:33% line:83% align:start
If so, yucky!
I'm basically a homewrecker.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:19.007 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Jiro? What did
that kiss mean to you?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.778 position:16% line:89% align:start
Cause for me... Oh, Jiro.

00:03:56.704 --> 00:04:00.508 position:27% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Aw, crap.
What am I supposed to do?

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.980 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh? The hell?

00:04:06.114 --> 00:04:07.849 position:44% line:89% align:start
Why?

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:12.587 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I am so sorry.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.756 position:30% line:83% align:start
As we grow up,
being your childhood friend

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.992 position:24% line:83% align:start
won't be enough to
keep me in your life.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:29.237 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Aren't games supposed to
be an escape from real life?

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.706 position:21% line:83% align:start
I still can't believe
she kissed me.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.941 position:24% line:83% align:start
And she didn't even
seem to hate it.

00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:37.578 position:21% line:83% align:start
For me, it kinda felt
like that was my one shot.

00:04:37.712 --> 00:04:39.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like if that moment
had been perfect,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.218 position:16% line:83% align:start
this love I've held onto
might become something real.

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:46.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess it wasn't
perfect though.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
Beside a barrage of apologies,

00:04:48.022 --> 00:04:50.625 position:27% line:83% align:start
"let's head back"
was all she had to say.

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:54.662 position:10% line:83% align:start
What did it mean to her, and
why kiss me just to apologize

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:58.266 position:13% line:83% align:start
for it? You're supposed to
go on dates and fall in love

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
and confess and
hold hands and then

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:04.672 position:19% line:83% align:start
kiss when you're ready.
Why did we jump straight to it?

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:06.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
And what was she talking
about when she said

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:09.544 position:19% line:83% align:start
being childhood friends
wouldn't be enough?

00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:12.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
What am I supposed
to do after all that?

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
If I had more points
in the lady skill tree,

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:17.384 position:10% line:89% align:start
I could probably answer that.

00:05:17.518 --> 00:05:19.352 position:13% line:89% align:start
But, big shocker, I don't.

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.255 position:21% line:83% align:start
Guess I'll just have
to bury my sorrows

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:23.591 position:19% line:89% align:start
in junk food and manga.

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:35.536 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I didn't realize this was out.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.737 position:27% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, ma'am!

00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:38.272 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oops, sorry!

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:41.341 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH yell]

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:44.477 position:10% line:89% align:start
Ha, what a coinky-dink. Hiya.

00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:46.514 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hello. A coincidence indeed.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.850 position:19% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Why so formal?

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:52.186 position:10% line:83% align:start
[laughs nervously] Sorry, you
caught me off guard is all.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.624 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, why are you here?
Do you really read manga?

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:59.359 position:13% line:83% align:start
Not me. I went to the shop
next door for some notebooks

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:03.164 position:5% line:83% align:start
and my little brother asked me
to grab this for him. So, yeah.

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:04.732 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, Kenta's into this stuff?

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:07.568 position:24% line:83% align:start
Mm-hm. He wants to
see you, by the way.

00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:09.537 position:21% line:89% align:start
Uh? He remembers me?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.974 position:13% line:83% align:start
Mm-hm! He's always curious
whenever I bring you up.

00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:15.743 position:16% line:83% align:start
You really talk about me
to your family?

00:06:15.877 --> 00:06:18.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Uh-oh, looks
like this is the last copy.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:20.081 position:30% line:89% align:start
Here. Take it.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:23.217 position:16% line:83% align:start
Uh, thanks but I'm good.
It's all yours!

00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.520 position:10% line:83% align:start
Please, I have more shopping
to do after this anyway.

00:06:26.654 --> 00:06:28.589 position:24% line:89% align:start
Come on, for Kenta.

00:06:28.723 --> 00:06:31.292 position:10% line:89% align:start
There it is. That sweet side.

00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:33.361 position:24% line:89% align:start
Uh? Say something?

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:37.765 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Mm-mm!
Not a peep. Thank you.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:41.068 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] What a relief!
I'm lucky I ran into her.

00:06:41.202 --> 00:06:44.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now the term won't
start on an awkward foot.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.774 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, this sucks.

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:49.510 position:7% line:83% align:start
It looks like a passing shower,
but I'm with ya.

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:53.114 position:16% line:89% align:start
Happy summer break to us.

00:06:53.247 --> 00:06:55.516 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess you didn't
bring an umbrella?

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.120 position:19% line:83% align:start
Nope. Maybe I can buy
a cheap one somewhere.

00:07:02.323 --> 00:07:05.126 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] What am I supposed
to say, "see you next term?"

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:07.295 position:13% line:89% align:start
Jeez. Get it together, me.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:10.798 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is an actual chance to
solidify some future plans.

00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:17.738 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or maybe not. Think,
brain, think! Words!

00:07:17.872 --> 00:07:19.774 position:44% line:89% align:start
Um...

00:07:19.907 --> 00:07:22.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, wanna come to
my place for a bit?

00:07:22.777 --> 00:07:24.345 position:27% line:89% align:start
My training dorm?

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:25.980 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.882 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] It's super close to
here, and I'd like to talk

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:30.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
a little more, at least
until the rain lets up,

00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:31.619 position:16% line:89% align:start
if that's cool with you.

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:33.120 position:33% line:89% align:start
Are you sure?

00:07:33.254 --> 00:07:35.890 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I don't have anything
super fun prepared,

00:07:36.023 --> 00:07:38.759 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it's a good chance to talk.

00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:42.563 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you have the time,
please come.

00:07:42.697 --> 00:07:46.767 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I have plenty
of time today.

00:07:49.637 --> 00:07:50.871 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Wait here for just a minute.

00:07:51.005 --> 00:07:53.874 position:30% line:83% align:start
Gotta make sure
it's nice and tidy.

[JIRO]
My hands are all sweaty.

00:07:57.812 --> 00:08:00.480 position:21% line:83% align:start
I hope I don't smell
like a locker room.

Uh...!

00:08:07.288 --> 00:08:11.359 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ha! What a weird joke.
Apologies for that.

Well, uh, please, come in!

Okay, that much I can do.

The school kept it simple.

My place is the same way!
Same stuff, too.

It kinda feels like I'm at home.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.517 position:19% line:89% align:start
May I sit next to you?

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.554 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh! Of course! It is your dorm.

That smells incredible.

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:53.801 position:33% line:89% align:start
Is it fancy?

00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:55.803 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
I mean, uh, I guess?

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.839 position:27% line:83% align:start
It wasn't exactly
super cheap or anything.

00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:03.310 position:10% line:83% align:start
Classy. That's cool! Just the
thing I'd expect from you!

00:09:04.145 --> 00:09:06.614 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Wait, he meant
the coffee not my perfume!

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.817 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm a stupid, stinky baby!

[JIRO laughs] The gods
smile upon ya boi today!

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:25.366 position:19% line:83% align:start
I haven't read a single
word of this manga

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:27.001 position:27% line:83% align:start
and I don't think
I'll be able to,

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:29.270 position:21% line:83% align:start
but who needs manga
at a time like this?

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:32.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
Her outfit is innocent and
sweet, yet still so attractive.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:36.143 position:13% line:83% align:start
Look at her perfect hands,
I wish I was that book.

00:09:36.277 --> 00:09:38.779 position:19% line:83% align:start
And how does she smell
so freakin' good?

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:40.948 position:24% line:83% align:start
She's tiny, except
where it counts.

00:09:41.082 --> 00:09:44.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
I could swim in those eyes.

Huh?!

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.756 position:19% line:83% align:start
What's up? Do I... have
something in my teeth?

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.091 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all!

00:09:50.224 --> 00:09:52.293 position:30% line:83% align:start
I was wondering
what you're reading.

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:53.694 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah, that makes sense.

00:09:53.828 --> 00:09:56.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's a novel called "Hello
Summer, Goodbye."

00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:58.866 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's super neat.
You can borrow it sometime.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.134 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Cool, thanks.

00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:02.436 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Excuse me for just a moment.

00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:04.371 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh, sure.

00:10:07.108 --> 00:10:09.944 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] When our eyes met,
my brain went to mush.

00:10:10.077 --> 00:10:14.715 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe I was too pushy
inviting him over here.

00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:17.485 position:33% line:83% align:start
Is he bored?
What if he wants to leave

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:20.721 position:27% line:83% align:start
but doesn't want
to hurt my feelings?

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:25.059 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did I mess up so bad
that he hates me?

00:10:25.192 --> 00:10:27.261 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Oh great, does she hate me?

00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:33.602 position:13% line:83% align:start
She must think I'm a weenie
who can't take the lead.

00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:36.003 position:5% line:89% align:start
But come on, cut me some slack!

00:10:36.137 --> 00:10:39.006 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm alone in a room
with the girl who kissed me!

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.176 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't think I'm a freak
for being a little freaked.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:49.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
Shiori has never been what
I'd call the assertive type.

00:10:49.518 --> 00:10:51.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
So, the fact that she kissed me?

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:54.523 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm allowed to be happy
about that, aren't I?

00:10:54.655 --> 00:10:56.190 position:19% line:83% align:start
It might be good to sit
down and talk through

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:57.925 position:30% line:83% align:start
what happened,
at least a little.

00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:59.628 position:41% line:83% align:start
--Jiro!
--Oh, yeah?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.864 position:30% line:83% align:start
--Look outside!
--Huh? No way!

00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:06.333 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
It's a double rainbow!

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.269 position:16% line:89% align:start
Whoa, that's so intense!

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.671 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've never seen
anything like it!

00:11:10.804 --> 00:11:15.676 position:35% line:83% align:start
How lovely!
Let's take a picture!

00:11:15.809 --> 00:11:18.279 position:30% line:83% align:start
Get in, I wanna
capture this memory!

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:19.847 position:21% line:89% align:start
If you want me to...

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.284 position:24% line:89% align:start
Smile! Here we go!

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:25.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
That turned out pretty!
Double rainbows

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.590 position:19% line:83% align:start
are supposed to bring
happy times, you know.

00:11:28.722 --> 00:11:30.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd like something
happy to happen.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.259 position:30% line:83% align:start
That's kind of
an awesome picture.

00:11:32.393 --> 00:11:33.394 position:16% line:89% align:start
Could you send it to me?

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:34.495 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course!

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:35.696 position:27% line:89% align:start
Cool, thank you.

00:11:35.829 --> 00:11:37.765 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's see...

00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:40.234 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Is this it?

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:43.638 position:24% line:83% align:start
The moment that we
take the next step?

00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:45.739 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, so-- Uh?

00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:48.042 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Check it out!
You're in this one, too!

00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:52.647 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll send it to ya.
Look at all our smiling faces!

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.549 position:13% line:89% align:start
I really love this picture.

00:11:54.683 --> 00:11:56.984 position:27% line:83% align:start
It captures what
good times we had.

00:11:57.117 --> 00:11:59.086 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh...

00:12:03.857 --> 00:12:05.159 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think I cut you off.

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:07.027 position:27% line:83% align:start
You were about to
say something, right?

00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:12.399 position:16% line:83% align:start
Huh? Uh... That's weird,
can't remember.

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:15.503 position:24% line:89% align:start
Jeez, what a trip.

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:17.271 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Mm-hm!

00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:22.142 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I tend to run from the
romance stuff because I just

00:12:22.276 --> 00:12:25.312 position:24% line:83% align:start
don't get it. Which
feeling is friendship?

00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:27.781 position:24% line:83% align:start
And which feeling
is something more?

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.450 position:21% line:89% align:start
They're my emotions,

00:12:29.584 --> 00:12:33.053 position:19% line:83% align:start
so why are they such a
freakin' puzzle to me?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.061 position:16% line:83% align:start
I had the chance, so why
the hell didn't I say anything?

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:45.199 position:16% line:83% align:start
Shiori has been my dream
forever, but for some reason...

00:12:45.332 --> 00:12:47.134 position:27% line:89% align:start
[phone vibrates]

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:48.637 position:41% line:83% align:start

Must be Kamo.

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:52.473 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sorry dude, I'm in no mood
to deal with your crazy.

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:57.579 position:24% line:83% align:start
Bro, what could you
possibly want? Akari?

00:12:57.712 --> 00:13:02.182 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, that's a surprise.
It's been like half a month.

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.119 position:38% line:83% align:start
[VOICE]
Ba-bump.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:07.021 position:7% line:89% align:start
Don't you "Ba-bump" me, heart!

00:13:07.154 --> 00:13:10.324 position:19% line:83% align:start
I bet she sent this to
everyone in her phone.

00:13:14.094 --> 00:13:16.130 position:7% line:89% align:start
Kill me! I freakin' hate this!

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:20.334 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why am I being such a weenie?
It's just Jiro!

00:13:29.143 --> 00:13:32.647 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Wha--?! She wants to hang
outside of the practical?

00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:34.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
She can't be for real!

00:13:34.148 --> 00:13:35.617 position:24% line:83% align:start
Points aren't even
being counted right now!

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.950 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is this a scheme?

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.419 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna fall face first
into a booby trap

00:13:38.553 --> 00:13:40.154 position:19% line:83% align:start
and not the good kind!
We're going somewhere

00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:41.889 position:7% line:89% align:start
that's not the grocery store?!

00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:45.192 position:10% line:83% align:start
What if she tries to make me
her weird sugar daddy, pay pig.

00:13:45.326 --> 00:13:48.730 position:7% line:83% align:start
Or worse! She's just teasing me
for the ten billionth time!

00:13:48.862 --> 00:13:51.432 position:7% line:89% align:start
That's it. That's gotta be it!

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:55.135 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
But if she's serious about this,

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:57.304 position:24% line:83% align:start
and is inviting me
out as her friend,

00:13:57.438 --> 00:13:59.273 position:27% line:83% align:start
it would be rude
to turn her down.

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:03.177 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do I go? I already
said I was bored.

Ten minutes early.

A white tee-shirt
was safe, right?

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.224 position:7% line:83% align:start
I hear the internet never lies.
Is she still getting ready?

00:14:17.358 --> 00:14:21.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
Or is she standing me up?
It's almost time...

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:24.799 position:35% line:83% align:start
Big shock.
She's nowhere to be seen.

00:14:24.932 --> 00:14:27.368 position:16% line:89% align:start
I knew this would happen.

you'd come at all.

Jeez, gimme a break!

Think about it,
we don't normally

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.298 position:24% line:83% align:start
do stuff like this
with just the two of us.

I couldn't really
see it happening.

I even told you it was a date.

Well, uh...

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:17.284 position:19% line:83% align:start

new and different.

you're into fits more like

have this kinda stuff on hand.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.423 position:10% line:89% align:start
Chug, dude! Drink that shiz!

00:16:29.557 --> 00:16:30.525 position:41% line:89% align:start
Tasty?

00:16:30.658 --> 00:16:32.326 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Delicious!

00:16:32.459 --> 00:16:34.729 position:24% line:83% align:start
For real? It's not
too bitter for you?

00:16:34.863 --> 00:16:37.431 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's a little bitter,
but it's still great.

00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:39.868 position:35% line:89% align:start
Lemme try!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.302 position:35% line:89% align:start
Aw. Gimme.

00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:44.004 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, fine.

00:16:45.974 --> 00:16:48.175 position:27% line:89% align:start
Bleh! Too bitter!

00:16:48.308 --> 00:16:51.713 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeesh, tough guy.
Yo, I know that face.

00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:53.848 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're thinking about how
that was an indirect kiss.

00:16:53.982 --> 00:16:55.783 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, er, uh, yes.

00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:58.820 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't. When you get
embarrassed, so do I,

00:16:58.953 --> 00:17:01.956 position:21% line:83% align:start
especially when it's
about junk like that.

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:07.294 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh? Wait a second,
has she always been like this?

00:17:07.427 --> 00:17:09.329 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
So freakin' cute!

00:17:09.463 --> 00:17:11.465 position:5% line:83% align:start
Just look at all of them, these
guys could form a small militia!

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.100 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I, like, need to touch!

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:16.336 position:21% line:83% align:start
He takes pats like a
dang pro! Good kitty!

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.606 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I've gotten used to
seeing her smile all cute

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
like this, but based on
my first impressions,

00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:23.477 position:5% line:89% align:start
I never would've seen it coming.

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:25.279 position:10% line:89% align:start
If we hadn't been paired up,

00:17:25.412 --> 00:17:27.849 position:19% line:83% align:start
I never would've known
this side of her.

00:17:27.982 --> 00:17:31.084 position:5% line:89% align:start
What a polite gentleman you are.

00:17:31.218 --> 00:17:33.721 position:13% line:89% align:start
Ah! He's so freakin' cute!

00:17:33.855 --> 00:17:35.890 position:19% line:83% align:start
You might've mentioned
that once or twice.

00:17:36.024 --> 00:17:38.158 position:5% line:89% align:start
No doy I have because it's true!

00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:39.627 position:27% line:83% align:start
Here! You should
give him some pets.

00:17:39.761 --> 00:17:42.730 position:41% line:83% align:start
--Okay.
--He's so soft. Right?

00:17:42.864 --> 00:17:43.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, for sure.

00:17:43.932 --> 00:17:46.266 position:44% line:89% align:start
Meow.

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.772 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Summer break is supposed
to be for playing games

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:52.840 position:21% line:89% align:start
and eating like crap.

00:17:52.974 --> 00:17:56.410 position:13% line:83% align:start
But a few normie days every
now and again can be fun.

00:17:56.544 --> 00:17:59.581 position:16% line:89% align:start
Really fun, it turns out.

00:18:00.548 --> 00:18:02.917 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just a sec. Lemme send that pic.

00:18:03.051 --> 00:18:04.586 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sure. Thank you.

00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:08.422 position:10% line:83% align:start
Aw! I'll send you this, too.
It's us with our new buddy.

00:18:08.556 --> 00:18:11.425 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Wha-- When the heck
was that taken?

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:14.394 position:16% line:83% align:start
Probs when that lady said
she was taking our picture.

00:18:14.529 --> 00:18:16.396 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dang, a photography ninja.

00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:21.468 position:10% line:83% align:start
That picture is kinda funny,
isn't it? It's our family photo.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.038 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:26.641 position:27% line:83% align:start
Look, the cat is
like our baby, see it?

00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:28.643 position:24% line:83% align:start
That would make you
the mom and me--

00:18:28.776 --> 00:18:33.180 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uh! I, uh, just meant it has
similar composition, so--

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:34.616 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm a creep!

00:18:34.749 --> 00:18:37.384 position:19% line:83% align:start
[laughs] I see it now,
that's hilar.

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:39.687 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh? She isn't
calling me a perv?

00:18:39.821 --> 00:18:42.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wish he could be our
little practical pet.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.592 position:24% line:89% align:start
For sure. Me, too.

00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:47.762 position:7% line:83% align:start
We'll just have to go and visit
him again. Date two, yo!

00:18:47.895 --> 00:18:49.764 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Is there no secret motive here?

00:18:49.897 --> 00:18:52.967 position:7% line:83% align:start
Did she actually plan all this
just to hang out with me?

00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:55.770 position:21% line:83% align:start
Up, right? Isn't that
where your ticket gate is?

00:18:55.903 --> 00:18:57.371 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah! You?

00:18:57.505 --> 00:18:59.373 position:21% line:89% align:start
Down. But it's fine.

00:18:59.507 --> 00:19:01.441 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sorry. You're off course.

00:19:01.576 --> 00:19:03.711 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Don't be. My course is close.

00:19:03.845 --> 00:19:05.847 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] This feels
sorta weird, doesn't it?

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.548 position:24% line:83% align:start
We usually go home
to the same place

00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:09.884 position:30% line:83% align:start
but now goodbye
really means goodbye,

00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:11.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
for a while at least.

00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:12.820 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah, weird.

00:19:12.954 --> 00:19:16.390 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I mean, that's how
it'll be for good soon, huh?

00:19:16.524 --> 00:19:20.460 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll be big lonely.
Ha! J-K-ing.

00:19:20.595 --> 00:19:23.064 position:19% line:83% align:start
I forgot to buy a charm
at the shrine!

00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:25.298 position:24% line:89% align:start
A charm? What kind?

00:19:25.432 --> 00:19:26.299 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, later!

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:29.604 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Hey! Wait, Akari!

00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:34.976 position:10% line:83% align:start
Slow the hell down, I'm sick
of chasing you! Come on!

00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:38.146 position:7% line:89% align:start
Oh, hi. What a happy surprise.

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:39.446 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Shiori?

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.783 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo, what's up, girly?
Look at you!

00:19:41.916 --> 00:19:45.753 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess you must've
been out shopping.

00:19:45.887 --> 00:19:46.988 position:30% line:89% align:start
You guys, too?

00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:48.723 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that's right!
I figured this nerd

00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:50.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
would be in desperate
need of some sunlight.

00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:53.928 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, I invited him to hit
all my fav places with me.

00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:56.463 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's fun. Headed home now?

00:19:56.597 --> 00:19:59.332 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Yup! I just need to
hit the shrine real quick.

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:02.335 position:24% line:89% align:start
Gotcha. Oh my gosh.

00:20:02.469 --> 00:20:04.539 position:16% line:83% align:start
Remember the time we ran
into each other there?

00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:06.206 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Oh, yeah.

00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:10.845 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, I was about to go
and pay my respects myself.

00:20:10.978 --> 00:20:12.446 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
Could I maybe come with you?
Race you there!

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.252 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh? What the--? Race?

00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:22.090 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're on. Full speed! Let's go!

00:20:22.222 --> 00:20:23.958 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:24.892 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hold, please.

00:20:25.026 --> 00:20:25.993 position:30% line:89% align:start
What? I, uh...

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:27.494 position:35% line:89% align:start
Mine, too?

00:20:27.628 --> 00:20:29.964 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm never gonna
understand women, am I?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.271 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ready?

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.340 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Go!

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:02.395 position:27% line:83% align:start
--[GIRL] Got it!
--[BOY] Here!

[SHIORI, AKARI panting]

[SHIORI]
Oh my gosh, you're super fast!

00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:52.880 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] You're pretty dang
speedy yourself!

00:21:53.014 --> 00:21:55.650 position:41% line:83% align:start
[WIFE]
Goodness. What's happened here?

00:21:55.783 --> 00:21:58.653 position:5% line:89% align:start
Is everything all right, ladies?

00:21:58.786 --> 00:22:00.822 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yes, sorry we
worried you, ma'am.

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:02.857 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just a little friendly
race, that's all.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.593 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is that so? You gave us
quite the scare.

00:22:05.726 --> 00:22:07.460 position:24% line:89% align:start
Right. Jiro, dear?

00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:09.831 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes indeed.

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:14.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Mm? Jiro?

00:22:14.569 --> 00:22:16.003 position:41% line:83% align:start
[WIFE]
Come, now.

00:22:16.137 --> 00:22:18.139 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you don't pay attention,
you'll trip and fall.

00:22:18.272 --> 00:22:19.439 position:38% line:83% align:start
[HUSBAND]
Jeez...

00:22:19.574 --> 00:22:20.473 position:41% line:83% align:start
[WIFE]
I won't carry you. Let's go.

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:22.543 position:13% line:89% align:start
Seems a lot like our Jiro.

00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:25.513 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Yeah, he really does.

00:22:29.283 --> 00:22:34.589 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO panting]

00:22:34.722 --> 00:22:38.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
Awesome, now I'm
confused and sweaty.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.394 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Put your whole heart into it!

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:43.531 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Will do!

00:22:46.767 --> 00:22:48.169 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Apparently,
this place has made

00:22:48.302 --> 00:22:53.975 position:10% line:83% align:start
all sorts of romantic wishes
come true. I wish...

00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:48.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
Thank ya, dude! But now
it's rockstar chef time.

00:23:48.195 --> 00:23:50.698 position:41% line:83% align:start

Cool. I'll get outta your way.

[JIRO] Actually, let me
help you with dinner!

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.008 position:24% line:89% align:start
This looks awesome!

00:24:01.142 --> 00:24:02.109 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, no doy.

00:24:02.243 --> 00:24:03.644 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Do I get a ketchup message?

00:24:03.778 --> 00:24:05.112 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yeah, that's like the best part!

00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:06.781 position:13% line:89% align:start
You do it! I'll guide you!

00:24:06.914 --> 00:24:08.215 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Ah? Oh, jeez.

00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:12.153 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Go like this,
some up here, and voila!

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:14.789 position:5% line:89% align:start
Omurice fit for a Jiro! [laughs]

Don't tease me.
