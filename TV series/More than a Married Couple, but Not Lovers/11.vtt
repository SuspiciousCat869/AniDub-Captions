[ALL snoring]

00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:16.985 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Not the best
sleep I've ever had.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.085 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you okay, dude?

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.989 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Well, a wee bit scared.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.389 position:44% line:89% align:start
Fair.

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:25.092 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] Akari!
Where were you, Miss Girl?

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] We thought
you got got or something!

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.198 position:10% line:83% align:start
I was stargazing on the beach
and dozed off, oopsie.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
A real free spirit, isn't she?

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:35.102 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:40.407 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Yakuin?

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:44.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, that's weird.
He was down there, too?

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:21.709 position:13% line:83% align:start
[yawns] Not the best sleep
in the history of sleeps.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.512 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO gasps]
Uh, good morning.

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:27.414 position:21% line:83% align:start
Morning! On your way
to brush your teeth?

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:30.051 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Guess you're
on your way back.

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.653 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Sheesh.

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:34.454 position:19% line:83% align:start
The Shiori pajama skin
hits harder than I thought.

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.625 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tenjin gets to see this
every day, huh? Lucky.

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.762 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey, uh, can I
ask you something?

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:42.195 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm?

00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:45.099 position:35% line:89% align:start
Never mind!

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.568 position:27% line:83% align:start
Let's kill it in
the kitchen later, okay?

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:48.836 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.376 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo!

00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:58.646 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hiya, hubs. Morning!

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.982 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey. Morning.

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:05.218 position:13% line:83% align:start
Spill, dude. What happened?
Why the gloom?

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.888 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
No gloom here.

00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:11.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] I get it,
somebody's embarrassed.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:13.961 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're remembering
last night, aren't you?

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:18.900 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO coughs]

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.002 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Groddy! Don't hack on wifey!

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:23.504 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI giggles]

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.310 position:41% line:89% align:start
Later.

00:03:30.444 --> 00:03:32.914 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo, last night can be
our little secret, yeah?

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:35.783 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Awesome.

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:38.886 position:19% line:83% align:start
She can hold that crap
over my head forever now.

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:42.724 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] All in all, it hasn't
been as awkward as I figured.

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:45.560 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm glad she just
laughed it off.

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:47.995 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I guess that was
her way of being

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.131 position:5% line:89% align:start
considerate towards my feelings.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:52.066 position:21% line:89% align:start
Get it together, me.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.335 position:24% line:89% align:start
[CROWD chattering]

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.739 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Oh, yeah.

00:03:57.872 --> 00:03:59.173 position:24% line:83% align:start
They're doing that
big game thing tonight.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:00.407 position:33% line:89% align:start
You playing?

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.375 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh, for sure!

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.611 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
It sounds a little clichÃ©,

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.246 position:13% line:89% align:start
some test of courage bull.

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.150 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't know it was
a courage thing!

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.085 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm not gonna make it out alive!

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.420 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa, take a breath!

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:17.058 position:5% line:83% align:start
We were on the beach last night,
and I heard these noises.

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.995 position:24% line:83% align:start
Scary, scary noises
like ghouls or something!

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.429 position:19% line:89% align:start
Must've been the wind.

00:04:22.563 --> 00:04:24.098 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you're right.

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:27.535 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm just worried whoever I'm
paired up with is gonna hate me.

00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:29.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, then I hope you're
paired up with me.

00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:31.572 position:5% line:89% align:start
Just think. I already know that

00:04:31.706 --> 00:04:33.574 position:30% line:83% align:start
you're prone to
scare pretty easy,

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:35.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
so it wouldn't bother me at all.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.745 position:7% line:89% align:start
Maybe we'd even have some fun.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.214 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yeah. That'd be kinda perfect.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.983 position:33% line:89% align:start
Thanks, Jiro.

00:04:42.116 --> 00:04:45.418 position:10% line:83% align:start
You have this sweet side that
comes out sometimes. I love it.

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.657 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:52.392 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:04:52.527 --> 00:04:55.428 position:33% line:83% align:start
Uh-oh! Sorry!
I meant that, uh...

00:04:55.563 --> 00:04:57.565 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] No! It's cool!
I know what you meant.

00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:00.601 position:19% line:83% align:start
I just don't get called
sweet very often.

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:03.470 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI giggles]
Sorry for blurting it out

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.072 position:21% line:89% align:start
like a crazy person!

00:05:05.206 --> 00:05:07.775 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welp, trash duty calls!

00:05:12.914 --> 00:05:15.049 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
She-- She said "love."

00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:17.518 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's not some new
slang thing, right?

00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:20.353 position:10% line:89% align:start
She loves my sweet side, huh?

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:21.556 position:38% line:89% align:start
Me, too!

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:23.891 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO screams]
Begone, creep!

00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:25.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, the gods will
give us a new map,

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.094 position:10% line:89% align:start
but they refuse to nerf you?

00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:29.396 position:19% line:83% align:start
What? How long have you
been standing there?

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.364 position:19% line:83% align:start
Since you coerced that
poor creature to partake

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:32.900 position:33% line:83% align:start
in a night in
the woods with you!

00:05:33.034 --> 00:05:35.468 position:27% line:83% align:start
Word choice, man!
You should've said hi!

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:37.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Pardon me,
sorry I didn't wanna interfere

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.407 position:13% line:83% align:start
with the copulation station
you're running in here.

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.709 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, thanks, I guess.

00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:45.146 position:5% line:89% align:start
Now, bro. Don't get a big dome.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.081 position:10% line:89% align:start
Sakurazaka does not love you!

00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:48.516 position:10% line:89% align:start
She is not in love with you!

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:51.118 position:30% line:83% align:start
She loves your
dainty personality!

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:53.087 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sweet doesn't mean dainty, dude.

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:58.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Might I interest
you in... the power?

00:05:59.026 --> 00:05:59.861 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:05:59.994 --> 00:06:01.929 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Oh, excuse me, bro-seph.

00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:05.132 position:5% line:83% align:start
So, you don't want the power to
pair up with Sakurazaka tonight?

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:08.435 position:24% line:83% align:start
Remember who you're
dealing with, bro-seidon.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.571 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm the guy-who-
hired-you's brother!

00:06:10.705 --> 00:06:12.273 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Big whoop!

00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:15.843 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tonight's test is the most
important part of the trip yet.

00:06:15.977 --> 00:06:19.680 position:27% line:83% align:start
Familiar with the
suspension bridge effect?

00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.481 position:30% line:83% align:start
This phenomenon
may or may not have

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:23.416 position:27% line:83% align:start
led past pairs in
a good direction.

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:24.752 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Ambiguous.

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:26.287 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Pairs are chosen by lottery.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.856 position:19% line:83% align:start
Thus, your meager lives
rest in the hands of fate.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.792 position:5% line:83% align:start
Though through an act as simple
as tampering with said lottery,

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:34.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
fate would crumble to
the boss's brother's will.

00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:35.963 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasps]

00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:40.134 position:21% line:83% align:start
All that for the low,
low cost of 30 gem pulls!

00:06:42.103 --> 00:06:45.172 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Gather round, people!
Time to draw lots!

00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:46.473 position:21% line:89% align:start
Cute, I got a heart!

00:06:46.607 --> 00:06:48.376 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mine is a bear?

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.412 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think mine's a yacht,
but this art is total cheeks.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.849 position:30% line:89% align:start
What'd you get?

00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:58.386 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
A sunflower. Jeez Louise.

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:00.087 position:16% line:89% align:start
Still freaking out a bit?

00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:02.890 position:24% line:83% align:start
A lot. My partner's
gonna hate me.

00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:04.191 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, they won't.

00:07:04.325 --> 00:07:07.494 position:19% line:83% align:start
Some of them are weird,
but those dudes are nice.

00:07:07.628 --> 00:07:09.897 position:16% line:89% align:start
Make them take the lead.

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:12.499 position:27% line:89% align:start
But I... [gasps]

00:07:12.633 --> 00:07:14.869 position:16% line:89% align:start
You'll be fine, promise.

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.177 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Shiori drew the sunflower.

00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:26.914 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] I am eternally in
your debt! Our sneaky spoils!

00:07:27.048 --> 00:07:29.283 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey, can I ask you something?

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:30.718 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
M'lady?

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:32.253 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MEI] You said this
scheme was to help out

00:07:32.386 --> 00:07:34.422 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shiori and Yakuin, right?

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:35.523 position:33% line:89% align:start
Anybody else?

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.059 position:7% line:89% align:start
Huh? No, that's it. What's up?

00:07:38.192 --> 00:07:40.895 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm a little confused
as to why you didn't just

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.863 position:21% line:83% align:start
mark two of the slips
and have them draw those.

00:07:42.997 --> 00:07:45.232 position:30% line:83% align:start
Did you need to
drag me into this?

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:46.634 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, 'bout that.

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:48.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure Jiro
would've been down,

00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:49.737 position:33% line:83% align:start
but I thought
Sakurazaka might object

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.672 position:7% line:89% align:start
to something so morally fuzzy.

00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:53.341 position:35% line:83% align:start
Worst case,
to avoid getting involved,

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:56.344 position:19% line:83% align:start
she would've picked an
unmarked slip intentionally,

00:07:56.476 --> 00:08:00.614 position:7% line:83% align:start
and I'm not tryna send my best
bro into existential crisis.

00:08:00.748 --> 00:08:02.550 position:38% line:83% align:start
This way,
your girl's in the dark,

00:08:02.683 --> 00:08:05.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
and she can have fun
without feeling bad.

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:07.021 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wow, dude.

00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.323 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] What? Have I made
an unforgivable oopsie?

00:08:09.457 --> 00:08:12.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
Nah. You're just a better
person than I thought.

00:08:12.393 --> 00:08:13.995 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Huh? Aw! You flatter me,

00:08:14.128 --> 00:08:16.063 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you're a pretty
amazeballs person yourself!

00:08:16.197 --> 00:08:18.532 position:35% line:83% align:start
Look at us,
homie helpers of the year!

00:08:18.666 --> 00:08:22.737 position:16% line:83% align:start
For real? Dang, must look
better than it is.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.940 position:5% line:83% align:start
Don't screw this up, dude, okay?
Good luck!

00:08:26.073 --> 00:08:27.842 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yes, ma'am!

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.779 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
That doofus. He's got it wrong.

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:33.047 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not a good person.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm using his "bro"
for my own gain.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.686 position:13% line:89% align:start
Purely selfish. I'm a jerk.

00:08:38.819 --> 00:08:42.723 position:21% line:83% align:start
[sighs] I was worried
that homie had caught on.

00:08:42.857 --> 00:08:44.291 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
One more thing,

00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:46.927 position:19% line:83% align:start
would it be possible to
put together another pair?

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:47.762 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.764 position:30% line:89% align:start
I was thinking.

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe you could pair
Akari and Tenjin.

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:53.868 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Huh? For why, though?

00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:57.171 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please. I can pay you double.

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:59.974 position:19% line:89% align:start
Bro, what's your deal?

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:03.010 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's struggling
just as much as I am.

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:04.478 position:10% line:89% align:start
We keep on telling each other

00:09:04.612 --> 00:09:07.281 position:24% line:83% align:start
that we're going to
try our hardest.

00:09:07.415 --> 00:09:10.818 position:5% line:89% align:start
If I get help, she should, too.

00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.688 position:7% line:89% align:start
I can't abandon her, you know?

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:17.491 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ugh. No way in hell
I can take 30 more gems

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:19.760 position:16% line:89% align:start
from that puppy dog face.

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:22.797 position:7% line:89% align:start
Blast you, my servant's heart!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO'S OLDER BROTHER]
Okay, kids!

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:28.335 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hope you like your pairings,
'cause you're stuck!

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:29.437 position:33% line:89% align:start
This is cool.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.338 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, super cool.

00:09:31.472 --> 00:09:33.040 position:24% line:89% align:start
Awesome. Let's go.

00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:34.442 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, let's.

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.977 position:19% line:83% align:start
Great. I seriously have
the worst luck in the world.

00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.647 position:16% line:83% align:start
Aw, adorable, so you have
a death wish, yeah?

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.248 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's me and glasses McGee!

00:09:41.382 --> 00:09:42.716 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ayo!

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.086 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess that makes me
the odd man out then.

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:47.922 position:13% line:83% align:start
Each group will start at a
different set of colored cones.

00:09:48.055 --> 00:09:51.692 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, report to your respective
starting points, pals!

00:09:51.826 --> 00:09:53.060 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
I think that's us over there.

00:09:53.194 --> 00:09:54.862 position:16% line:83% align:start
Ready to go check it out,
Watanabe?

00:09:54.995 --> 00:09:56.330 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yup!

00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:58.132 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO'S OLDER BROTHER]
Get a move on, cowboy!

00:09:58.265 --> 00:09:59.967 position:30% line:89% align:start
Giddy-up, now!

00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.804 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI screams]
I hate this!

00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:06.474 position:27% line:83% align:start
I wanna go back,
like, for reals!

00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:10.377 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] I never would've
guessed you scare so easily.

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:13.881 position:13% line:83% align:start
Does holding my hand help?
Or does that make it worse?

00:10:14.014 --> 00:10:16.484 position:5% line:89% align:start
It-- It helps for sure. Thanks.

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.285 position:5% line:89% align:start
Then let's just stay like this.

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:20.888 position:24% line:89% align:start
'Kay, cool with me.

00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:23.525 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] So, this is how
Minami's hand feels.

00:10:23.657 --> 00:10:26.794 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even though they're both dudes,
it feels different.

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:28.462 position:10% line:89% align:start
Jiro's hand is a bit more...

00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:29.797 position:27% line:89% align:start
Jiro's hand what?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.765 position:19% line:89% align:start
Head in the game, girl!

00:10:31.899 --> 00:10:33.167 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
Is something wrong?

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.570 position:33% line:83% align:start
[gasps] N-No,
everything's totally fine!

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:38.205 position:16% line:83% align:start
Just zoned out a little,
but I'm back!

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:39.608 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yo, the group chat!

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.078 position:16% line:83% align:start
Let's see how badly we're
smoking these suckers. Uh-oh.

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:48.382 position:5% line:89% align:start
Bummer news. I dropped my phone.

00:10:51.553 --> 00:10:53.053 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welcome back, beaches!

00:10:53.187 --> 00:10:56.790 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Oh my goodness, Mei!
I was so scared!

00:10:56.924 --> 00:10:58.627 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
You're okay. No ghosties here.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:01.095 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tell Mama. Any smoochies?

00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:02.730 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Shiori was way too terrified

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:04.331 position:19% line:89% align:start
for anything like that.

00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:06.834 position:13% line:83% align:start

to want your weenie, huh?

00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:09.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wait, where's Akari?
They taking a cat nap?

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.739 position:33% line:89% align:start
Beats me, yo.

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:13.941 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Akari isn't back yet?

00:11:14.074 --> 00:11:16.710 position:19% line:83% align:start
Weird cause she's with
the king of, like, all games.

00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.179 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'll try calling.

[SACHI] Don't get your
digits in their shiz!

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:22.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
Leave them alone.
They could be having freaky fun.

[NATSUMI]
Preach, sister!

00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.819 position:30% line:83% align:start
Out in the dark
with nobody around?

They basically have
no choice but to bang.

[AKARI] I see you
talking to other girls

00:11:29.256 --> 00:11:31.425 position:13% line:89% align:start
and it makes me feel weird.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:35.564 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She said all that crap
and now she's doing this?

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:38.699 position:5% line:89% align:start
Jeez, and why does it bother me?

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:41.135 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's not like it matters.

00:11:42.504 --> 00:11:43.971 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ew! Soggy!

00:11:44.104 --> 00:11:46.173 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, RIP my hair.

Oh, okay. I got it.

You turning back then?

00:11:54.114 --> 00:11:55.684 position:24% line:89% align:start
So, where are they?

00:11:57.686 --> 00:11:59.588 position:13% line:83% align:start
and while they were looking
for it, they got separated.

[ALL gasp]

00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.323 position:10% line:89% align:start
Do you think they'll be okay?

00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:03.824 position:41% line:89% align:start
Akari.

00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:07.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
This area is privately owned,
so they're not in any danger.

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:09.763 position:16% line:89% align:start
Head back to your rooms.

[NATSUMI] Not cool,
water pillows in the sky!

Make sure Akari gets home

00:12:19.674 --> 00:12:22.476 position:13% line:83% align:start

gonna get soaked. Let's hurry.

00:12:24.245 --> 00:12:25.614 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.147 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Shiori.

00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:29.416 position:24% line:83% align:start

[AKARI]
What am I supposed to do?

00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.360 position:16% line:83% align:start
No phone plus a freakin'
torrential downpour?

00:12:39.493 --> 00:12:41.428 position:30% line:83% align:start
This is, like,
worst case for real.

00:12:41.563 --> 00:12:43.831 position:16% line:83% align:start
I should probs head back
to the beach house.

the shots on directions,

00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:50.938 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I'm totally turned around.

I don't even know how to get

Sorry, guys. I suck.

Well, found the phone.

Let's wait it out there.

00:13:45.225 --> 00:13:48.295 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Once the rain lets up,
we'll be outta here.

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:52.166 position:35% line:83% align:start
Sorry, man.
I appreciate the help, bye.

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:54.703 position:30% line:89% align:start
Feeling better?

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:56.403 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, I guess.

00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:58.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm mega sorry for
causing you trouble!

00:13:59.039 --> 00:14:00.874 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like, this is so my fault.

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.443 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey! It's all good.

00:14:02.577 --> 00:14:05.580 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should've noticed
the second that you were gone.

00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.916 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just sit down and
take some deep breaths.

00:14:12.286 --> 00:14:16.924 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, and, uh...
I'm sorry that I wasn't Jiro.

00:14:17.057 --> 00:14:18.727 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:22.329 position:16% line:89% align:start
[laughs] Your face, dude!

00:14:22.463 --> 00:14:25.366 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wait! I swear
it isn't like that!

00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:26.467 position:38% line:89% align:start
Come on!

00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:28.435 position:30% line:83% align:start
Stop laughing,
you've got it all wrong!

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry. Your reaction
got me for a second.

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:33.808 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm back.

00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:35.376 position:35% line:89% align:start
So, Yakuin?

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.244 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] That dweeb is
totally irrelevant to this!

00:14:37.378 --> 00:14:40.114 position:13% line:83% align:start
Very convincing, but your
cheeks are giving it away.

00:14:40.247 --> 00:14:42.049 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I'm just a blushy girl!

00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:43.752 position:19% line:83% align:start
You gotta listen to me,
the person I love is--

00:14:43.884 --> 00:14:45.653 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wow. Kinda makes me sad.

00:14:45.787 --> 00:14:46.920 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:50.124 position:35% line:83% align:start
Screw this.
Stupid freakin' rain.

00:14:50.257 --> 00:14:52.594 position:27% line:83% align:start
--[SHIORI] Jiro!
--[gasps]

00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:55.764 position:10% line:89% align:start
Gosh. I've looked everywhere.

00:14:55.896 --> 00:14:57.131 position:38% line:89% align:start
You have?

00:14:57.264 --> 00:15:00.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
Of course! Also,
Akari is safe and sound!

00:15:00.502 --> 00:15:01.636 position:33% line:89% align:start
Wait, she is?

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.773 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Uh-huh, Minami's
the one who found her.

00:15:05.507 --> 00:15:07.609 position:19% line:83% align:start
They're taking shelter
from the rain now,

00:15:07.742 --> 00:15:10.043 position:27% line:83% align:start
but they're gonna
head back once it lets up.

00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:11.345 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a relief!

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:12.680 position:27% line:89% align:start
Good stuff, huh?

00:15:12.814 --> 00:15:16.216 position:21% line:89% align:start
For sure. Good stuff.

00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:23.290 position:10% line:83% align:start
You came all the way out here
just to let me know?

00:15:23.424 --> 00:15:25.192 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, you weren't
checking your phone.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.494 position:24% line:89% align:start
It made me worried.

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:29.129 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:15:29.798 --> 00:15:32.933 position:10% line:83% align:start
Don't be, you were super busy
trying to find your friend.

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.101 position:21% line:89% align:start
I think that's neat.

00:15:34.234 --> 00:15:36.604 position:27% line:83% align:start
It shows how much
you really care.

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:40.441 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I-I was so panicked
I couldn't find her.

00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:42.309 position:19% line:83% align:start
I should've remembered
how useless I am

00:15:42.443 --> 00:15:44.846 position:24% line:83% align:start
and left everything
up to Minami.

00:15:44.978 --> 00:15:46.146 position:41% line:89% align:start
I suck.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.916 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't talk to
my friend like that!

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:50.752 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're such a kind person.

00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:52.352 position:5% line:89% align:start
And since the practical started,

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:54.722 position:24% line:83% align:start
you've become quite
the cool person, too.

00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:56.223 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:58.192 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Akari has gotten to know

00:15:58.325 --> 00:16:00.695 position:5% line:89% align:start
a version of Jiro that I don't.

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:03.130 position:7% line:89% align:start
Makes me a teensy bit jealous.

00:16:03.263 --> 00:16:04.732 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you mean by "version"?

00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:07.836 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm pretty sure I'm the
same Jiro I've always been.

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:10.070 position:33% line:83% align:start
I know that,
but you have other sides

00:16:10.204 --> 00:16:11.573 position:16% line:89% align:start
than the one you show me.

00:16:11.706 --> 00:16:14.241 position:19% line:83% align:start
Like the husband side,
for example.

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:17.077 position:13% line:83% align:start
I don't know. I don't think
the way you are changes

00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:19.614 position:24% line:83% align:start
because you happen
to be married.

00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:22.249 position:21% line:89% align:start
And I mean, with us.

00:16:22.382 --> 00:16:25.319 position:33% line:83% align:start
It's not like
Akari and I are in love.

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.923 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
That expression.

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:30.257 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've known him
for a million years

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.459 position:7% line:89% align:start
and I've never seen it before.

00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:34.963 position:21% line:83% align:start
Speaking of marriage,
how's yours?

00:16:35.095 --> 00:16:36.163 position:33% line:83% align:start
--Did you...
--Huh?

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:39.333 position:38% line:83% align:start
Uh, well,
we practiced that thing.

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:42.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
Did you ever put it
into use or whatever?

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:45.740 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh-- For real? You and Tenjin?

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:48.877 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Oh, no, no.
We very much did not do that!

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.478 position:24% line:83% align:start
Really? But you're
all flustered.

00:16:51.613 --> 00:16:52.814 position:35% line:89% align:start
Well, yeah!

00:16:52.947 --> 00:16:56.049 position:10% line:83% align:start
Because I was thinking about
kissing you, and...

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.786 position:35% line:89% align:start
And, uh...

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.354 position:5% line:89% align:start
Since we kissed at the nurse's,

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:03.090 position:21% line:83% align:start
I haven't really done
anything else like that.

00:17:03.223 --> 00:17:04.926 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:17:05.994 --> 00:17:09.898 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] It was super special.
You were my first.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.499 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, uh, was that
the same for you?

00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:14.602 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO gasps]
Well... I mean...

00:17:14.736 --> 00:17:17.639 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI laughs]
That was an invasive question!

00:17:17.772 --> 00:17:19.106 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:20.775 position:21% line:83% align:start
And sorry for getting
myself all worked up.

00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.042 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Shiori?

00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:25.013 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
The rain's not so bad, let's go.

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:27.515 position:10% line:89% align:start
Come back, you'll get soaked.

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:34.354 position:13% line:83% align:start
You been beside me forever
and I can't lose that!

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:37.357 position:30% line:83% align:start
As we grow up,
being your childhood friend

00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:40.795 position:24% line:83% align:start
won't be enough to
keep me in your life.

00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:43.196 position:13% line:89% align:start
I am so sorry. I'm just...

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.732 position:27% line:89% align:start
Akari is just...

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:46.099 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:51.906 position:10% line:83% align:start
If Akari really isn't special
to you, show me something.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.779 position:13% line:83% align:start
A side of you so hidden...
even your wife doesn't know.

00:18:02.584 --> 00:18:06.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
What did it mean, uh,
when you said it made you sad?

00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:10.324 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh, not quite sad,
like how a big brother feels

00:18:10.457 --> 00:18:12.760 position:33% line:83% align:start
after meeting
his sister's boyfriend.

00:18:12.894 --> 00:18:13.761 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wistful?

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.597 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sister?

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:21.134 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Oh, crap. It's happening.

00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:24.939 position:7% line:83% align:start
He's totally shooting me down.
This sucks.

00:18:25.073 --> 00:18:26.641 position:16% line:89% align:start
But I can't just give up.

00:18:26.774 --> 00:18:29.544 position:33% line:83% align:start
Like, no doy,
I made a promise to Jiro!

00:18:29.677 --> 00:18:32.847 position:13% line:83% align:start
We're gonna get into A-rank
and change partners!

00:18:34.716 --> 00:18:35.750 position:41% line:89% align:start
Minami?

00:18:35.883 --> 00:18:38.385 position:30% line:83% align:start
So, if we could
switch to be partners

00:18:38.519 --> 00:18:41.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then spend rest of
the practical together,

00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:46.794 position:10% line:83% align:start
do you think that maybe you'd
stop looking at me as a sister?

00:18:46.928 --> 00:18:49.496 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Gross.
It's a million times worse

00:18:49.631 --> 00:18:52.100 position:27% line:83% align:start
when you know how
desperate you sound.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:53.768 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry. No.

00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:55.737 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can tell you have
feelings for me.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.506 position:16% line:83% align:start
Truth is, I've been able
to tell for a while.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.407 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:03.111 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] C'mon, you weren't
exactly subtle.

00:19:03.243 --> 00:19:06.413 position:24% line:83% align:start
I always took it as
a huge compliment,

00:19:06.547 --> 00:19:09.282 position:21% line:83% align:start
but, uh, I'm in love
with somebody else.

00:19:09.416 --> 00:19:14.122 position:33% line:83% align:start
[AKARI gasps]
It's Sakurazaka, isn't it?

00:19:14.254 --> 00:19:15.422 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:18.291 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MINAMI laughs]

00:19:18.425 --> 00:19:20.160 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] Hold up!
You've got it all wrong!

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:22.496 position:10% line:89% align:start
What do you mean? Like, huh?

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:24.532 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
No wonder you were stressed.

00:19:24.666 --> 00:19:27.035 position:30% line:83% align:start
Chill with the
laugh track, dude!

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:30.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
My bad. There's nothing
between me and Shiori.

00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:32.339 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I totally thought there was.

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:35.643 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, who then? Some new chick?

00:19:35.777 --> 00:19:38.345 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
No, you wouldn't know her.

00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:42.315 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI]
It's an unrequited love.

00:19:42.449 --> 00:19:45.452 position:5% line:89% align:start
And it'll stay that way forever.

00:19:46.888 --> 00:19:47.955 position:30% line:89% align:start
It's the worst.

00:19:48.089 --> 00:19:51.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
An intense love with
no future like that?

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.861 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know how bad it hurts,

00:19:53.995 --> 00:19:57.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I still put you through
the same thing, didn't I?

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.433 position:27% line:89% align:start
I feel horrible.

00:20:00.101 --> 00:20:01.301 position:35% line:89% align:start
But go you!

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:03.071 position:19% line:83% align:start
You found your special
person in Yakuin.

00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.939 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's huge.

00:20:05.073 --> 00:20:06.641 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
But what if...

00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:09.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
He's, uh, in love
with somebody else?

00:20:09.577 --> 00:20:11.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] Oh, does he have
a girlfriend? That's new.

00:20:11.879 --> 00:20:14.782 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Mm-mm. Not quite a girlfriend.

00:20:14.916 --> 00:20:17.785 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then it's all about
how hard you try right now.

00:20:17.919 --> 00:20:20.888 position:16% line:83% align:start
He could very well choose
you over this other girl.

00:20:21.022 --> 00:20:23.991 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yeah, but, what if I, like,
confess and make things weird?

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:28.295 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI laughs] You realize
you just confessed to me, right?

00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:29.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
Do you feel like
things are weird?

00:20:30.131 --> 00:20:33.701 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh-- Mm-mm.

00:20:33.835 --> 00:20:36.037 position:24% line:83% align:start
I hope you put your
whole heart into this love

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.305 position:21% line:89% align:start
and never look back.

00:20:38.438 --> 00:20:40.775 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm living vicariously
through you.

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:43.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
Cause I'm not quite
ready for that myself.

00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:46.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
I wasted your time, huh? Sorry.

00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:50.618 position:33% line:83% align:start
[AKARI gasps]
You didn't waste crap!

00:20:50.752 --> 00:20:54.088 position:13% line:83% align:start
Like, I've had the freakin'
time of my life loving you!

00:20:54.222 --> 00:20:56.858 position:24% line:83% align:start
Talking to you made
my heart beat like crazy,

00:20:56.991 --> 00:20:59.426 position:13% line:83% align:start
looking at you made me feel
like I was floating!

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.929 position:24% line:83% align:start
Shut up! Why would
you apologize?

00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:05.767 position:13% line:83% align:start
For being hot and kind and
giving me something beautiful?

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.336 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thank you, Minami.
For every minute of it.

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:11.873 position:24% line:89% align:start
I really loved you!

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.310 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thank you, too.
This meant the world.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.482 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I'm glad I fell in love.

00:21:22.617 --> 00:21:24.484 position:16% line:89% align:start
He rejected me and still.

00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:27.155 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm so glad I loved him.

00:21:27.855 --> 00:21:30.057 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Hells yeah! It's time!

00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:31.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
If don't want to
have any regrets,

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:33.861 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've gotta give this my all!

00:21:33.995 --> 00:21:37.265 position:16% line:83% align:start
Check it out, there's the
spunky Watanabe I know.

00:21:37.397 --> 00:21:39.534 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've gotta hurry up
and move on, too.

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:42.170 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please, you'll find
the perfect hottie right away.

00:21:42.302 --> 00:21:44.739 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, thank you.
Guess we'll see.

00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:59.153 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
It's Sakurazaka, isn't it?

00:21:59.287 --> 00:22:02.256 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] I never thought that's
what she was worried about.

00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:04.091 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come to think of it,
Shiori seems like

00:22:04.225 --> 00:22:05.726 position:5% line:89% align:start
she's in love with someone, too.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.930 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hope that hasn't started
any weird rumors.

00:22:09.063 --> 00:22:12.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
In any case,
I hope things work out for them.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.468 position:13% line:89% align:start
They both truly deserve it.

00:23:57.672 --> 00:23:59.740 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] All this kissing is,
like, uber boring.

00:23:59.874 --> 00:24:01.474 position:10% line:89% align:start
Lemme see these prudes boink!

00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:03.244 position:27% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] Please,
foreplay is the best part.

00:24:03.377 --> 00:24:04.979 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Uck!

00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:06.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] You gotta marinate
the sausage before you cook it!

00:24:06.414 --> 00:24:07.480 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Sick nasty!

00:24:07.615 --> 00:24:09.016 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Quickies make me sickies!

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.117 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Get real!

00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:11.652 position:16% line:83% align:start
The best part of screwing
is the screwing.

00:24:11.786 --> 00:24:14.689 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, the best part
is the raw connection.

00:24:14.822 --> 00:24:17.792 position:27% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Next time,
"Done, Being Less Than Love."
