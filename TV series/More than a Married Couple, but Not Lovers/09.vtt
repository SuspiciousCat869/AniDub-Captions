[TEACHER A]
And on that note,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.212 position:21% line:83% align:start
don't let yourselves
get carried away.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:14.414 position:16% line:83% align:start
Summer break is exciting,
but keep in mind

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
you'll be graded up
until July 31st.

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.353 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
As far as grades go,

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.421 position:24% line:83% align:start
Akari and I are on
the right track.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:24.659 position:7% line:83% align:start
But we're ending the term with
a lot of junk left unresolved.

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:26.093 position:13% line:89% align:start
It wouldn't be fair to her

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.462 position:24% line:83% align:start
to let this drag on
into the second term.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:31.231 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wonder what Shiori's
doing for summer break.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:34.636 position:21% line:83% align:start
I bet she'll probably
go home in August.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:37.271 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Room and board included?

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.907 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Hells to the yeah.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.542 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's this big,
pop-up shop thing.

00:00:40.675 --> 00:00:42.777 position:27% line:83% align:start
Some new campaign
for my blood bro's work.

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.812 position:21% line:83% align:start
They're short-staffed
and it's for three days,

00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:46.246 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I thought I might as well.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.750 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow. You're all in on this, huh?

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:51.753 position:24% line:83% align:start
Bingo, bro. Ours is
not the only dimension

00:00:51.886 --> 00:00:54.822 position:7% line:83% align:start
with limited-time summer stuff.
Ya boi needs some dough.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:58.158 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thus, this interdimensional
spender took the bait.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.727 position:10% line:89% align:start
Plus, the work will be easy.

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:02.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
I caught the vibe that they
just need extra hands.

00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:04.566 position:41% line:89% align:start
Huh...

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.367 position:16% line:83% align:start
And since you have hands,
I applied for you, too.

00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:09.202 position:10% line:89% align:start
For real?! There's no way I'm

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.706 position:16% line:83% align:start
socially competent enough
to serve real customers!

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.741 position:19% line:83% align:start
And the entire "living
with coworkers" thing

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:14.976 position:27% line:89% align:start
would be torture!

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.612 position:13% line:89% align:start
C'mon, as if I don't know!

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.549 position:13% line:89% align:start
Me! An introverted gazelle!

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.018 position:24% line:83% align:start
Them! Apex predator
party people!

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:26.386 position:19% line:89% align:start
How's a Kamo to thrive?

00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.388 position:5% line:89% align:start
So why are you even going then?

00:01:28.523 --> 00:01:30.490 position:27% line:83% align:start
Summer's my baby
Marin's season, bro!

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:32.961 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I'm not gonna be cheeks
out for the swimsuit gacha!

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.964 position:13% line:83% align:start
How better to prepare than
by acquiring some fat stacks!

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:42.269 position:5% line:83% align:start
Dude! I'd do anything for Marin!
Anything for her swimsuit!

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.104 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hiya. You dropped this.

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.272 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Uh--

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:47.041 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank you.

00:01:47.174 --> 00:01:50.210 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shiori?

00:01:50.344 --> 00:01:52.013 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, thank you.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.715 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You already said that, silly.

00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:55.382 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, I know that flyer.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:56.951 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm?

00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:00.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
How funny! Mei and I just
applied for that exact job!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
Thought we'd try
the part-time life.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.825 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Wait, really?

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:06.027 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mm-hm! It's so short
that it doesn't conflict

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.427 position:19% line:89% align:start
with summer intensives!

00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:10.130 position:30% line:83% align:start
I applied, too!
Small world, sis!

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.834 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh my gosh, that's so fun!
Great minds, eh?

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:16.537 position:7% line:83% align:start
Preach! My servant's heart got
the better of me this summer.

00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:20.140 position:10% line:83% align:start
My broski and I? We're gonna
work ourselves to the bone!

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.576 position:38% line:89% align:start
Shut up!

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.546 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Huh? Will you
be there, too, Jiro?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.481 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah.

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:30.217 position:27% line:83% align:start
Awesome! Now I'm
even more excited!

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.920 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's give it our all!

00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:37.025 position:38% line:89% align:start
Epic win.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.359 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
A live-in job with Shiori?

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:42.764 position:13% line:89% align:start
A live-in job with Shiori.

00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:44.264 position:21% line:89% align:start
Aw, you mean ouchies,

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:46.968 position:24% line:83% align:start
you better leave my
friend Jiro alone or else!

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:51.371 position:5% line:83% align:start
I feel lonely in there. Would it
be okay if I slept with you?

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:54.075 position:21% line:83% align:start
My heart is pounding.
I can't sleep.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.910 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Holy crap! I'm on fire!

00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:57.477 position:16% line:89% align:start
My poor, virgin synapses!

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:59.479 position:10% line:83% align:start
They can't handle the sudden
influx of adrenaline!

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:01.181 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Jiro! Bro!

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.750 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wuzzup?

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.520 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have the deets, yeah?
I just got my wife's permission.

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:07.989 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, once your missus has
given you her blessing,

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:09.189 position:24% line:89% align:start
we'll be all good.

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.625 position:38% line:89% align:start
Right...

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:13.061 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bro, there's no way that
the gyaru gives a rip.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.494 position:30% line:83% align:start
She'll use this
as a chance to do

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.598 position:24% line:83% align:start
the no pants dance
with some new guy.

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:22.603 position:10% line:83% align:start
Welcome home, hubby dearest,
care to join in?

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:26.107 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes! Oh, how I would
care to join in!

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.110 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shut up, dude,
she's not like that.

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.845 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Interesting.

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:35.183 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ah, hope this job sheds some
light on your decision, Bromeo.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:36.483 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? The what?

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.853 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:12.013 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm home!

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:18.385 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Akari? Oh, yeah,
she said she was going out.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.154 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Welcome back, Jiro.

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:23.925 position:13% line:83% align:start
I thought you we're hanging
out with-- Ah! Hanging out!

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:26.561 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunts]

00:05:29.897 --> 00:05:32.465 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well? Be honest--
what do you think?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.368 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasping]

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:39.941 position:16% line:89% align:start
Think it's cute? [laughs]

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:42.176 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yo, earth to
captain tomato face.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.812 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't choke on your drool,
it's just a swimsuit.

00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:48.182 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] You've gotta be
kidding me. Just a swimsuit?

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:49.984 position:10% line:89% align:start
That thing is not a swimsuit!

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:53.688 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's bazoonga floss and
that's being generous!

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:55.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
The squad is taking
a vacay to the beach.

00:05:55.923 --> 00:05:58.693 position:16% line:83% align:start
I picked this bad boy out
with the girls today.

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:01.529 position:21% line:83% align:start
But your face says it
might be too risquÃ©.

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.030 position:30% line:83% align:start
Good thing I'm a
genius and bought

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:05.533 position:13% line:89% align:start
two suits just to be safe.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.849 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're, like, undressing me
with your eyes, perv.

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:23.918 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
There's not much to undress.

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.320 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, I find your lack
of fabric disturbing,

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:27.822 position:13% line:89% align:start
but who cares what I think.

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:29.724 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Blah, blah, boring, blah.

00:06:29.857 --> 00:06:34.028 position:19% line:83% align:start
Check it. It's got the
cutest little bow. Look!

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunting]

00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:41.936 position:19% line:83% align:start
Creep-oo! Quit staring!
It's so gross! Heh!

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.205 position:21% line:83% align:start
You can't be serious,
you told me to look!

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:47.541 position:19% line:83% align:start
Also, I never said that
you could wear my hoodie.

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.277 position:21% line:89% align:start
Scared of my cooties?

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.879 position:10% line:83% align:start
Speaking of cooties, are you
gonna catch some on this trip,

00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:54.782 position:21% line:83% align:start
or is it just girls?
Are guys coming?

00:06:54.916 --> 00:06:56.751 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Why do you care? Jealous?

00:06:56.884 --> 00:06:59.820 position:30% line:83% align:start
No, not at all.
I'd prefer there were guys.

00:06:59.954 --> 00:07:03.024 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, if you plan to dress
so questionably, yeah.

00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:04.392 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:06.027 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Jeez, uh, I'm sorry.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.830 position:5% line:83% align:start
Who am I to tell you what to do?
It's just freaky.

00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:12.767 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't think you'd be
as safe with only girls.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.938 position:5% line:89% align:start
Hey. It's safe. It's for a job.

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:20.574 position:41% line:89% align:start
A job?

00:07:20.708 --> 00:07:22.442 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just a quick gig at
this cafÃ© near the beach.

00:07:22.576 --> 00:07:25.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
Starting next Friday, we'll
be staying there for a few.

00:07:25.513 --> 00:07:28.549 position:19% line:83% align:start
Funny. Must be a lot of
jobs like that popping up.

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:30.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
This actually works out
pretty great because,

00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:32.987 position:24% line:83% align:start
believe it or not,
I got a live-in job, too.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.158 position:16% line:83% align:start
No way, Jiro with a job?
I can't picture that.

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:38.726 position:16% line:89% align:start
Honestly, neither can I.

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:40.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
But Kamo's kinda forcing me, so.

00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:42.663 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Aw, bestie westies.

00:07:42.797 --> 00:07:45.465 position:16% line:83% align:start
It sounds weird when you

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.516 position:13% line:89% align:start
and we're not even married.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.884 position:24% line:83% align:start
Even though I kinda
stumbled into this job,

00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:13.655 position:19% line:89% align:start
it could be my chance.

00:14:13.788 --> 00:14:17.458 position:7% line:83% align:start
What're you gonna choose, Jiro?
Team kitchen or team floor?

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:21.462 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kitchen, I think.
Floor sounds tough, so yeah.

00:14:21.596 --> 00:14:24.298 position:13% line:83% align:start
Cool, then maybe I'll sign
up for team kitchen, too.

00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:26.568 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd like to work with
somebody that I know.

00:14:26.701 --> 00:14:30.871 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, uh, let's work in the
kitchen together, then.

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:32.039 position:44% line:89% align:start
Cool?

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:33.675 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Is this real life?

00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:35.543 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, cool.

00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:40.682 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Hmmm.

00:14:40.815 --> 00:14:41.783 position:33% line:89% align:start
You all good?

00:14:41.915 --> 00:14:42.784 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:14:42.916 --> 00:14:43.785 position:33% line:89% align:start
Lower right.

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:45.687 position:27% line:89% align:start
I see! Thank you!

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.489 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thanks for paying attention
and learning so fast.

00:14:48.623 --> 00:14:51.392 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're making
my life a lot easier.

00:14:51.526 --> 00:14:53.994 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Is this real life?

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:56.096 position:19% line:83% align:start
Once you charge their
card and give it back.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.599 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Ooo! I give them
the receipt, yeah?

00:14:57.732 --> 00:14:59.266 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Question.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.302 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] Can toppings be added
to this one, too? Dude!

00:15:02.436 --> 00:15:05.707 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey! I'm raising my
hand over here, Teach!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.374 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hm? Heh...

00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:10.845 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aw, cute Akari would, like,
totally bust over this one!

00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:12.312 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait a sec, which one?

00:15:12.446 --> 00:15:13.715 position:35% line:89% align:start
Pranked ya!

00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:16.518 position:19% line:83% align:start
You are, like, stupidly
easy to read, my man.

00:15:16.651 --> 00:15:18.252 position:24% line:89% align:start
Plain stupid, too.

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.921 position:10% line:83% align:start
Hey! If you're gonna be mean,
then I'm not gonna train you!

00:15:21.054 --> 00:15:22.389 position:21% line:89% align:start
Whoa, unclench, dude!

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:24.726 position:27% line:83% align:start
Sisters don't dig
uptight misters.

00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:26.193 position:27% line:89% align:start
[TERAFUNE grunts]

00:15:26.326 --> 00:15:28.328 position:19% line:83% align:start
Poor baby. Must totally
suck that the person

00:15:28.462 --> 00:15:30.532 position:19% line:83% align:start
you're in love with is
in love with your bestie.

00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:32.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
What happens if they
start dating for real?

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:33.835 position:35% line:89% align:start
They might.

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.335 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're wrong about that.

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:36.838 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
How're you so sure?

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.873 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh, my gut.

00:15:39.006 --> 00:15:41.041 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] You're tiny, there's
no room in there for guts.

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:42.242 position:21% line:89% align:start
Just spill the beans.

00:15:42.376 --> 00:15:43.912 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, that cut deep.

00:15:44.044 --> 00:15:46.548 position:13% line:83% align:start
Tell us everything that you
know, or kitty will go craycray!

00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:50.050 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nothing's scarier than this
chick once she bears her claws.

00:15:50.184 --> 00:15:52.953 position:27% line:83% align:start
They're so loud.
What could be that exciting?

00:15:53.086 --> 00:15:55.155 position:16% line:89% align:start
Sounds like a lot of fun!

00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:57.057 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry that I got
you stuck back here

00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:59.059 position:10% line:89% align:start
working the kitchen with me.

00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:00.895 position:35% line:83% align:start
Oh, please!
The number one reason

00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:02.963 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm here is to
hang out with you.

00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:05.132 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're the best.

00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:09.102 position:21% line:83% align:start
Best, huh? I'm pretty
sure you think "the best"

00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:10.304 position:19% line:89% align:start
is standing over there.

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:12.072 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Mei! Hush up!

00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:14.141 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MEI] I don't get how
that doof's intimidating.

00:16:14.274 --> 00:16:16.276 position:21% line:83% align:start
You need to show him
you're not a kid anymore.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:20.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's random you're both here,
but also the perfect chance!

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:22.082 position:35% line:83% align:start
Escape the
"childhood friend" crap!

00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:24.184 position:30% line:83% align:start
This summer is
clutch time, dude!

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:26.621 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI grunts]

00:16:26.754 --> 00:16:29.089 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Yakuin!

00:16:29.223 --> 00:16:30.491 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry to bug ya.

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.760 position:24% line:83% align:start
Could you get that
thing up there for us?

00:16:32.894 --> 00:16:34.495 position:16% line:89% align:start
Shiori can't quite reach.

00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:39.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
Uh, sorry? It's way up there.
Could you help me get it down?

00:16:39.834 --> 00:16:41.001 position:35% line:89% align:start
Sure. What?

00:16:41.134 --> 00:16:44.404 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, uh. Just this syrup.

00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:46.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI grunting]
Jiro?

00:16:46.741 --> 00:16:50.812 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? Sorry, spaced out!
Syrup, right?

00:16:50.945 --> 00:16:52.379 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:54.849 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
You've got this, Shiori.

00:16:54.983 --> 00:16:59.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Bro! Hang on,
I gotta show my boy my new soap!

00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:00.522 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, if you have a minute,

00:17:00.655 --> 00:17:02.322 position:21% line:83% align:start
could you help me move
these boxes real quick?

00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:05.593 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course.
Kamo at your service.

00:17:05.727 --> 00:17:07.562 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:17:07.695 --> 00:17:09.096 position:24% line:89% align:start
A misanga bracelet.

00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.599 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you fancy the arts
and the crafts?

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:12.834 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Huh?

00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:14.636 position:33% line:83% align:start
[KAMO grunts]
Sincerest apologies, ma'am.

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:16.704 position:30% line:83% align:start
Thanks a bunch
for your help, Jiro.

00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:18.573 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
No! Thank you.

00:17:18.706 --> 00:17:21.441 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Moron! What are you
even thanking her for?

00:17:21.576 --> 00:17:22.710 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:29.249 position:5% line:83% align:start
This is the kind we're supposed
to put whipped cream on, right?

00:17:29.383 --> 00:17:33.320 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh! Wanna practice with me?

00:17:33.453 --> 00:17:36.758 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I'm having a
hard time getting it in.

00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:40.060 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's fine. I mean, this is
your first time, isn't it?

00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:41.061 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah.

00:17:41.194 --> 00:17:42.329 position:27% line:89% align:start
You'll be great!

00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:45.365 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just try to take it
slow and gentle.

00:17:45.499 --> 00:17:48.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's it. Trace around
the edge super softly.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
And when you're ready,
put it in.

00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:53.942 position:19% line:83% align:start
In my opinion, there's
no need to rush anything.

00:17:54.074 --> 00:17:56.276 position:30% line:83% align:start
It's best if you
go nice and slow.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.112 position:10% line:89% align:start
I think I get it. Like this?

00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:00.748 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Yup, it's in there now.

00:18:00.882 --> 00:18:03.851 position:19% line:83% align:start
Good. Now keep it there
and slowly press.

00:18:03.985 --> 00:18:09.156 position:13% line:83% align:start
[gasps] Don't rush, silly.
That's perfect.

00:18:09.891 --> 00:18:11.491 position:21% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] It might be
even better if you went in

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:14.194 position:5% line:89% align:start
a teensy bit deeper. Like this.

00:18:14.328 --> 00:18:16.163 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasps]

00:18:17.264 --> 00:18:20.367 position:27% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI squeaks]

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.571 position:16% line:89% align:start
Aw. Well, that was quick!

00:18:24.338 --> 00:18:26.908 position:30% line:83% align:start
Uh! Oh my gosh.
I'm so sorry! My bad!

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:31.111 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI laughs] You gave
yourself a little mustache!

00:18:31.244 --> 00:18:32.680 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't laugh!

00:18:32.814 --> 00:18:34.281 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've got it all over your
face, too, by the way!

00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:36.718 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wait, I do? Where?

00:18:36.851 --> 00:18:38.318 position:30% line:83% align:start
Well, it's not
where you're wiping.

00:18:38.452 --> 00:18:41.221 position:30% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Chill,
or you'll make it worse!

00:18:41.355 --> 00:18:43.691 position:19% line:89% align:start
Aw... I'm embarrassed.

00:18:43.825 --> 00:18:47.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
Please, just wipe it off.
Help, Jiro.

00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:54.969 position:27% line:89% align:start
[gasping] Tickly!

00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:59.139 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Sorry, Shiori,
but I need you to hold still.

00:18:59.272 --> 00:19:02.142 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Jiro's hands. They're so warm.

00:19:02.275 --> 00:19:04.112 position:35% line:83% align:start
Escape the
"childhood friend" crap!

00:19:04.244 --> 00:19:05.947 position:13% line:89% align:start
This summer is clutch time!

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.517 position:13% line:83% align:start
Okay, I'm pretty sure that
you're whipped cream free now.

00:19:09.651 --> 00:19:12.352 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
This summer is clutch time!

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:14.421 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hey, Jiro?

00:19:14.555 --> 00:19:19.159 position:35% line:83% align:start
Look at me.
Please. Actually look.

00:19:19.292 --> 00:19:21.161 position:41% line:89% align:start
Shiori?

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:30.571 position:30% line:89% align:start
Jiro, I, uh...

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:34.174 position:7% line:89% align:start
You look scared. What's wrong?

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:35.977 position:27% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI gasping]

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.945 position:41% line:83% align:start

Hm?

Sorry to barge in on whatever
you were in the middle of,

00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:44.786 position:16% line:83% align:start
we'll be out of your hair
once Natsumi remembers

00:19:44.919 --> 00:19:46.621 position:27% line:83% align:start
what size we were
supposed to get.

00:19:46.754 --> 00:19:50.323 position:19% line:83% align:start
I so forgot that shiz.
I say we just bring all of them.

00:19:50.457 --> 00:19:52.093 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
He seemed super weirded out!

He must think I'm disgusting.

second of that. I blew it.

[NATSUMI]
Leaving for real now!

00:19:59.466 --> 00:20:01.703 position:13% line:89% align:start
Knock yourselves out. Heh.

00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:04.005 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, gosh. Sorry!

00:20:04.138 --> 00:20:06.440 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, I'm sorry.

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:09.143 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Don't lose it, me.
Everything's fine.

00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:12.312 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's plenty of
time left on the trip.

00:20:12.446 --> 00:20:14.949 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I got super close
to telling him, Mei.

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:18.953 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's okay. Summer's only
just started after all.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.789 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Everything's going to be fine.

00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:25.793 position:10% line:83% align:start
We're older now, and it's not
like she's leaving again.

00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:31.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] But here on out, if I
want to get closer to Shiori,

00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:35.203 position:21% line:83% align:start
there's no way things
can stay the way they are.

00:20:35.335 --> 00:20:37.370 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's this "childhood
friends" label.

00:20:37.505 --> 00:20:39.140 position:5% line:89% align:start
I've held onto it for too long!

00:20:39.272 --> 00:20:41.542 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Heyo, bro!

00:20:41.676 --> 00:20:42.844 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh?

00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:44.846 position:19% line:89% align:start
Got a swimsuit? Or two?

00:20:44.979 --> 00:20:45.913 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:50.350 position:27% line:89% align:start
I love the beach!

00:20:50.484 --> 00:20:52.053 position:24% line:89% align:start
I love getting tan!

00:20:52.186 --> 00:20:54.555 position:33% line:89% align:start
I love fish!

00:20:54.689 --> 00:20:56.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
My shadow-dwelling
eyes are restored!

00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:59.761 position:19% line:83% align:start
What a glorious view we
have ourselves today.

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:01.562 position:30% line:89% align:start
Say that again.

00:21:01.696 --> 00:21:03.363 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Oh, to be at
the beach surrounded by

00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:04.866 position:19% line:89% align:start
the cream of the crop!

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:06.834 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's times like this I'm
reminded how good it feels

00:21:06.968 --> 00:21:07.969 position:33% line:89% align:start
to be alive!

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:09.604 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah, but it's pretty evident

00:21:09.737 --> 00:21:11.639 position:16% line:89% align:start
we're the outsiders here.

00:21:11.773 --> 00:21:14.075 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] I have to say,
Akari's one-piece look

00:21:14.208 --> 00:21:15.810 position:5% line:89% align:start
is throwing me for a total loop.

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:18.980 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm a devout fan of her typical
"let it all hang out" style,

00:21:19.113 --> 00:21:22.784 position:21% line:83% align:start
but I guess this is
cute in its own way.

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:24.018 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasping]

00:21:24.152 --> 00:21:28.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
This suit? I'll save.
It's for your eyes only.

00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:30.558 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
No way she was serious.

00:21:30.691 --> 00:21:32.960 position:21% line:89% align:start
She wouldn't do that.

00:21:33.094 --> 00:21:34.494 position:35% line:89% align:start
Would she?

00:21:34.629 --> 00:21:36.864 position:16% line:89% align:start
No, brain. Not a chance.

00:21:36.998 --> 00:21:40.400 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Wait a minute.
Where are your swimsuits?

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.005 position:10% line:89% align:start
Don't wanna take the plunge?

00:21:44.138 --> 00:21:46.439 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can't swim, huh?

00:21:46.574 --> 00:21:48.009 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH laugh]

00:21:48.142 --> 00:21:50.443 position:7% line:83% align:start
Please! We can swim like fish,
we just didn't think

00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.680 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'd have free time,
so we didn't pack suits.

00:21:52.814 --> 00:21:55.415 position:7% line:83% align:start
But we still thought we'd come
down and check out the ocean.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.984 position:16% line:89% align:start
By "check out the ocean,"

00:21:57.118 --> 00:21:58.920 position:19% line:83% align:start
do you mean "check out
all the girls' nasty bits?"

00:21:59.053 --> 00:22:01.722 position:33% line:83% align:start
Blas-phem-y!
Those bits are not nasty!

00:22:01.856 --> 00:22:05.159 position:13% line:83% align:start
They're sacred! Thanks for
blessing our lowly eyes!

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:06.828 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
You moron!

00:22:06.961 --> 00:22:09.931 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't quite get what
you mean, but, you, uh...

00:22:10.064 --> 00:22:13.835 position:27% line:83% align:start
You wanna go over
there together?

00:22:13.968 --> 00:22:15.770 position:27% line:89% align:start
It could be fun!

00:22:15.903 --> 00:22:16.504 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasps]

00:22:16.637 --> 00:22:17.805 position:33% line:89% align:start
[KAMO gasps]

00:22:17.939 --> 00:22:19.106 position:35% line:89% align:start
[MEI gasps]

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:27.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KAMO, MEI, JIRO]
A hotel?!

00:23:57.772 --> 00:23:59.407 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Okay, fit number one!

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.808 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Mee-yow!

00:24:00.942 --> 00:24:02.543 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] The twins are out
and ready to play.

00:24:02.677 --> 00:24:04.578 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] That's, like, yarn,
girl, what if it comes untied?

00:24:04.712 --> 00:24:06.446 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Who cares? That'll give her boyf

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.215 position:19% line:83% align:start
the perfect opportunity
to protect her!

00:24:08.349 --> 00:24:10.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Yeah, somehow, I don't
think he'd be that considerate.

00:24:10.518 --> 00:24:11.686 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo...

00:24:11.819 --> 00:24:13.020 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Who wouldn't be considerate?

00:24:13.154 --> 00:24:14.322 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Chill, it was hypothetical!

00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:15.589 position:27% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI, SACHI]
Next time,

00:24:15.723 --> 00:24:16.624 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
"'Already' Has Passed,"

00:24:16.757 --> 00:24:17.858 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
"But Not 'Yet.'"
