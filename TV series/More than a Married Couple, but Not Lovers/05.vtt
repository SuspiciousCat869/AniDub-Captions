[JIRO] Watanabe! I have
class duties today,

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.515 position:10% line:89% align:start
so I'm gonna head out early.

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:16.618 position:19% line:83% align:start
I could've sworn we had
more recycling than this.

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:21.789 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Nope, thassit.
Hold up, your tie is all wonky.

00:00:21.923 --> 00:00:23.390 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, thank you.

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:26.226 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I'm a total nobody
with nothing going for me.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.028 position:30% line:89% align:start
But somehow...

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.764 position:19% line:89% align:start
Make yourself shorter.

00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:32.132 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I got paired up with the
most popular girl in school.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.601 position:24% line:89% align:start
She really is cute.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.937 position:21% line:83% align:start
No wonder everyone's
in love with her.

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.337 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasps]

00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.106 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] If you can't
make your perverted eyes

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.975 position:19% line:83% align:start
stop staring my chest,
then I will.

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:44.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I wasn't!
I-I just like your shirt!

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.650 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasping]

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:53.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have a good day and be
safe out there, okay?

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.790 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Sometimes I
live in the delusion,

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:59.994 position:10% line:83% align:start
and imagine what it'd be like
if we were married for real.

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:02.030 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's enough of that, big boy!

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.164 position:27% line:83% align:start
Don't forget the
recycling, capeesh?

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.934 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO sighs]

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:10.370 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I'll try my best today.
That's all I can do, right?

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.501 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey Jiro! Happy morning!

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:48.402 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, Shiori, you're early.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:49.971 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Class duties call!

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.339 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh? Isn't it supposed
to be me and Hamano?

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.274 position:30% line:83% align:start
Crap! Did I get
the days mixed up?

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:55.977 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, don't worry.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.679 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're right, but because Mei
has a club leaders' meeting

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:00.014 position:33% line:83% align:start
after school,
she asked me to fill in.

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:01.381 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Wait, really?

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:02.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's been since middle school!

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.385 position:21% line:83% align:start
We haven't had duties
together since then, right?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.955 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wow. Yeah, I think you're right.

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:09.289 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is too good to be true!

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:12.560 position:30% line:83% align:start
Chin up, Jiro,
it's your lucky day!

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.100 position:16% line:89% align:start
It was nice. Thanks, Mei.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.902 position:24% line:83% align:start
Nice? So, your plan
to jump his bones

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.804 position:13% line:83% align:start
first thing in the morning
didn't pan out?

00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:24.572 position:27% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI coughing]

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:26.574 position:10% line:89% align:start
That was never my plan! Hush!

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:29.110 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm just teasing you. [laughs]

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:32.013 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, maybe don't jump him, but
you gotta tell him how you feel.

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:35.415 position:21% line:83% align:start
Dude, this is Yakuin
we're talking about here.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.518 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's just... I don't think Jiro

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.187 position:16% line:83% align:start
thinks of me in that way
in the slightest.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.590 position:5% line:83% align:start
Sounds to me like somebody needs
a reality check--he likes you.

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:43.925 position:10% line:89% align:start
The fact you're the only girl

00:03:44.058 --> 00:03:46.226 position:27% line:83% align:start
he talks to makes
that painfully clear.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.730 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's the problem.

00:03:48.863 --> 00:03:51.733 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's not because he likes me,
it's because he knows me.

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:55.636 position:19% line:83% align:start
Until recently, I was
the only girl he knew.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.872 position:10% line:83% align:start
You've gotta give it a shot,
and switching duties

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:01.876 position:7% line:83% align:start
gives you the perfect chance.
Don't waste my kindness, dude!

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.376 position:27% line:89% align:start
Take some action!

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:05.046 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you want him to think
of you that way, kiss him!

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.413 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ki--

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:08.015 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
If you keep skirting around it,

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.785 position:10% line:83% align:start
his fake ball and chain might
beat you to the punch!

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:14.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh, gosh, don't be sad!
It was only a joke.

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.524 position:33% line:83% align:start
You gotta be
confident in yourself!

00:04:16.657 --> 00:04:20.228 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're seriously one of
the best people I know.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.029 position:21% line:89% align:start
Did my pep talk work?

00:04:22.163 --> 00:04:23.564 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm!

00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:27.068 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI sneezes]
'Scuse me.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.268 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sick?

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:29.469 position:27% line:89% align:start
Lovesick perhaps.

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:30.872 position:27% line:89% align:start
Butt out, bestie.

00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:32.472 position:16% line:89% align:start
C'mon, love's in the air!

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:35.042 position:13% line:83% align:start
Real talk, apparently ten
practical pairs have legit

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:36.811 position:5% line:89% align:start
started dating. Isn't that wild?

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.046 position:19% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] Dang! I guess
"marriage-practical magic"

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.949 position:10% line:83% align:start
isn't total bull. We do spend
hella time with our partners.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.551 position:27% line:83% align:start
Those dummies are
just getting caught up

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:46.621 position:13% line:83% align:start
in the mood of everything,
that's all.

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:53.995 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Why the faces?

00:04:54.128 --> 00:04:56.463 position:10% line:83% align:start
No offense, girly, but you've
been watching Yakuin

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.866 position:16% line:83% align:start
like a horny hawk and us
birdwatchers have seen it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.970 position:16% line:83% align:start
As your friend, I'm going
to love whoever you love,

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:04.672 position:21% line:89% align:start
no matter what, okay?

00:05:04.806 --> 00:05:06.808 position:10% line:83% align:start
But ol' virgy-wirgy's a tough
pill for a girl to swallow.

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:07.975 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:09.877 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Akari is our pure flower baby!

00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.846 position:10% line:83% align:start
Maybe she needs another pure
flower baby to match, ya feel?

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.446 position:16% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] True, at least
she's not getting chucked

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:14.782 position:21% line:89% align:start
in some creep's van.

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:16.818 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? I don't like him!
Like, no duh!

00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:19.921 position:7% line:83% align:start
Minami is the peak of humanity
and I won't settle for less!

00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:23.124 position:7% line:83% align:start
Still down bad with the Minami
bug, huh? Totes get that, boo.

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:26.194 position:7% line:83% align:start
Fair enough, well, I guess that
brings us back to square one.

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.929 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, for real.

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:33.601 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI sighs]
Gosh, was that the last of them?

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:35.536 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah, think so.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.239 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm super sorry I made you
carry all that junk.

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.541 position:27% line:83% align:start
No prob, I could
do that in my sleep!

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:42.777 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're the best. Thanks, Jiro.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.011 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:05:45.246 --> 00:05:47.548 position:13% line:83% align:start
All that's left is to clean
the blackboard, right?

00:05:47.682 --> 00:05:50.651 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Yup! Today brought
back so many memories.

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.653 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's like we're in
middle school again.

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:55.056 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah, totally.

00:05:56.991 --> 00:05:59.694 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Come on, man,
progress the conversation!

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:05.132 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's trying to talk to you.
Just say something, just do it!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.670 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Why is my brain so empty?

00:06:09.804 --> 00:06:12.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
Oh yeah! Remember Mister Hatae?

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.075 position:24% line:83% align:start
From middle school?
Taught science?

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.944 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh? Uh, was he the one
with the kooky clothes?

00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:18.846 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh! Funny enough,
I ran into him

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.582 position:7% line:83% align:start
at the grocery store the other
day. He was wearing this bright,

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:23.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
funky shirt that made me
recognize him on sight!

00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:26.486 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's crazy!
Forgot about that guy!

00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:29.557 position:27% line:83% align:start
Nothing's changed
for the weirdo, huh?

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:35.229 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Why hasn't that doofus
read my message yet?

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:37.598 position:19% line:83% align:start
The way I said it makes
me sound uber desperate

00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:39.867 position:16% line:89% align:start
to go shopping with him.

00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:45.039 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's right, class duties. Ji--

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.609 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
He seemed really happy.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.183 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Wait a sec,
why am I hiding from them?

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:11.464 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oops!

00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:26.347 position:16% line:83% align:start
Jiro? Close your eyes and
lean down a little, please.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.416 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?!

00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:30.851 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh? Is this a dream?

00:07:30.985 --> 00:07:35.523 position:27% line:83% align:start
Close my eyes and
lean down a little?

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.125 position:13% line:89% align:start
Is she really about to...?

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:43.798 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunting]

00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.901 position:19% line:83% align:start
There was a teensy bit
of chalk dust on you.

00:07:47.034 --> 00:07:48.102 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you!

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.671 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anytime! I'm gonna find
a window and beat these.

00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:53.140 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm a creep! I smooched the air!

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.643 position:21% line:89% align:start
I should be arrested!

00:07:57.011 --> 00:07:58.913 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
We spent so much time together,

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:01.749 position:30% line:83% align:start
and we're still
right where we were.

00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:07.487 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] I knew I wouldn't
be able to do it!

00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:10.558 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry to let you down, Mei!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.031 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO sighs] Nothing ended up
happening. Could be worse.

00:08:17.164 --> 00:08:19.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I had confessed
my feelings back then

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.835 position:16% line:89% align:start
and she had shot me down,

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.437 position:19% line:83% align:start
we wouldn't be able to
hang out like we did today.

00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:25.406 position:16% line:89% align:start
When did I get so boring?

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:27.008 position:24% line:83% align:start
If she has a single
nice memory of me

00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:30.211 position:19% line:83% align:start
tucked away somewhere,
it'd be a miracle.

00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:35.249 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Watch out gloomy,
coming through.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.794 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm in milk mood, but I heated
up way too much. Want some?

00:08:46.927 --> 00:08:49.997 position:7% line:83% align:start
Yeah, that sounds pretty good.
Appreciate it.

00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:52.600 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
You seem depressed.

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:54.001 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nah, I'm fine.

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:57.371 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Cool. Did things
go well with Sakurazaka?

00:08:57.506 --> 00:08:59.707 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh, well enough.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.876 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't even, you're like
the worst liar ever.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:04.712 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Hush! If you know it went
bad, then don't ask about it!

00:09:04.845 --> 00:09:06.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
You poor baby.
Don't cry bout' it.

00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.149 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Not helping!

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:12.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
Uh-- Whoa, the sky is
crazy bright right now.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.923 position:19% line:83% align:start
No kidding! S'like all
the stars came out to play!

00:09:16.057 --> 00:09:17.725 position:5% line:89% align:start
Right? Feels like I'm in space.

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:20.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow! Too bad Minami's
not here right now.

00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:24.865 position:7% line:83% align:start
I bet the stars would look even
prettier if I was with him.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:28.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
Boo-frikkety-hoo.
You're stuck with boring me.

00:09:28.335 --> 00:09:31.038 position:7% line:83% align:start
I bet the stars would prefer to
have Tenjin looking at them.

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:34.108 position:27% line:83% align:start
Apparently I have
"perverted eyes."

00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.945 position:16% line:83% align:start
Not to be weird, but try
using my first name real quick.

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:40.181 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO yelps]
That's freakin' hot!

00:09:40.314 --> 00:09:42.450 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
It's not hard, dude. A-ka-ri!

00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:45.853 position:10% line:83% align:start
Where'd that even come from?
And what if I don't want to?

00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:48.622 position:13% line:83% align:start
Please, you call Sakurazaka
"Shiori" all day long.

00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:50.658 position:35% line:83% align:start
News flash,
I'm your wife, not her.

00:09:50.791 --> 00:09:53.094 position:7% line:89% align:start
Gimme a break! It's different.

00:09:53.227 --> 00:09:56.464 position:30% line:83% align:start
Shiori is just,
well, I don't know.

00:09:56.597 --> 00:09:59.266 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Too embarrassed to call
a hottie by her first name?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.470 position:16% line:83% align:start
That's our virg for ya!
Number one in all Japan!

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:05.906 position:19% line:83% align:start
No, I'm not letting you
bully me into it. Nice try.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.409 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Boo.

00:10:08.543 --> 00:10:12.379 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, whatevs. I only
mention it cause I love my name.

00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:13.848 position:5% line:89% align:start
Its sick that it means "light,"

00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:15.883 position:19% line:83% align:start
plus its written using
the character for "star."

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:17.451 position:16% line:89% align:start
And like, not to be emo,

00:10:17.586 --> 00:10:19.987 position:13% line:83% align:start
but sometimes my confidence
starts to bottom out.

00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:22.323 position:13% line:83% align:start
If that happens to me when
we're at home or out together

00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.759 position:10% line:83% align:start
or whatever, it would help if
you could call me by my name.

00:10:25.893 --> 00:10:28.195 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think that it would
make me feel a lot better.

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:29.564 position:16% line:89% align:start
So get in some practice!

00:10:29.697 --> 00:10:32.633 position:10% line:83% align:start
You don't wanna be unprepared
when the time comes!

00:10:36.605 --> 00:10:37.705 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Aka...ri.

00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:39.440 position:33% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasps]

00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:42.276 position:10% line:83% align:start
Funny. In a way, I'm kind of
glad I don't have a cool name

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:44.945 position:10% line:83% align:start
like you do. I'm pretty sure
I'd spend my whole life

00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:48.716 position:16% line:83% align:start
failing to live up to it.
But your name, it works.

00:10:48.849 --> 00:10:52.686 position:27% line:83% align:start
The name "Akari"
suits you really well.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
Uh... [grunting]

00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:57.424 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, that was
way too much.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:11:00.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's just pretend it never
happened, okay?

00:11:01.596 --> 00:11:03.230 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
No way.

00:11:03.364 --> 00:11:05.132 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.440 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Say it again. C'mon!

00:11:13.575 --> 00:11:15.743 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's annoying that I'm all
sweet and call you Jiro

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.745 position:24% line:83% align:start
when you refuse to
use my first name!

00:11:17.878 --> 00:11:19.346 position:24% line:83% align:start
I don't get what's
"annoying" about that!

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.749 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's like you're not
even in love! Just me!

00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:24.919 position:16% line:83% align:start
And "annoying's" the way
you'd describe that?

00:11:26.287 --> 00:11:28.722 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH grunt]

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:31.192 position:33% line:89% align:start
In love, huh?

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.995 position:19% line:89% align:start
No. It's not like that.

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:38.699 position:21% line:83% align:start
It was hypothetical.
Just practical stuff.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:43.505 position:27% line:83% align:start
Silly me. My bad.
I should've known, duh.

00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:47.474 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've just never had anyone say
anything like that to me before.

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:49.410 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Okay, goodnight!

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:51.378 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh, goodnight.

00:11:55.816 --> 00:12:00.888 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She has Tenjin!
She didn't mean it seriously.

00:12:01.021 --> 00:12:04.992 position:5% line:89% align:start
Don't be delusional, Jiro. Jeez.

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:09.531 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Crap. I hate this!

00:12:09.664 --> 00:12:14.235 position:27% line:83% align:start
What do I do now?
I'm so confused.

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.104 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TEACHER A] It happens
around this time every year.

00:12:17.238 --> 00:12:19.473 position:19% line:83% align:start
Students' focus shifts
toward the practical

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:20.874 position:5% line:89% align:start
and away from their course work,

00:12:21.008 --> 00:12:22.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
your class has it
worse than usual.

00:12:22.577 --> 00:12:24.778 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, starting now, we are
going to be implementing

00:12:24.912 --> 00:12:26.880 position:10% line:89% align:start
a series of additional exams.

00:12:27.014 --> 00:12:28.349 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just like with your
regular tests,

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:30.951 position:16% line:83% align:start
those who fail will take
supplementary lessons.

00:12:31.085 --> 00:12:32.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
The key difference
is that your score

00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:34.955 position:13% line:83% align:start
will be combined with your
practical partner's score.

00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:37.324 position:10% line:83% align:start
Supplementary lessons will be
taken together, as well.

00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:39.260 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Shenanigans! Shenanigans!

00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:41.161 position:13% line:83% align:start
You've gotta be kidding me,
they don't tell you

00:12:41.295 --> 00:12:42.796 position:24% line:83% align:start
it's sold out till
you're at checkout?

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.566 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why would they even list
it then? This sucks toes.

00:12:44.699 --> 00:12:46.433 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] This is bad.
Depending on the subject,

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
my performance is pretty far
below average! I'm a goner!

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.339 position:16% line:83% align:start
No way in hell Shiori and
Tenjin get anything less

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:55.776 position:13% line:83% align:start
than straight A's. If I get
anything lower than a B...

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:56.810 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo, bitch.

00:12:56.944 --> 00:12:58.647 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Eh?

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.080 position:19% line:89% align:start
C stands for castrate.

00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.516 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
My manhood!

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.084 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Karaoke? You know it,
I'm so down!

00:13:04.218 --> 00:13:08.055 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Hold up. Is Watanabe any
good when it comes to academics?

00:13:08.188 --> 00:13:09.724 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
So, like, death metal mode?

00:13:09.857 --> 00:13:10.958 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She comes to class,
but she hangs out with friends

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:13.027 position:19% line:89% align:start
every day after school.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.895 position:13% line:89% align:start
When does she study? Or...

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:16.997 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo! Glad I ran into you, Jiro.

00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:18.499 position:10% line:89% align:start
Buy us some fabric softener.

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.868 position:24% line:83% align:start
Get our fave with
the green flowers.

00:13:21.001 --> 00:13:23.738 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sure. Also, we really
need to start talking

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.205 position:30% line:83% align:start
about this test
they're springing on us.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.709 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Can't right now.
I got invited to karaoke.

00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:28.976 position:13% line:89% align:start
Some dudes from this fancy

00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:31.045 position:27% line:83% align:start
all boys' school
are gonna be there.

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:33.414 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is somebody jelly? Aw, so sad.

00:13:33.548 --> 00:13:34.815 position:21% line:83% align:start
I didn't realize that
it would bug you.

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:36.317 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
It doesn't!

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:37.484 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you positive that
you're going to do good

00:13:37.619 --> 00:13:38.385 position:21% line:89% align:start
on this test, though?

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.688 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.288 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah! Duh!

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:43.824 position:19% line:83% align:start
Stuff like that always
works out for me somehow.

00:13:43.957 --> 00:13:47.094 position:7% line:83% align:start
How can you be so sure? Aren't
there a couple of subjects

00:13:47.227 --> 00:13:51.131 position:10% line:83% align:start
you struggle with or concepts
you don't understand?

00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:54.168 position:13% line:89% align:start
Subjects I struggle with...

00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:57.838 position:16% line:83% align:start
Could we rehash what the
subjects are real quick?

00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:00.508 position:30% line:83% align:start
Real good one.
Absolute knee-slapper.

00:14:00.642 --> 00:14:03.410 position:16% line:83% align:start
Chill. If I start working
tomorrow, I'll be totally fine.

00:14:03.545 --> 00:14:07.047 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have nothing to worry
about, pinky promise.

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:08.415 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Let's go.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.685 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can't go with you,
they asked for me.

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:13.153 position:10% line:83% align:start
You understand what'll happen
if you blow off this test,

00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:16.023 position:16% line:83% align:start
don't you? You'll end up
farther away from Tenjin!

00:14:16.156 --> 00:14:17.091 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yeah, I guess, but--

00:14:17.224 --> 00:14:18.727 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
But nothing!

00:14:18.859 --> 00:14:20.562 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hang out with your friends some
other time, it's just karaoke!

00:14:20.695 --> 00:14:22.229 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dude, it's not my friends!

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:24.666 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those guys asked for me
specifically to come with them.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:26.166 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's hard to turn down.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.937 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm a guy.
I'm asking for you, too.

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.973 position:19% line:89% align:start
Come on. Let's go home.

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:40.582 position:16% line:83% align:start
Well, fine! I'm not dumb,
I get it! This sucks.

00:14:40.715 --> 00:14:42.449 position:21% line:89% align:start
You're so desperate.

00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:45.953 position:13% line:83% align:start
You only give a crap cause
Sakurazaka's involved.

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:49.858 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MEI] Oh, okay! I just have
to go like this, right?

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.393 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
That's right! You'll do great.

00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:54.128 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
You're a good tutor, dude!

00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:56.296 position:16% line:89% align:start
You make this stuff easy!

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.299 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yeesh, these additional
tests are so mean.

00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:01.268 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess you're probably not
too worried with Tenjin

00:15:01.402 --> 00:15:03.003 position:7% line:89% align:start
as your partner, but trust me,

00:15:03.137 --> 00:15:04.905 position:27% line:83% align:start
you two geniuses
are in the minority.

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:06.473 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
You're a super-fast learner!

00:15:06.608 --> 00:15:08.308 position:21% line:83% align:start
You really shouldn't
be worried either.

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:11.278 position:16% line:83% align:start
Eh, thanks. I'm confident
when it comes to sports,

00:15:11.412 --> 00:15:13.681 position:16% line:83% align:start
but school is certifiably
not my thing.

00:15:13.815 --> 00:15:15.215 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI laughs]

00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:17.819 position:13% line:83% align:start
You gave me a good starting
point though. Thank you!

00:15:17.951 --> 00:15:19.453 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Any old time!

00:15:19.587 --> 00:15:21.288 position:19% line:83% align:start
In return, maybe I can
tutor you in the type of stuff

00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:23.123 position:5% line:89% align:start
you're clearly struggling with.

00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:25.225 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
What type is that?

00:15:25.359 --> 00:15:26.927 position:19% line:89% align:start
Just the kissing type.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:28.929 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI gasps]
You meanie!

00:15:29.062 --> 00:15:30.665 position:35% line:89% align:start
[laughing]

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.634 position:7% line:83% align:start
I nearly popped a lung when I
heard about your chalk evasion

00:15:32.767 --> 00:15:33.668 position:10% line:89% align:start
that went down the other day.

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:35.335 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Don't remind me!

00:15:35.469 --> 00:15:37.839 position:10% line:83% align:start
I can perfectly imagine the
doofy look on Yakuin's face.

00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:39.507 position:19% line:89% align:start
Stop talking about it!

00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:40.642 position:30% line:89% align:start
[MEI laughing]

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:43.645 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI gasps]

00:15:47.682 --> 00:15:50.752 position:21% line:83% align:start
It's funny, last time
we did this, you know...

00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:53.555 position:35% line:89% align:start
[inaudible]

00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:55.557 position:16% line:89% align:start
Agh! This is killing me!

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:59.627 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dude, you've only done a
couple of problems so far.

00:15:59.761 --> 00:16:02.362 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] The future is bleak.
She picks things up quickly

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:04.465 position:19% line:83% align:start
when I teach her, but
she seems to have some

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:07.669 position:27% line:83% align:start
deep-rooted issue
with studying itself.

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:10.304 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, let's keep trying
for a little bit longer.

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:13.207 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm by no means a whiz, but I
can help you with some math.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
We can figure out
the rest together.

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:20.280 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Awesome. Anything for
darling Sakurazaka, right?

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:22.517 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh? What are you
mumbling about?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.186 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI grunts]
Oh, just nunya.

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:41.401 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO growls]

00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:43.771 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so bored.

00:16:43.905 --> 00:16:45.773 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can you think of something
more fun we can do together?

00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:47.107 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO gasps]

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:48.910 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I'll do anything.

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:52.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
Whatever your heart
desires, so do I.

00:16:53.515 --> 00:16:58.218 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
So? What do you want, Daddy?

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.529 position:19% line:83% align:start
Daddy wants you to hit
the books and study!

00:17:07.662 --> 00:17:10.197 position:7% line:83% align:start
King of the nerds would rather
play with books than boobies,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
huh? I'm floored,
surprise of the century.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.201 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Listen, you--

00:17:14.334 --> 00:17:15.803 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Missed opportunity, chief.

00:17:15.937 --> 00:17:20.942 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can't just seduce your
way out of studying! Jeez.

00:17:21.074 --> 00:17:24.344 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey look, Watanabe.
You had it right up to here.

00:17:24.478 --> 00:17:25.747 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.751 position:13% line:83% align:start
Nice. Try to finish it out
like we did that last one.

00:17:29.884 --> 00:17:33.086 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Okay. So, two X is T, right?

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.723 position:24% line:83% align:start
I should bring this
bad boy over here.

00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:39.426 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, hell yeah!
I mathed that shiz!

00:17:42.564 --> 00:17:46.400 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Finally. It's over!

00:17:46.534 --> 00:17:48.168 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
You worked really hard!

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.505 position:19% line:83% align:start
We made it way further
than I thought we would.

00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:55.610 position:7% line:83% align:start
I told you I was gonna be fine.
I'm just a genius like that.

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:57.645 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Big time, I believe it.

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:01.081 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She seems to be praise
motivated, so might as well.

00:18:01.214 --> 00:18:05.285 position:10% line:83% align:start
Uh! What? I'm not kidding, I
think that you're really smart!

00:18:05.419 --> 00:18:09.791 position:5% line:83% align:start
Well, thanks a lot, Mister Jiro.
You're so easy!

00:18:09.924 --> 00:18:13.561 position:10% line:83% align:start
[laughs] One little "Mister"
and your heart is racing, huh?

00:18:13.695 --> 00:18:15.830 position:16% line:83% align:start
Guys always seem a little
too into that kinda crap.

00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:17.264 position:33% line:89% align:start
Why is that?

00:18:17.397 --> 00:18:18.833 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Come on, I don't
speak for all men!

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.334 position:13% line:83% align:start
Forget it, let's just clean
this junk and eat dinner.

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:23.738 position:5% line:89% align:start
Okay. As you wish, Master Jiro.

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.238 position:33% line:89% align:start
[JIRO growls]

00:18:25.372 --> 00:18:27.041 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She's teasing me
more than usual today.

00:18:27.174 --> 00:18:28.943 position:24% line:89% align:start
Well, how was that?

00:18:29.077 --> 00:18:30.545 position:27% line:83% align:start
More of a master
than a mister guy?

00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:34.048 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] All that I am is a hungry
and annoyed guy!

00:18:34.181 --> 00:18:36.784 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stop doing that and
help me clean up!

00:18:37.885 --> 00:18:39.386 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm pissed off.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
Your loser self is better
at school stuff than I am.

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:44.559 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just let me get to you so I can
win at something today, jeez.

00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:46.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
No way I'm gonna
let you get to me.

00:18:46.661 --> 00:18:48.696 position:21% line:83% align:start
And this isn't about
winning or losing, so--

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.868 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO gasping]
Hey. No fair!

00:18:54.002 --> 00:18:57.972 position:7% line:89% align:start
Tell me, does this get to you?

00:18:58.106 --> 00:19:00.775 position:16% line:89% align:start
Your heart racing, virg?

00:19:00.908 --> 00:19:04.344 position:10% line:83% align:start
Cut it out! Don't ignore me.
Let me win and we can eat!

00:19:04.478 --> 00:19:05.813 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Think, Jiro!

You sneak glances all the time.

C'mon little man, you

00:21:12.206 --> 00:21:14.709 position:13% line:83% align:start

00:21:19.046 --> 00:21:22.216 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just want things to be normal
and chill like they usually are.

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:23.818 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
It's not like I'm panicking over

00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:25.285 position:24% line:89% align:start
my situation alone.

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:28.589 position:10% line:83% align:start
The sooner you get to be with
Tenjin, the better, right?

00:21:28.723 --> 00:21:29.991 position:24% line:83% align:start
From the second we
were paired together,

00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:31.692 position:24% line:83% align:start
you've been the one
earning us points.

00:21:31.826 --> 00:21:34.562 position:24% line:83% align:start
More than anything,
I've just held us back.

00:21:34.695 --> 00:21:36.296 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm sure you would've
thrived no matter who

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:37.999 position:21% line:89% align:start
you were paired with.

00:21:38.132 --> 00:21:40.701 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're naturally good at this,
and you've helped me a ton.

00:21:40.835 --> 00:21:42.937 position:5% line:83% align:start
I figured now that this academic
stuff has been thrown

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.739 position:21% line:83% align:start
into the mix, that I
might actually be able

00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:48.743 position:7% line:83% align:start
to help you out with something,
too, at least a bit.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.146 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] If there wasn't
a tissue up your nose,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.548 position:13% line:89% align:start
that would've sounded cool.

00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:54.849 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, let me and my
tissue live in peace,

00:21:54.982 --> 00:21:56.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm trying my best here,
you got that?!

00:21:56.784 --> 00:22:00.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
Don't say anything about
my nose at school!

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.793 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] If we keep doing
well and reach A rank,

00:22:05.927 --> 00:22:08.495 position:13% line:83% align:start
we'll be changing partners
before we know it.

00:22:08.629 --> 00:22:09.897 position:16% line:89% align:start
For the rest of my life,

00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:12.934 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll never get to welcome
Jiro home again.

00:22:13.067 --> 00:22:16.037 position:13% line:83% align:start
The scent of our favorite
fabric softener will fade,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.241 position:13% line:83% align:start
and our clothes will start
to smell like other people.

00:22:20.373 --> 00:22:22.243 position:21% line:83% align:start
But that's what we've
gotta do, right?

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:26.514 position:10% line:83% align:start
Besides, this is just a silly
class assignment after all.

00:23:57.571 --> 00:24:00.641 position:5% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I did worse on our modern
Japanese test than she did?

00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:03.044 position:5% line:83% align:start
"What can be gained from finding
something more enjoyable

00:24:03.177 --> 00:24:05.513 position:16% line:83% align:start
than studying?" What kind
of question is that?

00:24:05.646 --> 00:24:07.148 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so bored.

00:24:07.281 --> 00:24:09.116 position:13% line:83% align:start
Can you think of something
more fun we can do together?

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.751 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh?!

00:24:10.885 --> 00:24:14.121 position:5% line:83% align:start
Censored! Nothing I could come
up with was appropriate at all!

00:24:14.255 --> 00:24:17.725 position:13% line:83% align:start
Next time, "A Male Virgin,
but No Female Virgin."
