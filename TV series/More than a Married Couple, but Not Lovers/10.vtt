A hotel?!

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.184 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Lookin' good!

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.954 position:24% line:83% align:start
Kamo, I didn't know
you were such an artiste!

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.355 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Yeah, I wouldn't've taken you

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.090 position:10% line:89% align:start
for the detail0oriented type.

Craftsmen Kamo's
Western-style castle

will bring your princess
fantasies to life!

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.496 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] She meant the beach
in front of the hotel?

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:31.733 position:24% line:83% align:start
To ground our sandy
stronghold in reality,

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.801 position:19% line:83% align:start
I based it on England's
Conwy Castle

00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:35.369 position:13% line:89% align:start
with its protruding towers.

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:38.372 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
That's something.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:39.974 position:27% line:83% align:start
You better savor
every minute of this,

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.376 position:13% line:83% align:start
the best chance we have of
seeing bikini-clad females

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.580 position:13% line:83% align:start
this up close and personal
again is VR, bro!

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:47.347 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah, that's facts.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.449 position:13% line:83% align:start
Usually, Shiori buttons her
shirt all the way up,

but now, her chesticles are...

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:55.823 position:10% line:89% align:start
Gods above! How I thank you!

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:57.525 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Hey, Jiro? Are you okay?

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:00.028 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?! Uh, yeah! The okay-est!

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.461 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's good!

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:03.063 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was thinking that we
could make a tunnel.

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:05.198 position:19% line:83% align:start
We did it all the time
when we were kids.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.267 position:24% line:83% align:start
Remember? We dig in
from opposite sides

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.736 position:10% line:89% align:start
and join hands in the middle.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.337 position:30% line:89% align:start
We join hands?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.141 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes, sir! Ready?
Slide it in. Slowly.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.375 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Okay.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.345 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Uh, maybe a little deeper?

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:21.849 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
Oh! There you are, Jiro!

00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:25.954 position:10% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Look at us, playing
in the sand like old times.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.756 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh-- [laughs]

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.192 position:10% line:89% align:start
So lovey dovey. That's barf.

Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

[NATSUMI] The mystical hands
say you two grab the grub!

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:13.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
Huh? Boo! No! We're, like,
always together, boring.

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:18.766 position:13% line:83% align:start
Jeez, dude, don't sound so
excited. It's crazy crowded.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.703 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] And it looks like
most everybody's a couple.

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:25.606 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm about done with this
normie infested place.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.542 position:5% line:89% align:start
Well, that explains the couples!

00:03:27.675 --> 00:03:29.610 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Hells yeah,
let's take advantage!

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:32.212 position:10% line:89% align:start
What? But we're not a couple!

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:34.716 position:10% line:89% align:start
Being married totally counts.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.216 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.021 position:10% line:83% align:start

tomato! You with me, lil' red?

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:41.756 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
We're mock-married! Mock!

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.558 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
They don't have to know that.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.292 position:33% line:83% align:start
[EMPLOYEE A]
Next customer, please!

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.328 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Let's see...
Three yakisobas for sure.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.832 position:21% line:83% align:start
Couples can upgrade
the size, no charge.

00:03:50.965 --> 00:03:53.400 position:35% line:83% align:start
Whoa! Sick!
That's like so nice of you!

00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:55.803 position:13% line:89% align:start
In that case, supersize me!

00:03:55.937 --> 00:03:57.805 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EMPLOYEE A] Three large
yakisobas for the beautiful

man, my guy. I'm jealous!

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.077 position:24% line:89% align:start
[laughs nervously]

00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:05.947 position:19% line:83% align:start
[EMPLOYEE A] All right,
you crazy kids are number 13.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.249 position:30% line:89% align:start
Great. Thanks.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.985 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
What was with the dopey laugh?

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.654 position:13% line:83% align:start
If you want this discount,
make it more believable!

00:04:13.788 --> 00:04:15.223 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh? What exactly could I

00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.457 position:27% line:83% align:start
have done better
in that situation?

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:20.094 position:7% line:83% align:start
Just everything. You should've
put your arm around me

00:04:20.228 --> 00:04:23.998 position:21% line:83% align:start
and been like, "Yeah.
I'm one lucky boy, mister."

00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
That'd be the dream.
Minami would've done it.

00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:29.436 position:19% line:83% align:start
People don't say things
like that out of nowhere.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
[EMPLOYEE A] Number 13,
your order's ready!

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.841 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'll go get it.

00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:36.744 position:21% line:83% align:start

[MAN A]
Hey! You alone?

Crap, I got completely
turned around.

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:49.389 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Does Akari know
that guy? I can't tell.

00:04:49.524 --> 00:04:51.759 position:16% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Jiro, over here!

Is this dork your type?
Ha, that's wild.

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:59.700 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Are you two
acquaintances of hers?

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:01.502 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hell yeah! As of right now,

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:03.403 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're acquainted,
wouldn't you say?

[JIRO]
That's a "save me" face.

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:15.348 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, bro, you're here
with the chick, right?

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.618 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MAN A]
Tell us her name, will ya?

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:20.487 position:27% line:83% align:start
For some reason,
she's too shy to share.

00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:22.355 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MAN B] At least tell us
where you're stayin'.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.025 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's party.

00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.561 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Uh, sorry, but would
you mind letting go of her?

00:05:26.694 --> 00:05:28.229 position:19% line:89% align:start
She doesn't like that.

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.131 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa! It's a white knight!

00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:31.999 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you tryna bag her?

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.668 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
No, um...

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.303 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MAN A] The only thing
this virgin can bag

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:40.473 position:7% line:83% align:start
is his right hand! A girl like
this is too much for him.

Bro! Monogamy?

Post-Betrothed? Oh,
sorry dude, our mistake!

00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:55.756 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MAN A]
Yeah, uh, wish you the best!

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.361 position:19% line:89% align:start
Whoa, Jiro. That was...

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.598 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I'm sorry!

00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:05.766 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't come up with
a good lie on the spot.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.602 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't believe I
called you my wife.

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.637 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you hated that crap!

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.371 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I feel like calling
you my girlfriend

00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:12.673 position:13% line:89% align:start
would've been, you know...

00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:14.374 position:21% line:83% align:start
Stop! You're pissing
me off, dude!

00:06:14.508 --> 00:06:16.177 position:21% line:89% align:start
I told you I'm sorry!

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.946 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Did I say I hated
when you called me that?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.314 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:23.885 position:16% line:83% align:start
No. Don't assume things.
To be, like, perfectly honest.

00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:29.090 position:10% line:83% align:start
Well, I thought it was cool.
I guess. But now...

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:35.229 position:7% line:83% align:start
You, like, totally ruined it!
No wonder you don't get girls.

00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:37.298 position:5% line:89% align:start
You shouldn't be so apologetic,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.535 position:13% line:83% align:start
and I shouldn't be so quick
to get excited. But whatever.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:42.937 position:27% line:83% align:start
Just show me that
you're man enough

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.506 position:30% line:83% align:start
to even use me
for practice, okay?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.708 position:5% line:89% align:start
Wait, what do you mean by that?

00:06:47.842 --> 00:06:50.044 position:41% line:83% align:start

Use your nerd brain! Let's go.

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.514 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh? But... Hey! Quit pushing!

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:56.617 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] They're gonna flame us
for being slow because of you.

00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:58.485 position:21% line:83% align:start
No way, none of that
was my fault!

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.755 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Your slow-ass walking is!

00:07:00.888 --> 00:07:05.026 position:41% line:83% align:start

That was... too much.

Paradise at last.

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:16.837 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] How weirdly nostalgic.
This feels like a school trip.

00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:20.741 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, Mei, are you
sunburned at all?

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
Nah. I used some oil,
so I'm good.

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:26.781 position:13% line:83% align:start
But I guess it takes longer
than a day to even out a tan.

00:07:26.914 --> 00:07:31.018 position:7% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Look, the lines around
here are fading a teensy.

00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:33.220 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're looking a
little tan yourself!

00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:36.456 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Whoa, you're right!
I even put on sunscreen.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.993 position:21% line:83% align:start
C'mon, let's hurry up
and get in.

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:42.630 position:19% line:83% align:start
By that point I was big
mad, so I was like,

00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:44.999 position:7% line:83% align:start
"Yo. Instead of critiquing me,
let's calculate

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:47.568 position:10% line:83% align:start
how much weight you've put on
since we started dating!"

00:07:47.702 --> 00:07:48.970 position:27% line:89% align:start
He's delusional.

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:51.572 position:21% line:83% align:start
Guys can't expect us
to be perfect 24/7.

00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:53.274 position:33% line:89% align:start
So not cool.

00:07:53.407 --> 00:07:56.243 position:7% line:83% align:start
That noodle couldn't comprehend
your grindset if he tried.

00:07:56.377 --> 00:07:57.778 position:10% line:89% align:start
Dude will be single for life.

00:07:57.912 --> 00:07:59.880 position:19% line:89% align:start
You can say that again.

00:08:00.014 --> 00:08:01.716 position:33% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI, MEI]
We can hear everything.

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] Anyway, since we're
on the subject of guys,

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:05.219 position:24% line:89% align:start
how's yours, Akari?

00:08:05.353 --> 00:08:06.787 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Spill right meow.

00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:07.855 position:44% line:89% align:start
Jiro?

00:08:07.989 --> 00:08:09.123 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
He seems like he'd have

00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:11.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
unrealistic expectations
about women.

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:14.662 position:7% line:83% align:start
She used to complain about him,
like, every time we chatted.

00:08:14.795 --> 00:08:16.464 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] Yeah, you totally
didn't think you two

00:08:16.597 --> 00:08:18.199 position:16% line:89% align:start
would last for this long.

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:22.470 position:7% line:83% align:start
Of course I didn't because the
guy is, like, unbearably sloppy!

00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.739 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
So, he leaves the house a mess?

00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:26.707 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Sloppy can be fun, girl!

00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:29.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
Is he extra sweet cause
he has no experience?

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.046 position:10% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] In the end, kindness
is the most important thing.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.715 position:19% line:83% align:start
He could be a sex god,
but if he's rude, it'll suck.

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:37.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
My ex two exes ago was so
selfish in bed that I, like,

00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:40.621 position:13% line:83% align:start
legitimately thought about
putting him on a point system.

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:42.156 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Hey, guys?

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Shiori and I have heard
everything you've said.

00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:48.195 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's fine! You should come
and soak with us, girly!

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:49.430 position:21% line:89% align:start
You, too, Sakurazaka!

00:08:49.563 --> 00:08:50.898 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:08:51.032 --> 00:08:52.533 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SACHI] How do you two
talk about the nasty?

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:55.936 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh! Well, I, I, uh...

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
After hearing the stuff
you guys just said,

00:08:58.472 --> 00:09:00.241 position:7% line:89% align:start
it's about caring for someone.

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:02.076 position:16% line:83% align:start
You have to give yourself
to your partner

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.545 position:24% line:83% align:start
in a way that shows
you really trust them.

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:05.846 position:16% line:89% align:start
I think it boils down to

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.149 position:21% line:83% align:start
both parties wanting
to be truly seen.

00:09:08.282 --> 00:09:10.351 position:19% line:83% align:start
For me, it's not about
being good or bad.

00:09:10.484 --> 00:09:12.620 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's about looking deep
down inside their soul

00:09:12.753 --> 00:09:16.223 position:10% line:83% align:start
and being brave enough to let
them look deep inside yours.

00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:17.658 position:35% line:89% align:start
[MEI gasps]

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:19.427 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
That was so sexy!

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.264 position:10% line:83% align:start
Dang, girl! Are you a psychic
cause you totally read my mind.

00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.567 position:13% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] Not to be, like,
creepy, but will you marry me?

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:28.335 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MEI] I'm gonna need
some personal space!

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:31.572 position:7% line:83% align:start
Sorry for all the raunchy talk
the second you came over here.

00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:33.374 position:30% line:83% align:start
Huh? Oh my gosh,
it's really fine.

00:09:33.508 --> 00:09:35.176 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's me who should apologize.

00:09:35.309 --> 00:09:38.646 position:10% line:83% align:start
I do not have much experience
in that department,

00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.381 position:19% line:89% align:start
so I can't contribute.

00:09:40.515 --> 00:09:42.950 position:10% line:89% align:start
No way! You're like, so cute!

00:09:43.084 --> 00:09:46.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
I get it though.
That stuff's rough.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.155 position:13% line:83% align:start
When it comes to experience
being with dudes,

00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:50.691 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm like a trillion laps
behind those two.

00:09:50.825 --> 00:09:52.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
Same, but at least I'm
learning something.

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:57.298 position:16% line:83% align:start
[laughs] Okay, sis, I dig
the positive outlook!

00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:05.507 position:30% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI, AKARI]
If it was with Jiro...

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:08.909 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Akari! Kitty cat is rolling out!

00:10:09.043 --> 00:10:10.344 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kay!

00:10:13.848 --> 00:10:14.615 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:14.748 --> 00:10:16.417 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:18.352 position:16% line:89% align:start
Was the men's bath nice?

00:10:18.486 --> 00:10:19.820 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh, yeah.

00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:24.992 position:27% line:83% align:start
Cool, ours, too.
Aw, you got sunburned.

00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:28.295 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tell me about it.
My shower roasted me alive.

00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:30.565 position:24% line:83% align:start
The back of my neck
was extra bad.

00:10:30.698 --> 00:10:33.535 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Hang on a sec. I've got you.

00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.537 position:19% line:89% align:start
Pop a squat. I'll help.

00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.071 position:41% line:89% align:start
Uhh...

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:39.940 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Dayum! It's more
noticeable that I thought.

00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:42.743 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Hey, so, uh, shouldn't
you get back to your room?

00:10:42.877 --> 00:10:45.446 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's your deal?
Do you want me to go away?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.014 position:38% line:89% align:start
I don't.

00:10:47.148 --> 00:10:49.316 position:13% line:83% align:start
It just might look weird if
we're alone for too long.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.554 position:5% line:89% align:start
They'll make fun of us for sure.

00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:54.388 position:19% line:89% align:start
You worry way too much.

00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:57.358 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hold up, is your neck
not ticklish at all?

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:58.893 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh, guess not.

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:01.762 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even since I was little,
I've never really been ticklish.

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:03.364 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Are you ticklish here?

00:11:03.497 --> 00:11:04.899 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:06.467 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] You can't be serious!
Not even a giggle?

00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:10.671 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Get the heck off me!
What if someone sees us?

00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:14.909 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.513 position:21% line:83% align:start
We haven't done this
yet today, y'know.

00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:20.981 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Well, we're not in
the practical right now.

00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:23.083 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I know,
but ever since we got here

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:25.352 position:27% line:83% align:start
there's been this
distance between us.

00:11:25.486 --> 00:11:27.188 position:21% line:89% align:start
It just feels weird.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:30.758 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please, Jiro, treat me
like you do at home.

00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:34.596 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yo, Akari! Hey, uh...
Am I interrupting?

00:11:34.728 --> 00:11:38.699 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nuh-uh! I was just telling Jiro
he should buy me a drink.

00:11:38.832 --> 00:11:40.734 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'd crush some apple juice.

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:42.604 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Dude! I'm not gonna pay!

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:44.673 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yo richie, buy me a soda.

00:11:44.805 --> 00:11:47.308 position:21% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunts, sighs]

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:48.610 position:16% line:89% align:start
Get a load of this crap.

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:50.110 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm done with him
for real this time.

00:11:50.244 --> 00:11:54.014 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, so, Takimiya?
You wanted soda, didn't you?

00:11:54.148 --> 00:11:55.416 position:41% line:83% align:start
[SACHI]
Yeah! Chef's choice!

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.120 position:30% line:83% align:start
Aka-- Watanabe,
what did you want again?

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:01.922 position:38% line:89% align:start
Watanabe?

00:12:02.856 --> 00:12:03.924 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Apple juice.

00:12:04.058 --> 00:12:06.827 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh... Got it.

00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:10.231 position:24% line:83% align:start
Thanks for the bev!
Okay, so I should totally

00:12:10.364 --> 00:12:11.932 position:21% line:83% align:start
block his number now,
shouldn't I?

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:15.402 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, good. It feels like I
stepped on a land mine.

00:12:15.537 --> 00:12:18.806 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, it was a good
life while it lasted.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.649 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Be there.

00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:29.383 position:44% line:89% align:start
'Kay.

00:12:32.953 --> 00:12:35.122 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Hey, wait, where's Akari?

00:12:35.256 --> 00:12:37.157 position:24% line:83% align:start
She mentioned the
convenience store.

00:12:37.291 --> 00:12:40.761 position:7% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI] Uh? But it's time for
our mega-fun card game party.

00:12:40.894 --> 00:12:43.063 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Uh, have you seen my bro Jiro?

00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:45.899 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MINAMI] He said he was
gonna wander around.

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:47.901 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] That's weird--
are the shops even open?

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:50.170 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
I bet the convenience store is.

00:12:50.304 --> 00:12:51.673 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
What a turd.

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:53.974 position:21% line:83% align:start
I could use a change
of pace, you?

00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:03.217 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh, I'm really sorry.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.587 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Typical. You have
no idea why I'm angry,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.455 position:13% line:83% align:start
yet you come out swingin'
with a half-assed apology.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.358 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Yeah, I don't know
why you're angry, but...

00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:12.226 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know I'm sorry.

00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.161 position:10% line:89% align:start
Stop! Don't say you're sorry

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:16.864 position:13% line:83% align:start
if you don't even know what
you're sorry for! Are you dumb?

00:13:16.997 --> 00:13:20.267 position:10% line:89% align:start
Kind of! I'm sorr-- I get it.

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:21.969 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:13:24.805 --> 00:13:27.575 position:13% line:89% align:start
Whoa, dude! What are you...

00:13:31.613 --> 00:13:32.647 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
The swimsuit.

00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:34.214 position:16% line:89% align:start
We're both at the beach,

00:13:34.348 --> 00:13:37.217 position:19% line:83% align:start
and I told you that I'd
save this suit for you.

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:39.920 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
She was being serious? For real?

00:13:40.054 --> 00:13:41.488 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I was hyped up
for this time together,

00:13:41.623 --> 00:13:44.224 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you keep worrying
about how people see us.

00:13:44.358 --> 00:13:46.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
When I try to talk to you,
you don't care.

00:13:46.728 --> 00:13:50.264 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's like I'm the only
excited one. I hate that.

00:13:50.397 --> 00:13:53.601 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
She "hates that"? Wait a second.

00:13:53.735 --> 00:13:57.104 position:5% line:89% align:start
Does that mean... she's jealous?

00:13:57.237 --> 00:13:59.607 position:24% line:89% align:start
Please, we're fine.

00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:02.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Am I stupid?
I can't get the wrong idea--

00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:04.111 position:24% line:83% align:start
she does stuff like
this all the time.

00:14:04.244 --> 00:14:05.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
But are we though?

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.214 position:30% line:83% align:start
You've made it,
like, painfully clear

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:10.150 position:21% line:83% align:start
that you'd rather die
than be seen with me.

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.086 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
No! You've got it backwards.

00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:13.621 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Backwards?

00:14:13.755 --> 00:14:17.424 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Just let me try to
explain! It's the other way.

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:19.293 position:30% line:83% align:start
Being around a
boring nerd like me

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:21.730 position:16% line:83% align:start
has gotta be embarrassing
for you, right?

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Huh? Why should
crap like that matter?

00:14:24.733 --> 00:14:26.333 position:5% line:89% align:start
I can hang with whoever I want.

00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.603 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I have to worry
about that stuff!

00:14:28.737 --> 00:14:30.137 position:13% line:89% align:start
It might be cool with you,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
but people will assume
you're doing charity work.

00:14:32.172 --> 00:14:35.876 position:13% line:83% align:start
And it's not like I have to
be here with you right n--

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.850 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know. So, it's me
who needs charity.

00:14:41.982 --> 00:14:46.220 position:19% line:83% align:start
Just look at me, dude.
Like you do when we're at home.

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:49.957 position:30% line:89% align:start
Come on. Look.

00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:55.996 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you'll stare at my
chest constantly except

00:14:56.130 --> 00:15:00.134 position:19% line:83% align:start
the one time I actually
want you to!

00:15:00.267 --> 00:15:01.870 position:5% line:89% align:start
I know you're a tits man, champ,

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:03.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
so don't even try
to act cool right now!

00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:06.073 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Danger. Danger,
Commander Johnson!

00:15:06.206 --> 00:15:09.309 position:27% line:83% align:start
Chill out, Akari!
Let go off me. Please!

00:15:09.443 --> 00:15:11.713 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is not how we
communicate with people!

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:14.248 position:13% line:89% align:start
Come on. Let's talk it out.

00:15:14.381 --> 00:15:15.949 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Fine, let's talk.

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.185 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
What a mature and elegant lady.

00:15:18.318 --> 00:15:21.054 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's just, when were
not at the apartment,

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:24.391 position:16% line:83% align:start
it's like were not even a
married couple anymore.

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:27.695 position:5% line:83% align:start
I see you talking to other girls
and it makes me feel weird.

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:28.996 position:27% line:89% align:start
In those moments,

00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:31.231 position:27% line:83% align:start
it's like you're
not my husband at all.

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.467 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't help but think,
what if we get home

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:35.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
and things don't
go back to normal?

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.807 position:7% line:89% align:start
I totally despise the thought!

00:15:38.939 --> 00:15:40.875 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Uh, I'm a little confused.

00:15:41.008 --> 00:15:44.111 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is it okay for me to ask you
what you mean by that?

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:47.214 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] What do you mean by
"what do I mean by that?"

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:50.083 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh, okay. I can break it down.

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.787 position:16% line:83% align:start
You want us to act like
a couple when we're out.

00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:55.289 position:21% line:83% align:start
You demand that I call
you by your first name,

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:58.025 position:19% line:83% align:start
and you feel weird when
I talk to other girls.

00:15:58.158 --> 00:15:59.661 position:35% line:89% align:start
Am I right?

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:02.564 position:19% line:83% align:start
'Cause if so, you sound
less like a practical partner

00:16:02.697 --> 00:16:05.533 position:30% line:83% align:start
and more like a
jealous girlfriend.

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:06.500 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:06.634 --> 00:16:08.435 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Wh-What's that face?

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.172 position:7% line:83% align:start
You're not making sense at all!
And that's just how I look!

00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:13.608 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Well, I mean...

00:16:13.741 --> 00:16:16.076 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're stupid enough
to think I'm jealous?

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.512 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm just pissed because you only

00:16:17.645 --> 00:16:19.547 position:24% line:83% align:start
pay attention to me
when it's convenient!

00:16:19.681 --> 00:16:21.850 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Is that what this was about?

00:16:21.982 --> 00:16:24.451 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Gotcha, I'll make sure
to call you by your first name.

00:16:24.586 --> 00:16:27.154 position:13% line:83% align:start
I really wish you would've
just led with that, dipstick.

00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:29.958 position:16% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Wow! The moon's
super pretty tonight!

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.059 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it's crazy
bright out here.

00:16:32.192 --> 00:16:35.062 position:7% line:89% align:start
And this breeze feels amazing!

00:16:38.533 --> 00:16:40.735 position:13% line:83% align:start
Dude, remember the new show
I was telling you about?

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:43.070 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's an actor who
could be your twin.

00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:45.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, the girl playing
the little sister?

00:16:45.305 --> 00:16:47.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah! Wait, are you
watching, too?

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:49.142 position:30% line:83% align:start
[JIRO, AKARI]
What do we do?

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:51.044 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I'm feeling claustrophobic.

00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:53.515 position:19% line:83% align:start
--Scoot over that way.
--[groans]

00:16:53.648 --> 00:16:56.116 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're the one who
dragged me into this shoebox!

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.852 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Shh!

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.322 position:7% line:83% align:start
This sucks toes. I'm literally
being cooked alive.

00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:04.291 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Well, complaining won't help.

00:17:04.424 --> 00:17:07.595 position:5% line:83% align:start
Right now, we need to make sure
Shiori and Hamano don't see us.

00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.964 position:16% line:89% align:start
How freakin' predictable.

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:10.899 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Did you say something?

00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:12.867 position:30% line:89% align:start
Nope, nothing.

00:17:13.835 --> 00:17:16.336 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Here I am in my tiny swimsuit.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.205 position:16% line:89% align:start
Literally on top of him.

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:21.543 position:13% line:83% align:start
And I feel like he couldn't
give less of a damn.

00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:25.145 position:7% line:83% align:start
Back in the day, when all I did
was chase after Minami,

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:27.381 position:27% line:83% align:start
I managed to stay
way more optimistic.

00:17:27.515 --> 00:17:29.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now, every time Jiro
and I have a nice moment,

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:32.386 position:33% line:83% align:start
I jump to the
worst-case scenario,

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.055 position:30% line:83% align:start
and get scared
he's going to leave.

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:36.558 position:24% line:89% align:start
Who could blame me.

00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:38.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm virtually sitting in
his lap and the only thing

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:40.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
he cares about is
the girl outside.

00:17:40.427 --> 00:17:41.863 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's no big whoop.

00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:44.131 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've known he has this thing
for her since day one,

00:17:44.264 --> 00:17:47.035 position:27% line:83% align:start
but I still feel
all confused inside.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.037 position:33% line:89% align:start
I hate this.

00:17:49.169 --> 00:17:52.172 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, great. You sick?

00:17:53.273 --> 00:17:55.275 position:5% line:89% align:start
You sure? Well, that's a relief.

00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:58.646 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's hot. You think
you can hang in there?

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.616 position:30% line:83% align:start
What's the big
difference if I do?

00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:03.551 position:38% line:89% align:start
Cryptic.

00:18:07.387 --> 00:18:09.857 position:13% line:89% align:start
It'll save you some grief?

00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:11.458 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:18:11.593 --> 00:18:13.861 position:24% line:83% align:start
Weird, did you just
hear someone talking?

00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:15.262 position:35% line:89% align:start
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:17.765 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey! Come on, Mei!
Don't try to scare me!

00:18:17.899 --> 00:18:22.937 position:10% line:83% align:start
[laughs] I forgot about your
low tolerance for spooky stuff!

00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:24.338 position:19% line:89% align:start
We should check it out.

00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:26.574 position:19% line:83% align:start
There could be a spirit
trapped inside.

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.543 position:35% line:89% align:start
You meanie!

00:18:33.447 --> 00:18:36.517 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
All good. No ghosties over here.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.989 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
No people either. My b.

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:42.657 position:30% line:89% align:start
So, no ghouls?

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.026 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MEI] I must've just heard
some noise from the road.

00:18:45.158 --> 00:18:46.861 position:33% line:83% align:start
[JIRO, AKARI]
Safe!

00:18:48.763 --> 00:18:49.931 position:33% line:89% align:start
[AKARI gasps]

00:18:50.064 --> 00:18:50.965 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thud]

00:18:51.099 --> 00:18:52.667 position:30% line:89% align:start
[SHIORI yelps]

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.137 position:13% line:83% align:start
Ow! What do you think you're
doing! Contain your violence!

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.406 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thuds]

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.844 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm too scared, we gotta go!
I'm gonna pee my pants!

00:19:02.977 --> 00:19:05.780 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MEI]
Don't do that!

00:19:05.913 --> 00:19:10.118 position:16% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Nah. This sucks
the whole freakin' foot.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
Okay, perv, it's time
to get off of me.

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:15.657 position:10% line:83% align:start
It was life or death and you
were still staring at my boobs.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.827 position:7% line:83% align:start
Freakin' degenerate. I totally
regret wearing this swimsuit.

00:19:19.961 --> 00:19:21.562 position:13% line:89% align:start
All you dudes are the same.

00:19:21.696 --> 00:19:24.732 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Oh, shut up,
you were begging me to look.

00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:26.000 position:24% line:89% align:start
As if I meant that!

00:19:26.134 --> 00:19:28.569 position:19% line:83% align:start
It just spilled out in
the moment! You jerk!

00:19:28.703 --> 00:19:31.606 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hurry up and forget
about it already!

00:19:31.739 --> 00:19:33.808 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, I get it.
So, you were just playing

00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:35.943 position:33% line:83% align:start
with me again
like some stupid toy.

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:37.011 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
No, I wasn't.

00:19:37.145 --> 00:19:38.445 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yes, you were.

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:39.647 position:24% line:83% align:start
All that crap about
using your first name

00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:41.916 position:10% line:89% align:start
and being a couple in public.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.052 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you were coming up
with that "in the moment,"

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:47.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
then why the hell would I
change a freakin' thing?

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.706 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I hate you, Jiro.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:09.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
And I hate this.
I'm so embarrassed.

00:20:12.513 --> 00:20:16.316 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on. It's too hot
to get any closer.

00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:20.054 position:16% line:83% align:start
Childhood bestie is gone,
we can leave now.

00:20:20.188 --> 00:20:24.257 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your knee is poking me, Jiro.
Can you move it?

00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:26.761 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
That's, uh, not my knee.

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:29.897 position:33% line:83% align:start
[AKARI gasps]
Wait, what is it?

00:20:30.031 --> 00:20:31.165 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
You know...

00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:32.299 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
For real?

00:20:32.432 --> 00:20:34.334 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.606 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Lemme see your face.

00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:46.848 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, uh, did looking
at me do that to you?

00:20:46.981 --> 00:20:50.450 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:20:50.585 --> 00:20:55.123 position:33% line:83% align:start
[AKARI gasps]
Wait, Jiro! Please, wait!

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.457 position:16% line:89% align:start
We... We can't! Not yet!

00:20:57.592 --> 00:21:02.864 position:16% line:83% align:start
There's an order to these
kinda things, y'know!

00:21:02.997 --> 00:21:04.832 position:41% line:89% align:start
Jiro?!

00:21:07.334 --> 00:21:10.872 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] They said it was a mild
heatstroke. Are you okay?

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.305 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Yeah.

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.407 position:33% line:83% align:start
[AKARI, JIRO]
Hey, so...

00:21:17.145 --> 00:21:20.948 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm, uh, sorry, that you
had to save me and stuff.

00:21:21.082 --> 00:21:24.484 position:16% line:83% align:start
On top of that, I'm sorry
for any other weirdness.

00:21:24.619 --> 00:21:27.021 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
I told you to stop apologizing.

00:21:27.155 --> 00:21:28.890 position:7% line:89% align:start
It always makes me feel worse.

00:21:29.023 --> 00:21:32.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, no more sorrys,
got it? And also!

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.061 position:30% line:83% align:start
That d-bag tone
you took during your,

00:21:34.195 --> 00:21:36.230 position:24% line:83% align:start
"shut up, you were
begging me to look" bull?

00:21:36.363 --> 00:21:37.665 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was way too much.

00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.801 position:21% line:83% align:start
You sneak glances of
my boobs constantly,

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:41.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was just doing my
good deed of the day!

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:43.336 position:10% line:89% align:start
You should be more grateful!

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.873 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Too loud! Way too freakin' loud!

00:21:46.007 --> 00:21:48.576 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've been thinking and instead
of showing you outside stuff,

00:21:48.709 --> 00:21:51.612 position:7% line:83% align:start
I wanna show you inside stuff,
like my personality.

00:21:51.746 --> 00:21:53.681 position:24% line:83% align:start
We've already been
married for four months,

00:21:53.815 --> 00:21:56.383 position:16% line:83% align:start
but if someone was like,
"Hey, tell me about Jiro,"

00:21:56.517 --> 00:21:57.919 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'd be screwed.

00:21:58.052 --> 00:21:59.854 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, don't you think
living together will be

00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:02.455 position:24% line:83% align:start
more fun if we know
who we're living with?

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.892 position:16% line:83% align:start
All that to say, I wanna
see your inside stuff

00:22:05.026 --> 00:22:06.561 position:16% line:89% align:start
and learn about you, too.

00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:10.631 position:16% line:83% align:start
Cause you and I are still
a married couple, right?

00:22:10.765 --> 00:22:12.399 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Right.

00:22:12.533 --> 00:22:16.204 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] It has been four months,
hasn't it? Time is so strange.

00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:20.340 position:7% line:83% align:start
Especially this time that Akari
and I have shared together.

00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.577 position:7% line:89% align:start
"Still a married couple," huh?

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.912 position:16% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't read into it,
but for some reason,

00:22:25.046 --> 00:22:27.849 position:33% line:83% align:start
that "still"
isn't sitting right.

00:23:58.172 --> 00:24:00.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE] Knock, knock!
We're ready to play!

00:24:00.274 --> 00:24:01.208 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Let's game!

00:24:01.342 --> 00:24:02.410 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Come in, boys!

00:24:02.543 --> 00:24:03.911 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TERAFUNE]
Old maid? Go Fish?

00:24:04.045 --> 00:24:06.479 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hell, let's put some
money on this shiz!

00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:09.216 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Kay!

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.619 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOYS scream]

00:24:11.752 --> 00:24:13.486 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
This mask feels incredible!

00:24:13.621 --> 00:24:14.822 position:38% line:83% align:start
[NATSUMI]
Totes!

00:24:14.956 --> 00:24:16.190 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Next time:
"More Than a Confession,

00:24:16.324 --> 00:24:17.858 position:10% line:89% align:start
but Not Yet a Broken Heart."
