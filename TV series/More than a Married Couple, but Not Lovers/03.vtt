[AKARI]
So, is it like... Just you?

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.817 position:21% line:83% align:start
Or do all guys prefer
the mega-sweet,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.484 position:10% line:89% align:start
mommy types like Sakurazaka?

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.554 position:27% line:83% align:start
Huh? The heck is
this coming from?

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.990 position:19% line:83% align:start
I wanna know what dudes
like chicks to do for them.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:23.323 position:5% line:89% align:start
This might come as a big shock,

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.392 position:30% line:83% align:start
but I'm not an
authority on chicks.

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:27.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] What happened to
"doing whatever it takes"?

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:28.863 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're supposed to help me!

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:32.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
And If I don't get answers,
you just get rice.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.935 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aw...

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
Put some legit thought
into this.

00:00:35.904 --> 00:00:41.709 position:10% line:83% align:start
Lemme think. Just nice things
girls can do? Uhhh... Hm?

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.078 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Guys like homemade lunches.

00:00:45.212 --> 00:00:46.981 position:19% line:89% align:start
Is that's all it takes?

00:00:47.114 --> 00:00:50.384 position:5% line:83% align:start
Yeah, the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach, y'know.

00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:51.953 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.622 position:10% line:83% align:start
It'd be even better from you,
cause no one would expect it.

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:57.224 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] You should expect
my fist up your ass.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.359 position:16% line:89% align:start
I see where I went wrong.

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.061 position:24% line:83% align:start
Crazy, but I think
your plan could work!

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.565 position:16% line:89% align:start
And you're gonna help me.

00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:05.600 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait, I am?

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:39.426 position:7% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Being the door mat that
I am, it was up to me to play

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.196 position:19% line:83% align:start
sous-chef in Operation
Bento of Love.

00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:01.783 position:27% line:83% align:start
The go big or go
home special, I see!

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.418 position:7% line:83% align:start
These are ideas for the bento,
hopefully we can pick

00:03:04.552 --> 00:03:07.555 position:16% line:83% align:start
something both cute and
delish from this lineup.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.825 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
You like?

00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:14.595 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, it's great. My only
note would be that I like

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.297 position:19% line:83% align:start
a little more sweetness
in my Tamagoyaki.

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:20.367 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ugh! As if I care about
childish preferences.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.469 position:13% line:83% align:start
Minami is an ultra-mature,
adult man,

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:25.506 position:19% line:83% align:start
there's no way that I'm
gonna put sugar in his eggs.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.809 position:10% line:89% align:start
Cool, don't bother asking me.

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:29.544 position:30% line:83% align:start
Okay, but don't
the teeny burgers

00:03:29.677 --> 00:03:31.612 position:27% line:83% align:start
and the ohitashi
salad look bomb?

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:32.980 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:35.817 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Maybe I should
invest in a Tamagoyaki pan.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.518 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
What am I looking at, bro?

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:39.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did Akari birth that
glorious lunch of love?

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:41.589 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, she did.

00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:43.891 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're otherworldly levels
of blessed, my guy,

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:45.593 position:24% line:83% align:start
I look at you then
look at me and think,

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:47.528 position:5% line:89% align:start
"O gods why do you smite me so?"

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought things we're going
okay in your romantic life.

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:51.999 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] If by "okay" you
mean loveless, then yeah.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:54.434 position:13% line:83% align:start
In the beginning, I'd feel
these big 'ole butterflies

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.336 position:27% line:83% align:start
in my tummy just
eating with her.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.872 position:7% line:89% align:start
Good morning, nice to see you!

00:03:58.005 --> 00:04:00.074 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KAMO]
Come on, female, it's afternoon.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.143 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our once tender "good mornings"
and "goodnights"

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.745 position:24% line:89% align:start
are tender no more.

00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:06.446 position:24% line:83% align:start
They feel more like
collecting log-in bonuses.

00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.483 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, just be glad
you get bonuses.

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:12.352 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
What's your deal?

00:04:12.486 --> 00:04:14.188 position:24% line:83% align:start
I refuse to listen
to your whining

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.623 position:27% line:83% align:start
when that little
love triangle of yours

00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:17.558 position:33% line:83% align:start
looks like an
S-tier ecchi manga.

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:19.527 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's a crime that you haven't
let the gyaru take that

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.462 position:16% line:83% align:start
factory-fresh unit you're
rockin' out for a spin.

00:04:22.597 --> 00:04:24.165 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
That's disgusting, man!

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:26.934 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Well, well, wouldja
lookie there, so Mister Bigshot

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:29.103 position:19% line:83% align:start
thinks letting a woman
dongle his dingle

00:04:29.237 --> 00:04:30.505 position:16% line:89% align:start
would be disgusting, huh?

00:04:30.638 --> 00:04:31.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you one of those
sappy harem protags

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:33.808 position:19% line:83% align:start
who protects his purity
even when females

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.643 position:21% line:83% align:start
are begging on their
hands and knees?

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.678 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, is that what
it's really like?

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:40.548 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do... do they yearn
for the dingle?

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:42.482 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bro? No!

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:45.520 position:21% line:83% align:start
She exclusively wears
tiny, flimsy clothes.

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:47.955 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think my self-restraint
around her is admirable

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.891 position:33% line:83% align:start
and should be
applauded if anything.

00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:51.893 position:35% line:89% align:start
Cute, huh?

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:55.462 position:21% line:83% align:start
[sighs] Man, I'm done
with this conversation.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.032 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're eating, and besides
this'll just make it awkward

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.234 position:10% line:89% align:start
when I see Watanabe at home.

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:01.602 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Watanabe what now?

00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:02.937 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:06.073 position:10% line:89% align:start
You just said my name, yeah?

00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:09.110 position:7% line:83% align:start
I believe that I'll be letting
you handle this one.

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.378 position:19% line:89% align:start
Uh. Greetings, m'lady.

00:05:11.512 --> 00:05:12.412 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
The hell?

00:05:12.547 --> 00:05:14.515 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry. It wasn't anything.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.717 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Weird you felt the
need to apologize for it.

00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:19.987 position:33% line:83% align:start
Say what? No!
We were just talking about

00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:22.056 position:5% line:89% align:start
our friend Tanabe. Small world.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.625 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Whatevs, how
was the bento? Delish?

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.527 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you did a
really awesome job.

00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:28.196 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is that all you have to say?

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:31.199 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think that the bacon-wrapped
asparagus was my favorite.

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.134 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Go on.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:35.269 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, you already know

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:37.939 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'd prefer my Tamagoyaki
a bit sweeter.

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:40.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
And you know I'd prefer it
if you kept that crap quiet.

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:43.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
Jeez, then quit asking
for my opinion.

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:45.313 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] There's plenty of other
info you could give me!

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:46.747 position:19% line:89% align:start
What about the colors?

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.282 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did it survive being
thrashed in your bag?

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:49.817 position:27% line:83% align:start
Or maybe what you
thought of the taste!

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.919 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I was telling you
what I thought of the taste!

00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:53.588 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Yeah, but I don't
care how it aligns with

00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:55.857 position:13% line:83% align:start
King Yakuin's preferences,
just if it's good!

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:01.662 position:13% line:83% align:start
A tanka. Standing before me
they force me to watch as they

00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.264 position:16% line:89% align:start
have their lovers' spat.

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:07.001 position:21% line:83% align:start
I am not envious, no,
Instead, I shall remember.

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:08.769 position:44% line:89% align:start
Kamo.

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:24.585 position:35% line:89% align:start
[yawns] Hm?

00:06:27.288 --> 00:06:30.925 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey, good morning.
Whoa, that looks incredible!

00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:33.261 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] I know! The bento
above all bentos!

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.163 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna deliver it to the
place Minami works part-time.

00:06:36.297 --> 00:06:39.432 position:10% line:83% align:start
Wait, so, that means this one
is the real deal, right?

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:40.868 position:24% line:89% align:start
[stomach grumbling]

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:42.670 position:16% line:83% align:start
Sorry about him, he just
thinks it looks good.

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:45.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
You gotta try today's
Tamagoyaki, it's my best yet.

00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:48.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
But I thought all of this
cooking was for Tenjin?

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:51.579 position:27% line:83% align:start
Chillax buzzkill,
it's only an end piece.

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:02.590 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
As predicted, zero sweetness.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.859 position:13% line:83% align:start
My fake wife is cooking up
this delicious lunch

00:07:04.992 --> 00:07:08.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
for her real crush. Meanwhile
her real crush's fake wife

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:11.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
has been my real crush
the whole time.

00:07:11.365 --> 00:07:14.669 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's isn't sweetness
anywhere these days.

00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:20.374 position:44% line:89% align:start
Cute?

00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:22.475 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's a lot going on,
that's for sure.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.745 position:5% line:89% align:start
Better a lot than nothing, duh.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.414 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] How long did she
spend getting ready

00:07:26.547 --> 00:07:28.649 position:13% line:89% align:start
just to play delivery girl?

00:07:28.783 --> 00:07:30.551 position:7% line:89% align:start
The fact she's meeting a dude,

00:07:30.685 --> 00:07:32.420 position:24% line:83% align:start
and letting it all
hang out like that?

00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:34.021 position:16% line:89% align:start
It seems pretty obvious.

00:07:34.155 --> 00:07:36.657 position:19% line:83% align:start
When she's out with me,
she just wears what's easy.

00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:39.427 position:24% line:83% align:start
She certainly never
dresses up like this.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.129 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Yo, Yakuin?

00:07:42.263 --> 00:07:43.731 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm?

00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:46.133 position:7% line:83% align:start

00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:07.474 position:19% line:89% align:start
Your crap-tastic rank!

00:15:07.609 --> 00:15:09.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
You've gotta tell me what went
down or I'll start imagining

00:15:09.977 --> 00:15:13.581 position:7% line:83% align:start
things. It was the hoe's fault
and not my bro's fault, right?

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:17.251 position:27% line:83% align:start
Jeez, either way,
it doesn't matter to you.

00:15:21.623 --> 00:15:26.026 position:19% line:83% align:start
Even now, I'm not sure
what I should've done.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.463 position:16% line:83% align:start
At first, I figured she
was teasing me as usual.

00:15:29.597 --> 00:15:31.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
And if I started to
take her seriously,

00:15:31.398 --> 00:15:34.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
she'd laugh and call
me some bratty name.

00:15:34.368 --> 00:15:36.170 position:16% line:89% align:start
But then I felt her hand.

00:15:36.303 --> 00:15:39.841 position:19% line:83% align:start
It was weirdly cold and
shaking out of control.

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:44.111 position:7% line:83% align:start
She was just about as uncertain
and nervous as I was.

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:48.282 position:27% line:83% align:start
Maybe we're more
similar than I thought.

00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:51.619 position:19% line:83% align:start
It seemed like all that
stuff was new to her, too.

00:15:51.753 --> 00:15:53.287 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I guess what I'm trying to say

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
is that any guy would
want to have se--

00:15:55.657 --> 00:15:57.224 position:33% line:89% align:start
Weirdly cold.

00:15:59.026 --> 00:16:05.733 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] If my hunch is right,
I'm the absolute worst.

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:07.735 position:16% line:89% align:start
Quick trip to emo-ville?

00:16:07.869 --> 00:16:10.939 position:21% line:83% align:start
Are you seriously not
gonna dry your hands, bro?

00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:12.740 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Shiori.

00:16:12.874 --> 00:16:16.210 position:16% line:83% align:start
Glad I caught you, Jiro.
I was wondering if maybe you

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:18.947 position:19% line:83% align:start
had some time to talk,
just the two of us?

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:19.948 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.416 position:24% line:89% align:start
They smite me, see?

00:16:24.184 --> 00:16:28.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wow! The breeze feels
super nice up here.

00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:32.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, uh, I can guess
what's on your mind.

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:35.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Be honest. Did
something happen with Watanabe?

00:16:35.897 --> 00:16:37.464 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:16:37.599 --> 00:16:40.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah. You could
say that I ran into

00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:42.369 position:21% line:83% align:start
some serious trouble
expressing myself.

00:16:42.504 --> 00:16:46.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
Plus, I think I had the wrong
idea about her entirely.

00:16:46.273 --> 00:16:48.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
I haven't found the right
moment to apologize,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.445 position:16% line:83% align:start
and I can tell she wants
nothing to do with me.

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.081 position:24% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI] Tall order
when you live together.

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.482 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Huh?

00:16:55.617 --> 00:16:57.251 position:27% line:83% align:start
Every single day,
you spend more time

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:58.720 position:5% line:89% align:start
with Watanabe than anyone else.

00:16:58.853 --> 00:17:00.555 position:16% line:83% align:start
If you just talk to her,
I'm sure she'll be

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:03.390 position:19% line:83% align:start
more understanding than
what your brain's saying.

00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:05.392 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've known you forever
and the evidence shows

00:17:05.527 --> 00:17:07.261 position:19% line:83% align:start
that you can definitely
handle this!

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.597 position:21% line:89% align:start
Boom! Now we're even.

00:17:09.731 --> 00:17:11.298 position:30% line:89% align:start
I needed that.

00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:14.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
I pronounce you the clear
victor of this argument.

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:15.537 position:24% line:83% align:start
Funny, you've been
better than me

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.205 position:21% line:83% align:start
with stuff like this
since we were little.

00:17:18.338 --> 00:17:21.576 position:5% line:83% align:start
After all these years, I'm still
the same Shiori I was!

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:22.877 position:30% line:89% align:start
See? Just look!

00:17:23.011 --> 00:17:26.179 position:16% line:83% align:start
[JIRO laughs] I'm pretty
impressed you even noticed

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:29.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
something was up with me.
Well, I guess anyone

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:32.520 position:19% line:83% align:start
who saw today's ranking
could predict that.

00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:39.827 position:38% line:83% align:start
[SHIORI]
It's gonna be okay.

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:45.465 position:30% line:89% align:start
Hey, I'm back.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.252 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Hey, Watanabe?
I'd like to talk for minute.

00:18:05.385 --> 00:18:08.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
No chance you're gonna
come out though, huh?

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:14.261 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, so come in.

00:18:18.365 --> 00:18:20.868 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] It even smells
like a chick in here!

00:18:21.002 --> 00:18:22.904 position:38% line:89% align:start
[gasping]

00:18:23.571 --> 00:18:26.173 position:13% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] I didn't think she'd
ignore my existence.

00:18:26.306 --> 00:18:28.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
I just wanted to
tell you that, um,

00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:31.579 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry about the other day.

00:18:31.713 --> 00:18:34.348 position:16% line:83% align:start
Relax dude, it's not like
you did anything wrong.

00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:37.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Yes, I did.
This is all my fault.

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:38.820 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
Shut up!

00:18:38.953 --> 00:18:40.755 position:16% line:83% align:start
What happened was I swung
and I missed, yeah?

00:18:40.888 --> 00:18:43.390 position:33% line:83% align:start
Don't make me
live it over again!

00:18:43.524 --> 00:18:44.926 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:47.795 position:7% line:83% align:start
If you like breathing, wipe it
from your mind! You got that?

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:49.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry, I think
I might've given you

00:18:49.731 --> 00:18:52.199 position:30% line:83% align:start
the wrong idea,
so let me explain.

00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:54.035 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKARI grunts]

00:18:54.802 --> 00:18:57.505 position:10% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] It isn't that I didn't
want to do it with you, okay?

00:18:57.639 --> 00:19:00.708 position:13% line:83% align:start
I find you very attractive,
and you were right,

00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:03.443 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've had more than one
crazy fantasy about you,

00:19:03.578 --> 00:19:05.880 position:24% line:83% align:start
a lot more than one
if we're being honest.

00:19:06.014 --> 00:19:07.949 position:19% line:83% align:start
And, well, what I want
to tell you is that

00:19:08.082 --> 00:19:10.885 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm actually really grateful
for the experience.

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:12.219 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're such a freakin' perv!

00:19:12.352 --> 00:19:13.821 position:24% line:83% align:start
Droning on and on
about it like this

00:19:13.955 --> 00:19:15.823 position:5% line:89% align:start
is virtually sexual harassment!

00:19:15.957 --> 00:19:18.726 position:13% line:83% align:start
You just came barging into
a girl's room with zero tact!

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.895 position:16% line:83% align:start
Might as well get "virg"
tattooed to your forehead

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:22.295 position:10% line:89% align:start
'cause you'll be one forever!

00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:24.498 position:19% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] You're probably
right about that.

00:19:24.632 --> 00:19:26.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, I stopped you
for a reason, though!

00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:30.571 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's just... It's kinda hard to
explain, but, in the moment,

00:19:30.705 --> 00:19:32.239 position:30% line:83% align:start
I felt like you
deserved to be treated

00:19:32.372 --> 00:19:34.509 position:16% line:89% align:start
with more care than that.

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:37.477 position:7% line:83% align:start
The idea of us doing something
so big on a whim...

00:19:37.612 --> 00:19:39.647 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know,
it just felt wrong.

00:19:39.781 --> 00:19:42.050 position:33% line:83% align:start
Like I said,
it's hard to explain.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:44.018 position:13% line:89% align:start
Dude! Spit it out already!

00:19:44.152 --> 00:19:45.653 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
It still feels wrong!

00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:48.856 position:10% line:83% align:start
I despise the way things are
so awkward between us now!

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.993 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to hang out and be
normal, like we were before.

00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:53.761 position:5% line:89% align:start
And I want to eat together, too.

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:55.830 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:57.364 --> 00:19:59.801 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Will you give me another chance?

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:09.644 position:21% line:83% align:start
Come on. You and me.
Let's do it.

00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:17.250 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Let's be a married couple again.

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.259 position:24% line:83% align:start
Don't get me wrong,
when I say "married couple"

00:20:26.393 --> 00:20:27.929 position:16% line:83% align:start
obviously I mean in terms
of the practical,

00:20:28.062 --> 00:20:29.864 position:10% line:83% align:start
not like "will you marry me"
because you have Tenjin and,

00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:32.100 position:10% line:83% align:start
trust me, my friend, I am not
gonna get in the way of that,

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:33.568 position:10% line:89% align:start
cross my heart, hope to die!

00:20:33.701 --> 00:20:34.702 position:44% line:89% align:start
Pff.

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:35.937 position:44% line:89% align:start
Pff?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.405 position:21% line:83% align:start
[laughing] We've got
a code red doof alert!

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:40.608 position:21% line:83% align:start
[JIRO] Huh? Shut up!
Why are you laughing?

00:20:40.742 --> 00:20:44.244 position:10% line:83% align:start
Quick call the wah-mbulance!
What was that supposed to be?

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:47.247 position:35% line:83% align:start
A proposal?
Dial it the hell back!

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.717 position:5% line:89% align:start
Huh? I'm trying to make amends,

00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:51.652 position:19% line:83% align:start
you said you were done
with the couple stuff?

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:54.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Hm? How could I
just be done, dude?

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:56.724 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's literally required
for us to graduate.

00:20:56.858 --> 00:21:00.528 position:16% line:83% align:start
Great! So you lied to me?
Like a liar would?

00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:03.631 position:19% line:83% align:start
Straight up deception?
How could you?

00:21:03.765 --> 00:21:06.734 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh. I wasn't lying,
just shifting the vibe.

00:21:06.868 --> 00:21:11.672 position:19% line:83% align:start
A, that makes no sense,
and B, I've agonized over this!

00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:14.242 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKARI] Don't flip, but
I'm enjoying married life

00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:16.409 position:24% line:83% align:start
with you more than
I thought I would.

00:21:16.544 --> 00:21:18.546 position:30% line:89% align:start
[JIRO grunting]

00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:23.651 position:21% line:83% align:start
I realized something.
I like you, Jiro.

00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:25.987 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
What's going on?

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.589 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why'd she suddenly
use my first name?

00:21:28.723 --> 00:21:32.860 position:21% line:83% align:start
And she "likes" me?
What does that mean?

00:21:32.994 --> 00:21:35.495 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, got anything to say?

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.598 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
I...

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:45.973 position:41% line:83% align:start
[JIRO]
Hm? Hand?

00:21:46.107 --> 00:21:49.677 position:19% line:83% align:start
Heh. You so missed your
moment on that one, dork!

00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:50.978 position:5% line:89% align:start
The heat of the moment matters,

00:21:51.112 --> 00:21:53.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
not that you'd know,
oh repressed one.

00:21:54.015 --> 00:21:56.250 position:16% line:89% align:start
Some things never change.

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:59.987 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm happy that you're
home, Jiro. Heh!

00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:03.090 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hmph. Good to be back.

00:22:03.224 --> 00:22:07.829 position:5% line:83% align:start
If we're starting from zero, at

[AKARI] I realized something.
I like you, Jiro.

00:22:24.377 --> 00:22:26.681 position:41% line:83% align:start
[AKARI]
There, I said it.

00:23:59.006 --> 00:24:01.474 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] A very burned
piece of Tamagoyaki.

00:24:01.609 --> 00:24:03.678 position:13% line:89% align:start
And a very concerned Akari.

[JIRO]
It's yucky.

00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:17.758 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KAMO] Next time, "A Hero,
but Not the Main Character."
