All right, then, it's settled.

That's enough. It doesn't

"I don't want to die"

a name right now?

that traditionally a man's name?

at least make it Juliette.

[RUDEUS] We decided that
Julie would live with Zanoba

00:21:51.245 --> 00:21:55.629
and help him do, whatever he
does, that he needs help with.

I would teach her languages
and incantation less magic.

we had a brand new routine.
