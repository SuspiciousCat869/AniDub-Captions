[Rudeus panting]

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.772
[panting]

00:00:11.397 --> 00:00:13.778
[RUDEUS] So how we feeling
about the run today, boys?

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.698
Tindalos? Baskerville?

00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:17.493
[chuckles]

00:00:17.577 --> 00:00:19.330
Oh, is that so?

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:20.249
[chuckles]

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.461
Yeah, good job, boys.

00:00:24.382 --> 00:00:26.971
[RUDEUS] It's been a few months
since I arrived in Rosenburg.

00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:28.808
I've been working
with different parties

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:29.726
as a mercenary,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.895
helping out on their jobs

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.565
and trying to build
a good reputation

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.611
among the townsfolk
and adventurers.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:35.530
[grunts]

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:37.199
The idea is to get
popular enough

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.161
that word about me
reaches Zenith,

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:40.540
wherever she is.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.420
Okay, only like a hundred left
to go!

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:45.592
Come on, Heracles! Hulk!

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:53.524
[Rudeus sighs]

[SOLDAT]
Listen up!

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:11.267
Stepped Leader is taking
this S-ranked extermination job!

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:13.188
We'll clear
the Snow Drake infestation

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:15.275
out of Ilbron Cave in no time!

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.945
And we'll set out immediately!

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:18.198
[PARTY MEMBERS]
Yeah!

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:20.620
Hope the rest of you are ready
to marvel at our greatness

00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:21.580
when we return!

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:23.333
[Footsteps]

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:30.848
[door creaking]

00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:38.238
Hm? Hey, Quagmire,
thanks again for the other day!

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:40.242
Oh, no,
I should be thanking you.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:42.496
We're leaving town today,
Quagmire,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.749
but I'll be sure to send word

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:45.795
if I hear anything
about your mother out there,

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:48.049
-all right?
-[RUDEUS] Oh, thank you.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:48.968
Please do.

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:50.555
[RUDEUS]
Looks like all my hard work

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:52.141
is starting to pay off,

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:55.063
because Rudeus Greyrat
now has quite the reputation

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:56.733
-in this town!
-Iâ€™ll take this one.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.865
Although more people do know me
by my nickname, Quagmire,

00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:01.284
than my real one.

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:03.873
Making a name for yourself
in one town

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:05.710
takes a few months to a year.

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:07.337
It feels like
a hell of a long time,

00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:09.759
but, right now,
it's the best plan I have.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.686
Isn't that right, Master Roxy?

00:02:17.274 --> 00:02:18.109
Huh?

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.161
[RUDEUS]
I'm Rudeus Greyrat.

00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:24.706
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:26.919
[CLIENT 202A]
You that famous "Quagmire" guy?

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:30.091
I don't know
if I'm all that famous, but yes.

00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:32.972
Well, then get to work,
celebrity.

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:35.227
[RUDEUS]
Yes, sir.

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:54.761
[RUDEUS]
Good boys! Way to go!

00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:56.472
Oh?

00:03:58.267 --> 00:03:59.311
On your way home?

00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:02.275
[RUDEUS]
Yes, I just finished a job,

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.446
so I'll report it
and head back to the inn.

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.576
[Sara grunts]

00:04:07.954 --> 00:04:11.001
Well, we were just about
to pick out a new job ourselves.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:11.962
You want to join us?

00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:14.551
Yeah, I...

00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:17.180
[RUDEUS] I met Counter Arrow
as soon as I got here,

00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:19.268
and I've worked
with them a lot since.

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:21.147
Teaming up with one party
over and over

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.482
doesn't do much for my goal,

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:24.486
but it's hard to turn them down.

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.535
Uh, when would you guys
be heading out?

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:30.583
Oh, my God,
if you're not interested,

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:31.793
then just say no.

00:04:31.877 --> 00:04:33.714
It's not like we're desperate.

00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:35.175
Sorry about that.

00:04:35.258 --> 00:04:36.970
I'm just indecisive.

00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:37.972
[Sara sighs]

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:39.851
You're sorry about everything.

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:41.187
It's kind of pathetic.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:44.234
[SUZANNE]
Sara, that's enough.

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:45.905
Whatever.

00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:47.407
So? What do you think?

00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:48.326
You coming?

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:52.794
-I am! I appreciate the invite.
-[SUZANNE] Well then,

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:55.340
let's get in there
and find a job, shall we?

00:04:55.423 --> 00:05:00.391
[water rushing]

[all oohing]

00:05:03.064 --> 00:05:05.736
[TIMOTHY] The Galgau Ruins were
originally built as a fortress

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.698
during the First
Human-Demon War.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:09.159
[RUDEUS]
Wow.

00:05:09.243 --> 00:05:11.080
[RUDEUS] I saw
some pretty cool structures

00:05:11.163 --> 00:05:12.917
on the Demon Continent,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.754
but nothing quite like this.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.677
Don't just stand there staring.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.306
[RUDEUS]
Oh, sorry. I'm coming.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.102
[SARA]
Do you like architecture?

00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:23.312
[RUDEUS]
Not especially.

00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:26.110
I just haven't seen many places
this impressive before,

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.028
you know?

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:28.824
Oh.

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.334
[both gasp]

00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:37.007
Ah.

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:40.430
Hey, watch your hands, creep!

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:42.894
[RUDEUS]
I thought I was.

00:05:42.977 --> 00:05:43.812
[Sara grunts]

00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:47.485
Sorry about that.

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.711
[SUZANNE]
This must be the place.

00:05:55.794 --> 00:05:56.880
[all oohing]

00:05:56.963 --> 00:05:58.174
[RUDEUS]
All we're here to do

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:00.261
is collect a bunch
of these fancy scales,

00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:02.850
and they're just lying around
everywhere.

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:05.104
Pretty easy for an A-class job.

00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:08.654
[SUZANNE] This
is still Snow Drake territory,

00:06:08.737 --> 00:06:10.240
so stay alert.

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:12.369
Don't go past that statue.

00:06:12.452 --> 00:06:13.830
[PATRICE, MIMIR]
Got it!

00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:16.293
[RUDEUS] Actually fighting
the Snow Drakes would suck,

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:19.257
but they only use this passage
to get from place to place,

00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.222
so we can just hide
if any of them show up, but...

00:06:24.686 --> 00:06:26.480
[RUDEUS]
It's a little too quiet.

00:06:31.866 --> 00:06:33.035
[RUDEUS]
You know,

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.749
that buxom babe statue
kind of reminds me of...

00:06:38.462 --> 00:06:40.843
Talk about taking
artistic license.

[growling]

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:44.934
What was that?

00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:47.063
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

All right,
let's press the attack as well.

-I thought you'd never ask!
-[Patrice grunts]

Is it over?

[sighs]

00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:48.890
Huh?

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:55.821
Hey there!

00:08:55.904 --> 00:08:57.741
I'm Timothy of Counter Arrow.

00:08:57.825 --> 00:08:59.452
Thank you-- [grunts]

00:09:00.664 --> 00:09:03.168
You got a lot of nerve
giving me that dopey smile

00:09:03.252 --> 00:09:05.089
after you tried
to swipe our prey.

00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:06.216
Are you joking?

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.014
We didn't know anyone else
was working a job down here!

00:09:09.097 --> 00:09:11.393
I announced it
in front of the entire Guild!

00:09:11.476 --> 00:09:13.022
[SUZANNE]
Well, it's news to us!

00:09:15.026 --> 00:09:16.153
Oh.

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:18.867
Do you know something
about this, Rudeus?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.871
[RUDEUS]
Well, come to think of it,

00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:22.206
he did mention something

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.377
about a job at the Guild hall
the other day.

00:09:25.296 --> 00:09:26.924
I think
they were going to exterminate

00:09:27.008 --> 00:09:29.889
a Snow Drake infestation
in Ilbron Cave.

00:09:30.515 --> 00:09:31.768
In Ilbron Cave?

00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:34.022
That's a day and a half away
from here!

00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:36.569
-These are the Galgau Ruins!
-[Timothy grunts]

00:09:36.653 --> 00:09:38.405
-Suzanne, please, it's fine.
-[sighs]

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:39.617
You okay, Timothy?

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.537
How's your face feeling?

00:09:41.621 --> 00:09:42.581
I'm fine.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.627
He was kind enough
to take it easy on me.

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:47.048
Sara, lower your bow, please.

00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:48.635
[Sara grunts]

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:51.682
[TIMOTHY]
I think I see what happened.

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:55.064
This castle was once the base
for a Demon King,

00:09:55.147 --> 00:09:57.861
with tunnels branching off
to who-knows-where.

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.909
Maybe one of them opened up
between the ruins and the cave.

00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:03.205
So what, you're saying
you came out here

00:10:03.288 --> 00:10:05.544
-on a different job?
-[TIMOTHY] That's right.

00:10:05.627 --> 00:10:07.088
You can confirm this
with the Guild

00:10:07.171 --> 00:10:08.758
when you return to town
if you like.

00:10:10.177 --> 00:10:11.138
[scoffs]

00:10:11.221 --> 00:10:13.685
Well, sorry for punching you
out of nowhere, then.

00:10:13.768 --> 00:10:14.645
That's all right.

00:10:14.729 --> 00:10:16.899
We both misunderstood
the situation.

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:19.112
I'm sorry we had to run
into each other.

00:10:19.195 --> 00:10:20.866
Well, I don't care
how many you killed,

00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:22.661
these Drakes
were still our prey.

00:10:22.745 --> 00:10:24.874
We'll let you claim one corpse,
but that's it,

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.376
you understand me?

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.713
[TIMOTHY]
Yes, of course.

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:33.223
Okay then,
let's gather up our scales

00:10:33.307 --> 00:10:34.852
and head on back to town.

00:10:34.935 --> 00:10:37.440
We can celebrate together
once we get there.

00:10:37.524 --> 00:10:39.027
[PATRICE]
You got it, boss.

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.448
I need a drink after this.

00:10:41.532 --> 00:10:45.206
Hey, Rudeus, you should come
to the afterparty for once.

00:10:45.289 --> 00:10:46.124
Huh?

00:10:50.424 --> 00:10:52.470
[SUZANNE]
Well then. Cheers!

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.349
[ALL]
Cheers!

00:10:54.432 --> 00:10:56.478
[gulping and sighs]

00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:59.150
Feels good
to have made it out of that mess

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:00.486
without losing anyone,

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.116
though it was pretty close
for a minute, there.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.705
Yeah, you got really lucky,
Rudeus.

00:11:05.789 --> 00:11:07.208
[RUDEUS]
Was that luck?

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.379
It felt more like
you guys rescued me.

00:11:09.462 --> 00:11:11.299
[SARA] Yeah,
and you're lucky that we did.

00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.930
Most parties would've left you
to die out there.

00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:16.644
Well, I'm grateful.

00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:17.604
Don't thank me.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:21.779
You should be thanking
Timothy and Suzanne,

00:11:21.862 --> 00:11:23.073
they deserve all the credit.

00:11:23.616 --> 00:11:25.327
Oh, you say that now,

00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:27.248
but you're the one
who rushed back in

00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:28.458
before any of us.

00:11:28.543 --> 00:11:31.047
You insisted
that we could save him!

00:11:31.131 --> 00:11:33.010
-[bangs]
-[SARA] Shut up, Suzanne!

00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:35.431
You helped us out last time
with the Grizzlies,

00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:37.644
so I wanted to return the favor.

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:39.314
I don't like
being in anyone's debt,

00:11:39.397 --> 00:11:40.859
and that's all there is to it!

00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:44.490
In any case,
we made it back in one piece,

00:11:44.575 --> 00:11:46.161
and got plenty of cash!

00:11:46.244 --> 00:11:47.748
That's my kind of job!

00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:50.127
[all laugh]

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.133
Although, shame
we had to run into that jerk.

00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:55.555
Would've been even better
if we hadn't.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.183
[sighs]

00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:59.437
[MIMIR] Yeah, being
the toughest party in the Guild

00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:01.358
made them pretty insufferable.

00:12:01.441 --> 00:12:03.821
[PATRICE] I wish they'd stick
to their damn labyrinths.

00:12:03.905 --> 00:12:06.911
[SUZANNE] And that jackass
calls himself a party leader?

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:08.372
[RUDEUS]
I can't help but wonder

00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:10.669
if Paul was like that
when he was younger.

00:12:12.421 --> 00:12:15.887
[both laughing]

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.806
Huh?

00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:23.193
[Soldat chuckling]

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:24.404
[SOLDAT]
Hey.

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:25.907
What do you want?

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.744
I was all worked up
back in the cave,

00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.665
so I thought I'd come
set things straight

00:12:29.748 --> 00:12:30.583
with you people.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.508
I didn't know what was going on
and I kind of screwed up.

00:12:34.591 --> 00:12:36.554
So I guess
what I'm trying to say,

00:12:36.637 --> 00:12:39.643
ugh, that was my bad,
or whatever.

00:12:41.146 --> 00:12:42.273
-But that said!
-[yelps]

00:12:42.356 --> 00:12:44.820
Your face just pisses me off,
man.

00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:46.489
Always grinning like an idiot,

00:12:46.574 --> 00:12:49.120
and then you just let a guy
punch you like that?

00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.582
Didn't even argue or nothing,

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:52.418
you're just
all smiles and bruises,

00:12:52.502 --> 00:12:54.422
and I hate that shit!

00:12:54.506 --> 00:12:57.178
Sometimes, a man's gotta fight!
You feel me?

00:12:57.846 --> 00:12:59.850
Well, yes, perhaps you're right.

00:12:59.933 --> 00:13:02.104
Suzanne often tells me
I'm too passive.

00:13:02.188 --> 00:13:03.273
I'll remember that.

00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:06.697
[chuckles]

00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:08.701
Good, yeah, you remember that.

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:13.251
[SOLDAT]
[sighs] Now. Quagmire.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.128
Yes?

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.305
Tim here's one thing,
but I can't stand your ass, kid.

00:13:19.388 --> 00:13:21.644
You got this weird,
people-pleasey attitude,

00:13:21.727 --> 00:13:23.063
-but no one's buying it.
-[sighs]

00:13:23.146 --> 00:13:25.025
[SOLDAT] Yeah,
and that creepy grin of yours

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:26.236
makes me sick!

00:13:26.319 --> 00:13:28.406
Maybe you think that's a smile,
but it ain't.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.868
Try a little harder!

00:13:29.952 --> 00:13:32.206
We can see the contempt
in your eyes!

00:13:32.289 --> 00:13:34.545
-Who do you think you are, huh?
-[Rudeus gasps]

00:13:34.628 --> 00:13:36.549
-Come on, Sol. Give it a rest--
-Let go of me!

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:39.805
Look at him, his dumb face,
pouty cry mouth,

00:13:39.888 --> 00:13:41.517
you're the saddest boy
in the world!

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.478
I don't know what happened
to you, Quagmire,

00:13:43.563 --> 00:13:44.773
but you're depressing!

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:46.276
So you can either learn
to man up

00:13:46.359 --> 00:13:47.696
and face your stupid problems,

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.533
or get the hell out of my Guild!

00:13:49.616 --> 00:13:51.704
[wind rushing]

00:13:52.413 --> 00:13:54.626
[RUDEUS] I didn't realize
I bothered you so much.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.883
I'll do my best to stay out
of your sight from now on.

00:13:57.966 --> 00:13:59.553
-[SOLDAT] Oh, bullshit!
-[crashes]

00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:01.974
What is that supposed to mean?

00:14:02.057 --> 00:14:03.936
-Are you trying to piss me off?
-[Rudeus gasps]

00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:05.397
Is it fun for you,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.901
acting like a martyr
all the time,

00:14:06.984 --> 00:14:09.196
or acting like you're too good
for money?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.077
We all need cash to survive,
you brat!

00:14:12.704 --> 00:14:14.332
That's enough, Sol.
Go sleep this off.

00:14:14.415 --> 00:14:16.461
Ah, shut up.
Let me go, Konrad.

00:14:17.004 --> 00:14:18.298
Listen, Quagmire!

00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:20.970
If you hate your life so much,
drop dead!

00:14:21.054 --> 00:14:23.559
At least then I won't have
to see your stupid face again!

00:14:23.643 --> 00:14:25.228
I'm so sick of your shit.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.199
Ugh, that guy is the worst.

00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:35.667
[sighs]

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:47.022
[door creaking]

00:14:47.106 --> 00:14:50.487
Hm? [sighs]

00:14:54.621 --> 00:14:57.042
[SOLDAT] Aw,
waiting for cheap jobs again?

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:58.963
I have my reasons
for doing this.

00:14:59.046 --> 00:15:00.883
[SOLDAT]
Well, I bet your reasons suck.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:03.681
You half-ass everything
you ever do, don't you?

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:05.935
[scoffs]

00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:15.203
[door creaking]

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:17.876
[RUDEUS]
Hello.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:19.336
Oh, it's Rudeus.

00:15:20.255 --> 00:15:21.884
[RUDEUS]
Is something wrong?

00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:22.969
[sighs]

00:15:24.388 --> 00:15:25.975
It's Mimir and Sara.

00:15:26.059 --> 00:15:26.894
[gasps]

00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:29.398
Are they okay?

00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:31.612
They're both dead.

00:15:33.574 --> 00:15:35.578
[RUDEUS]
Oh, I...

00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:37.624
[TIMOTHY]
No.

00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:40.128
Mimir is dead,
but Sara just got separated.

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:42.174
If we leave now, we may
still be able to find her.

00:15:42.257 --> 00:15:44.763
If we try to go back out
right now in this blizzard,

00:15:44.846 --> 00:15:47.519
we'll die
long before we ever find her.

00:15:48.646 --> 00:15:50.273
We shouldn't have left.

00:15:50.357 --> 00:15:51.860
I shouldn't have made the call.

00:15:52.695 --> 00:15:54.574
[SUZANNE]
We all agreed to run.

00:15:54.658 --> 00:15:57.204
We're equally responsible, okay?

00:15:58.164 --> 00:16:00.545
[RUDEUS]
Um, where did you lose her?

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.676
[SUZANNE]
In Trier Forest, to the west.

00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:05.930
The blizzard blinded us,

00:16:06.013 --> 00:16:08.101
and then a herd of Snow Buffalo
attacked.

00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:09.813
[RUDEUS]
I see.

00:16:10.565 --> 00:16:12.025
That must have been awful.

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:13.529
But I should be going.

00:16:13.612 --> 00:16:14.698
[door creaking]

00:16:26.262 --> 00:16:29.519
[raging]

00:16:29.603 --> 00:16:34.613
[rushing]

00:16:43.797 --> 00:16:45.676
[SOLDAT]
Well, I bet your reasons suck.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.641
You half-ass everything
you ever do, don't you?

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.561
[RUDEUS]
Maybe he was right.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:53.024
What the hell am I doing
out here alone?

00:16:53.107 --> 00:16:54.819
Stroking my own ego?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.115
Of course I want to find Sara,

00:16:57.199 --> 00:17:00.413
but I don't think I even care
if she's alive or dead.

00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:01.833
Maybe I just want to take action

00:17:01.917 --> 00:17:03.419
and have something
to show for it.

00:17:04.714 --> 00:17:06.551
Get a result. Any result.

00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:09.849
Or maybe I wanted
to actively make the choice

00:17:09.933 --> 00:17:11.770
not to abandon someone.

00:17:12.522 --> 00:17:14.358
The way Eris abandoned me.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.447
That could be all there is
to it.

[crashing]

00:17:19.034 --> 00:17:21.497
[whimpers]

00:17:21.581 --> 00:17:24.211
[RUDEUS]
But... what if I do find her?

00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:26.007
[crashing]

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:27.050
[RUDEUS]
I don't know.

00:17:27.552 --> 00:17:29.221
Maybe
I shouldn't get my hopes up.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.772
I'm not going to accomplish
anything here.

00:17:34.398 --> 00:17:35.735
How could I?

00:17:35.818 --> 00:17:38.574
[clattering]

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:39.491
[gasps]

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:43.499
Is that Mimir?

00:17:43.584 --> 00:17:46.339
[gasps and retches]

00:17:46.422 --> 00:17:51.432
[coughing and panting]

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:04.626
Where's Sara?

00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:09.803
[gasps]

00:18:11.682 --> 00:18:12.975
[Rudeus gasps]

00:18:13.936 --> 00:18:14.771
[Rudeus sighs]

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.612
[blazing]

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:20.533
[RUDEUS] It's not like
Sara and I were close

00:18:20.616 --> 00:18:21.450
or anything.

00:18:22.578 --> 00:18:26.043
But, she hadn't been nearly
as prickly lately.

00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:31.805
I bet we could have been
friends, eventually.

00:18:36.439 --> 00:18:38.067
[gasps and grunts]

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:40.906
[crackles]

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.077
[whooshing]

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.628
Sara! [grunts]

00:18:49.214 --> 00:18:51.553
[grunting]

00:18:51.636 --> 00:18:53.306
Sara! Sara!

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:54.767
[pants]

00:18:58.191 --> 00:18:59.026

[whimpers]

00:19:13.764 --> 00:19:15.350
[RUDEUS]
Sara. Sara!

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.522
[SARA]
Who's there?

00:19:18.147 --> 00:19:19.149
[RUDEUS]
It's Rudeus.

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:21.655
[SARA]
Rudeus?

00:19:23.449 --> 00:19:24.702
I'm here to save you.

00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:29.461
[raging]

00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:39.607
[gasps]

00:19:43.824 --> 00:19:44.659
[gasps]

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:50.921
[SARA]
Okay, now, do you mind?

00:19:51.005 --> 00:19:53.844
Nope, go ahead.
Thank you very much.

00:19:54.554 --> 00:19:56.140
[SARA] What are you
thanking me for,

00:19:56.223 --> 00:19:57.058
weirdo?

00:19:58.019 --> 00:20:00.899
There's nothing wrong
with your leg, still, is there?

00:20:00.983 --> 00:20:02.695
Uh-uh. It's fine.

00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:07.245
It doesn't even hurt now.
All good.

00:20:07.329 --> 00:20:08.790
[RUDEUS]
Well, if you're sure.

00:20:10.126 --> 00:20:12.088
I just feel like something
is off.

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:15.178
I told you, everything is fine.

00:20:15.888 --> 00:20:17.015
Oh.

00:20:17.098 --> 00:20:19.646
But you being here alone
is kind of weird, I guess.

00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:21.524
[RUDEUS]
Uh, well, you know.

00:20:21.608 --> 00:20:24.363
Your party mentioned
you were missing, so...

00:20:24.446 --> 00:20:26.743
What? Are they all okay?

00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:30.041
[RUDEUS]
Mimir is dead.

00:20:32.087 --> 00:20:32.922
[SARA]
Oh.

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:45.029
You ready to head back to town?

00:20:46.073 --> 00:20:46.908
[SARA]
Mm.

00:20:57.262 --> 00:20:59.391
-[SARA] Listen.
-[RUDEUS] Hm?

00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:00.978
[gasps]

00:21:02.063 --> 00:21:05.278
I'm really glad,
you came to rescue me.

00:21:05.361 --> 00:21:06.196
[chuckles]

00:21:08.242 --> 00:21:10.038
[RUDEUS]
And just like that,

00:21:10.121 --> 00:21:12.500
something inside me
clicked together.

00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:14.630
I feel like I've been forgiven

00:21:14.714 --> 00:21:17.469
for everything
I've done and been.

00:21:17.553 --> 00:21:21.059
In a way, I sort of feel like
Sara just saved me.

00:21:25.527 --> 00:21:26.571
[SARA]
Suzanne!

00:21:26.654 --> 00:21:28.074
-[SUZANNE] Sara?
-[Sara sighs]

00:21:28.157 --> 00:21:29.493
You had me so worried.

00:21:29.577 --> 00:21:31.831
We were just setting out
to go look for you again.

00:21:32.332 --> 00:21:34.504
It's okay. Rudeus rescued me.

00:21:35.004 --> 00:21:35.923
Did you--

00:21:36.006 --> 00:21:37.510
Did you set out by yourself

00:21:37.593 --> 00:21:39.722
after we told you
what happened last night?

00:21:40.223 --> 00:21:42.102
Well, I-- Yeah...

00:21:42.185 --> 00:21:43.980
Do you have any idea
how reckless that was?

00:21:44.064 --> 00:21:45.901
How would we have felt
if you died out there?

00:21:45.984 --> 00:21:49.199
Suzanne! You don't have to
put it like that, jeez!

00:21:49.867 --> 00:21:51.830
No, I suppose
you're right about that.

00:21:51.913 --> 00:21:54.417
I'm not exactly myself
right now.

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:57.048
Rudeus, I apologize.

00:21:57.131 --> 00:21:59.929
I should have started by saying
thank you for saving her.

00:22:00.012 --> 00:22:00.848
Sorry.

00:22:02.225 --> 00:22:03.060
[Timothy sighs]

00:22:04.229 --> 00:22:05.147
[TIMOTHY]
Rudeus.

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:10.199
I'm grateful.
I mean that with all I am.

00:22:10.283 --> 00:22:11.159
[Rudeus gasps]

00:22:11.243 --> 00:22:12.705
[TIMOTHY]
If there's any way at all

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:14.374
we can repay you,

00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:15.544
just name it.

00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:18.215
[RUDEUS] Please,
you don't need to thank me.

00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:22.473
You've done so much
to help me already, honest.

00:22:23.267 --> 00:22:24.979
[RUDEUS]
And I mean that too.

00:22:25.062 --> 00:22:26.524
Counter Arrow has been there
for me

00:22:26.608 --> 00:22:28.904
since the second
we stepped foot in this town.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.866
They don't owe me a thing.

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:35.207
If you like, we can just say
this makes us even, okay?

00:22:36.502 --> 00:22:37.337
Really?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.675
If you insist.

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:43.349
But if you need us,
we'll always be around.

00:22:43.432 --> 00:22:46.606
Okay. And hey,
the same goes for you guys.

00:22:46.689 --> 00:22:47.524
[gasps]

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:50.071
[sighs]

00:22:55.289 --> 00:22:56.793
[RUDEUS]
I ought to go home.

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:58.755
[TIMOTHY]
Okay. I'll walk you there.

00:23:00.383 --> 00:23:01.218
[SARA]
Rudeus!

00:23:02.303 --> 00:23:03.305
I'll see you later.

00:23:04.474 --> 00:23:06.646
Make sure
you get some rest today.

00:23:20.131 --> 00:23:21.759
[RUDEUS]
Time for a break.

00:23:21.843 --> 00:23:23.095
I think I earned it.

00:23:34.952 --> 00:23:38.417
I feel like I can sleep soundly
for the first time in ages.
