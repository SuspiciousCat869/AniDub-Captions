[wind blowing]

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.239
[horse neighs]

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:26.762
-[MAN 1] Alright!
-[MAN 2] Dammit!

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:28.849
[MAN 1] Wanna go again?
[laughs]

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.018
[MAN 3] Are you cheating?

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:31.563
[MAN 1] What? No!

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.441
[MAN 2]
Mm, you sure about that?

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:35.947
[MAN 1] Oh, please.
Here, watch me do it.

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:40.581
[carriage rattling]

00:00:47.303 --> 00:00:49.975
-Ahh!
-See? It's just my lucky day!

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:51.311
Sorry.

00:00:51.394 --> 00:00:52.731
[MAN 4] You've gotta be
cheating.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:55.193
[MAN 2] Yeah.
[MAN 1] Now, put up or shut up.

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:56.613
-[sigh]
-[MAN 2] Just take it.

00:00:56.697 --> 00:00:58.617
[MAN 1] You'll get me next time
for sure.

00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:04.253
Okay.

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:06.884
-[MAN 2] I can't with this guy.
-[MAN 1] 'Eyyy!

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.219
-[man 1 chuckles]
-[sigh]

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:11.685
What's with you?

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:14.398
You've been heaving sighs like
that since we left the capital.

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.777
Hmm?

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:29.136
Sorry 'bout that.

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:33.395
So, what brings you
this far up north?

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.652
With all due respect,
why do you care?

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:39.031
The Northern Territories
are dangerous.

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:40.785
And though
you're traveling solo,

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:43.289
you don't exactly strike me
as the adventuring type.

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:45.753
Mage or not,
you are still a kid, right?

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:47.339
Hey, sorry,

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.011
but there's no reason I need
to answer any of your questions.

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:58.529
Okay, what's your freakin' deal,
kid?

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:00.031
She's trying to be nice!

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:02.494
Now, Sara.
It's not like he's...

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.956
-[RUDEUS] She's just like...
-...trying to start a fight.

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.417
-He's just a little blunt.
-Yeah, I know!

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.173
But you've been worried about
him since yesterday, Suzanne!

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:10.803
And now he's acting like you're
harassing him or something.

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:13.684
Search and rescue.

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:17.316
My mother was a victim of the
mass-teleportation in Fittoa.

00:02:23.077 --> 00:02:24.330
Yeah, well, whatever.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.919
Still don't have to be so rude.

00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:29.423
What's your plan?

00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:31.512
The Northern Territories
are huge.

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.682
You're not gonna find her
stumbling around.

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:38.358
I suppose you're right.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.070
One step at a time, I guess.

00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:41.615
[SUZANNE]
Do you have a lead?

00:02:43.536 --> 00:02:46.040
I could give you a quick primer
on the northlands

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:47.752
while we're on the road,
if you like.

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:50.382
Oh, yeah?

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.637
Well, if you're offering, sure.

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.181
Alright!

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:57.020
Now pick the wax outta
your ears and listen up, kiddo.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:58.481
You may have noticed

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.570
most countries
in the northlands are poor,

00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:02.615
but the
"Three Great Magical Nations"

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.159
all do pretty well
for themselves.

00:03:04.578 --> 00:03:08.042
The Kingdom of Ranoa is known
for the University of Magic.

00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:11.173
The Duchy of Neris produces
great magical implements.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:15.348
And the Duchy of Basherant
specializes in arcane research.

00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:17.394
We're actually
on our way to Basherant now.

00:03:17.477 --> 00:03:19.524
Anyway, those three pooled
their knowledge

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:20.693
and formed an alliance,

00:03:20.776 --> 00:03:23.197
and now they're the
dominant power in this region.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.868
With me so far?

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.106
[indistinct chatter]

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.130
Hey-hey! The gang's all here.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:54.259
I'm beat,
let's get going already!

00:03:54.343 --> 00:03:56.013
I wanna take a bath.

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.397
It's freezing here.

00:04:04.071 --> 00:04:05.073
Excuse me.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.452
I'd like a room for a month.

00:04:08.037 --> 00:04:09.666
Ahh, you got it.

00:04:10.626 --> 00:04:11.545
Just a second.

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:15.051
I'll need your signature.

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.151
Great.

00:04:23.234 --> 00:04:26.742
You'll be on the third floor,
far end of the hall, as for pay.

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:29.581
Huh? Huh? Oh!

00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:40.268
[indistinct chatter]

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.042
I miss you.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.089
Stop it.

00:04:55.925 --> 00:04:58.639
[RUDEUS FORMER SELF] You're not
traveling to get over Eris.

00:04:58.722 --> 00:05:00.141
You're here to find Zenith.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:03.524
[sigh]

00:05:05.318 --> 00:05:07.239
[indistinct chatter]

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:10.663
I hear the pay is great,
though.

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:11.665
Oh, yeah?

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:17.510
Whoa, it's a little kid.

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:18.679
Must be a newbie.

00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:19.681
Yeah, right.

00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:21.601
Or he's just playing
make-believe.

00:05:22.562 --> 00:05:23.981
Who's this little guy?

00:05:24.064 --> 00:05:26.778
-What's he doing here alone?
-Looks like a pushover to me.

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:31.580
Excuse me,

00:05:31.663 --> 00:05:34.752
would you mind helping me
officially disband my party?

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.132
Oh. Sure.

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:43.854
Sir? I, uh...

00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:49.699
[RUDEUS]
Sorry, here.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.454
[RECEPTIONIST]
This will only take a moment.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.673
Oh, man, do you think?

00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:00.053
Yeah, sounds like his
party got wiped out.

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:03.017
I can't imagine what that's
like, being the sole survivor.

00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:12.745
[RUDEUS]
I'd like to take this job.

00:06:12.828 --> 00:06:13.914
Huh?

00:06:14.456 --> 00:06:16.460
Oh, but what about your party?

00:06:16.878 --> 00:06:18.590
I'll do it alone.

00:06:18.674 --> 00:06:20.343
[RECEPTIONIST]
But this is an A-ranked job!

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:21.261
Doing it yourself would be...

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:22.430
[RUDEUS FORMER SELF]
Quit harping

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.142
and just give me
the details already.

00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:35.373
[SUZANNE]
What's up?

00:06:35.456 --> 00:06:36.793
Arguing about something?

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:40.968
I wouldn't call it
an argument, no.

00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:43.431
Sure, sure, didn't mean
to eavesdrop, but I did.

00:06:43.974 --> 00:06:45.519
Your old party was wiped out,

00:06:45.602 --> 00:06:47.147
but you need money
to look for your mom,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.902
that's why you want to take
this job by yourself, right?

00:06:49.986 --> 00:06:50.946
[RUDEUS]
Well.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.954
Doesn't look to me
like you're up for it, though.

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:57.000
Kinda looks like
you don't even care

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.545
whether you live or die anymore.

00:07:00.048 --> 00:07:02.553
So, that being said,
how about this:

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:04.515
why don't we take it on
together?

00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:07.897
I dunno.

00:07:10.986 --> 00:07:12.990
We don't usually go
for outside help,

00:07:13.074 --> 00:07:15.579
but we're all
on unfamiliar turf right now,

00:07:15.662 --> 00:07:17.833
so at least
until we get our bearings here,

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:19.211
couldn't hurt to team up.

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:22.843
No, thank you,
I'd rather work alone.

00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:27.143
There's only so much you can do
by yourself.

00:07:27.812 --> 00:07:30.526
The one thing you need
above all is help, kid.

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:31.443
And if you ask me,

00:07:31.528 --> 00:07:35.034
best way to get it is by joining
parties and staying alive.

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:36.871
Tell him I'm right, you guys.

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:38.165
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.169
You agree, don'tcha, Sara?

00:07:40.253 --> 00:07:41.296
Yeah, sure.

00:07:42.423 --> 00:07:43.885
[RUDEUS FORMER SELF]
So that's it.

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:47.392
Of course, she doesn't want
my help, she just pities me.

00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:50.314
Now, you do look
pretty young still,

00:07:50.398 --> 00:07:52.485
but I'll bet
you can hold your own.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.114
What are your specialties?

00:07:54.197 --> 00:07:56.911
[RUDEUS] I'm good at supporting
melee fighters with magic.

00:07:56.995 --> 00:07:58.999
I usually stick to the rear.

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:00.502
Do you? Perfect.

00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:02.172
We were just talking about

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:04.760
how our party could use
someone else on the backline.

00:08:07.975 --> 00:08:09.979
[RUDEUS]
Okay, then. I'll go.

00:08:10.062 --> 00:08:11.566
Great, that settles it.

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:13.737
So let's spend
the rest of today getting ready,

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.033
and plan to meet at
the north gate tomorrow morning.

00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:19.624
We can work out whatever
the updated formation will be

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:20.542
on the road.

00:08:21.586 --> 00:08:22.630
Sounds good.

00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:25.802
Oh, my gosh,
are you still sulking?

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.305
You are such a big baby.

00:08:27.388 --> 00:08:28.892
Will you shut up already?

00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:33.944
[RUDEUS FORMER SELF] Even more
like her than I thought.

00:08:35.697 --> 00:08:37.075
[grunts]

00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:44.548
[yawning]

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:46.928
[MAN 5] Okay, let's go.
[MAN 6] Yeah!

00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:48.723
[MAN 5] This job should be
a pretty good payday.

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:49.976
[MAN 6]
Yeah?

00:08:50.059 --> 00:08:52.063
Then let's get it over
with and have a drink.

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:53.817
[MAN 5]
Haven't you had enough yet?

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.656
[MAN 6] Just got my hands on
some Asuran wine.

00:08:56.739 --> 00:08:58.577
[MAN 5] Congratulations.
Now focus on the job.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.413
[MAN 6] Please, I've got this!

00:09:00.496 --> 00:09:02.918
I could take on the
Seven Great Powers right now!

00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:05.172
Check this out! Boom! Flex!

00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:07.218
[SUZANNE]
Hey, you're early!

00:09:08.137 --> 00:09:10.601
You didn't seem too excited
yesterday, so I wondered.

00:09:11.602 --> 00:09:13.314
I just happened
to wake up early.

00:09:13.397 --> 00:09:14.859
Uh-huh.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.827
My name's Rudeus Greyrat,
I'm a mage.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.457
And I can cast spells
without incantations.

00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:25.672
Rudeus.

00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:26.924
Good to have you.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.266
My name's Suzanne.

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.978
I'm one of our
frontline fighters,

00:09:54.062 --> 00:09:56.567
and Counter Arrow's illustrious
sub-leader.

00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:57.945

00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:48.740
[RUDEUS FORMER SELF]
I'd completely forgotten.

00:21:50.577 --> 00:21:52.163
To get serious about living.

00:21:55.086 --> 00:21:57.006
What the hell is wrong with me?

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.010
[crying]

00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:10.032
Of course, you haven't
"lost everything," you moron!

00:22:10.868 --> 00:22:12.830
[crying]

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:23.852

Remember when you first came

00:22:23.935 --> 00:22:25.396
into this world.

00:22:26.774 --> 00:22:28.152
Remember Roxy.

00:22:28.695 --> 00:22:30.908
Remember the day
she took you outside.

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:33.329
She taught you so much.

00:22:34.749 --> 00:22:36.961
You can't betray
those lessons now.

00:22:39.884 --> 00:22:41.470
I haven't lost everything.

00:22:42.305 --> 00:22:43.474
Not by a long shot.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.981
Sure, I lost something
that I cared about very much,

00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:49.570
but that doesn't mean I have
nothing left to live for.

00:22:50.404 --> 00:22:51.574
I have all of them.

00:22:53.578 --> 00:22:55.582
I can't fall to pieces.

00:22:57.418 --> 00:23:00.550
We may be far apart,
but I'm not alone.

00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:04.558
And things still suck.

00:23:04.642 --> 00:23:08.399
But I've got to remember:
I've had it way worse.

00:23:31.863 --> 00:23:35.871
I'll keep moving forward, and
I'll do what needs to be done.

00:23:37.123 --> 00:23:39.587

Master, please guide me.
