00:10:02.412 --> 00:10:03.540
for feminine wiles.

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:04.625
[exclaims]

00:10:05.502 --> 00:10:07.756
You needn't put
it so brutishly, Luke.

00:10:08.215 --> 00:10:09.510
[LUKE] Your Highness,
the Greyrat men

00:10:09.593 --> 00:10:10.929
have been drawn
to buxom women

00:10:11.012 --> 00:10:12.014
for generations.

00:10:12.265 --> 00:10:14.562
If he's anything like
the rest of us, it won't work.

00:10:14.937 --> 00:10:16.398
Personally,
I feel no attraction

00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:18.360
to Sylphie at all,
and I never have.

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:22.160
However...

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.168
Wow, what is that for?

00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.675
This, ladies, is a powerful
Fittoan aphrodisiac.

00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:31.094
Behold.

00:10:31.178 --> 00:10:32.514
-[ARIEL] You're joking.
-[SYLPHIETTE] You're joking.

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:35.352
[LUKE] It was at one time
widely distributed.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.774
But the facility
where it was manufactured

00:10:37.858 --> 00:10:40.739
and the recipe they used were
lost to the mass teleportation,

00:10:40.822 --> 00:10:43.202
so eventually,
the asking price soared

00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:45.456
to over 100 gold pieces
per bottle.

00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:49.297
I've been holding onto this
in case I ever found myself

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.842
in urgent need of money.

00:10:51.636 --> 00:10:53.515
But, you should take it.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.602
It's so valuable, though.

00:10:56.102 --> 00:10:57.898
-Are you sure?
-[LUKE] Of course.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.862
But listen, any man
who drinks this stuff

00:11:00.946 --> 00:11:02.490
will completely lose control.

00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:04.912
So if you can't keep up,

00:11:05.246 --> 00:11:06.999
you may want to drink
some of it yourself.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.630
And keep in mind
that your first time

00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:11.299
won't go
the way you've envisioned.

00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:12.886
It never does.

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:14.515
Thank you, Luke.

00:11:16.644 --> 00:11:17.646
I appreciate it.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.232
Oh, think nothing of it.

00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:21.612
You've saved my life
often enough,

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:22.865
I definitely owed you.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.290
[ARIEL] I love how you two
have become friends.

00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:29.587
Here, let me chip in, too.

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:34.470
[SYLPHIETTE] But, Princess,
isn't this your personal money?

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:37.143
[ARIEL] Yes, my spending money
for this month.

00:11:37.811 --> 00:11:39.857
Please, take it.
At this point in the game,

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.278
it's the only helpful thing
I have left to give.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.244
[SYLPHIETTE] Thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:11:46.787 --> 00:11:48.666
Benevolent as always,
your Grace.

00:11:49.334 --> 00:11:51.589
Sylphie...best of luck.

00:11:52.674 --> 00:11:54.929
Okay.
Here I go.

00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:06.409
[SYLPHIETTE]
Princess Ariel picked out

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:07.788
some new underwear for me.

00:12:08.706 --> 00:12:10.877
And I have the aphrodisiac
that Luke gave me.

00:12:11.962 --> 00:12:12.965
Okay.

00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:15.135
[breathes deeply]

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:18.768
Mom, Dad,
give me your blessing.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.439
Tonight I'm going to become
a woman.

00:12:22.693 --> 00:12:24.445
[knocking on door]

00:12:26.282 --> 00:12:30.082
Yes? Oh! Hey, Syl...
Master Fitz, rather.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.002
Please, come on in.

00:12:32.963 --> 00:12:33.965
[SYLPHIETTE]
Thanks.

00:12:36.136 --> 00:12:38.140
[door creaking shut]

00:12:41.271 --> 00:12:42.273
-[RUDEUS] So what's up?
-[Sylphiette gasps]

00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:43.860
You were so tired earlier.

00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:45.864
I thought you'd be going
straight to bed.

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:47.408
Well...

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.538
I came to stay the night.

00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:51.792
Huh?! Uh, oh.

00:12:52.544 --> 00:12:55.759
Okay, if you want.
Come in and sit down, then.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.522
[chuckles]

00:13:07.532 --> 00:13:08.743
-What is that?
-Oh...

00:13:08.951 --> 00:13:10.412
I brought that for us to share.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:12.333
After all,
we ought to do something

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:13.920
to celebrate our reunion,
right?

00:13:14.128 --> 00:13:15.673
Oh, yeah, true.

00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:17.677
We should commemorate
the occasion.

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:22.646
[RUDEUS]
Here.

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:23.773
You need cups, right?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.860
I have plenty,
I eat in here a lot.

00:13:27.196 --> 00:13:29.117
[SYLPHIETTE] Well, then,
here's to old friends

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.329
from Buena Village,
reunited at last!

00:13:31.496 --> 00:13:34.043
[RUDEUS] Cheers!
And to our future, Sylphie.

00:13:34.795 --> 00:13:36.381
[SYLPHIETTE]
Y-Yeah! Cheers!

00:13:37.843 --> 00:13:38.845
"Our future?"

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:41.809
Rudy says the most
embarrassing stuff sometimes.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.817
[coughs]

00:13:46.067 --> 00:13:47.319
That's no good, are you okay?

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.783
You did get
some awfully strong stuff.

00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:51.494
-Lemme see it.
-Huh?

00:13:52.454 --> 00:13:53.456
Here.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.712
I'll dilute it. This would
probably be pretty good

00:13:55.795 --> 00:13:56.672
with hot water.

00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:58.008
-[liquid sloshing]
-Now try it.

00:13:58.593 --> 00:13:59.595
Ah, thank you.

00:14:03.393 --> 00:14:05.565
You know what's funny?
That hot water trick

00:14:05.648 --> 00:14:07.611
is why I started learning magic
from you.

00:14:07.736 --> 00:14:08.821
Oh, was it really?

00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:11.911
Remember? Those bullies
had been pelting me with mud,

00:14:12.328 --> 00:14:14.750
so you helped me rinse off
on the side of the road.

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.254
Oh, yeah.
That was so long ago.

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:18.716
Yeah.

00:14:22.014 --> 00:14:23.684
I wonder if our tree
is still there,

00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:25.103
in Buena Village.

00:14:25.688 --> 00:14:28.193
I was thinking about it a lot
on our walk through the forest.

00:14:28.485 --> 00:14:31.074
Yeah, we did spend a lot
of time under that tree, huh?

00:14:31.992 --> 00:14:34.038
That's where we had
all of our magic lessons!

00:14:34.163 --> 00:14:36.209
You showed me how to conjure
water first.

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:39.256
And silent spellcasting
came so naturally to you!

00:14:39.925 --> 00:14:40.927
It did, yeah.

00:14:42.262 --> 00:14:43.390
That was a lot of fun.

00:14:46.479 --> 00:14:49.151
Uh, I forgot.
I brought something else, too.

00:14:51.782 --> 00:14:52.784
[RUDEUS]
What is that?

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.913
Um... It's a medicine

00:14:54.997 --> 00:14:57.126
that's supposed to fix
your you-know-what.

00:14:57.752 --> 00:14:59.631
[SYLPHIETTE] I don't know
if it's "medicine," exactly,

00:14:59.715 --> 00:15:02.512
but it is a drug.
So I don't think I'm lying.

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:05.977
I think I've seen
this somewhere before.

00:15:06.227 --> 00:15:08.899
Uh, I was hoping
you'd give it a try.

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:18.627
It's supposed to work
right away, from what I hear.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.257
Hang on.
Do you know if it's safe

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.552
to take this with alcoh...

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:27.061
Y-Yeah, they said it's fine
to mix them. I think.

00:15:28.229 --> 00:15:29.231
And once it kicks in.

00:15:29.608 --> 00:15:31.653
Y-You don't have to hold back,
okay?

00:15:42.382 --> 00:15:43.803
Do you want to try some, too?

00:15:45.138 --> 00:15:46.850
[glugging]

00:15:47.602 --> 00:15:48.604
[Sylphiette sighs]

00:15:50.817 --> 00:15:51.985
[RUDEUS]
Are you okay?

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.831
[SYLPHIETTE]
I'm just a little nervous.

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.586
Right, yeah, me too.

00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:04.218
[rain pattering]

00:16:04.385 --> 00:16:07.391
[breathes heavily]

00:16:28.726 --> 00:16:29.728
[gasps]

00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:34.696
[RUDEUS]
Sylphiette.

00:16:35.573 --> 00:16:38.579
[breathes heavily]

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:51.395
Y-You can't resist anymore?

00:16:59.411 --> 00:17:00.790
Then, go ahead.

00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:04.088
I want you to devour me, Rudy.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.382
[gasps]

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:18.826
[indistinct chatter]

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:21.915
[birds chirping]

00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:35.066
[inhales, sighs]

00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:57.612
[indistinct chatter]

00:18:00.492 --> 00:18:01.828
Oh, I remember.

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.166
That was the aphrodisiac

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.379
the peddler
in Roa was hawking, huh.

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:25.960
She has guard duty today.

00:18:26.753 --> 00:18:27.755
She'll come back.

00:18:33.642 --> 00:18:36.648
[sobbing]

00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:45.373
Oh! Good, you're awake.

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:47.879
Hi, Rudy. Good morning!

00:18:48.881 --> 00:18:51.051
Sorry I left!
I just went to thank

00:18:51.135 --> 00:18:53.640
Princess Ariel and Luke
for all their help yesterday.

00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:55.477
O-Or, I mean,

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.024
for giving me the push
I needed, or well...

00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:00.320
Anyway,
they were both overjoyed.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.744
You should come with me
to see them sometime,

00:19:03.827 --> 00:19:05.079
I think the Princess...

00:19:12.093 --> 00:19:13.221
What's the matter?

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.565
[Rudeus sobbing]
Sylphie. Sylphie,

00:19:19.943 --> 00:19:20.945
my Sylphie.

00:19:22.322 --> 00:19:25.286
[Rudeus crying]

00:19:30.129 --> 00:19:31.298
Silly Rudy.

00:19:33.135 --> 00:19:35.265
Don't cry.
I'm right here.

00:19:45.786 --> 00:19:46.788
[gasps]

00:19:47.372 --> 00:19:48.834
Rudy! Excuse you.

00:19:51.297 --> 00:19:52.299
[gasps]

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:54.887
[RUDEUS]
I'm cured.

00:19:57.602 --> 00:19:58.812
Thank you, Sylphie.
[sniffs]

00:20:01.442 --> 00:20:02.444
[crying]

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.293
[RUDEUS]
Thank you. I love you.

00:20:22.484 --> 00:20:24.196
[RUDEUS] It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance.

00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:26.283
Rudeus Greyrat,
at your service.

00:20:27.118 --> 00:20:28.454
Your reputation resounds

00:20:28.538 --> 00:20:30.458
throughout this school
like a thunderclap.

00:20:31.043 --> 00:20:33.674
What brings you here
to see me today, Rudeus?

00:20:34.132 --> 00:20:36.930
I imagine that Sylphie...
Sylphiette, rather

00:20:37.347 --> 00:20:38.975
has told you most everything.

00:20:39.727 --> 00:20:42.065
But there's one thing
I wanted to say in person.

00:20:43.652 --> 00:20:45.446
Your Highness,
Sylphie was so good

00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:46.741
as to cure my condition...

00:20:47.743 --> 00:20:50.081
and I'm given to understand
that you and Master Luke

00:20:50.164 --> 00:20:51.250
helped her to do so.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.341
Therefore...if I can ever
be of service to you,

00:20:55.843 --> 00:20:57.137
you only need but ask.

00:21:01.478 --> 00:21:04.151
Generous. But I thought
that you shied away

00:21:04.234 --> 00:21:06.488
from power struggles
between Asuran nobles?

00:21:07.198 --> 00:21:09.620
True enough.
I'd rather not stick my nose

What's next for you, Rudeus?
