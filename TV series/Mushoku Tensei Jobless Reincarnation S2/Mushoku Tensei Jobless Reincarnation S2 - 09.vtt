I won't try to rush you
into anything with Rudeus, okay?

[RUDEUS] The more
I study the Mana Disaster,

the more it seems to me

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.362
that teleportation works
a lot like summoning.

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:25.285
But whereas summoning
calls things to you,

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:27.080
teleportation sends them away.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:30.462
And there are a couple
of other major differences.

00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:32.759
Namely,
or most insurmountably...

00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.013

00:11:18.313 --> 00:11:19.148
[NANAHOSHI]
I see.

00:11:19.692 --> 00:11:22.280
And the next thing you knew,
you were a baby?

00:11:23.156 --> 00:11:25.452
I got dumped in the middle
of the Asura Kingdom.

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.585
Then Orsted took me
under his protection.

00:11:29.628 --> 00:11:31.339
Did he ever tell you why?

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:32.759
[NANAHOSHI]
No.

00:11:33.678 --> 00:11:36.601
But it doesn't seem like
he's the one who summoned me.

00:11:36.684 --> 00:11:38.228
[footsteps]

00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:41.276
I spent two years in Asura
learning the Human language

00:11:41.359 --> 00:11:43.447
since I obviously
didn't know it.

00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:45.744
Speaking, reading, writing.

00:11:45.827 --> 00:11:46.662
Mm...

00:11:47.664 --> 00:11:48.498
[NANAHOSHI]
After that,

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.419
he took me on a journey
around the world.

00:11:51.046 --> 00:11:54.553
Orsted has enemies everywhere,
so the fights were constant.

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:57.308
Attacking you
was nothing special,

00:11:57.391 --> 00:11:59.312
but you seemed different
from the others.

00:12:00.147 --> 00:12:02.109
So I asked Orsted
to bring you back.

00:12:03.571 --> 00:12:04.405
[sighs]

00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:07.495
Wait, maybe you know.

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:08.998
What's the deal
with the Man-God?

00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:11.252
Why exactly are they at war?

00:12:11.336 --> 00:12:13.465
[NANAHOSHI] He said
it's a personal grudge, but...

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.806
beyond that,
I don't have any idea.

00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:18.768
[RUDEUS]
If it's personal,

00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:20.689
I wish he wouldn't drag me
into it.

00:12:20.772 --> 00:12:21.607
[RUDEUS sighs]

00:12:23.945 --> 00:12:25.322
[NANAHOSHI]
Man-God aside.

00:12:25.406 --> 00:12:26.951
Orsted took me
all over the world

00:12:27.034 --> 00:12:28.663
to gather data for my return,

00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:30.709
and to look for the two guys
in that note.

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.713
After about a year,
I enrolled here.

00:12:33.296 --> 00:12:35.259
The entire world in one year?

00:12:35.342 --> 00:12:38.098
[NANAHOSHI]
Yes, using a special method.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.937
[RUDEUS]
And that would be?

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:41.856
[NANAHOSHI]
Uh...

00:12:43.609 --> 00:12:46.322
Do you know
about teleportation circles?

00:12:46.406 --> 00:12:47.826
Only by name.

00:12:47.909 --> 00:12:51.166
Although, I thought I read
that they no longer existed.

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:53.170
[NANAHOSHI]
You can still find some intact,

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:55.592
in ruins
of the Human-Demon Wars.

00:12:55.675 --> 00:12:56.886
[RUDEUS]
Ruins?

00:12:56.969 --> 00:12:57.804
Where are they?

00:12:58.514 --> 00:12:59.348
[NANAHOSHI]
Sorry,

00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:00.602
I'm not allowed
to tell you that.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.480
[RUDEUS]
"Not allowed"?

00:13:03.356 --> 00:13:04.192
[NANAHOSHI]
No,

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:06.154
but since I just followed
Orsted around,

00:13:06.237 --> 00:13:07.657
it's not like I remember.

00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:08.701
Fair enough.

00:13:08.785 --> 00:13:11.039
So, did you ever stumble
on any leads?

00:13:14.505 --> 00:13:17.093
[NANAHOSHI]
No, but I did meet someone

00:13:17.176 --> 00:13:19.180
who told me
in no uncertain terms...

00:13:20.057 --> 00:13:22.394
that while it may not have been
Orsted...

00:13:23.564 --> 00:13:26.027
I must have been summoned
by someone.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.154
[gasps]

00:13:27.238 --> 00:13:28.365
How would they know that?

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:29.827
Who told you?

00:13:30.537 --> 00:13:31.789
[NANAHOSHI]
I can't say.

00:13:31.872 --> 00:13:34.126
They asked me not to tell anyone
I'd met them.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:36.089
[RUDEUS]
Oh.

00:13:39.513 --> 00:13:40.347
[NANAHOSHI]
Look,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.561
we're foreign objects
to this world.

00:13:42.644 --> 00:13:43.478
If we do anything

00:13:43.563 --> 00:13:45.274
to significantly alter
its history,

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:47.111
we could be erased
from existence.

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.365
So I only do what I have to,

00:13:49.448 --> 00:13:52.329
and I don't share information
unless it helps me personally.

00:13:52.914 --> 00:13:54.250
[RUDEUS]
What do you mean "erased"?

00:13:55.127 --> 00:13:56.672
[NANAHOSHI]
Haven't you read sci-fi?

00:13:56.755 --> 00:13:58.008
It happens all the time.

00:13:58.634 --> 00:13:59.636
[RUDEUS]
That's usually portrayed

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.974
as a side effect of time travel,
though.

00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:03.895
Whatever.

00:14:05.523 --> 00:14:07.736
[RUDEUS] So, you're researching
magic circles?

00:14:07.819 --> 00:14:08.654
[NANAHOSHI]
Yes.

00:14:08.738 --> 00:14:11.034
I taught myself using
the university's books.

00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:14.040
This people of this world
are kind of set in their ways.

00:14:14.123 --> 00:14:17.004
No one really believes
what I want to do is possible,

00:14:17.087 --> 00:14:19.175
so I can't expect them
to teach me much.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.473
And it doesn't help
that they all just assume

00:14:22.557 --> 00:14:23.809
I have mana.

00:14:23.893 --> 00:14:26.064
-[RUDEUS] Oh. You don't?
-[NANAHOSHI] Nope.

00:14:26.147 --> 00:14:27.984
I have zero mana to speak of.

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:30.823
I take it that means
you do have some, then?

00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:31.825
[RUDEUS]
Yes.

00:14:31.909 --> 00:14:33.161
[NANAHOSHI]
Because you were reincarnated,

00:14:33.244 --> 00:14:34.080
I guess.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:37.796
Everything native to this world
has some degree of mana in it.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.469
Even dead bodies.

00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:48.191
[NANAHOSHI]
Oh, and...

00:14:48.943 --> 00:14:51.030
This might not apply
to you either, but...

00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.746
I've been in this world
for five years now...

00:14:55.455 --> 00:14:56.959
and I don't seem to age.

00:14:57.752 --> 00:14:59.756
That sounds like
a bit of a silver lining.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.512
[NANAHOSHI scoffs]

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:03.430
I suppose it's better

00:15:03.514 --> 00:15:05.977
than growing old
in a strange land, at least.

00:15:08.064 --> 00:15:08.899
[sighs]

00:15:10.862 --> 00:15:12.406
Well, that's my story.

00:15:13.283 --> 00:15:14.160
So?

00:15:14.243 --> 00:15:15.747
Do you trust me
a little more now?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:17.792
[sighs]

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:18.794
I do.

00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:21.466
[NANAHOSHI]
Okay. Then let's make a deal.

00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:25.725
[NANAHOSHI]
I have no mana to speak of,

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:27.478
and no way to defend myself.

00:15:28.313 --> 00:15:31.069
I don't age,
but I'm probably not immortal.

00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:32.154
[RUDEUS]
Right.

00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:34.366
[NANAHOSHI] I honestly
can't stand this world.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.204
None of it feels real to me.

00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:37.624
The food is atrocious.

00:15:37.707 --> 00:15:40.212
Everything is morally dubious
and inconvenient.

00:15:41.172 --> 00:15:43.594
And I left people behind
in our old world.

00:15:47.017 --> 00:15:47.852
What about you?

00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:50.107
[RUDEUS]
Me?

00:15:53.446 --> 00:15:55.117
I actually like this world.

00:15:55.785 --> 00:15:57.121
I don't want to go back.

00:15:58.081 --> 00:15:58.916
[NANAHOSHI]
You didn't leave behind

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:00.168
a family or anything?

00:16:03.968 --> 00:16:05.888
I have no regrets. I'm home.

00:16:06.974 --> 00:16:07.809
[NANAHOSHI]
Huh...

00:16:09.019 --> 00:16:11.440
You must have had
a good, long life, then.

00:16:11.525 --> 00:16:15.783
[footsteps]

00:16:15.867 --> 00:16:16.785
[thuds]

00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:19.290
[thuds]

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.337
[NANAHOSHI] Well,
we clearly have different goals,

00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:24.133
there's no denying that,

00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:26.262
but we both have something
to offer each other.

00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:28.684
So, let's negotiate.

00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:31.189
What do I have to offer you?

00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:32.984
[NANAHOSHI]
I just told you.

00:16:33.527 --> 00:16:34.571
Huh?

00:16:34.654 --> 00:16:36.240
-[NANAHOSHI] Mana.
-[gasps]

00:16:36.324 --> 00:16:38.077
You help me with my experiments,

00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:39.873
and I'll teach you
what you want to know,

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:41.835
or find someone who can.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.505
So, you're basically
just looking

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:45.258
for a give-and-take
relationship.

00:16:45.342 --> 00:16:46.177
[NANAHOSHI]
Yes.

00:16:47.972 --> 00:16:48.807
[sighs]

00:16:57.867 --> 00:16:58.786
[RUDEUS]
I understand.

00:17:00.413 --> 00:17:01.332
Let's do it.

00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:02.794
I'm happy to accept.

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:04.380
[NANAHOSHI]
Ah, glad to hear it.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.008
But just so we're clear,

00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:08.889
no backing out or changing
your mind later, okay?

00:17:08.973 --> 00:17:10.601
A man's word is his bond.

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:11.520
[NANAHOSHI]
Uh?

00:17:12.772 --> 00:17:14.108
[sighs] It's kind of nice

00:17:14.191 --> 00:17:15.861
to hear a saying
from home like that.

00:17:15.945 --> 00:17:16.780
[sighs]

00:17:17.322 --> 00:17:18.366
[NANAHOSHI clears throat]

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:20.120
[NANAHOSHI]
Shall we get right to it?

00:17:20.203 --> 00:17:21.122
What do you want to know?

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.671
I hear that you're investigating
the Displacement Incident.

00:17:24.754 --> 00:17:26.591
I am, but who told you that?

00:17:26.675 --> 00:17:27.510
[NANAHOSHI, RUDEUS]
Hm?

00:17:29.263 --> 00:17:31.727
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:33.522
Hm.

00:17:34.064 --> 00:17:37.446
[SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.452
Nanahoshi, will you continue
in the local language?

00:17:40.536 --> 00:17:41.370
[NANAHOSHI]
All right.

00:17:43.626 --> 00:17:45.546
[NANAHOSHI] I don't know
the specifics, of course.

00:17:46.088 --> 00:17:47.717
But the Incident
closely coincided

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.763
with the moment
I arrived in this world.

00:17:51.307 --> 00:17:52.184
Meaning what?

00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:54.856
Huh?

00:17:55.775 --> 00:17:57.862
[NANAHOSHI] It was probably
a side effect or backlash

00:17:57.945 --> 00:17:59.365
of whatever brought me here.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.414
[NANAHOSHI]
So...

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:06.880
Honestly,
I might have caused it.

00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:11.263
[gasps]

00:18:11.347 --> 00:18:12.767
[RUDEUS]
Part of me saw that coming.

00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:14.813
The pieces fit together
too neatly

00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:16.107
for it to be chance.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.113
I'm mostly just relieved
it wasn't my fault.

00:18:23.162 --> 00:18:24.833
[inhales] So it was you!

00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:25.751
[NANAHOSHI grunts]

00:18:26.545 --> 00:18:28.089
[SYLPHIETTE gasps and strains]

00:18:29.091 --> 00:18:30.176
[gasps]

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:34.561
[shouts]

00:18:34.644 --> 00:18:35.521
[straining]

00:18:35.604 --> 00:18:39.153
Do you have any idea
how much we suffered?

00:18:39.236 --> 00:18:41.950
My mom and dad died
because of you!

00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:43.954
[NANAHOSHI]
Hey! Quit staring and help me!

00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:45.791
-[SYLPHIETTE panting]
-Master Fitz!

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.797
-How many people died?
-It's okay! Calm down!

00:18:48.881 --> 00:18:50.049
No! Why?

00:18:50.133 --> 00:18:52.220
She just admitted
it was her fault!

00:18:53.682 --> 00:18:55.185
Why would you hold me back?

00:18:55.268 --> 00:18:56.312
You suffered, too!

00:18:56.395 --> 00:18:58.483
I know you suffered
just like the rest of us!

00:18:58.567 --> 00:18:59.861
I know, I'm sorry.

00:18:59.944 --> 00:19:01.698
We didn't explain this
clearly enough.

00:19:01.782 --> 00:19:03.827
She didn't choose to come here!

00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:05.079
She's a victim, too!

00:19:05.623 --> 00:19:06.457
Ah...

00:19:07.627 --> 00:19:08.545
Is that true?

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.175
[whimpers]

00:19:11.676 --> 00:19:13.429
I misunderstood.

00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:15.433
[NANAHOSHI]
I'm sorry.

00:19:15.518 --> 00:19:16.895
I could have phrased that
better.

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:18.356
Forgive me.

00:19:20.569 --> 00:19:21.403
No.

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:24.953
I apologize
for jumping to conclusions.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.879
[NANAHOSHI]
Anyway,

00:19:29.963 --> 00:19:32.593
I don't know much more
about the incident itself.

00:19:32.677 --> 00:19:34.096
Not who
would have brought me here,

00:19:34.179 --> 00:19:35.558
or what they hoped to gain,

00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:37.562
or why it led
to such a disaster.

00:19:39.314 --> 00:19:40.859
[RUDEUS] What did Orsted have
to say about it?

00:19:41.903 --> 00:19:43.782
[NANAHOSHI]
That it'd never happened before.

00:19:43.866 --> 00:19:44.701
That's all.

00:19:44.784 --> 00:19:46.120
[RUDEUS]
Okay.

00:19:46.203 --> 00:19:49.293
I feel like the Man-God told me,
it was Orsted's fault, though.

00:19:50.044 --> 00:19:52.633
[RUDEUS] Then, why did you say
that you caused it?

00:19:53.677 --> 00:19:55.221
[NANAHOSHI]
Well, I did, in a sense.

00:19:55.723 --> 00:19:58.645
And I wanted to get that fact
out in the open right away.

00:19:58.729 --> 00:20:01.317
Don't need anyone using it
against me down the road.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.235
Mm...

00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:04.489
I understand.

00:20:04.574 --> 00:20:05.576
[NANAHOSHI]
Anyway, I have a plan

00:20:05.659 --> 00:20:07.747
to move forward
with my research from here,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:08.999
and if my work succeeds,

00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:11.253
I should be able to explain
the mass teleportation

00:20:11.337 --> 00:20:12.965
logically, at least.

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:15.345
But to even get that far,
I'll need a lot of mana.

00:20:15.888 --> 00:20:16.848
[RUDEUS]
I see.

00:20:16.931 --> 00:20:18.769
So I must be a godsend, then.

00:20:19.854 --> 00:20:20.981
[NANAHOSHI]
"A godsend"?

00:20:21.566 --> 00:20:23.570
[chuckles] You may be right.

00:20:25.156 --> 00:20:27.160
That's about enough for today.

00:20:27.745 --> 00:20:29.791
I need
to think some things over.

00:20:29.874 --> 00:20:31.628
Can I come back in a few days?

00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:32.922
[NANAHOSHI]
Okay.

00:20:33.005 --> 00:20:35.009
I'm tired from talking so much,
anyway.

00:20:35.678 --> 00:20:36.888
[sighs]

00:20:36.971 --> 00:20:37.974
I'll see you around.

00:20:57.429 --> 00:21:02.439
[footsteps]

00:21:13.294 --> 00:21:14.171
[SYLPHIETTE]
Rudeus.

00:21:14.964 --> 00:21:16.926
What do you think about her,
really?

00:21:17.887 --> 00:21:18.722
Hm?

00:21:20.768 --> 00:21:21.853
To be honest,

00:21:21.936 --> 00:21:24.107
some things about her
rub me the wrong way.

00:21:25.234 --> 00:21:27.322
But for the time being,
I trust her.

00:21:28.407 --> 00:21:29.284
Is that so?

00:21:30.537 --> 00:21:31.371
Well...

00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:36.090
All right.

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:37.551
I trust you.

00:21:38.553 --> 00:21:40.933
[footsteps]

00:21:45.901 --> 00:21:47.487
[RUDEUS] You were worried
about me, weren't you?

00:21:48.322 --> 00:21:49.157
Thank you.

00:21:49.867 --> 00:21:52.915
[SYLPHIETTE]
Oh, no, I wasn't exactly.

00:21:54.334 --> 00:21:56.380
Well... yes.

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.134
You're welcome.

00:22:05.189 --> 00:22:06.024
[sighs]
