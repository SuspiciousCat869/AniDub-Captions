00:18:48.714 --> 00:18:50.718
one-handed, and panicking.

00:18:51.343 --> 00:18:52.220
But here?

00:18:52.304 --> 00:18:54.684
I can channel everything
I have into this shot.

00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:57.397
Creating the bullet
is fundamentally no different

00:18:57.481 --> 00:18:58.984
than crafting a figure.

00:18:59.067 --> 00:19:01.489
I'll focus on hardness
and aerodynamics,

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:02.992
then rotate it.

00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.581
The faster I can make it spin,
the better penetration

00:19:05.664 --> 00:19:06.958
it will have on contact.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.089
But velocity
is the most critical aspect.

00:19:10.173 --> 00:19:12.720
I've never used
this much mana for speed before.

00:19:20.819 --> 00:19:22.823
All right. Get ready.

00:19:22.907 --> 00:19:25.078
Excellent. Go on!

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:31.550
[explosion]

00:19:33.094 --> 00:19:34.764
[body thuds]

00:19:39.732 --> 00:19:44.157
[RUDEUS]
No way. Is he dead?

00:19:51.213 --> 00:19:55.346
[clamoring]

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:57.058
[laughs]

00:19:57.142 --> 00:19:59.187
[BADIGADI]
Badigadi has revived!

00:19:59.271 --> 00:20:00.440
[RUDEUS]
Oh, you're alive.

00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:03.446
[laughs]
Yes, I thought I was a goner!

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.410
[tapping]

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:13.049
You vanquished me
in single combat, Rudeus,

00:20:13.132 --> 00:20:15.094
so you may call yourself a hero!

00:20:15.178 --> 00:20:17.098
[RUDEUS] I don't think
I will, but thanks.

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:19.562
Then, at least let out
a victory cheer for the crowd!

00:20:19.646 --> 00:20:22.025
[laughter]

00:20:22.902 --> 00:20:26.785
[RUDEUS] Okay. If he says I won,
I guess I won.

00:20:26.868 --> 00:20:29.791
Um, I'm the winner!

00:20:29.874 --> 00:20:30.709
Well done.

00:20:30.793 --> 00:20:32.838
Now it's my turn
to take a whack!

00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:36.136
Huh!

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.349
[punches]

00:20:38.432 --> 00:20:39.811
Um!

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.904
[SYLPHIETTE]
There. Is the pain gone, too?

00:20:44.987 --> 00:20:46.616
Yeah, it is, thank you.

00:20:47.702 --> 00:20:48.662
[SYLPHIETTE]
Well.

00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:50.791
Healing aside,
after the day you just had,

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.837
I would advise
taking it easy tonight.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.968
I really can't thank you enough
for all your help, Master Fitz.

00:20:57.303 --> 00:20:59.099
[door opens]

00:21:03.859 --> 00:21:05.403
[RUDEUS]
He's probably right.

00:21:05.486 --> 00:21:09.202
Between duels and Demon Kings,
I've had one hell of a day.

00:21:09.286 --> 00:21:12.668
But hey, at least I'll probably
never see Badigadi again.

00:21:23.732 --> 00:21:25.652
[LINIA]
I mew you could do it, boss.

00:21:25.736 --> 00:21:26.946
A whole mating season

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.784
and we didn't even have
to lift a finger!

00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:30.871
But I never expected
a Demon King

00:21:30.954 --> 00:21:32.750
would show up to challenge
you for our hand!

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.798
I suppose our charms really must
reach all corners of the world.

00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:38.762
As thanks, I invite you to touch
Linia's boobs.

00:21:38.845 --> 00:21:40.473
Thank you, that's very generous.

00:21:40.557 --> 00:21:42.603
Meow!

00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:44.816
[gasps]

00:21:44.899 --> 00:21:46.443
[explosion]

00:21:48.698 --> 00:21:53.207
[BADIGADI laughs]

00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:59.010
The immortal Demon King Badigadi
has returned!

00:21:59.929 --> 00:22:04.229
[BADIGADI laughs]

00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:08.028
[RUDEUS]
Goddammit.

00:22:08.112 --> 00:22:11.034
[BADIGADI laughs]
