WEBVTT

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:07.599
[RUDEUS] I was so preoccupied
with my little buddy's

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:10.437
brief recovery yesterday
that I was hardly able to sleep

00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:12.984
Fitz was all I
could think about,

00:00:13.068 --> 00:00:16.157
and yet, not so much as
a twitch from downstairs.

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.623
What a traitor.

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:22.044
At least I know all
hope isn't lost, I guess.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:29.851
Good morning, Master Luke.

00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:30.937
How are you?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.066
A bit surprised to
see you up so early.

00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:36.155
Do we need to have
a talk about Fitz?

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.328
I can't think of any
reason we would.

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:40.497
Really?

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.084
Not a single one?

00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:45.883
[RUDEUS] Fair. I can see
why he wouldn't trust me.

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.687
I may be repeating
myself, Luke.

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:53.231
I don't know.

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:56.613
But listen, I have no intention
of opposing any of you.

00:00:57.615 --> 00:00:59.911
I don't know anything
about Master Fitz,

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:02.584
or any secrets
he might be hiding.

00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:05.798
You're truly that willing
to feign ignorance for us?

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.092
How come?

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:09.347
I've cut all ties
with our family,

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:11.810
so I have no loyalty
to them over you.

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:15.902
Moreover, I'm kind of afraid to
get on the Princess's bad side.

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.657
And I would prefer
to leave it at that.

00:01:26.297 --> 00:01:28.886
[RUDEUS] The last thing I want
is to make trouble for Fitz.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.727
But this isn't going
to be easy for me.

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:10.715
[SYLPHIETTE]
Um.

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:13.596
[clears throat]

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:17.520
Your Highness? You asked
for me to meet you, so...

00:03:18.354 --> 00:03:20.860
I've been made aware
that Rudeus approached us

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:23.072
while we were out
shopping the other day.

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:25.578
He was suspicious
of your behavior.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.080
Hm...

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.422
And later,

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:33.636
he threw you to the floor
of the library,

00:03:33.802 --> 00:03:36.683
and then you fled the scene,
shouting that you're 'a man.'

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:39.438
or something like that,
according to the rumors.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.739
It's concerning, because
if he touched you,

00:03:44.448 --> 00:03:46.452
I have no doubt
he knows that's a lie.

00:03:47.955 --> 00:03:49.793
This morning,
Rudeus claimed that

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.462
he was willing
to keep your secret

00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:53.132
so as to not antagonize me.

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.261
However, I believe
that he simply

00:03:55.345 --> 00:03:57.517
means to do right
by a close friend.

00:03:58.184 --> 00:04:00.146
I admire his devotion.

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:02.610
Now.

00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:06.242
What do you intend
to do about this?

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.456
I completely understand that
you want to take your time,

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.753
no need to rush
something so important.

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.258
However, after six months

00:04:14.341 --> 00:04:16.262
without any
progress to speak of,

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:18.391
Even I've grown impatient.

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:20.521
I have to say something.

00:04:20.604 --> 00:04:21.606
W-wha...

00:04:22.734 --> 00:04:24.571
And soon it will be your turn.

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:26.658
I've grown tired of
watching you dither about

00:04:26.742 --> 00:04:28.620
something so obviously
important to you.

00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:31.543
[ARIEL] So kindly
work up the courage

00:04:31.626 --> 00:04:33.129
to reveal yourself to the boy.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.760
And that's a direct
order, Sylphie.

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:40.393
Princess, I...

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:47.617
What do you want
most right now?

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.077
Really think about it.

00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:50.998
Mm mm...

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.004
To be frank,

00:04:54.338 --> 00:04:56.760
you've spent far too
much time fretting over me.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.972
Your debts have
long been repaid.

00:04:59.056 --> 00:05:00.518
It's time to think about
yourself.

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:01.561
No, I can't.

00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:04.316
I want to stay by your side
because I care about you.

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:05.736
I know.

00:05:05.903 --> 00:05:08.491
And holding back
for my sake is your style.

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:11.706
But listen,

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.919
You're not my servant
anymore. You're my friend.

00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:17.342
So if you want something,
I want you to put that first.

00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:19.263
Stop prioritizing me,

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:21.141
I'll be just fine without you.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.816
But that...would
be such a betrayal.

00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:29.868
No, it most certainly
would not, silly!

00:05:30.744 --> 00:05:32.164
Now, be brave.

00:05:32.247 --> 00:05:33.792
Tell me what you want.

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:37.675
Then I guess...

00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:42.142
I think...

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.025
â™ª

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.830
What I want...is
to be with Rudy.

00:05:54.626 --> 00:05:56.337
Well done, Sylphie.

00:05:58.884 --> 00:05:59.969
[SYLPHIETTE]
But...

00:06:00.053 --> 00:06:01.514
if Rudy doesn't remember me

00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:03.100
I don't think
I'll ever recover.

00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:05.522
So what am I
supposed to say to him?

00:06:06.858 --> 00:06:08.194
Don't worry.

00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.281
We'll figure it out together.

00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:17.045
[ARIEL] Perhaps it would
be best to keep things simple.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.509
Why not just tell him
you're the Sylphiette

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:21.345
who grew up with him
in Buena Village?

00:06:22.013 --> 00:06:23.391
That may not work out.

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:25.228
If he truly doesn't
remember her,

00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:27.440
the name may not
ring any bells, either.

00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:29.319
Hm...

00:06:30.405 --> 00:06:32.743
Do any memories of your time
together stand out?

00:06:33.662 --> 00:06:35.081
Oh, let me think...

00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:37.712
Well, um, I believe
I've told you about

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:39.423
how I used to get
bullied, haven't I?

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:40.509
Yes.
[ARIEL laughs]

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:42.012
You mentioned
that you were bullied

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.347
for your gorgeous hair color.

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.143
I first met Rudy
when he stepped in

00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:46.855
to save me from
getting picked on.

00:06:47.188 --> 00:06:49.401
I'd say that has to be
my favorite memory of him.

00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:51.280
[both chuckling]

00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:56.165
Has anything else
sprung to mind yet?

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:58.377
Not really. Sorry.

00:06:58.754 --> 00:06:59.756
Oh, wait!

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.175
There is one thing...

00:07:01.258 --> 00:07:02.260
When we met,

00:07:02.343 --> 00:07:03.930
Rudy actually
thought I was a boy

00:07:04.014 --> 00:07:05.976
for a few weeks
or a month, at least.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.395
But we got caught
in a rainstorm

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.107
while we were out
practicing magic,

00:07:09.274 --> 00:07:12.155
and so we had to take a bath
together back at his house.

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.535
He kinda undressed me.

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:16.998
And then he pulled
my panties down himself,

00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:19.127
so uh, he saw my private parts

00:07:19.336 --> 00:07:23.845
and that's when he realized
that I'm, um, actually a girl.

00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:28.312
[ARIEL] I see!
That's...quite the story.

00:07:31.318 --> 00:07:32.863
Thank you for sharing.

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:38.457
I've finalized
the details of our plan.

00:07:41.756 --> 00:07:43.217
But before we start,

00:07:43.384 --> 00:07:45.597
do allow me to confirm
one thing with you.

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:47.601
Oh, of course.

00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:49.772
[ARIEL] Sylphie,
you said the other day

00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:51.734
that you want to
'be with Rudeus'

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:54.866
but I want to know what that
means to you, specifically.

00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.955
What sort of relationship?

00:07:59.457 --> 00:08:00.459
Hm...

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:06.598
[SYLPHIETTE]
We would share a bed.

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:08.434
And he can be crude sometimes,

00:08:08.518 --> 00:08:11.566
so he might say something like,
'I want to put a baby in you.'

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:13.778
Oh! But then
I'll be crude, too.

00:08:13.862 --> 00:08:16.033
So I could say something like,

00:08:16.366 --> 00:08:19.206
'Oh, Rudy! I'll take as many
as you want to give me!'

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:20.792
and then we'll go to our room.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.214
Then he'll chuckle,
and he'll say,

00:08:23.297 --> 00:08:24.299
"I want a lot".

00:08:24.382 --> 00:08:26.596
And we'll kiss and start
undressing each other.

00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:30.102
Then I'll laugh, too,
and say something like,

00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:32.733
'Well, we better
get started, then!'

00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:34.904
You know? Something like that!

00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:36.532
[clears throat]

00:08:37.868 --> 00:08:38.954
Sylphie,

00:08:39.037 --> 00:08:42.043
your success here depends
entirely on your efforts.

00:08:42.335 --> 00:08:43.588
Oh, right.

00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:45.968
Failures of nerve
will not be tolerated.

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.224
If you come back
and tell me that you once again

00:08:49.307 --> 00:08:51.896
couldn't find the courage
to speak up when it counted,

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.154
by my authority
as a princess of Asura,

00:08:56.531 --> 00:08:59.704
I shall forbid you any further
contact with Rudeus Greyrat

00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:01.456
for as long as you both live.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.210
So give this your all.

00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:04.964
Are we clear?

00:09:07.928 --> 00:09:09.055
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:10.517
Wonderful.

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:11.936
Now then,

00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:15.694
[ARIEL]
let's discuss the plan. Hmm.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.322
Mm.

00:09:38.113 --> 00:09:40.619
-Rudeus.
-Oh, Master Fitz!

00:09:40.702 --> 00:09:42.121
What can I do for you?

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:44.042
Oh, well...

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.294
Um...

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:47.508
Can we talk somewhere else?

00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:49.302
It's a bit sensitive.

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:50.806
Yeah, of course.

00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:54.312
So, Zanoba, just go ahead
with what we discussed.

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:56.108
Yes, sir! I have your notes,

00:09:56.191 --> 00:09:58.320
and you can count
on me to fill in the rest!

00:10:00.909 --> 00:10:03.080
Okay, so what's going on?

00:10:03.163 --> 00:10:04.165
Uh...

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:07.255
I actually have a pretty
big favor to ask of you.

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:08.967
Well, rest assured!

00:10:09.092 --> 00:10:11.639
I'll be there with all
the force of a red dragon.

00:10:11.722 --> 00:10:12.891
Hold on a second.

00:10:12.975 --> 00:10:15.020
I haven't told you
what it is yet.

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:17.066
Master Fitz, if it was for you,

00:10:17.275 --> 00:10:19.697
I would even shoot down
a flying fortress.

00:10:22.118 --> 00:10:23.078
Well, all right.

00:10:23.162 --> 00:10:24.372
So the thing is,

00:10:24.456 --> 00:10:26.376
Princess Ariel is frustrated

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.299
because another noble keeps
bragging about her bodyguard,

00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:30.719
and at my expense.

00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:32.639
Oh. Okay.

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:34.602
The noble tells her,

00:10:34.685 --> 00:10:37.106
'And my 'Fitz' has
braved the Forest of Hail.

00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:39.152
He was only
in a party of four,

00:10:39.235 --> 00:10:41.532
they brought back this
flower that only grows there,

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:43.035
things of that nature.

00:10:43.118 --> 00:10:46.124
A flower that only grows
in the Forest of Hail?

00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:48.838
I guess that would be
the Freeze Fringe.

00:10:48.922 --> 00:10:50.216
That blooms in winter.

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:52.178
Yes. Well, after that,

00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:54.975
Princess Ariel had gone
way too far to back down,

00:10:55.184 --> 00:10:56.394
and she might have said,

00:10:56.478 --> 00:10:57.606
"Silent Fitz could do that

00:10:57.689 --> 00:10:59.985
with an even smaller
group, no problem."

00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:01.948
Now I get it.

00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:03.743
Well, I'll tell you what...

00:11:03.826 --> 00:11:05.539
Let me ask around
about the flower.

00:11:05.622 --> 00:11:07.751
I bet I could find you
a deal on one.

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:09.713
What? Rudeus, no, no, no

00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:11.132
that would just be cheating!

00:11:11.258 --> 00:11:13.721
I'm supposed to go out
and show what I'm capable of!

00:11:14.097 --> 00:11:16.519
Sure, but there's more
than one kind of power.

00:11:16.811 --> 00:11:19.148
Having connections at
your disposal is one of them.

00:11:19.232 --> 00:11:20.694
Sorry, I can't do that.

00:11:20.777 --> 00:11:22.614
Princess Ariel
would be humiliated

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:23.908
if word were to get out.

00:11:23.992 --> 00:11:25.411
I see, okay.

00:11:25.494 --> 00:11:27.498
Oh, wait!
Stepped Leader is in town,

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:28.710
I could get a hold of them.

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:30.379
[SYLPHIETTE]
No! Rudeus!

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:32.383
It's fine. Don't worry.

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:34.763
We can set it up so they just
"coincidentally" enter

00:11:34.847 --> 00:11:36.601
the forest
at the same time we do.

00:11:36.684 --> 00:11:38.855
But couldn't you and I
pull this off?

00:11:38.938 --> 00:11:41.652
If you ask me, I think we'd be
just fine without them.

00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:43.781
I guess that's true.

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:47.079
In which case, I would be more
than happy to accept the job.

00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:48.373
[sighs]

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.252
Thank you so much, Rudeus!

00:11:50.336 --> 00:11:53.300
I was so nervous about going
into the forest by myself.

00:12:00.105 --> 00:12:01.734
[SYLPHIETTE]
I'm sorry that I basically

00:12:01.817 --> 00:12:03.153
left all the prep work to you.

00:12:03.696 --> 00:12:05.282
No, that's okay.

00:12:05.366 --> 00:12:06.493
And it's only natural

00:12:06.577 --> 00:12:08.539
if I'm the one playing
bodyguard today.

00:12:18.183 --> 00:12:19.520
Well, wait.

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:23.235
Should I be paying you
for your services, then?

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:24.571
Of course not.

00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:26.116
I'm doing this
because we're friends.

00:12:26.199 --> 00:12:27.493
I don't want
anything from you.

00:12:27.577 --> 00:12:28.830
I'm just glad to help.

00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:31.836
Right, but, you don't have
to be here at all,

00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:34.048
so the least I could do is
pay you for your time,

00:12:34.132 --> 00:12:35.802
-don't you think?
-Well...

00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:37.681
I don't exactly come cheap.

00:12:38.014 --> 00:12:39.977
I-I'm sure you don't,

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.772
but still...

00:12:45.404 --> 00:12:47.450
[SYLPHIETTE]
Buying Rudy with money?

00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:53.420
[gasps]
Sorry.

00:12:53.546 --> 00:12:55.382
Uh, let's keep moving!

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.402
[RUDEUS]
This flower blooms on a cliff.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.949
I can melt us a path
pretty much straight to it,

00:13:08.033 --> 00:13:09.953
but it's going to take
some paying attention.

00:13:10.204 --> 00:13:12.500
Would you keep an eye out
for threats while I do that?

00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:26.402
[SYLPHIETTE] I kept thinking
about that staff

00:13:26.486 --> 00:13:28.406
after I fetched it for you
the other day.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.701
It's really something.

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:32.791
I mean, all made-to-order,
with a colored magic crystal.

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.672
I've never seen anything
like it outside of the palace.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.091
Yeah,

00:13:37.174 --> 00:13:39.220
a young noblewoman
I tutored for a while

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:41.141
gave it to me
for my 10th birthday.

00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:44.648
Do you think...I could
try holding it for a bit?

00:13:45.608 --> 00:13:48.280
You've seen my beginner's
wand, but that's all I have.

00:13:48.614 --> 00:13:50.827
I've always wanted
to try out a staff.

00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:53.373
Well, here.
Go on, take it.

00:13:58.216 --> 00:13:59.218
Got a good grip?

00:13:59.302 --> 00:14:00.470
Pretty hefty, right?

00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:02.391
Yeah.
It's so thick.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:05.439
Was this staff designed to be
held with two hands?

00:14:07.611 --> 00:14:08.571
I don't know.

00:14:08.654 --> 00:14:09.740
I thought it must have
been sized

00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:11.367
for me to use when I grew up.

00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:13.204
Huh?

00:14:13.998 --> 00:14:14.958
[SYLPHIETTE]
Okay.

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:17.087
All according to plan so far.

00:14:17.212 --> 00:14:18.591
So, next...

00:14:20.595 --> 00:14:24.603
â™ª

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:27.734
Red tower.

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:30.113
[SYLPHIETTE]
I hope this works.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.742
[rumbling]

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.467
Perfect! Here we go!

00:14:41.887 --> 00:14:43.098
A storm?

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:44.935
Look at those clouds.

00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:46.437
We might be in for rain.

00:14:46.689 --> 00:14:48.651
You're right.
We should look for shelter.

00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:49.736
It's fine.

00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:51.824
I'll have the sky clear
in no time.

00:14:52.241 --> 00:14:53.451
[SYLPHIETTE]
Oh, no!

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:55.372
Just like Rudy taught me.

00:14:55.455 --> 00:14:57.627
I'll gather moisture
into the clouds,

00:14:58.003 --> 00:15:00.257
cool it, and let it fall!

00:15:05.058 --> 00:15:06.060
Hm?

00:15:10.152 --> 00:15:12.239
-Wow. I'm sorry, Master Fitz.
-[panting]

00:15:12.532 --> 00:15:14.911
I must be having
an off day for some reason.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.667
Oh. Don't apologize.

00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:20.297
It's probably just because
I'm still holding your staff,

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:21.382
right?

00:15:21.717 --> 00:15:23.303
[SYLPHIETTE]
I knew taking his staff away

00:15:23.386 --> 00:15:24.765
wouldn't stop him using magic,

00:15:25.265 --> 00:15:27.436
but I didn't expect
I'd need to use it!

00:15:28.313 --> 00:15:31.110
Well, not much we can do
now that it's coming down.

00:15:31.528 --> 00:15:34.408
But look, there's a cave
not too far up ahead.

00:15:34.743 --> 00:15:36.622
Might as well post up there
for a while.

00:15:37.456 --> 00:15:38.918
Uh, good idea.

00:15:39.669 --> 00:15:40.963
[rain pattering]

00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:50.482
This look okay to you?

00:16:13.319 --> 00:16:14.781
[RUDEUS]
There's been something fishy

00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:16.450
about this whole
venture from the start.

00:16:17.452 --> 00:16:20.125
Master Fitz has been acting
weird ever since she hired me.

00:16:20.835 --> 00:16:23.131
And now this sudden,
unseasonable downpour?

00:16:24.133 --> 00:16:26.387
Someone may have
created that storm with magic.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.853
I wonder if Fitz
has picked up on that.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.153
She looks a little tense, which
suggests to me that she has.

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:36.783
But she's still oddly calm.

00:16:37.326 --> 00:16:38.787
Maybe she expected interference

00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:40.666
from that other
noble's bodyguard.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.461
[fire crackling]

00:16:46.678 --> 00:16:47.722
[RUDEUS]
Okay...

00:16:47.805 --> 00:16:49.559
That should do it
for my clothes.

00:16:49.893 --> 00:16:51.897
But what about my underwear?

00:16:52.397 --> 00:16:53.609
I'm not really comfortable

00:16:53.692 --> 00:16:55.320
taking them off
in front of Fitz.

00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:06.050
I can dry...

00:17:15.987 --> 00:17:17.615
-Hey, Master Fitz?
-Y-yes?

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:18.951
W-what's the matter?

00:17:19.577 --> 00:17:23.084
Um, a girl I know told me
that showing bare skin

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:26.132
to members of a different
race is taboo among elves.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.344
So, to that point,

00:17:28.804 --> 00:17:29.806
Uh?

00:17:30.348 --> 00:17:32.687
I'm going to turn around
and keep my eyes closed.

00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:34.983
You just change
and get dried off,

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:36.987
and let me know
whenever you're done.

00:17:55.065 --> 00:17:56.400
[RUDEUS]
Master Fitz?!

00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:03.081
Please, at least
take that coat off.

00:18:03.164 --> 00:18:05.503
You're going to make yourself
sick. You know that, right?

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.632
Do you want me to make you
a little stall or something?

00:18:07.715 --> 00:18:09.886
Or maybe I could just leave the
cave entirely, how about that?

00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:11.723
That should work.
I'll go right now.

00:18:11.807 --> 00:18:12.809
Wait.

00:18:21.993 --> 00:18:23.162
Come on.

00:18:23.413 --> 00:18:24.707
You'll get sick.

00:18:27.254 --> 00:18:28.339
Yeah,

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:29.718
you're right.

00:18:31.345 --> 00:18:32.598
So let go.

00:18:33.015 --> 00:18:35.103
You can't stay
in those clothes.

00:18:35.896 --> 00:18:37.274
It could kill you.

00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:39.486
You're losing too much heat.

00:18:41.073 --> 00:18:43.244
Yeah. I could die here

00:18:44.121 --> 00:18:45.666
Unless you help me.

00:18:47.962 --> 00:18:49.883
I can't seem
to get my clothes off.

00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:53.181
[SYLPHIETTE]
Undress me.

00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:06.583
If you can't
manage it yourself,

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:09.046
then I suppose I'll have to.

00:19:15.475 --> 00:19:16.811
Y-you know,

00:19:17.814 --> 00:19:21.530
I am already aware of the fact
that you're actually a woman.

00:19:22.823 --> 00:19:23.951
Yes.

00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:26.706
But, I could still die here,

00:19:27.457 --> 00:19:29.629
unless you hurry
and take my clothes off.

00:19:51.255 --> 00:19:53.426
[RUDEUS] Where have I seen
those blushing ears before?

00:19:54.219 --> 00:19:55.723
It's so familiar.

00:20:01.943 --> 00:20:03.195
Something like this
happened to me

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:05.408
a long time ago, didn't it?

00:20:05.868 --> 00:20:06.995
When I was...

00:20:07.454 --> 00:20:08.957
five or six, maybe.

00:20:34.842 --> 00:20:35.803
Rudy,

00:20:35.886 --> 00:20:37.430
you're not quite done yet.

00:20:54.882 --> 00:20:57.262
Master Fitz,
I have a question.

00:20:58.389 --> 00:20:59.391
What is it?

00:20:59.474 --> 00:21:00.561
Ask away.

00:21:02.188 --> 00:21:03.315
Is your name,

00:21:04.067 --> 00:21:06.155
I mean, is your real name...

00:21:06.573 --> 00:21:08.744
Sylphiette, by any chance?

00:21:10.622 --> 00:21:11.916
Yes, it is.

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:14.797
â™ª

00:21:16.175 --> 00:21:17.177
[sobbing]

00:21:21.018 --> 00:21:22.020
That's right.

00:21:22.103 --> 00:21:24.357
It's me.
It's Sylphiette.

00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:26.320
From Buena Village.

00:21:28.575 --> 00:21:29.786
I said it,

00:21:30.203 --> 00:21:31.205
finally.

00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.923
[RUDEUS] Looks like
she's still a crybaby.

00:21:36.591 --> 00:21:38.135
The more things change.

00:21:39.597 --> 00:21:40.724
I waited,

00:21:41.183 --> 00:21:43.605
I've waited so, so long.

00:21:44.481 --> 00:21:46.528
And I worked really hard.

00:21:46.611 --> 00:21:48.405
The whole time I was in Buena.

00:21:48.489 --> 00:21:49.951
Yeah. I know.

00:21:55.879 --> 00:21:57.340
I love you, Rudy.

00:21:57.716 --> 00:21:59.554
I've always loved you.

00:22:00.722 --> 00:22:02.308
I loved you back then.

00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:05.189
And now I love you even more.

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:07.485
Please never leave me again.

00:22:09.072 --> 00:22:11.159
[SYLPHIETTE] I want
to stay with you forever.
