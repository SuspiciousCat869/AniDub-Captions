Now, regarding Princess Ariel,

00:14:47.649 --> 00:14:49.193
my sources have informed me

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.030
that she has placed
sympathetic agents

00:14:51.197 --> 00:14:52.826
among the knights and guards.

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.663
[GRABEL]
Is she plotting a coup d'état?

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.044
[DARIUS] Hardly. I doubt
she would ever dare be so rash.

00:14:58.211 --> 00:15:00.758
I suspect
she is merely rallying support.

00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:02.846
But why court groups
like the knights and guards

00:15:03.013 --> 00:15:04.306
who lack political influence?

00:15:04.473 --> 00:15:06.019
She doubtless
finds their support

00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:07.731
simple to cultivate.

00:15:07.897 --> 00:15:09.568
Many of them
are from common stock,

00:15:09.735 --> 00:15:12.072
and commoners are easy to woo.

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:13.951
If you ask me,

00:15:14.118 --> 00:15:16.790
this will prove before long
to be the first step of many.

[laughing]

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.506
For if she has
no personal troops,

00:15:20.673 --> 00:15:22.259
she need only numbers.

00:15:22.426 --> 00:15:23.888

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:26.184
You think she means to amass
an unofficial army

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.520

00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:29.983
So if there were trouble
in the capital,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.071
it would fall
to the pawns to act.

00:15:32.237 --> 00:15:34.868

in Ariel's pocket at the time...

a fairly well-known assassin
in this region.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.113
She has evidently claimed
the lives of many nobles

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:46.700
in her storied career.

00:20:47.242 --> 00:20:48.369
How are you feeling?

00:20:48.537 --> 00:20:49.539
Better?

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:51.083
Yes, I'm fine now.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.920
It was only a little poison.

00:20:55.258 --> 00:20:56.720
We're fortunate
that you're unharmed,

00:20:56.886 --> 00:20:58.347
but this incident leaves
no doubt

00:20:58.515 --> 00:21:00.268
that we have enemies
in the palace.

00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:03.567
And we don't know when or how
they may strike again.

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:06.280
I would like to propose
that you go abroad for a time,

00:21:06.447 --> 00:21:08.535
using your studies as a pretext.

00:21:08.702 --> 00:21:10.204
You wish me to flee?

00:21:10.371 --> 00:21:12.960
Of course, not, Princess,
I wish you to live.

00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:15.465
Your time will come.

00:21:15.632 --> 00:21:16.718
I swear it.

00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:19.431
Very well, then.

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:21.853
I'll begin to forge ties
with foreign dignitaries

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.022
and bide my time.

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:25.652
Perhaps this is necessary.

00:21:25.819 --> 00:21:28.199
I'll go with you, if you please.

00:21:28.365 --> 00:21:30.244
Thank you, Luke. Bless you.

00:21:37.258 --> 00:21:38.512
And Fitz.

00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:42.227
I relieve you of your duties
as my mage bodyguard.

00:21:42.393 --> 00:21:44.231
Oh. But, how come?

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:47.738
I initially secured
your services by threatening you

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:49.575
with punishment for trespassing.

00:21:49.742 --> 00:21:51.788
I left you with no recourse.

00:21:51.955 --> 00:21:55.127
And I never once gave thought
to your wishes,

00:21:55.294 --> 00:21:58.008
let alone asked about them.
I'm sorry.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.096
I cannot grant your wish.

00:22:00.263 --> 00:22:03.269
I have no power
to find your friends and family,

00:22:03.435 --> 00:22:05.774
and I probably never could.

00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:08.697
So, from this day,

00:22:08.864 --> 00:22:11.410
I shan't burden you
more than I already have.

00:22:12.203 --> 00:22:14.457
-You are a free man, Fitz.
-[FITZ] Wait.

00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:17.130
I won't leave you.

00:22:17.297 --> 00:22:19.217
You called me your friend,
Your Highness.

00:22:20.011 --> 00:22:22.390
And you're my friend, too.

00:22:23.727 --> 00:22:26.524
When my friends are in trouble,
I help them.

00:22:27.025 --> 00:22:28.778
I protect those close to me.

00:22:29.487 --> 00:22:31.158
And that's no burden at all.

00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:41.971
I'm going to stay by your side.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.311
And this time
I'll do it of my own free will.

00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:50.238
All right, Fitz.

00:22:50.404 --> 00:22:51.824
As you wish.

00:22:58.964 --> 00:23:00.132
Just you wait.

00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:03.765
I will become
this kingdom's sovereign.

00:23:07.188 --> 00:23:08.399
Hail!

00:23:08.566 --> 00:23:10.403
[BOTH] Her Highness,
our future ruler,

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.700
Princess Ariel Anemoi Asura!

00:23:15.371 --> 00:23:16.916
[FITZ]
I had chosen a path.

00:23:17.793 --> 00:23:18.962
I wanted to be someone

00:23:19.129 --> 00:23:20.464
my friends
could really count on.

00:23:26.811 --> 00:23:30.151
And after that day,
my nightmares ceased.
