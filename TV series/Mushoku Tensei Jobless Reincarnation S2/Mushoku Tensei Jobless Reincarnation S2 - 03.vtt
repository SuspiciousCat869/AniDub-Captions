WEBVTT

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.340
[RUDEUS]
Great work, you guys!

00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:04.593
[COUNTER ARROW]
Cheers!

00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:09.268
[gulping]

00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:11.774
You saved our butts
again today, Rudeus.

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:13.401
That's our Quagmire!

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:15.447
No, I'm only any use at all

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:17.577
because you all work so well
together already.

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:19.998
And you're always so modest.
Stop!

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:22.545
[RUDEUS]
Since that night in the woods,

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:24.215
I've been working
with Counter Arrow

00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:25.843
almost exclusively.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.724
And my reputation keeps growing.

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:31.897
It's not just the adventurers
talking about "Quagmire Rudeus",

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.651
it's the villagers as well.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.655
And one other thing has changed.

00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:38.451
Sara and I have gotten closer.

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:41.499
My dad was a hunter for years
before I was born,

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:43.378
so I've basically
been practicing archery

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:44.923
ever since I could walk.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:46.885
That's why I still use a bow
today.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.889
I know it's not the best
for adventuring,

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:50.017
but I still like it.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.146
My father was a knight
before I was born.

00:00:52.772 --> 00:00:54.358
I think he wanted me to be, too,

00:00:54.442 --> 00:00:56.530
but I always had more talent
for magic.

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:59.285
So he hired me a tutor.

00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:01.540
A Migurdian mage named Roxy.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:06.090
That sounds like a woman.

00:01:06.174 --> 00:01:08.428
She is. She was incredible.

00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:11.017
And, I consider her my master
even now.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.021
Oh, that's neat.

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.526
[RUDEUS] Some topics put her
in a sour mood,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.446
but, in general, we're good!

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.365
[sighs]

00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:22.122
Oh, hey, you don't mind
if I change the subject, do you?

00:01:22.206 --> 00:01:23.083
[RUDEUS]
No.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.503
Well, being a hunter's kid,

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:26.799
I'm not too bad with a knife,
either,

00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:29.680
but I mostly use mine
to do repairs on my gear.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.061
And the blade
is getting awfully chipped,

00:01:33.144 --> 00:01:34.731
so, uh, I've been thinking

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:37.027
about buying myself
a new one pretty soon.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:38.572
[RUDEUS]
I see.

00:01:38.656 --> 00:01:41.829
That being said,
if you're free tomorrow,

00:01:41.912 --> 00:01:43.415
you want to come shopping
with me?

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.127
Uh, sure thing.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.337
That sounds like fun.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.468
It's settled, then!

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:51.807
[chuckles]

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.101
[gasps]

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:55.021
Uh. Uh... [sighs]

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.819
[RUDEUS]
And only then did I realize

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:00.323
what her invitation
really was...

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:02.453
a date.

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.564
Ah, that was so much fun!

00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:41.192
Can't afford it now,

00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:44.031
but seeing all that stuff
made me want a new breastplate.

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:46.285
Is something wrong
with your current one?

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.208
Well, I bought it
a long time ago,

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.255
now, so it's starting
to get a little tight on me.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.552
Is it, now?

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:57.140
Oh, quit your blushing,
you big baby.

00:03:57.224 --> 00:03:58.393
I mean, honestly.

00:03:58.476 --> 00:04:00.480
You men are all the same, huh?

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:06.158
[sighs]

00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:08.539
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.547
I almost always drink too much
whenever we're together.

00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:14.258
[Rudeus gasps]

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:15.636
[RUDEUS]
Do you?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.182
[SARA]
Yeah, I wonder why.

00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:22.274
Maybe I just feel safer
when you're next to me.

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:25.113
[RUDEUS]
Is this what I think it is?

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.954
Do I "have a shot," as they say?

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:30.498
I do, right?

00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:32.962
You're allowed to touch me.

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:35.341
Oh, are you sure?

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:37.972
[RUDEUS]
Okay, then. I'll go for it.

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:40.226
I've done a lot of reflection
in the last 30 seconds,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.022
and it's high time
I put the past behind me

00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:42.982
and moved on.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:45.111
[Rudeus chugs and sighs]

00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:48.577
Hey,
why don't we call it a night?

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.080
It's getting late.

00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:51.541
I'll walk you to your inn?

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.461
[RUDEUS]
On the other hand,

00:04:53.545 --> 00:04:56.551
I shouldn't try to make a move
until I'm positive about this.

00:04:56.635 --> 00:04:58.096
Isn't that right, Paul?

00:05:01.937 --> 00:05:05.318
[SARA] I think I'd like to talk
a little longer.

00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:10.663
Ah. If you want, okay.

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:13.000
Maybe we could look
for another tavern to try?

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.506
Yeah.

00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:20.641
No. I think I'd rather go back
to your room.

00:05:20.724 --> 00:05:22.060
[RUDEUS]
Come on.

00:05:22.144 --> 00:05:23.897
Does she realize
how that sounds?

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:26.235
Even if she does,
I need to control myself.

00:05:26.318 --> 00:05:27.905
It's not even like that
between us!

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.116
But hang on. Read the room.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.705
If she's fine with this, maybe
I should just go with the flow!

00:05:31.788 --> 00:05:33.542
Let things
take their natural course!

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.965
Okay, well...
Let's get going, then.

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:38.802
[Sara sighs]

00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:43.227
[gasps]

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.031
And here we are.

00:05:49.908 --> 00:05:51.410
This is a big room.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.636
[sighs]

00:06:03.977 --> 00:06:06.566
Would, uh,
you like something to drink?

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.236
[SARA]
Forget about that.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.196
Come over here.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:10.156
Okay.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.534
[RUDEUS]
Here goes nothing.

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:16.335
So, um...

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:17.253
What's up?

00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:19.341
I'm really grateful to you.

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:21.721
I almost died,

00:06:21.805 --> 00:06:23.474
and if you hadn't come
looking for me,

00:06:23.558 --> 00:06:25.019
I definitely would have.

00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.325
That's why, if you want...

00:06:33.452 --> 00:06:35.331
we can do it.

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:36.876
[gasps]

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:38.547
[sighs]

00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:50.696
[whimpers]

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.994
[RUDEUS]
Huh.

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:09.817
[RUDEUS]
Mm? Oh, uh.

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:13.240
[RUDEUS]
And then it hit me.

00:07:13.324 --> 00:07:16.623
The real reason I had felt
like something was "off."

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:17.583
It wasn't Sara.

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:21.006
She was amazing,
her body was perfect.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.682
She left absolutely nothing
to be desired.

00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:27.268
The problem was me.

00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:30.483
My body was raising
one hell of a red flag.

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:31.903
Or, to be more precise,

00:07:31.986 --> 00:07:34.617
it wasn't raising anything
at all.

00:07:35.493 --> 00:07:38.499
It was completely unresponsive.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:40.712
[RUDEUS]
Oh, come on.

00:07:42.382 --> 00:07:45.471
[RUDEUS]
Why? How? And since when?

00:07:45.556 --> 00:07:46.641
How long have I--?

00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:47.726
[panting]

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.689
[RUDEUS]
This doesn't make any sense.

00:07:49.772 --> 00:07:51.441
It's never stayed down before!

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:53.070
Even when I wanted it to!

00:07:54.364 --> 00:07:57.830
What in the ever-loving hell
is happening to my body?

00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:00.042
-[SARA] Hey.
-Huh?

00:08:00.126 --> 00:08:01.336
It's not like I was...

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:03.884
I don't know,
"into you" or anything.

00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:06.471
What?

00:08:07.348 --> 00:08:09.854
[SARA]
I just wanted to thank you.

00:08:10.647 --> 00:08:12.818
You know, pay my debt.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.323
So, don't go
getting the wrong idea.

00:08:15.866 --> 00:08:18.287
I only came up here
'cause I felt obligated.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.749
You what?

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.711
[SARA]
So, bye.

00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:22.880
[RUDEUS]
Hey, wai--

00:08:22.963 --> 00:08:24.174
What a disaster.

00:08:24.884 --> 00:08:26.428
[gasps]

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.315
[sighs]

00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:39.454
[RUDEUS]
It's cold.

00:08:43.337 --> 00:08:45.550
[gulping and groans]

00:08:45.634 --> 00:08:47.262
Give me another, old man.

00:08:47.345 --> 00:08:50.184
Kid, you're gonna hurt yourself
drinking like that.

00:08:50.268 --> 00:08:52.063
[RUDEUS]
Lay off and pour, would you?

00:08:52.146 --> 00:08:53.482
[sighs]

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:56.698
Well, well.
If it isn't Quagmire!

00:08:56.781 --> 00:08:58.409
Fancy seeing you here.

00:08:58.492 --> 00:09:00.121
Not every day
I find you drinking

00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:01.916
in our favorite tavern.

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:04.296
What're you moping about?

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:06.258
Did someone have a shitty day?

00:09:06.341 --> 00:09:08.555
Come on, now,
don't bother trying to hide it.

00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:10.016
I've seen you do this enough.

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:11.811
Whenever something
doesn't go your way,

00:09:11.894 --> 00:09:13.732
you run off with your tail
between your legs

00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:16.194
till it's time to deploy
that sad clown smile again.

00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:18.240
You're such a-- [grunts]

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.409
You asshole!

00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:21.496
What are you so mad about?

00:09:22.248 --> 00:09:24.002
You're always picking fights
with me.

00:09:25.714 --> 00:09:27.843
Isn't this what you wanted
all along?

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:28.845
What're--

00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:31.893
What's wrong with smiling
whenever I want, huh?

00:09:31.976 --> 00:09:34.439
Maybe I should go around
insulting and belittling people,

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:35.734
just like you?

00:09:35.817 --> 00:09:38.447
If I could get away
with that shit.

00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:41.161
If I could stand to make
everyone around me resent me.

00:09:41.244 --> 00:09:44.543
If I didn't care whether I drove
everyone away from me.

00:09:44.585 --> 00:09:46.923
If I could keep your attitude
without hating myself,

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:48.677
then yeah, maybe I would!

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.016
[inhales]
I don't want anyone to hate me!

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.396
That's why I'm always smiling
like that!

00:09:55.147 --> 00:09:58.153
What about that
pisses you off so much?

00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:01.493
I just want you to stay.

00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:05.084
[sniffling]
Smile even if you don't mean it.

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:06.879
It's not that hard,

00:10:06.963 --> 00:10:09.426
and it hurts
when you're so cruel to me.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.390
[breathes shakily]

00:10:12.473 --> 00:10:14.603
Whatever. I'm done.

00:10:15.605 --> 00:10:16.983
I don't care anymore.

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:19.362
So bring it on.

00:10:19.864 --> 00:10:20.949
Hit me, damn it.

00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:23.370
Have your fucking fun.

00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:25.374
Then when I'm sprawled out,

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.295
you can look down on me
and laugh.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.468
I know I can't take you
in a fight.

00:10:31.386 --> 00:10:36.396
[Rudeus crying]

00:10:39.612 --> 00:10:41.072
Hey, Soldat.

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:43.410
It's about time you cut the boy
some slack, huh?

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:44.705
Yeah, I guess so.

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:48.546
All right, kiddo.
That was my bad.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.882
I'm sorry, okay?

00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:52.470
Maybe
you really do have it worse

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:53.515
than most people.

00:10:54.642 --> 00:10:56.646
[RUDEUS]
What would you know about it?

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:00.904
Uh... Well, nothing yet.

00:11:01.446 --> 00:11:03.408
Anyway, next one's on me.

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:05.914
So drink up
and you can tell me about it.

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:07.668
It might help you get it
off your chest,

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:08.878
if nothing else.

00:11:09.672 --> 00:11:11.717
[Rudeus sniffles]

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.474
[SOLDAT]
Ah, so your girl dumped you

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:16.686
'cause you can't get it up?

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.357
[sniffles] Yeah, so what?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.986
You making fun of me now?

00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:23.115
No, of course I'm not.
Don't be dumb.

00:11:23.198 --> 00:11:24.033
Here's the thing.

00:11:24.117 --> 00:11:25.787
When you're down in the dumps
like this,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.206
you got to be clear about why,

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.460
otherwise,
no one can help make it better.

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:30.755
[sighs]

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.260
Well, I was feeling melancholy
'cause--

00:11:33.343 --> 00:11:34.763
Uh, don't be so formal.

00:11:35.724 --> 00:11:38.270
You sounded
a lot more honest earlier.

00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:41.234
Don't feel like you have to hide
behind fancy words like that.

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.324
Now start over.
Tell it to me straight.

00:11:44.407 --> 00:11:45.242
[Rudeus sighs]

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.377
I was upset about something that
happened a long time ago now.

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.549
I used to know this girl.

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:53.551
Yeah?

00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:56.849
We went through a lot,
but we got closer,

00:11:56.933 --> 00:12:00.147
and, eventually,
we were each other's first.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.485
Sure, everyone's got to
start somewhere.

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:03.905
That's how it works.

00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:07.244
But in the morning,
she had already left,

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:08.748
gone on some trip.

00:12:08.831 --> 00:12:10.710
And she didn't even tell me
where.

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.421
Wow, she just ditched you, huh?

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:14.175
[Rudeus crying]

00:12:14.258 --> 00:12:15.887
Hey, quit the tears.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.181
But if that's your reaction,

00:12:17.264 --> 00:12:19.561
I think we just found
what your problem is.

00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:21.398
Why would she leave?

00:12:21.481 --> 00:12:24.278
I thought we were supposed to...
I don't...

00:12:25.114 --> 00:12:27.703
Well, based on my experience,

00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:30.583
it might have been something
you screwed up right beforehand.

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.211
[gasps] But right beforehand?

00:12:33.422 --> 00:12:35.092
I must have really sucked
in bed, then.

00:12:35.175 --> 00:12:37.430
No, don't start
jumping to conclusions.

00:12:38.348 --> 00:12:39.810
Let's fix you up.

00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:40.729
[Rudeus gasps]

00:12:41.229 --> 00:12:42.733
But how, exactly?

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:44.110
I don't know.

00:12:44.193 --> 00:12:45.446
But, look, sometimes,

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.907
the only way to get past
a problem

00:12:46.991 --> 00:12:49.162
is to keep pounding at it,
if you get my drift.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.790
Meaning what?

00:12:51.834 --> 00:12:53.796
It's time to call in
a professional.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.683
[crowd chatter]

00:13:06.655 --> 00:13:07.490
[gasps]

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.654
Excuse me.

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:28.908
I am Elise.

00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:30.285
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:33.918
Would you do me the honor
of sharing your name, sir?

00:13:34.545 --> 00:13:36.297
Oh, yeah, I'm Rudeus.

00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:37.884
Uh, Rudeus Greyrat.

00:13:39.596 --> 00:13:41.307
I look forward to serving you.

00:13:41.391 --> 00:13:42.769
Why don't I get you a drink?

00:13:44.648 --> 00:13:46.067
Your reputation precedes you,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.779
-Rudeus.
-Does it?

00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:51.579
Oh, well,
I suppose another adventurer

00:13:51.662 --> 00:13:53.081
must have mentioned me.

00:13:53.164 --> 00:13:55.252
Oh, no. It was my sister.

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.133
You once cast a healing spell
on her, free of charge.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:13:59.970
I did?

00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:00.889
You did.

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:01.807
Last winter,

00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:03.853
while you were clearing snow
out of the square,

00:14:03.936 --> 00:14:04.938
she said.

00:14:05.022 --> 00:14:05.857
[gasps]

00:14:08.445 --> 00:14:11.577
I'm honored to welcome
such a gentleman into my bed.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.332
The other working girls
will be terribly jealous.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.587
That's nice.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.423
May I have another cup?

00:14:18.507 --> 00:14:20.177
Yes, of course.

00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:24.686
But our time here is limited,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.066
so I do hope
you'll enjoy me, as well.

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:28.986
Oh, yeah, I will, thank you.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:37.211
[sighs]

00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:41.052
So, what do we do? Just, start?

00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:42.221
Certainly.

00:14:43.306 --> 00:14:44.141
[gasps]

00:14:56.625 --> 00:14:59.422
[ELISE]
Now, Master Rudeus, to bed.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:00.967
[grunts]

00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:07.856
You can lie back.
Let me get started my way.

00:15:09.818 --> 00:15:12.281
So then I said,
"You guys go around the back,

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:15.245
I'll take out all the monsters
in front with one strike!

00:15:15.328 --> 00:15:16.164
Meet me at--"

00:15:16.247 --> 00:15:17.082
Uh?

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.253
[SOLDAT]
Hey, Quagmire. How'd it go?

00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:22.259
She tried all sorts
of different things for me,

00:15:22.342 --> 00:15:23.679
but no luck.

00:15:23.763 --> 00:15:25.975
Ah, shoot. Okay.

00:15:26.602 --> 00:15:28.939
I'm so sorry
that I couldn't be of more help.

00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:32.530
Hey, it's not your fault.
You did what you could.

00:15:32.614 --> 00:15:34.283
[SOLDAT]
Oh, well, I'm all out of ideas.

00:15:35.118 --> 00:15:37.916
Hey, you "know" him now,
what do you think?

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.126
[sighs]

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.216
It struck me that he's a bit,
well, frightened and timid

00:15:42.299 --> 00:15:43.552
around women in general.

00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:45.430
So I wonder,

00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:48.394
if his partner were someone
he didn't have to be afraid of.

00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:52.069
Someone whom he feels certain
would never turn on him

00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:53.446
no matter what, then.

00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:54.825
Ring any bells?

00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:57.580
[RUDEUS] For a moment,
I thought of Roxy,

00:15:57.664 --> 00:15:59.500
but no,
that probably wouldn't work.

00:16:00.837 --> 00:16:03.717
I fear that such relationships
can't be rushed into.

00:16:03.801 --> 00:16:06.347
They must be nurtured,
little by little.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.226
Eh, that figures.

00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:10.063
Well, drink up tonight,
Quagmire.

00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:11.608
You deserve to forget this.

00:16:12.484 --> 00:16:13.319
Right.

00:16:18.246 --> 00:16:20.585
-[Rudeus snoring]
-[WAITER 203A] Excuse me, sirs?

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.337
We're a bit past closing time.

00:16:23.006 --> 00:16:24.383
Huh?

00:16:24.466 --> 00:16:27.682
[yawns] It's morning? Ah, well.

00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:28.601
[sighs]

00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:36.199
[SOLDAT]
Say, Quagmire.

00:16:36.909 --> 00:16:37.744
[RUDEUS]
Mm, what?

00:16:38.494 --> 00:16:39.998
I got this rule, like,

00:16:40.081 --> 00:16:41.585
when I'm going
through a labyrinth,

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:44.215
I don't rush into things
too quickly, you know?

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.885
Um...

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:48.306
[SOLDAT]
'Cause he deeper you go,

00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:51.020
the tougher the monsters
you encounter are gonna be.

00:16:51.103 --> 00:16:52.649
Different kinds
will even team up

00:16:52.732 --> 00:16:54.151
with each other sometimes.

00:16:54.736 --> 00:16:55.696
And when that happens,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.825
you can't just go
rushing in blind.

00:16:57.909 --> 00:17:00.080
That's how people get hurt
or dead.

00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:01.207
Yeah.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.794
So what you do,

00:17:02.877 --> 00:17:06.217
is you stay a floor above
and ease yourself into things,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.054
and that works pretty well.

00:17:08.137 --> 00:17:09.766
-[clears throat]
-Yeah!

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.352
Fight the weaker ones!

00:17:11.435 --> 00:17:13.356
So, with you and Sara,

00:17:13.439 --> 00:17:15.903
I think you just got in
too deep, too fast.

00:17:15.987 --> 00:17:18.408
"Too deep"?
Haven't you been listening?

00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:20.120
I mean sure, I tried,

00:17:20.203 --> 00:17:22.917
but the problem here
is that I didn't get in at all.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:23.919
It's a metaphor!

00:17:24.003 --> 00:17:25.088
'Cause it sounds to me like

00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:27.259
she was all ready
and raring to go tonight,

00:17:27.342 --> 00:17:31.058
but maybe, you needed more time
to get yourself prepped,

00:17:31.142 --> 00:17:33.814
like in your emotion
feeling stuff, or whatever.

00:17:33.897 --> 00:17:36.444
Yeah, I'm not sure
about any of that.

00:17:36.528 --> 00:17:38.699
She said she was only doing it
out of obligation.

00:17:38.782 --> 00:17:39.618
Yeah?

00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:41.329
Hope you're not always
that gullible,

00:17:41.412 --> 00:17:42.999
'cause
from where I've been sitting,

00:17:43.082 --> 00:17:44.919
it looks like
she's plenty into you.

00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:45.838
Uh...

00:17:48.844 --> 00:17:51.098
Anyway, if you got the time,

00:17:51.182 --> 00:17:52.309
why not go see her again

00:17:52.392 --> 00:17:54.647
and see
if you can't talk things out?

00:17:54.731 --> 00:17:56.526
Sir, yes, sir! Yeah.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.699
Maybe I'll go see her tonight
or tomorrow or something.

00:17:59.783 --> 00:18:01.410
I don't feel like
you're listening.

00:18:01.995 --> 00:18:04.124
-I was actually gonna--
-[RUDEUS] Yeah! Whatever!

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.047
I get it, already!
Just, let it go, will you?

00:18:07.548 --> 00:18:10.428
But what do I care
if it doesn't work out?

00:18:10.513 --> 00:18:12.809
You really think
I'd want a woman like her?

00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:14.646
I mean, she's built like a kid.

00:18:14.729 --> 00:18:16.733
A real woman ought to be
like Elise, you know?

00:18:16.817 --> 00:18:18.361
Like, stacked, you get me?

00:18:18.444 --> 00:18:19.656
[chuckles]

00:18:19.739 --> 00:18:22.995
Come on, Soldat.
Am I right or am I right?

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:24.916
I mean, shopping and dinner?

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:27.170
Can you believe
all that little girl crap?

00:18:27.254 --> 00:18:29.299
Like, are we playing house,
or what?

00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:31.638
Hey, Quagmire, leave it at that.

00:18:31.722 --> 00:18:33.307
[RUDEUS]
I'm just stating facts.

00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:35.980
Rudeus deserves a real woman!

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:40.238
-Mm?
-Uh...

00:18:44.496 --> 00:18:45.331
[growls]

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:49.214
Uh, no, Sara, I, I didn't--

00:18:49.841 --> 00:18:51.177
[slap]

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:55.853
You're the worst.

00:18:55.936 --> 00:18:58.316
I never want
to see your face again.

00:18:58.399 --> 00:18:59.234
[metal clanging]

00:18:59.819 --> 00:19:00.654
[Sara grunts]

00:19:09.004 --> 00:19:11.802
Rudeus, that was out of line.

00:19:11.885 --> 00:19:12.720
[gasps]

00:19:14.516 --> 00:19:15.350
[sighs]

00:19:17.605 --> 00:19:19.358
Ah...

00:19:23.199 --> 00:19:27.457
-[gasps]
-[metal slicing]

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:28.877
-[thuds]
-[metal clangs]

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:30.714
Hold your horses, dumbass!

00:19:30.798 --> 00:19:32.217
You go after her
right this second

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.221
and explain yourself, okay?

00:19:34.304 --> 00:19:36.475
Stand up, idiot! Go!

00:19:37.185 --> 00:19:39.481
What's the point? Won't help.

00:19:40.191 --> 00:19:43.866
I don't want to,
don't want to do anything.

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.161
-[Rudeus weeps]
-Okay, then, hey!

00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:48.625
Why not take a trip
to visit your family?

00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:51.673
Where's your old man at, huh?
Asura, or where?

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.635
[RUDEUS]
Millis.

00:19:53.719 --> 00:19:55.764
Uh, that's pretty far away,
isn't it?

00:19:57.225 --> 00:19:58.060
[sighs]

00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:01.776
[SOLDAT]
Then you want to come with us?

00:20:03.487 --> 00:20:04.323
Huh?

00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:06.452
[SOLDAT]
A huge labyrinth turned up

00:20:06.536 --> 00:20:08.331
over in the Duchy of Neris.

00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:11.170
We were thinking of heading out
sometime today.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.800
Come on. It'll be fun.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.386
[gasps]

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.476
Why? Why would you even offer?

00:20:18.977 --> 00:20:21.273
I thought you hated my guts.

00:20:21.357 --> 00:20:22.693
Yeah.

00:20:22.777 --> 00:20:25.156
That creepy smile
and the kiss-ass attitude

00:20:25.239 --> 00:20:26.576
really rubbed me the wrong way,

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.872
and I just wanted you
to drop the mask.

00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:29.916
But now that you have,

00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:32.253
and I know
what's at the heart of you,

00:20:32.337 --> 00:20:35.468
I know you got reasons
for acting the way you do.

00:20:35.552 --> 00:20:37.556
So, there's no reason
to hate you now.

00:20:38.432 --> 00:20:39.309
[RUDEUS]
I feel like

00:20:39.393 --> 00:20:41.397
I've really misunderstood
Soldat.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.819
I've been giving him
a wide berth

00:20:43.902 --> 00:20:45.990
because of my first impression,

00:20:46.073 --> 00:20:49.246
but he's a much better person
than I ever would have imagined.

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:51.918
So? What's the verdict?

00:20:54.047 --> 00:20:56.594
[sniffles]

00:21:03.482 --> 00:21:04.317
I'll go.

00:21:05.027 --> 00:21:06.447
Please take me with you.

00:21:07.115 --> 00:21:07.950
Okay.

00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:11.165
What are we waiting for?

00:22:46.564 --> 00:22:47.900
Oh, hey, get this.

00:22:47.983 --> 00:22:50.029
There's a rumor
about some incredible mage

00:22:50.112 --> 00:22:51.156
who just showed up.

00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:54.037
Apparently he was able to help
a party of under 20 people

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.670
take down a stray dragon
without even breaking a sweat.

00:22:57.753 --> 00:23:00.258
[ADVENTURER 203B]
Impressive. This guy got a name?

00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:02.387
They call him, like,
"Quagmire Rudeus,"

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.015
-or something.
-[Elinalise gasps]

00:23:04.099 --> 00:23:05.769
[ADVENTURER 203B]
"Quagmire," huh?

00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:07.480
[ELINALISE]
Pardon me, gentlemen.

00:23:07.564 --> 00:23:09.067
Would you mind telling me more?

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.196
Uh, more about what?

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:13.702
This rumor about the adventurer.

00:23:13.785 --> 00:23:15.580
"Quagmire Rudeus," was it?

00:23:15.664 --> 00:23:16.916
That's pretty much it.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.212
I don't actually know
anything else about him-- Uh!

00:23:19.295 --> 00:23:20.841
Come on, think harder.

00:23:20.924 --> 00:23:22.845
Surely you can remember
a little more.

00:23:22.928 --> 00:23:25.391
There's something good in it
for you and your friend there,

00:23:25.474 --> 00:23:26.561
-if you do.
-Oh.

00:23:26.644 --> 00:23:28.732
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.319
-Ah! Yeah, I know!
-[chuckles]

00:23:31.403 --> 00:23:32.614
He's in Pippin!

00:23:32.698 --> 00:23:34.744
Basherant's second city, Pippin.

00:23:34.827 --> 00:23:37.541
Is he really? Thank you so much.

00:23:37.624 --> 00:23:38.459
[both chuckles]

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:40.505
So I've finally found him.
