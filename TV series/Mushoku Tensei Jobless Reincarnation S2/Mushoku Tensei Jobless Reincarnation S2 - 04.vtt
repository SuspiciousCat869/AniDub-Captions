That day,

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:39.037
I learned where Zenith was,

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.876
the labyrinth city of Rapa
on the Begaritt Continent,

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:45.466
far to the south,
the other side of the world.

00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:48.848
Traveling there on foot
from the Northern Territories

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:50.059
could take a year,

00:08:50.226 --> 00:08:51.186
maybe more.

00:08:52.856 --> 00:08:55.946
Besides, winter is coming.

00:08:58.618 --> 00:09:00.371
I'll have to stay put
for the time being,

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:02.710
but I shouldn't have anything
to worry about.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.004
According to Elinalise,

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.674
Zenith is having
a grand old time

00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:07.135

00:09:13.022 --> 00:09:14.775
We met Roxy while searching
for your family

00:09:14.942 --> 00:09:17.363
and only split up
once we found where Zenith was.

00:09:17.531 --> 00:09:19.284
She and the others should have
joined up with Paul

00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:20.787
in Millishion by now

00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:22.916
and made their way down
to Begaritt to get her.

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:24.754
So you can relax, okay?

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.214
Wait, go back.

00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:27.926

going to happen.

no one can help me fix this.

And I don't like anyone enough
to keep trying.

00:15:57.287 --> 00:15:59.083
The liege lords of Asura?

00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:01.420
What're you doing
as a solo adventurer

00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:02.757
way out here, then?

00:16:02.924 --> 00:16:03.801
Hm?

00:16:04.719 --> 00:16:06.097
Well, my folks...

00:16:07.517 --> 00:16:09.855
-Oh, uh...
-I shouldn't have asked.

00:16:10.021 --> 00:16:12.652
But they went out of their way
to offer you a pretty good deal.

00:16:12.819 --> 00:16:15.658
You might as well go down there
and hear them out, at least.

00:16:15.825 --> 00:16:17.327
-You know?
-[RUDEUS] Yeah.

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.624
And come to think of it,

00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.920
the only reason I went
to tutor Eris in the first place

00:16:22.087 --> 00:16:24.091
was so I could save up
tuition money.

00:16:24.968 --> 00:16:26.555
I'd totally forgotten.

00:16:26.722 --> 00:16:28.433
Attending the University
with Sylphiette

00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.853
was the original goal.

00:16:31.565 --> 00:16:33.652
I wonder what she's been up to
all this time.

00:16:34.905 --> 00:16:36.073
I hope she's all right.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.827
Ah! Oh!

00:16:37.994 --> 00:16:39.371
You should listen to him.

00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:41.250
School is a wonderful option,

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.795
especially
when the only alternative

00:16:42.962 --> 00:16:44.758
would be rejoining Paul.

00:16:44.925 --> 00:16:46.427
[RUDEUS]
You think?

00:16:46.595 --> 00:16:49.099
I feel like reuniting my family
ought to come first.

00:16:49.266 --> 00:16:50.770
[ELINALISE] Paul is eventually
going to bring them all

00:16:50.937 --> 00:16:52.523
back to Asura anyway,

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.151
just wait
'til they make it back safely

00:16:54.318 --> 00:16:55.696
and get settled in,

00:16:55.863 --> 00:16:57.825
and then take a shorter trip
to visit them.

00:16:57.992 --> 00:16:59.286
[RUDEUS]
You're saying that

00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:00.831
because you don't want
to see my father again,

00:17:00.998 --> 00:17:02.209
aren't you?

00:17:02.376 --> 00:17:03.879
-Guilty as charged.
-[KONRAD] Oh.

00:17:04.046 --> 00:17:06.175
[RUDEUS]
Whoa, she must really hate him.

00:17:07.135 --> 00:17:09.641
Well, improving my skills
is important.

00:17:10.267 --> 00:17:13.064
But attractive
as the University's proposal is,

00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:16.070
I don't think I can justify
taking them up on it right now.

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.185
[RUDEUS]
Long time no see.

00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:34.023
[MAN-GOD]
Yup! Hi.

00:17:34.189 --> 00:17:36.193
[RUDEUS] What has it been,
two years now?

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.907
I don't feel as nasty
as I did before.

00:17:39.074 --> 00:17:41.203
[MAN-GOD]
Aw, you missed me, huh?

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:43.124
That's not what I said.

00:17:44.043 --> 00:17:45.504
Although, hey.

00:17:45.671 --> 00:17:47.090
I did try to reach out to you
a bunch of times

00:17:47.257 --> 00:17:49.053
while I was out
looking for Zenith.

00:17:49.219 --> 00:17:51.808
Would it have killed you
to show up for me even once?

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:54.188
I had a lot going on my end.

00:17:54.355 --> 00:17:55.440
[RUDEUS]
Oh, yeah?

00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:58.404
Well, at least someone
eventually found her.

00:17:58.572 --> 00:18:01.118
Just feels like
I lost two whole years over it.

00:18:01.285 --> 00:18:02.496
Yeah, sorry.

00:18:02.663 --> 00:18:03.916
But I'm glad
you know where she is!

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.628
[RUDEUS]
Thanks.

00:18:05.795 --> 00:18:07.882
I had no idea Roxy was out there
looking for her, too.

00:18:08.717 --> 00:18:11.097
[MAN-GOD] She's
a real go-getter, isn't she?

00:18:11.263 --> 00:18:12.975
[RUDEUS]
Yeah, you said it, but...

00:18:13.434 --> 00:18:15.773
I hope she gets back
from Begaritt sooner than later,

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.359
I can't wait to see her.

00:18:17.902 --> 00:18:18.779
Oh, dear.

00:18:19.363 --> 00:18:20.658
Are you sure you want
your master

00:18:20.825 --> 00:18:22.411
to see how pathetic you are
right now?

00:18:22.578 --> 00:18:23.831
[grunts] Hey.

00:18:23.997 --> 00:18:25.166
I mean, think about it.

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:26.962
Eris ran out on you,

00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:28.715
and when you finally had
a good thing going with Sara,

00:18:28.882 --> 00:18:30.970
your little guy
just wouldn't go to bat for you!

00:18:31.638 --> 00:18:33.684
Your spellcasting
may have improved a little,

00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:35.771
but you're really hitting a wall
lately.

00:18:35.938 --> 00:18:38.276
And your swordsmanship
hasn't gotten any better either!

00:18:38.443 --> 00:18:39.988
I know you practice every day,

00:18:40.155 --> 00:18:42.159
but boy, you don't have much
to show for it.

00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:43.662
Sure, you've built some muscle,

00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:45.415
but I don't think
you can stand before her

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.002
and say with any confidence

00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:49.047
that you're a student
to be proud of, Rudy.

00:18:49.214 --> 00:18:51.595
Wow, you're really letting me
have it this time, huh?

00:18:51.762 --> 00:18:53.599
How about you get to the point
already?

00:18:54.851 --> 00:18:57.815
The point is that
you have a chance to shape up!

00:18:58.316 --> 00:19:00.654
Attend the University,
and I can promise you this:

00:19:00.821 --> 00:19:02.157
you'll learn so much more

00:19:02.324 --> 00:19:04.829
than a common adventurer
could ever hope to!

00:19:05.831 --> 00:19:08.754
What are you, every teacher
I had in high school?

00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:10.966
Oh, wait, you just kind of threw
that out there,

00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:13.847
but is that more
of your patented "Godly Advice"?

00:19:14.014 --> 00:19:16.310
[MAN-GOD]
Sure. You could say that. [hums]

00:19:16.477 --> 00:19:18.439
You do this thing where
literally everything you say

00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:20.778
-sounds suspicious and creepy.
-[MAN-GOD] Sorry!

00:19:20.945 --> 00:19:22.865
But you really should listen
this time.

00:19:23.032 --> 00:19:25.161
I'm giving it to you
as straight as I can.

00:19:25.328 --> 00:19:26.915
If you set out for Begaritt now,

00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:29.127
you will most assuredly
regret it.

00:19:29.921 --> 00:19:31.465
[RUDEUS]
Really. Why?

00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:33.177
Can't tell you!

00:19:33.344 --> 00:19:34.471
[RUDEUS]
Of course you can't.

00:19:34.639 --> 00:19:35.891
Well, this isn't the first time

00:19:36.058 --> 00:19:36.977
you've kept something important
from me,

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:38.647
but you've got to realize

00:19:38.814 --> 00:19:40.483
that this whole interdimensional
man of mystery thing

00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:42.320
doesn't exactly make
a strong argument

00:19:42.487 --> 00:19:44.449
for whatever you're trying
to get me to do.

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:46.120
I'd love
to take time for myself,

00:19:46.287 --> 00:19:48.917
but I'd much rather find
the rest of my family first.

00:19:49.084 --> 00:19:50.420
[MAN-GOD]
I see.

00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:52.465
Well, why don't I put it to you
another way?

00:19:52.633 --> 00:19:53.886
This ought to be good.

00:19:54.469 --> 00:19:55.681
[clears throat]

00:19:56.265 --> 00:19:57.602
Rudeus!

00:19:57.768 --> 00:20:00.273
Enroll in the Ranoa University
of Magic,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.612
and investigate
the Displacement Incident

00:20:02.778 --> 00:20:04.657
with their abundant resources!

00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:05.743
[gasps]

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.370
If you do,

00:20:07.538 --> 00:20:10.376
You shall once again regain
your manly potency

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:12.882
and, more importantly,
your pride!

00:20:13.049 --> 00:20:14.426
Oh! Really?

00:20:14.594 --> 00:20:16.388
Are you saying
that just by going to school,

00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:18.935
I can cure
my erectile dysfunction?

00:20:19.102 --> 00:20:21.148
-You are, right?
-[MAN-GOD] Your pride!

00:20:29.498 --> 00:20:34.007
[snoring]

00:20:34.174 --> 00:20:35.051
[RUDEUS]
Ah.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:42.482
[RUDEUS] Sure enough,
not a peep from the peen.

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:47.409
-[Rudeus gasps]
-[Elinalise mumbling]

00:20:48.704 --> 00:20:51.876
[Elinalise snoring]

00:20:53.003 --> 00:20:57.345
Well, okay, if it'll get better.

00:20:59.726 --> 00:21:02.230
[bird chirping]

00:21:03.525 --> 00:21:06.113
-[wing flapping]
-[bird chirping]

00:21:11.123 --> 00:21:12.543
[RUDEUS]
Thank you for everything.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.254
Good luck, kid.

00:21:14.421 --> 00:21:15.799
Take care of yourself.

00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:16.843
[scoffs]

00:21:19.682 --> 00:21:22.353
[RUDEUS]
Sol, I really appreciate you.

00:21:22.521 --> 00:21:23.940
[SOLDAT]
Huh?

00:21:24.107 --> 00:21:25.401
I don't know how
I can ever repay all the things

00:21:25.569 --> 00:21:27.615
that you and your party
have done for me.

00:21:28.449 --> 00:21:29.952
[RUDEUS]
He may not want to admit it,

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:31.581
but he's taken
really good care of me

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:33.292
these last couple of years.

00:21:34.504 --> 00:21:36.048
In fact,
I've made pretty nice money

00:21:36.215 --> 00:21:37.300
exploiting your ass.

00:21:37.467 --> 00:21:38.762
So, thanks for that.

00:21:39.722 --> 00:21:41.810
Anyway, safe travels.

00:21:41.976 --> 00:21:43.145
Go get cured.

00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:45.316
[RUDEUS]
Yeah. I'll try.

00:21:45.483 --> 00:21:46.611
[SOLDAT]
Good.

00:21:46.778 --> 00:21:48.197
Well, I'm sure
we'll have business

00:21:48.364 --> 00:21:50.201
over in Ranoa one of these days.

00:21:50.368 --> 00:21:52.080
And when that happens,

00:21:52.247 --> 00:21:53.750
we ought to go
drinking and whoring again,

00:21:53.917 --> 00:21:55.461
just the two of us.

00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:56.506
Hm.

00:22:01.056 --> 00:22:03.227
[grunts and chuckles]

00:22:03.687 --> 00:22:04.939
[RUDEUS]
And so,

00:22:05.106 --> 00:22:07.277
I set out
for the Kingdom of Ranoa.
