2
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,833
[YOSHINO] I think it's
a memory from my childhood.

3
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,875
I was in the main hall
of a palace somewhere.

4
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,208
Surrounded by my people
who were shouting my name.

5
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,458
And I wore a beautiful,
sparkling crown on my head.

6
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,291
[YOSHINO] In that moment,
I felt so happy.

7
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,041
It was perfect.

8
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,000
Was it some kind of dream?

9
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,958
Or did that day really happen?

10
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,750
I'm still not completely sure.

11
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,666
But it's my favorite memory!

12
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,375
[PROCTOR A] You're saying that
one memory has made you happier

13
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,583
than anything else in your life?

14
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,666
Uh, yes!

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
[YOSHINO]
Oh, crap! I screwed it up!

16
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,916
[PROCTOR A] I see you've applied
for our management track,

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,833
but are you open to accepting
a secretarial position?

18
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,625
Sure!

19
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,875
Yes, I'm open to that.

20
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,666
I'd be proud to do my
part in any way I could.

[PROCTOR A]
Even at a rural branch?

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,083
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
I'd prefer Tokyo.

23

How many applications
have you submitted so far?

24

About thirty, counting this one.

25
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,541
[PROCTOR B] Considering that,
what's your theory

26
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,125
as to why none of
the others have offered you

27
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,416
a position yet?

Your golden years
will be blessed.

Look, I don't care
about my golden years!

[YOSHINO] Yep. I've just been

here if it doesn't work out.

You're saying I should
move home and help you out

with the chores?

growing old in the city?

[YOSHINO sighs]

[YAE] It's what normal
people do, you know.

What's wrong with being normal?

Can you please not
call me "normal"?

completely out of options here.

set on staying in Tokyo?

There's plenty of
work out here, too.

The job is with a tourism board,

so it's probably something
along those lines.

[SHIORI]
I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,291
There appears to have been
some kind of mix-up.

128
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,458
The person we were trying
to request for the position

129
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,416
is named Yoshino Tsubaki.

130
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Yoshino Tsubaki?

131
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,333
Oh, she apparently
used to be a big pop star

132
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,333
back in the day.

133
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,000
Our board director
is a huge fan,

134
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,833
so he planned to have her
come promote our town

135
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,375
as queen.

136
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,000
[USHIMATSU] That person out
there is not my little Yoshino!

137

How in the hell did you
manage to screw this up?

138
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,083
Well, if you look at your note,
it really doesn't look

139
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,375
at all like Tsubaki.

140
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, it's my fault?!

141
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,791
Ah, here we are.

142
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,500
I finally found some info
on Yoshino Tsubaki.

143
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm afraid she passed
away eight years ago.

[USHIMATSU]
Wha--?

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,916
Wow, so she was
famous forever ago.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,166
What should we do now?

147
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,166
We already mailed off
that long application

148
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,500
to receive a subsidy!

149
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,625
And we've already transferred
the contract fees

150
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,875
to her agency.

151
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,166
Which is all your fault
because you screwed up!

152
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,833
[YAMADA] Seriously,
would you look at your note?

153
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,625
Well the banner said "Tsubaki,"
so how do you explain that?

154
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,541
Funny thing--that was
actually a mistake

155
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,958
'cause we asked for Koharu.

156
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,916
[USHIMATSU] The characters
are too close for Koharu!

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,125
Shigaraki is only
a novice calligrapher.

158
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,083
Well, I'm a master!

[YOSHINO] Holy cow,
these people are nuts.

00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,166
Mr. Kadota, please,
you've gotta calm down!

161
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,500
You're being very rude
to Ms. Koharu!

162
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,041
After all, she came here for us.

163
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
Would you shut up, Shiori?

164
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,916
This random girl can't
possibly hold a candle

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,166
to my little Yoshino!

166
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,083
Your "little Yoshino"
would be an old woman

167
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,291
if she was alive!

168
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,791
Yeah, it's confusing
how you keep calling her

169
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,666
"little Yoshino."

170
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,583
What's confusing about Yoshino?

171
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,583
[YAMADA]
Everything!

172
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,125
[YOSHINO]
So, it's happened again.

173
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,041
Yet another job rejection.

174
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
She'll be my
"little Yoshino" till I die!

175
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:18,916
Pardon me!

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,958
[USHIMATSU]
Hm?

177
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,791
Um, the thing is,

178
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,666
we all know it's very easy
to mistake Tsubaki for Koharu

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,916
because of how they're written,

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,041
and no matter what level
calligrapher wrote it,

181
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,833
of course you would
see it as Tsubaki

182
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,666
if that's what you're
looking for from the start,

183
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,250
so that's no one's fault.

184
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,541
And no matter how old
your favorite pop star gets,

185
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,833
calling her "my little Yoshino"
is kind of sweet, isn't it?

186
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,083
Yeah, so, that's all okay.

187
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,166
Anyway...

188
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,333
I know I'm very young.

189
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,458
And I know I'm not
who you wanted.

190
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,166
And I'm sure Yoshino Tsubaki
was a wonderful person

191
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,916
and I couldn't hope to
compete with a pop star,

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,250
but if there is
something I could do

193
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,541
to help you all out here,

194
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,166
I'd love the
opportunity to try--

195
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
Fine, then!

196
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,250
I guess it's meant to be.

197
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,625
We'll go ahead
with the coronation,

198
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,958
as was originally planned.

199
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,000
[MINO]
Huh?

200
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,708
[SHIORI]
For the record...

201
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm really glad it worked
out for you to stay.

202
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,416
Oh, my name is Shiori Shinomiya!

203
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,416
I work for the
tourism board, also.

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,583
Nice to meetcha.

205
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,791
[YOSHINO]
Thanks, you too!

206
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,791
The one walking up
in the front up there?

207
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,541
That's Ushimatsu Kadota.
He's the king.

208
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,166
He's also head of the board.

209
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,000
And behind him is Shigaraki,
the bureau chief.

210
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,958
The really young one
is named Yamada.

211
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,625
And the one with
the glasses is Mino.

212
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,333
[YOSHINO] This place is almost
as dead as back home.

213
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,166
Excellent. Is this another
one of your idiotic plans,

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,583
you old jackass?

215
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,083
Shut up, you stupid hag.

216
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,333
[YOSHINO gasps]

217
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,666
Oh, no worries!
Those two are always like that.

218
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
[SHIORI]
This is Sakura Pond.

219
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,625
Soon the blossoms
will be in full bloom,

220
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,541
and I promise you,
it's absolutely beautiful!

221
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,208
Oh, and if you look that way,

222
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,750
you can see the,
um, palace, over there.

223
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
[YOSHINO]
The palace?

224
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,416
[YOSHINO]
The Kingdom of... Chupakabura.

225
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,666
[SHIORI] I know the kingdom
thing is pretty silly.

226
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,916
but they say years ago,

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,583
we used to get quite
a lot of tourists here

228
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,416
because of it!

229
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
A while back, these mini
independent states

230
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,208
were popping up
constantly all over Japan.

231
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,791
[YOSHINO]
Really? I never knew that.

232
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,916
It created interest in the town.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,583
We received tax money as part
of the Hometown Revival project.

234
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,333
Manoyama got caught
up in the boom,

235
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
and you're looking
at the result.

236
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,166
Then, the boom ended,
and so, here we are.

237
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
[music playing]

238
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,125
[USHIMATSU] Citizens of the
Kingdom, you must not forget!

239
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,458
You must never forget
the horror and calamity

240
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,000
visited upon us by
the Chupakabura!

241
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,833
Only the legendary
Sacred Sword could defeat it!

242
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,041
But, alas, the sword had
been sealed into stone,

243
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,291
and nobody had been
able to free it!

244
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,250
And that was when I,
Ushimatsu Kadota,

245
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,666
appeared on the scene
and though many had failed,

246
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,833
I miraculously freed the sword!

247
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,666
[SHIORI]
That's the basic backstory.

248
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,791
Oh, cool.

249
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,125
[USHIMATSU]
I stood resolutely against

250
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,125
the Chupakabura's attack,
cutting the beast down!

251
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,833
The Secret Sword
did not fail me! However...

252
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,875
Imagine him with a monster.
Probably soiled his pants!

253
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,833
[laughing]

254
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,166
[MINO]
Sorry, Mr. Kadota,

255
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,458
but if you could wrap this up...

256
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,958
[USHIMATSU growls]

257
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,041
Now, we shall conduct the
traditional coronation ceremony.

258
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,916
So, step forward, new queen.

259
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,625
Oh, right, here I am!

260
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,750
I lay this crown upon your head

261
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,333
as an acknowledgement
of your sovereign reign.

262
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,833
[grunts] And now, I hereby
declare you to be the new queen

263
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,041
of the Kingdom of Chupakabura!

264
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,083
[AUDIENCE clapping, chattering]

265
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,333
[GROUP laughing]

266
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,708
Well, you've sure had
a long day, haven't you?

267
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,291
You must be pretty worn out.

268
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, no, it wasn't
that bad, really.

269
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,250
Hey, Kinu!

270
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,375
What gives?

271
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,208
We're running out
of booze down here!

272
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,250
Oh, all right.

273
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,958
What's wrong, Queen? Drink up!

274
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,125
Here, gimme your glass!

275
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,833
Oh, thank you.

276
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,166
I know it's a bit late
for me to ask,

277
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,958
but what is a Chupakabura?

278
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,750
Well, it's a legendary
monster from around these parts.

279
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,166
They say it can suck
the blood out of livestock,

280
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,708
but I've heard that it's
actually just a weasel.

281
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,958
It is not.

282
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,333
When I was a kid,
I saw it with my own eyes.

283
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,208
Oh, God. You're not really gonna
start that nonsense again.

284
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,791
It's not nonsense!

285
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,708
Then where is the Chupakabura?

286
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,625
It's inside all of our hearts!

287
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,875
[laughing]

288
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,500
[TATSU] Say, that's
pretty tasty, isn't it?

289
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,083
Those potatoes
are a town specialty!

290
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,000
And we're known for
making other things, too!

291
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,375
But you should know
that the best thing

292
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,625
we've made by far
is the town itself!

293
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,625
The hope is you'll be able
to get the word out

294
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,250
about this great little place!

295
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
So, my queen.

296
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,583
I look forward
to working with you.

297
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,083
Wait. What do you mean?

298
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,083
How 'bout a toast?

299
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,458
Raise your glasses, get 'em up!

300
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,500
That's right!

301
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,333
To Manoyama and
its shining future!

302
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,333
Pitch black.

303
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,875
[SHIORI] I have to tell you,
I really am so glad

304
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,875
that you decided
to take the job, Yoshi.

305
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,583
Oh, sorry, is it okay
if I call you Yoshi?

306
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,375
Oh, um... mm-hmm.

307
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh, good! And you can
just call me Shiori.

308
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,416
[giggles]

309
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,125
I hope you weren't
caught too off guard.

310
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,250
I know those old guys
can be pretty lively.

311
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,625
I'm used to it. I'm actually
from the country, too.

312
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, wow, this whole time
I thought you were from Tokyo!

313
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,625
The country wasn't for me.
I got out as soon as I could.

314
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,000
Why was that?

315
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,083
There's just nothing out there,
and it's so boring.

316
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,625
I didn't want to spend my
entire life out in the sticks

317
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,041
doing nothing at all.

318
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh! There's nothing
wrong with that, though!

319
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,208
No worries.

320
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,958
I mean, I totally hear
what you're saying,

321
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,125
but I really love my hometown.

322
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,666
That's why I want so badly
to be able to share it

323
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,291
with the rest of the world.

324
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,083
[SHIORI] Back in the day,
this little place

325
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,625
was used as a dorm.

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,500
Mr. Kadota said
to feel free to choose

327
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,458
whichever room you want.

328
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,083
Well, I guess that covers it,
at least for today.

329
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,166
[YOSHINO]
Thanks so much!

330
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,000
I've really appreciated
all your help.

331
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,333
Can't wait to kick things
off with you tomorrow!

332
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,166
What'd she mean,
"kick things off"?

Wait a minute.

What are you doing
in this place?

Aren't you the new queen?

[YOSHINO]
What am I--?

341
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,833
They said I should
spend the night here, so--

342
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,000
anyway, why are you here?

343
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,166
Well, I'm the... guess I'm
the manager or something.

344
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,125
Of what, though?

345
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
So you're the talent, right?

346
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,041
What, like,
a model or something?

347
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Or maybe you're a pin-up
girl that didn't sell?

348
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,500
That can't be it.

349
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
How rude!

350
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,583
I'm here because
I seriously needed the money.

351
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,583
So this is just
a one-time thing.

352
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,708
[MAKI] Oh, then,
you're just a normal student?

353
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,583
Could you please
not call me "normal"?

354
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,375
[MAKI]
So an abnormal student?

355
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,041
[YOSHINO]
What? No! I'm not!

356
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,125
Okay, so, you're normal.

357
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,125
Anyway, I'm kinda impressed
that you decided

358
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,291
to come to this
little podunk village.

359
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,666
It's not much more than
an old ghost town now.

360
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, I'm going back
as soon as I get paid.

The event I was hired for
happened earlier today.

Wait, what are
you talking about?

00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,750
You can't leave.
The job's just starting.

00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,166
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

365
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,291
No way!
Did no one tell you?

366
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,500
Yoshino Koharu,
20 years old, from Tokyo,

367
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,166
was crowned the new queen
of the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,500
One hundred and fifty people
gathered together today

to celebrate her coronation.

The new queen will take up
residence here for one year,

[HASHIMOTO] Hello, Hashimoto
with Momonga Promotions.

Listen, I thought this
job was for one day!

377
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Nobody ever said a word to me
about a year-long commitment!

378
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,791
What am I supposed to do now?

[HASHIMOTO]
Ah, Ms. Koharu!

380
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,833
I do believe those details
were in your contract.

381
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,000
My contract?

382

[YOSHINO]
Yep, there it is.

You have gotta be kidding me!

I can't stay for a year!

little late to back out now.

I'm afraid we've already
signed the contract

with the tourism board.

Look, I don't care, okay?

00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,708
How am I supposed
to live way out here

back from one company!

assume I'd given up already!

would read the contract.

freed the sword

and experienced being a hero,

then you'd surely change
your mind about things

be fun to have someone

474
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,125
my same age as the queen.

475
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,458
Working together to
liven up the town again,

476
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,333
making it all it can be.

477
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,916
So that's why.

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,083
I wanted you to stay so badly
I agreed to that silly prank.

479
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,375
I understand.

480
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,458
Thank you.

481
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,833
It selfishly makes me feel
good to have been wanted.

482
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,916
Thanks again.
Have a good night!

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,541
Okay, sleep well.

484
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,958
You've gotta be kidding!

485
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,333
Okay, then.

486
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,250
Guess I'll stay here
till morning.

487
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,666
[YOSHINO]
Lotta history.

488
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,541
What is this?

489
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,541
No way, I've really
been here before?

490
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,083
This is the place where
that memory came from!

491
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,166
[SHIORI]
Yoshi, you stayed!

492
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,208
So does this mean that
you've changed your mind?

493
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,291
Wait, no, no, that's
not what's happening!

494
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,958
It's just that it was cold,

495
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,500
and I didn't have a blanket,

496
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,875
plus I'm still waiting to
hear back on one interview--

497
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,083
[phone chiming]

498
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,250
I take that back.

499
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:23,750
[crutch clanking]

500
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,708
So have you finally
made up your mind, then?

501
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,000
No, I have not!

502
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,208
[USHIMATSU]
If you're staying,

503
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,916
your first job
is waiting for you,

504
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,291
so let's hurry up
and get you to work.

505
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,833
[SANDAL] The queen
wants to return to Tokyo.

506
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,166
But Tokyo is a little
too far away.

507
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,500
Next time: "The Gathering
of the Five Champions."
