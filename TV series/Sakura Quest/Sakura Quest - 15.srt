1
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,375
[YOSHINO]
I'm back!

2
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,291
[TAKAMIZAWA] Huh! Looks like
the queen has returned!

3
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,000
Did you have a
relaxing trip home?

4
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,500
Yeah! I really did!

5
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,625
[phone rings]

6
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,083
[YOSHINO]
Hey, Maki!

7
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,666
I just got to the station.
Where are you?

8
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,791
[MAKI] We're close to
the station, actually.

9
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,208
Are you already on the bus?

10
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,833
We're gonna get back
sooner than we thought,

11
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,291
so we could come pick you up.

12
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,083
[YOSHINO] Oh, awesome!
I would love that!

13
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,625
The bus hasn't left yet,
so I'm sure it's fine.

14
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,916
Uh, please excuse me,
Takamizawa!

15
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,666
[YOSHINO]
So, how was Tokyo?

16
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,583
[SANAE]
Oh, same as always, I guess.

17
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,166
I still can't believe how few
traffic lights there are here.

18
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,666
[MAKI]
How about you?

19
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,583
I don't even need to ask.

20
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,375
It's true,
she looks so cheerful.

21
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,125
Huh? What do you mean?
Ask me!

22
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:03,000
We can all chat about it later.

23
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,833
[SANAE]
Why are the lights on?

24
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,000
[YOSHINO] Uh...
Maybe Shiori and Riichan?

25
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,250
[SANAE] The Tourism Board
Office was closed, though.

26
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,000
[GROUP chattering]

27
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,041
[GIRLS]
Huh?

28
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:34,291
[GROUP chattering]

29
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,500
What the--?

30
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,000
Look, Yoshi and the
girls are back! Hola!

31
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:38,833
[GROUP]
Hola!

32
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,291
[GROUP speaking Spanish]

33
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,583
[MAKI]
Safe birth?

34
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,250
Hey, no worries, you guys!

35
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,041
Hola just means
hello in Spanish.

36
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,625
Our new friends are from Spain!

37
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,166
Wait, from Spain?

38
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,083
[SHIORI] I didn't know what
to make of them either at first,

39
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,916
but I promise
they're not scary!

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,541
They wanted to show
they weren't dangerous,

41
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,625
so they had these t-shirts
made for their trip,

42
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,666
but they apparently mixed up
the word for "safe"

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,125
with "safe birth,"
which is a little awkward.

44
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:04,958
[SANAE]
Oh, okay.

45
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,083
They tried to write
"safe" in kanji,

46
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,666
but they made a typo and it
converted to "safe birth."

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,125
That's an easy mistake to make.

48
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,416
These are the members
of the Cryptid Twelve.

49
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,625
What's a "cryptid"?

50
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,625
[RIRIKO] Cryptid is another word
for unidentified life form.

51
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,291
Our visitors investigate
and research

52
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,750
unidentified life forms
around the world.

53
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,583
They call themselves
"the twelve chosen ones."

54
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,208
And they learned
about it from this.

55
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,416
[USHIMATSU] They came
all the way here to see

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,333
the Chupakabura in Manoyama.

57
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,166
The only one ever seen in Japan!

58
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,041
Which only proves
that our dear old town

59
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,541
is now famous throughout
the entire world!

60
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,875
[laughing]

61
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,875
Seeing as they came
for the Chupakabura,

62
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,541
I was thrilled to welcome 'em.

63
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,375
So, I decided to
open up the palace

64
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,500
and throw them a
big party to celebrate!

65
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,333
[laughing]

66
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:49,791
[SHIBUKAWA]
This is called sushi!

67
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,916
O, sí!

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,041
Sushi es muy delicioso!

69
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,750
[KAKIMURA]
What do you like best?

70
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,625
Maguro, toro, ika,
shrimp, tamagoyaki?

71
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:01,000
Ah! Me gusta sukiyaki!

72
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,208
No, no.
Sukiyaki is not sushi!

73
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,708
The guys in the singles
group seem totally thrilled.

74
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,125
I bet they're excited
to meet some new

75
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,416
international
marriage prospects!

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,458
[YOSHINO sighs]

77
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,041
[YOSHINO sighs]

78
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,708
So tired.

79
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:20,083
How did your vacation
with your family go?

80
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,125
I'm really glad I went back.

81
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,083
I ended up getting to see
a bunch of old friends

82
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,500
while I was there,
and go to the festival!

83
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,708
Oh, what's your festival like?

84
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,958
There's a shrine
float that's shaped

85
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,375
like a big boat and they
carry it around town.

86
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,791
It's not that big of a festival,

87
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,166
but we get a good
number of people

88
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,958
from neighboring towns,
so it's still pretty lively!

89
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,916
Everyone there
is super friendly.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,208
It's kind of lovely, really.

91
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,875
You know, I don't think I've
ever heard you get so excited

92
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,500
about anything to do
with your hometown before.

93
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,041
[laughs]

94
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,250
I've always thought
I didn't like the country,

95
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,583
but I think it's
actually grown on me.

96
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,208
It's a place I can
always return to.

97
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,041
[SHIORI]
A place to return to.

98
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,333
[gasps] Except...

99
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:02,541
[YOSHINO]
Except what?

100
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,291
I was just thinking how
when your term as Queen ends,

101
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,541
chances are, you'll probably
head back home.

102
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,916
[SANAE]
What's with you guys?

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,250
Did someone die?

104
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,625
[MAKI]
I brought everyone some snacks!

105
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:19,625
Let's try 'em!

106
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,375
Oh, yummy!
I'll go make some tea!

107
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,708
Ah, I almost forgot,

108
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,291
I brought back some
gifts for you, too!

109
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,500
Yep, so did I!

110
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,250
[SANAE, MAKI]
Here! Ahh!

111
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,166
We bought the same thing!

112
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,666
[YOSHINO] I guess we're
all pretty tired.

113
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,375
Do you want me to drive
you home, Riichan?

114
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,041
I said I'd be
home late tonight.

115
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,666
[YOSHINO]
Cool! Another drink, then?

116
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,583
Place to return.

117
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,416
[RIRIKO]
What you said earlier.

118
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,666
The thing is...

119
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,708
I moved in with my
grandma when I was little,

120
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,500
and haven't left Manoyama since.

121
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,083
So I guess I didn't
know exactly

122
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,083
what you meant by that.

123
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:01,833
So you're saying
you've never felt

124
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,166
like leaving Manoyama before?

125
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,583
I've honestly never
thought about it.

126
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:08,708
If I were ever to leave,
then my grandma

127
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,041
would be all alone here.

128
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,708
She would be fine on her own
for one night, though.

129
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,916
So! Why don't you stay
here tonight?

130
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,416
You're right.
I'll text her and let her know.

131
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,666
[YOSHINO] Okay! We're back
together, and ready to work!

132
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,416
So let's start by tackling
a new problem!

133
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,791
That being said, I have
no clue what that might be,

134
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,791
and therefore
have no plan at all.

135
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,333
[laughs]

136
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, while you guys
were on vacation,

137
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,833
Mr. Kadota had us
do some research

138
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,916
on the guest lodging
problem in Manoyama.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,083
They've recently sorted out
the laws for B&amp;Bs,

140
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,041
so he wondered if
we could find a way

141
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,291
to make use of all the
empty houses in town.

142
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,958
[MAKI] The Cryptid Twelve
guys showing up is

143
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,791
a good example of why we should!

144
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,416
They're a perfect chance
to create a model case!

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,666
But we do need to be aware
of the potential issues

146
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,083
that come with B&amp;Bs.

147
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,583
What do you mean, issues?

148
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,166
Accommodating foreign
tourists can be sensitive.

149
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,375
Unlike hotels in big cities
and tourist destinations,

150
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,125
B&amp;Bs require direct
cooperation from the locals

151
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,375
in the area.

152
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,833
So there are always
potential issues

153
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,416
regarding basic
cultural differences.

154
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,666
Like with our new
friends here, for instance.

155
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,416
People felt a bit
uneasy about them

156
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,166
until they knew
exactly what the visitors

157
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,458
had come here to do.

158
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,833
It's true. Riichan and I
were a little freaked out

159
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,416
the first time they
surrounded us!

160
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,875
You know what I find funny
about this case, though?

161
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,666
Knowing what they're here for
only makes them more bizarre.

162
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,833
[MAKI]
And then there's the obvious

163
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,916
language barrier problem.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hang on. Where's Riichan?

[CRYPTIDS speaking Spanish]

[RIRIKO] The Mothman.
Mokele-mbembe.

00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:42,916

168
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:44,916
[SERGENO]
Matsudodon!

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,166
[CRYPTIDS speaking Spanish]

170
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,458
Looks like they're overcoming
the language barrier!

171
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,375
Behold the power of
the international language

of UMA!

173
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,833
I mean, there are
also some pretty good

174
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,541
translation apps out there.

175
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,375
So, maybe we should believe
in the Manoyamans a little more.

176
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,666
I'm just curious what
the Cryptids are actually doing

177
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,333
here every day.

178
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,875
Well, they're
gathering information

179
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,708
about Chupakabura sightings,

180
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,500
they're exploring the mountains,

181
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,791
and they're taking pictures
of old source material.

182
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,000
What else, partying?

183

Muy better than sushi.

[SHIBUKAWA] No, no,
sushi is numero uno!

It's the muy best!

[GROUP chattering]

192
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,666
I guess this is where
they're meeting tonight.

193
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,291
You wanna go?

194
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,000
No way!
We came all the way here.

195
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,458
I say we should eat!

'Kay, real talk,
anyone have a clue

how long the Cryptids
plan to stay here?

198
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,500
Until they find the Chupakabura.

199
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,791
If that's true, they'll
never get to go home.

200
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,250
[ANGELICA] I heard they
plan to stay until the drying.

201
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,500
[YOSHINO]
What's that?

202
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,500
Sandal was just telling
them about the drying

203
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,000
and they seemed
really interested.

204
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,291
They said they didn't want
to leave until they'd seen it.

205
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,750
[SANAE]
So, what is this "drying"?

206
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,583
[TAIRA] I would've thought that
the Tourism Board was involved.

207
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,458
The water's drained
from Sakura Pond.

208
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,791
[YOSHINO]
All of it?

209
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,208
I guess you didn't know
it's actually a reservoir.

210
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,583
So, if you open the gates...

211
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,583
That's right. They stopped
using it for irrigation

212
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,708
a long time ago, so it hasn't
been dried like that

213
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,958
for several decades now.

214
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,083
Maybe for not for about
seventy years, I'd guess?

215
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,875
Not for seventy years?

216
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,750
[NOGE] The number of black
bass have been increasing,

217
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,375
and that damages the ecosystem,

218
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,708
so this is a common way
of addressing that.

219
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,500
It's supposed to happen
tomorrow, isn't it?

220
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,083
The opening of
the gates, I mean.

221
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,791
And once they've been opened,
it should take about

222
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,708
two weeks to dry
depending on the weather.

223
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,708
[USHIMATSU] Hey, hey, hey,
what's everyone talking about?

224
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,625
[NOGE] We've just been
discussing the drying tomorrow.

225
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,500
Huh? Ah, yes, the drying!

226
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,416
Yeah, that's tomorrow, huh?

227
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
What if we find something
besides black bass

228
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,333
hanging out at the
bottom of the pond?

229
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,500
[RIRIKO]
Like the matsudodon?

230
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:49,916
Oh, I almost forgot!

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,250
Where there's a drying,
there's overnight dried squid!

232
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,458
I love how everybody's
really getting into

233
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,875
the spirit of this thing!

Overnight dried squid!
Squiddly-diddly-doo!

235

[YOSHINO]
Well, it's our first drying,

236
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,208
and I officially can't wait!

237
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,833
Me neither!

238
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,333
All right,
but it takes two weeks

239
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,583
for it to completely dry up.

240
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,000
That's going to take a while.

241
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,708
[MINO] It would've been
great if they had coordinated

242
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,166
with us on this so we
could bring in some people.

243
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,708
[YAMADA]
This is so weird.

244

It's not every day you get to
see Sakura Pond emptied out,

245
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,333
is it?

246
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,208
[SANAE]
Why hasn't it been done?

247
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,958
Mr. Kadota isn't
really keen on it,

248
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,166
at least from what I've heard.

249
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,750
That's right.

250
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,500
Normally I wouldn't be surprised
if he figured out a way to plant

251
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,791

bottom of the pond, but--

252
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,458

Shh! He'll hear you!

253
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,458
[DOKUSHIMA] The most
common thing that upsets

254
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,208
nearly every single
foreign tourist

255
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,416
who comes to Japan is the food!

256
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,458
Here's the answer:
I present the Artemis Mark One!

257
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,125
With this incredible device,

258
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,875
anyone can use
chopsticks with ease!

259
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,291
That's not all!

260
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,458
It excels at picking up things
that are normally hard

261
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,000
to get a hold of!

You mean the girl here
with the Cryptids?

269
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,250
[RIRIKO]
She has a problem.

270
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,708
A few more of her friends
are coming to town

271
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,166
to see the drying,

so she's hoping you'll help
them find a place to stay.

273
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,708
[SHIORI] I'm amazed
the drying has turned into

274
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,250
this big of a draw.

275
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,791
[RIRIKO]
The Chupakabura lives in water,

276
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,625
so they think they
may find a clue.

277
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,666
The Chupakabura
lives in the water?

278
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,958
There's a long-standing theory

279
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,083
that kappa are
actually Chupakabura.

280
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,375
What's it based on?

281
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,125
Look, can we agree
that any theory

282
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,583
that raises interest in
Manoyama is a good one?

283
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay, that's fair.

284
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,625
Who knows, this might even
end up leading to Manoyama

285
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,708
being recognized worldwide!

286
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,375
[MAKI] When do the
other members arrive?

287
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,833
[RIRIKO]
Three days.

288
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,708
[SANAE] That's not much time
but we'll do what we can!

289
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,250
Is something wrong, Yoshino?

290
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,375
I dunno. I was just wondering
whether this is what

291
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,166
the people of Manoyama
actually want.

292
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,625
Meaning, is it good
for rural rejuvenation?

293
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,041
[YOSHINO] I just don't want
to repeat the same mistakes

294
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,083
we made during
the Founding Festival.

295
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,416
No worries, listen up!

296
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
They've come all this way
to explore Manoyama,

297
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,166
so let's not overthink it!

298
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,750
Of course we should help them!

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,291
Yeah, you're right.

300
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,125
Not just for the town,
but as their Japanese hosts!

301
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,750
Plus, the lack of
lodging in this town

302
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,083
is going to present itself
as a problem over and over

303
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,291
until we address it.

304
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,291
Where have the Cryptids
been staying so far?

305
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,250
Or is this something
I don't wanna know?

306
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,833
They're staying in
one of the empty houses

307
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,375
that an owner has
registered on a B&amp;B site.

308
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,833
As it happens, that's the
only property in Manoyama

309
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,208
that's been properly
registered so far.

310
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,583
All right! Let's check out
some of the other vacant houses

311
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,875
and try to find owners
who'll let people stay!

312
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,541
I'm afraid we can't.

313
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,750
Why? What do you mean?

314
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,041
Even if you do find one,

315
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,000
you still have to apply
for an operating permit

316
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,250
and receive approval,

317
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,791
and that's gonna take
you a month, at least.

318
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,250
Are you kidding?

319
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,541
Can't you just put them up
in a regular inn or a hotel?

320
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,041
They've got places one
town over in Tomikura.

321
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,041
They said they'd really prefer
to stay in an old-style house.

322
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,291
Picky, aren't they?

323
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,083
[YAMADA] We should be
happy they like it here!

324
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,375
It's a lot better than
the alternative!

325
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,541
What if you didn't take
any money for the rent?

326
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,666
Genius!

327
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,458
If it's free, then the
hospitality industry laws

328
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,666
don't apply!

329
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,750
We have the old list
we made of empty homes.

330
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,416
We can hit them
up one at a time!

331
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,416
[ANGELICA] So, this is
the one you found, huh?

332
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,333
[YOSHINO]
Yep! It wasn't that hard.

333
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,791
[SHIORI] We're going to go
clean it up right now!

334
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,958
Oh, that works out perfectly!

335
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,541
Please put this in the entryway.

336
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,208
Why a gold shachi-hoko?

337
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:39,916
It's for the feng-shui.

338
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,291
[YOSHINO]
This house is impressive.

339
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,541
[SANAE]
Even if we have to clean it,

340
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,666
letting them stay for free
was very generous!

341
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,791
[MAKI] Well, they were
probably just maintaining it,

342
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,625
so maybe they're happy that
it gets to be used somehow.

343
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,125
[SHIORI] If this goes well,
the owners said

344
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,791
they'll think seriously
about applying

345
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,791
for registration as
an official B&amp;B!

346
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,916
Okay!

347
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,958
Let's show 'em how
well we can clean up

348
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,208
and get this place
under control!

349
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,291
[knocking]

350
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,291
[RIRIKO]
Lucia?

351
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,291
Cómo estás, Ririko?

352
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,291
I will help! Okay, yes?

353
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,833
[DOKUSHIMA]
What's on your mind?

354
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,000
Thought you gave up on
that dream a long time ago.

355
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,958
It must've fallen apart by now.

356
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,333
[USHIMATSU] It's always there
in my mind, though.

357
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,000
[YOSHINO] Good work, guys!
We did great!

358
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,666
[GROUP chattering]

359
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,500
Que bonito!

360
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,625
[LUCIA speaking Spanish]

361
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,750
Look, Ririko!

362
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,541
This is Wenbu Lake in Tibet.

363
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,541
Sharipovo village in Russia.

364
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,416
Stour River in England.

365
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,041
Oh, look!

366
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,541
This is Africa.

367
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,291
I took some pictures with
Mandinka people from Senegal.

368
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,708
[YOSHINO]
Kadota and Doku!

369
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,375
[MAKI] Wonder what
they're pondering over.

370
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:03,958
[RIRIKO]
Grandma.

371
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,541
Hmm? What is it?

372
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,333
Have you ever had a
moment when you felt like

373
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,250
you wanted to leave Manoyama?

374
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,625
I've never even
thought about it.

375
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,791
Why are you asking me
this right now?

376
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,250
I guess because I've
never thought about it, either.

377
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,791
[SERGIO]
Hola! [speaking Spanish]

378
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,791
Yoshi, did you
notice their shirts?

379
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,833
Oh, they actually
went and had them fixed!

380
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,375
[SHIORI] I think the people in
town will be a bit relieved!

381
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,041
[SERGIO speaking Spanish]

382
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,833
[GROUP chattering]

383
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,750
Shall we live there together?

384
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,166
In the big, empty casa
of my corazon?

385
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,333
Perdón?

386
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,333
Por favor, tu boda me?

387
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,500
Perdón?

388
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,083
What the hell?
Are you proposing to her?

389
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,291
Shut up! You should talk!
What the hell is that?

390
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:19,583
Don't look... at my mouth.

391
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,500
It's him.

392
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,541
[CRYPTID E]
Vale.

393
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,333
[USHIMATSU]
I'm gonna head home.

394
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,750
I'll leave the rest
of it to you.

395
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,333
[SHIORI]
See you later, Mr. Kadota!

396
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,791
[SERGIO]
Adios.

397
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,875
Oh, hey, by the way, Doku.

398
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,125
I saw you and Mr. Kadota
standing on the path

399
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,125
by the pond.

400
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,458
So?

401
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,458
You both seemed like you
were in kind of a reverie.

402
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,708
What were you talking about?

403
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,583
Oh.

404
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,750
Just two old fools
trading ghost stories.

[laughs]

406

[USHIMATSU]
Hm?

408
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,708
[gasps] No!

409
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,083
This is bad,
oh jeez, this is bad!

410
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,916
[GROUP chattering]

[CARLOS]
Todos a sus puestos!

[CRYPTIDS]
Sí, señor. Venga! Vamos!

415
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,916
[YOSHINO]
What? Where're they going?

416
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,375
No way!

417
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,875
Could it really be the
water-dwelling Chupakabura?

418
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,500
[DOKUSHIMA]
Huh?

419
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,666
[DOKUSHIMA]
No! It's Ushimatsu!

[GROUP gasps]

421
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,500
He's drowning?

422
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,500
Let's save him!

423
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,625
Outta the way!

00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,000
Look, mi amor!

425
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,916
[SANDAL] No, leave it to me,
I've got this covered!

426
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,375
We need an ambulance
at Sakura Pond right away!

427
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,875
[KINU]
I'm so sorry.

428
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,833
He's really put you girls
through a whole lot of trouble.

429
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:25,166
[YOSHINO] It's fine.
We're just so glad he's okay.

430
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,333
I wonder what
could've happened

431
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,625
to make him jump
in the pond at night.

432
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,833
Hard to say.

433
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,000
[MAKI] Maybe he was planting
Chupakabura bones or something.

434
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,208
Then he would've at least
worn a bathing suit.

435
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,458
I mean, even Mr. Kadota
isn't stupid enough

436
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,916
to jump purposefully
into the pond

437
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,208
with all his clothes on.

438
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,250
Well, then, perhaps
something inside the pond

439
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,583
pulled him down into it!

440
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,708
Don't say that!

441
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,000
[DOKUSHIMA] Just two old
fools trading ghost stories.

00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,458
[RIRIKO] Have you ever had
a moment when you felt like

444
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,416
you wanted to leave Manoyama?

[CHITOSE]
What?

448
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,958

in Sakura Pond?

[DOKUSHIMA]
Yeah.

00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,291
The thing from fifty
years ago is back.

451
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,541
[CHITOSE] You called just to
tell me about that nonsense?

452
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,583
You called me at
this hour for that?

453
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,958
That thing...

454
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,958
I can't reveal that thing's
existence to everyone!

455
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,125
I can't do it!

456
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,541
I can't!

457
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,375
[SANDAL] I thought I'd be so
concerned about the secret

458
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,833
in Sakura Pond that I
wouldn't be able to sleep,

slept really well.
