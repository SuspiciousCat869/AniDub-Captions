Feels like I lost a bet.

Why? It's a parade to introduce
you as the new queen!

At this rate, you should
just put me in the stocks!

Oh, don't be silly, Yoshi.

00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,875
What's the point of
putting you in the stocks

That's a bit of
an understatement.

Nope, he's my brother, Kosuke.

Thanks for looking after my sis.

Anyway, I don't think
there's much else to say.

So, are you the new queen?

The one they brought
in from Tokyo?

Um, yeah, I am.

Well, good luck with that.

I hope that you can bring
a little life to this place.

Oh, yeah, thank you.
Same to you.

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,416
[SHIORI] So you're pretty
resolved not to move back home,

[MAKI]
Yeah, not for a while, anyway.

38
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,541
I think I get that.

39
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,291
Hard to believe
it was so lively in here

40
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,875
a few days ago.

41
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,541
Well, Sanae's got her own work,

42
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,791
so I guess that's
just the way it goes.

43
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,583
Hey, if you're a little
lonely here on your own,

44
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,041
I could always move in with you.

45
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,166
Seriously?

It's here!

47

What? Not more manju.

48
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,833
[YOSHINO] No.
It's all my stuff from Tokyo.

49
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,208
I kept bugging my manager
until he finally sent it.

50
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,875
So I guess you've
made up your mind, then.

51
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,291
I'll go ahead and
give it a shot,

52
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,416
for now, anyway.

53
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,125
At least it's not boring.

54
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,791
And there are worse
things than being paid

55
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,625
to be a queen, wouldn't you say?

56
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:51,500
I kinda doubt it'll be
quite as easy as you think.

to be nervous about!

Oh, I see.

So, the Head of
the Tourism Board

67
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,500
mistook you for the
old star, Yoshino Tsubaki,

68
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,500
and that's what brought
you to Manoyama.

69
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,666
Right!

70
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,333
But even starting as a mistake,

71
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,625
I'm going to stay and
give it my very best shot!

72

that you're also entering

Kingdom of Chupakabura thing!

Yes! I honestly had no clue
what it was about at first,

79
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,708
but after looking into it a bit,
I found it really interesting.

80
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,125
It's basically one of the old
mini independent states,

81

for it and everything,

the 457th year of the Chupa--

[KUME] Right, right,
I think we're all familiar

with the backstory.

Now, there've been great
efforts to reinvigorate

Surely you are aware
that very few of them

have succeeded.

92
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,666
That's the big issue
you've committed to tackle

your thoughts on any changes

you'd like to make to the town?

not in the script!

the next quesion, then!

What are some of your favorite
things about Manoyama?

Umm... I would say
the beautiful scenery?

Do you have a
particular favorite?

106
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,958
Umm, I guess maybe the manju?

107
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,458
[KUME] So what made you
decide to continue as queen?

108
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,041
If it was a mistake,
you could have refused, right?

109

impressed by this company's--

growth and its company culture?

No, no worries at all, Yoshi!

to believe my own press,

little about the town?

What's the best thing
about Manoyama?

not the wrestling.

00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,333
Aw, just got a
few reports saying

162
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,625
some strange-looking girl
has been wandering around

163
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,125
blathering some
nonsense about how

164
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:07,041
she was going to "go home."

165
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,583
Well, ouch, that hurts.

166
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,875
To be fair, though,
a lot of people

167
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,208
haven't met you yet.

168
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,333
I mean, I know Ushimatsu
has been working

169
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,625
really hard on this,
but to tell the absolute truth,

170
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
most people couldn't
care less about

171
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,625
bringing change to this town.

172
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,583
And why do you think
that is, exactly?

173
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,083
[NOGE] The thing is,
we've been getting along okay.

174
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,791
The town's been surviving
for a while now

175
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,833
with hardly any tourists at all.

176
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,125
Although, the future's
not bright or anything.

177
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,916
It's not like many kids
are born here.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,541
But I doubt I'll still
be running this store

179
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,250
when it gets to be a problem.

180
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,291
So, no point fighting it,
you know?

181
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,666
Seriously?

182
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,708
[NOGE] Yeah, that's basically
how I feel about it.

183
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,583
I'd be surprised if most
didn't feel the same.

184
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,000
You might also
check in with the head

185
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,583
of the Board of
Merchants, though.

186
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,208
Board of Merchants?

187
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:53,125
Rii- <i>chan</i> 's grandma is
actually the head of that board.

188
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:56,041
but she doesn't get along
with Mr. Kadota, remember?

189
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,583
Well I'm going over there.

190
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,708
Yoshi, wait!

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,125
What do you want, Queen?
I don't have all day.

192
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,125
We just came by to say hello.

193

195
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,166
We can't come back yesterday!

196
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,916
Please, can't we talk to you?

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,541
[SHIORI] Come on, Yoshi, we'll
try another time, Thank you!

198
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,125
Hey! Working hard today,
huh, Queen?

199
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,583
[YOSHINO] Mr. Takamizawa,
isn't that right?

200
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,583
You're the bus driver
I met before.

201
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,500
Yep, that's me.

202
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,166
I might not look it anymore, but
I used to be a prince, you know.

203
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,791
What do you mean, a prince?

204
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,708
Oh, my gosh!

205
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,208
What is it?

206
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,916
Oh, it's nothing.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,041
Suddenly, I feel about a
bazillion years old, that's all.

208
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,208
[ERIKA] It's not gonna
matter what you do, Queen.

209
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,375
This is a crappy old
town way beyond saving.

210
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,750
Give it up.

211
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,458
Hey.

212
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,000
Apologize, Erika.

213
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,125
[ERIKA]
No!

214
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,166
I called it crappy
because it's crappy!

215
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,208
[TAKAMIZAWA sighs]

216
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,375
Welp, don't let
her discourage you.

217
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,125
You know the old saying, right?

218
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,041
Changemakers are the youth,
fools, and outsiders.

219
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,291
The funny thing is, Ushimatsu
used to be a young fool

220
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:21,125
long ago, but he definitely
wasn't ever an outsider.

221
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,333
[MAKI] Seems you're pretty
much the ideal candidate.

222
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,125
Just a youthful,
foolish outsider.

223
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,666
[YOSHINO]
Sanae is, too, then!

224
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,166
That doesn't work
because I'm not a fool.

225
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,875
I guess you must've
missed us pretty bad.

226
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,291
Couldn't stay away?

227
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,708
[SANAE] I'm just taking refuge
while the exterminators

228
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,666
clear my house.

229
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,833
Isn't it weird?

230
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,083
How it used to be
the Kingdom of Kabura?

231
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,125
Yeah, it is weird!

232
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,750
I just heard about that today.

233
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,958
[TAKAMIZAWA] The reason was
that <i>kabura</i> are Manoyama's

234
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,375
only real specialty.

235
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:52,916
<i>Kabura</i> ? We call them <i>kabu</i> .

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,416
[SHIORI] Yeah, around here,
people call them <i>kabura</i> .

237
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:59,833
It was back before I had even
started elementary school.

238
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,041
They used rural
stimulation funds to create

239
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,791
the Kingdom of <i>kabura</i> .

240
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,166
But it didn't last very long.

241
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,416
That was when Ushimatsu had
that big idea of his own.

242
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,666
"The ones that can
change our city are the youth,

243
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,000
outsiders, fools, and of
course, the monsters!"

244
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,375
And so, they decided
to hop on the UMA bandwagon,

245
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,583
changing the kingdom's name from
<i>kabura</i> to Chupakabura.

246
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,000
That's nuts!

247
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,083
The Board of Merchants
was completely against the idea

248
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,333
from the very beginning.

249
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,458
Well, I would be, too,
because I'm not nuts.

250
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,333
I've got it!

251
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,375
Got what?

252
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,750
It's <i>kabura</i> !

253
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,833
Everyone in Manoyama really
loves the stuff, right?

254
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,666
So <i>kabura</i> must be the secret
to changing the town!

255
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,083
[WOMAN 3A]
You want to observe the farming?

256
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,833
We harvest the <i>kabura</i> in winter.

257
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,041
So I'm afraid there's
not much to do now.

258
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,583
Well, maybe you
could just tell me why

259
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,000
you're so passionate
about <i>kabura</i> .

260
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,875
Oh, I wouldn't say
that I'm passionate.

If you use the
Kabura Kid costume

320
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,333
instead of the Chupakabura,
that would solve your problem.

Oh, my gosh, that's right!
There's a costume

00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,083
from when we were
the Kingdom of Kabura!

323

That old man destroyed
the Kingdom of Kabura

by himself, and now
he's going to be saved

325
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,416

Years ago, in Manoyama,

00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,208
the Kabura Kid was chosen
as the town's mascot.

424
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,333
Kabura was an obvious choice,

425
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,625
because Manoyama has a history
of growing quality <i>kabura</i> .

But unfortunately,

427
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,625
Kabura Kid was never very
beloved by the town folk.

428

Something had to be done,
and UMAs were very popular,

429

so they made their next
mascot the Chupakabura.

430

they really hoped

that people would
take to it this time.

00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:42,500
[GIRLS laugh]

473
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,958
So do you not
drink, Rii- <i>chan</i> ,

474
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,333
or just not tonight?

475
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,166
I'm not a fan of alcohol.

476
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,375
[SANAE]
Why the heck not?

477
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:49,750
It's so tasty!

478
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,958
[MAKI] You really just want
to get drunk, don't you?

479
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,250
[USHIMATSU] I take it you've
decided to commit to being Queen

480
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,583
for the next year,
after all, eh?

481
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,625
Yes.

482
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,083
But there's something
I've been thinking about.

483
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,708
I have one condition!

484
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,541
Hm? What's that?

485
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,333
I want to work
with these four.

486
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,791
What do you think?

487
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,250
If you guys are with me,

488
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,375
I feel like I have a real shot
at doing some good.

489
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,750
I mean, I really need your help.

490
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:31,083
Dear Shiori, and Sanae,
and Maki, and Ririko,

491
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,125
would you be willing
to work alongside me,

492
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,708
your new queen?

493
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,708
So, what, is this
a royal command?

494
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,375
It depends on the salary.

495
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,500
You'll do it,
won't you, Rii- <i>chan</i> ?

496
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,625
[RIRIKO]
Mm-hmm.

497
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
So?

498
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,791
All right.

499
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,500
Guess we have the
budget for it, Queen.

500
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,916
Sir, you won't regret it!

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,375
Sanae can be
the Minister of IT!

502
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,250
And Rii- <i>chan</i> 's
the uma Minister!

503
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,625
[RIRIKO]
It's U.M.A, not "uma."

504
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,083
Will you be Chief Handywoman?

505
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,458
[MAKI]
The hell is that?

506
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,083
How 'bout Minister of Oden?

507
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,125
I'm gonna kill you.

508
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,166
[YOSHINO laughing]

509
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,541
[SANAE]
What? It's perfect!

510
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,958
What's up, Minister of Oden?

511
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,750
[MAKI] Seriously, I'm over
hearing about Oden!

512
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,750
[SANDAL] The ministers
have finally been chosen.

513
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,333
So the queen won't
be lonely anymore.

514
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,791
Next time: "The Lone Alchemist."
