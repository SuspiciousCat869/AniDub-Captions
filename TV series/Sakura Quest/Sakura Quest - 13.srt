321
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,750
so the town should still
be bustling for a while!

322
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,625
Hey! We're having an after
party a little bit later.

323
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,750
You're all welcome to come!

324
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,750
Heh. I'll pass, thank you.

325
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,916
Oh, right, okay.

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,833
Well, I suppose they deserve
a night to let go a bit.

327
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,333
[USHIMATSU]
Great work, everyone!

328
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,833
Very good job!

329
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,666
Another successful Founding
Festival in the books!

330
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,041
Come on! Now it's your turn
to say something, Queen.

331
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,541
Uh... Sure.

332
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,916
I mean, I know we came
up short in a few places,

333
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,708
so there's room for improvement,
but I believe, overall,

334
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,708
it turned out to be a
pretty successful event.

335
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,916
Are you nuts?!

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,583
We got 6,000 people
to visit the Kingdom!

337
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,916
So, we fulfilled our yearly
visitor goal in one single day!

338
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,916
It was an enormous success!

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,833
Oh. Great!

340
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,916
All right, tonight we drink!

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,083
To us!

342
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,833
[ALL]
To us!

343
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:49,375
[ALL chattering, laughing]

344
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:55,333
[birds chirping]

345
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,958
[yawns]

346
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,875
I'm so hung over.

347
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,208
[SHIORI]
It's hard to believe

348
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,375
there were so many people
here yesterday, huh?

349
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,666
[SANAE] That's how it
is after a festival.

350
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,625
Next weekend it
what really counts.

351
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:39,208
[MAKI] Yeah, the coupons will
probably have a delayed effect.

352
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,291
You're right.

353
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,125
Amamiya was talking
about it, too.

354
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:47,125
Honestly, just you wait
until we finally air it.

355
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,666
The TV program is
still on its way.

356
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,750
That could be a huge deal.

357
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,291
[SANAE]
Oh, oh! It's starting!

358
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,708
[music plays]

359
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,708
[VOICEOVER] Come with us
tonight as we follow five girls

360
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,458
who are fighting together
to revive a rural town.

361
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,791
What kind of miracle
is in store for them?

362
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,541
[SAYURI shrieks]
Shiori's on TV!

363
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,541
Wow, this is incredible, Shiori!

364
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,916
[laughs]

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,166
[VOICEOVER] The city of
Manoyama, Population 50,000.

366
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,041
The center of town is
full of shuttered shops.

367
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:18,500
This place, which grew around a
temple, has lost its vibrancy.

368
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,375
What refreshments will be made
available to our dear guests?

369
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,458
Oh, that's indubitably
too big a job for--

370
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:25,333
What was that?!

371
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,708
Did you say "indubitably?"

372
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,000
[SHIORI] They didn't have
to put that in there...

373
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,166
No worries, it was cute, relax!

374
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,166
[VOICEOVER]
This town needs saving,

375
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,750
and these five lovely young
ladies have risen to the task.

376
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,583
Yet, each of them is still
dealing with her own problems.

377
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,583
Manoyama is a town
that's fading fast.

378
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,041
But these girls have
a secret plan.

379
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,666
Ptolemaios. A rock band that's
popular with twenty-somethings

380
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,791
and currently
topping the charts.

381
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,333
Uh! It's so great to meet you!

382
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:58,708
I'm the Queen of the Kingdom of
Chupakabura, Yoshino Koharu!

383
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:02,291
[VOICEOVER] Watch as these
girls bring this town to life.

384
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,041
Their passion truly
created a miracle.

385
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:06,875
[ALL]
Uh?

386
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,458
What's he talking about?

387
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:11,333
It makes it seem as though we
were the ones who invited them.

388
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,041
[ANGELICA]
Oh, is that true?

389
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,041
[TAKAMIZAWA] It's just a teeny
bopper reality show.

390
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,833
Hey, can I use this?

391
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:18,916
Congrats, you.

392
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,791
That's the first one
we've seen yet.

393
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,500
No way! Are you serious?

394
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,750
Sadly, yes.

395
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,250
So, how are any of us profiting?

396
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,583
They haven't even
shown me once yet.

397
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,500
This is B.S.

398
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:37,083
[music plays]

399
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,541
[SANAE]
Hey, hold on a second!

400
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,083
We didn't even go
to the concert!

401
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,833
How the heck did they do that?

402
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,708
That's the power of editing.

403
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,500
[AMAMIYA]
Can you tell me, honestly,

404
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,750
what effect your efforts
at rural rejuvenation

405
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,583
have had on the town so far?

406
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,333
Well, I-- Nope!

407
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,833
You'll have to see
at the festival!

408
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:58,083
[VOICEOVER] The Revival Gal's
fight has only just begun.

409
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,583
They didn't show a single
second of the trivia contest.

410
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,875
[YOSHINO]
This isn't right.

411
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:13,041
Ah... Trust me, we'll bring
in more viewers this way.

412
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,666
Honestly...

413
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,583
[USHIMATSU]
What's wrong with ya?

414
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,458
Come on!

415
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,166
The show had a ton of viewers,

416
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,625
and you all look like you're
headed to a funeral!

417
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:22,625
He's right!

418
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,208
Manoyama should be
well-known, now.

419
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,666
The "Mountain Movers"
effect is massive!

420
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,250
At least according to some
other municipal governments.

421
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,500
They did kinda dump on
us a bit, though.

422
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,791
Come on, no one will
be interested in Manoyama

423
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,958
after seeing that. All they
really saw was a live concert

424
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,666
they could've seen anywhere.

425
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,791
The real problem is with the
Manoyama coupons, though.

426
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,250
We handed out over 1,000
of them, and so far,

427
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,291
less than 20 have
even been used.

428
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,750
[YAMADA]
That's it?!

429
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,041
I wonder how many of those
were actually used by people

430
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,875
who made the trip back
out here again.

431
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,541
[YOSHINO]
Is this...?

432
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,916
Is this what we really wanted?

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,916
What are you talking
about, Queen?!

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,291
Yes, of course it is!

435
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,166
I don't think any of this
is actually helping

436
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,375
the people who live here at all.

437
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,333
The town hasn't changed.

438
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,333
Look around.

439
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,000
Reviving the town
isn't just about

440
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,541
getting people to come here.

441
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:15,166
We should've learned
at least that by now.

442
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,875
We got so swept up and
excited about Ptolemaios

443
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,583
and the whole "Moving
Mountains" thing.

444
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:26,833
I don't think I've done any real
good here the last six months.

445
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,833
[SHIORI]
Yoshi...

446
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,375
Hey there, Queen!

447
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,083
Where're you headed?

448
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,916
[YOSHINO]
To the station.

449
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,583
Okay.

450
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,750
[SANDAL] Mr. Kindaichi
said he couldn't go to Guam

451
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,666
because he was
too busy with work.

452
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,291
So, anyone else want
to come with me?

453
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,416
Next time:
"The Queen, Convicted"
