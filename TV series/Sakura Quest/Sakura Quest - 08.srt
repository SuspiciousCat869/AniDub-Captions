1
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,250
Oh, hey, I'm sorry!

2
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,958
I totally thought you guys
were only coming to watch today.

3
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,791
[YOSHINO] Mm-mm. It's okay.
We didn't tell you.

4
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,250
Our sun protection efforts
were all for naught, then.

5
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,000
[SANAE] Aw, I was looking
forward to getting down in it.

6
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,625
I guess I didn't realize
agriculture was automated.

7
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,000
[MAKI]
Why are you such a grandma?

8
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,500
What are you wearing?

9
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,041
[SANAE] I don't wanna get
bitten up by bugs, all right!

10
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,416
I'm sure most people assume
agriculture involves

11
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
heavy labor, but this is
what it's actually like.

12
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,000
Thanks so much for coming out
to see us, everyone.

13
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,166
Sure!

14
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,083
And since we're here,
is there anything

15
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,583
we can do to help you out today?

16
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,000
[TAKAYUKI]
Yeah!

17
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,666
We could have you guys cut
the corners of the field!

18
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,666
--[YOSHINO] 'Kay!
--[MAKI] Cool!

19
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,000
[RIRIKO]
Mission accepted.

20
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,875
Woah. Wait a minute,
if your mom and dad are both

21
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,041
right here, then, who's driving?

22
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,375
Oh, look at that.

23
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,916
Are they shooting another movie?

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,875
No, these are my
friends from work!

25
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,166
It's Yoshi, the Queen,
and her ministers!

26
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,958
Ah. The ones you
always talk about!

27
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,833
It's great to finally meet after
hearing so much about you!

28
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,791
I'm the big sis, Sayuri!

29
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,916
That's so cool!

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,083
So, you're actually
a nurse, then, Sayuri?

31
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,541
You know the big
general hospital

32
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,875
the next town over?
She's in pediatrics.

33
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,041
Wow! That must keep
you pretty busy.

34
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,708
Yeah, my schedule's
always changing

35
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,958
and it's pretty crazy.

36
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,875
But I love working
with children!

37
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,708
Come on, you need to eat up!

38
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,250
We've got to get some color
back into those cheeks!

39
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,958
Thanks, there never was any.

40
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,375
Your family's food
is so yummy, Shiori!

41
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,875
You gotta brother I could marry?

42
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,875
I know, right?

43
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,333
I don't really get it.

44
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,500
I mean, these are just
regular <i>somen</i> noodles!

45
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,708
[SANAE]
It's unique, though!

46
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,166
You put <i>menma</i> on it!

47
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,916
Huh? Who doesn't put
<i>menma</i> on <i>somen</i> ?

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,666
Don't laugh, she says silly
things like that sometimes.

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,583
Attack of the airheaded sisters.

50
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:28,666
[SHIORI]
Hey, I'm not an airhead!

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,833
My hand's up.
Queen, may I speak?

52
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,666
What is it, dear Minister of IT?

53
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,916
Just a thought.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,583
Why don't we have Shiori
lead the C-Rank Gourmet?

55
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,458
[MAKI]
Seconded.

56
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,458
[gasps] No way, I can't do that!

57
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:41,375
I can't be the
leader of anything!

58
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,666
Wait, what is C-rank Gourmet?

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,041
We're creating an exclusive,
signature dish for the

60
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,583
kingdom of Chupakabura!

61
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,166
We're hoping people will travel
to Manoyama just to eat it!

62
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,791
That's a fun project!

63
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,416
We had something
like that in the town

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,291
about ten years back, didn't we?

65
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,500
The, uh, Manoyama Burger?

66
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,541
That's it.

67
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,250
Oh, you mean
that weird hamburger

68
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,041
with the pickled
<i>Kabura</i> on it, right?

69
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,166
It was a flop-and-
a-half, of course.

70
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,500
Who came up with
that idea, anyway?

71
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah, I'm pretty
sure we know who.

72
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,625
We know exactly who.

73
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,833
Yes, this is just
what I ordered.

74
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,458
You did a great job.

75
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,500
Thanks, I'm glad
you're pleased, sir.

76
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:19,958
[MINO]
Chupakabura Manju Deluxe?

77
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,083
[USHIMATSU] Yeah, I decided
I would update our <i>manju</i>

78
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:25,583
for the Queen's new
C-Rank Gourmet project.

79
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,041
I can't believe you went and did
something like that again.

80
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,750
The Board of Merchants
isn't gonna like it.

81
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,500
Well, they can't get mad
if it increases tourism.

82
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,750
Plus, I got it
done on the cheap!

83
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,541
First, Chef Kouzuki!

84
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,541
Indeed!

85
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,083
[YOSHINO]
What is that, chef?

86
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:45,375
I call it "A Cup
of Flying Noodles."

87
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:47,541
The plating portrays
a delightful encounter

88
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,833
between ramen and chicken wings!

89
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,375
So it's supermarket
chicken wings

90
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,958
in a cup of instant ramen.
Please step down, chef.

91
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,375
Fair.

92
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,500
[YOSHINO]
And, next!

93
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:01,041
Chef Oribe! Explain your dish.

94
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,458
It's a Garden
Caterpillar Pastry.

95
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,833
We should avoid making
bug-themed food if we can.

96
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,166
Plus, it looks like it has
cream coming out of its butt.

97
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,708
That's what I like about it.

98
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,166
[YOSHINO] Please step down.
Next, Chef Midorikawa!

99
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,166
I kinda went for
quantity over quality.

100
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,833
It's the Mega Tempura Sandwich.

101
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,708
That's something a student
might come up with.

102
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,875
It's too thrown-together.

103
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,416
Hold on. You're one
to talk, Ms. Queen.

104
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,458
What the hell is that?

105
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,833
[YOSHINO] Croquette Peanut
Butter Curry Yakisoba!

106
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,541
Cropeacur Yakisoba,
for short! It's really good!

107
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,500
[MAKI]
It's a big brown pile!

108
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,416
[SANAE] I guess we can't just
throw things together, huh?

109
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,541
That's true.

110
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,750
More importantly,
none of your dishes

111
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,416
have anything to
do with Manoyama.

112
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,083
And where's the dish you
made, Chef Shinomiya?

113
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,541
Chicken with <i>ankake</i>
sauce and <i>kabura</i> !

114
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,291
[ALL]
Boring.

115
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,666
Really? But I don't think so.

116
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,041
[SANAE] Okay, but seriously,
this stuff is pretty good.

117
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,833
Look, the "C" in C-Rank Gourmet
stands for "champion."

118
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,708
It's got to have real
impact if it's gonna be

119
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,166
Manoyama's special dish!

120
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,541
Well, why don't we bring

121
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,375
some of the local restaurants
in on the project?

122
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,833
I think we're all
a little too biased

123
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,750
to be working on it alone.

124
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,208
That's a good idea.

125
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,416
[SANAE] I still think you
should head this up, Shiori.

126
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,791
Yeah, if we leave it
up to the Queen,

127
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,583
we'll probably end up
with food poisoning.

128
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,625
I'm right here!

129
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,208
I prefer staying out
of the spotlight

130
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,625
and supporting other people.

131
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,291
I have no desire to be out
in front, taking the lead.

132
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,416
Neither do I.

133
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Scary right?

134
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,000
The thought of
taking responsibility

135
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,291
if everything fails
is so overwhelming.

136
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,666
Thanks for your
faith in the project.

137
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,458
So, you're finally back home?

138
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,708
[CHIKAKO] It's been a while
since the whole family

139
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,375
went out to eat together.

140
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,000
Isn't this place expensive?

141
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,416
Don't worry about it,
I just got my summer bonus.

142
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,625
I want everyone to order
whatever they want!

143
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,583
It's pretty surreal
to hear those words

144
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,208
coming out of my
firstborn's mouth!

145
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,291
[SAYURI] Well, it isn't
exactly The Last Supper,

146
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,125
but I wanted to go
somewhere with everyone

147
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,041
before I moved out.

148
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:10,958
[sobs]

149
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,041
Come on, honey.

150
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,791
The girls have to
grow up sometime!

151
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,416
I bet work would be kinda tough

152
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,625
if you didn't live
close to the hospital.

153
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,875
Hey, now.

154
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,333
Don't you start saying
you're going to miss me

155
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,375
or I'm gonna lose it.

156
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,875
[SHIORI]
Of course I will!

157
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,750
But, for now, let's just enjoy
a delicious meal together!

158
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,416
Which one of these is snails?

159
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,583
If you want snails,
there are plenty outside.

160
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,833
And they're free.

161
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,416
[YOSHINO] Hm, I don't know,
can you make the date

162
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,416
jump out a bit more? So it
stands out as you go past?

163
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,416
Yeah, no prob.

164
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,166
Burning the midnight
oil, are we?

165
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,416
Yep, there's a lot
riding on this plan.

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,083
But I know we can pull it off.

167
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,083
We'll attract tons of tourists
and make the merchants happy!

168
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,500
[CHITOSE sighs]
What a long day.

169
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,875
Welcome home, Grandma.

170
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,583
Well, well, this is
a rare sight!

171
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,166
Are you actually making
us some dinner?

172
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,708
That's very kind of you, Ririko.

173
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,250
[RIRIKO]
You're back late.

174
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,875
[CHITOSE] I'm getting ready for
the annual summer festival.

175
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,375
It's usually very profitable
for the Board of Merchants.

176
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,708
We've gotta get our
product out there, too.

177
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,208
[CHITOSE]
Let me try a little.

178
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,583
How 'bout we order
some take-out?

179
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,041
[RIRIKO]
Mm-hm.

180
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,125
[TAKAYUKI] How're things on
the dating front, Shiori?

181
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,791
Aren't there any
nice guys at work?

182
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,375
[SHIORI]
Are you kidding? No way!

183
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,000
I like the idea of marrying
a civil servant, though,

184
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,875
and he could also help us out
in the fields on his days off!

185
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,375
Not to mention, he's stylish
and good-looking, right?

186
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, if he was, I
certainly wouldn't complain!

187
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,125
Good thing you haven't set
your standards too high.

188
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,333
Oh, sure, there are tons
of guys like that around!

189
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,583
[ALL laugh]

190
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:44,916
You're a good girl, Shiori.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,416
[NAKAYAMA]
Here you are.

192
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,916
Roast boar with balsamic
sauce and <i>myoga</i> ginger.

193
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,458
Delicious!

194
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,208
And the meat is so tender!

195
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,541
That glass shrimp and
chilled <i>kabura</i> potage

196
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,000
was incredibly tasty, too!

197
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,333
This would be great
for the C-rank Gourmet!

198
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,875
Cool idea!

199
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,958
I imagine this place uses lots
of local ingredients, right?

200
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,166
Yes!

201
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,333
In this dish, both the
boar and the ginger

202
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
are locally sourced.

203
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,750
Oh, my gosh,
it could really work.

204
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,250
[KUMANO]
My apologies!

205
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,291
This asparagus was supposed
to go along with that dish!

206
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,875
Uh, pardon me,
I'm the chef, Kumano.

207
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,458
[GANJURO] So you're the
one running this place?

208
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,875
Not bad for a young kid!

209
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,833
Oh, yes, it's my place now,
thank you very much.

210
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,166
Hey, long time, no see, Kumano.

211
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,833
[gasps] Shinomiya?

212
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,958
You guys friends?

213
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,916
We were classmates
in high school.

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,125
You went off to train in France
right after we graduated, yeah?

215
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,291
That's right!

216
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,500
This used to be a
noodle shop, didn't it?

217
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,625
Yes, this is my family's.

218
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,000
My father's unfortunately
not in good health,

219
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,208
so he let me come
and take over here.

220
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,000
I had no idea you
were back home now.

221
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,208
I'm a little late
on this, but congrats!

222
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,500
Thanks a lot.

223
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,208
[SAYURI]
Your dream came true, huh?

224
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,541
Yeah.

225
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,125
[CHIYO] Mr. Kumano,
are you a single gentleman?

226
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:00,083
[KUMANO]
Hm? Oh, uh, yes, I am.

227
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,666
We have two granddaughters!

228
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,291
Take your pick! Really!

229
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,375
Granny, stop!

230
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,333
What the heck are
you talking about?

231
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,708
Uh...

232
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:10,708
You're kind.

233
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,958
But I'm afraid they
would be wasted on me.

234
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,083
I don't know about that.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,500
[yelps]

236
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,333
Seriously, how am I
supposed to catch a fish

237
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,583
with my bare hands?

238
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,125
Shiori said it's very
important that we use

239
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,541
ingredients that are in season!

240
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,041
I never said we had to get them
straight from the river!

241
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,125
[yelps]

242
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,041
And I used to work
at an eel restaurant.

243
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,916
There's a bear right over there.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,625
--Huh?!
--[SHIORI] What?

245
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,791
Mister Kumano?

246
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,041
[gasps]

247
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,916
This is so good!

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,458
Isn't it though?

249
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:59,500
Just a bit of salt and a big
ol' bite. It really is the best!

250
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,125
It's funny to hear that
coming from a French chef!

251
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,916
I never would've imagined
there were so many

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,666
cool things about Manoyama!

253
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,875
[KUMANO]
Yeah.

254
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
In my opinion, it's
chock-full of treasures.

255
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,541
I couldn't agree more!

256
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,375
Manoyama's full
of hidden riches!

257
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:15,208
I still think we need something
with a pretty dramatic impact

258
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,833
to express that to people
who don't already know it.

259
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,333
So, you wanna use food
to revive the town.

260
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,666
What if I made a list of
all the seasonal ingredients

261
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,666
that I use from Manoyama
and sent it to you,

262
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,375
would that help?

263
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,458
Oh, would you, really?

264
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,083
Sure, that's easy.

265
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:31,333
Ingredients by the season...
That gives me an idea.

266
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,916
What if we have the
C-Rank Gourmet dish

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,208
change with seasons?

268
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,625
Wow, you're past your
instant ramen phase.

269
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,416
Whatever, Miss Sandwich!

270
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,875
Wait a minute, maybe you
and I should team up!

271
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,250
We'd put things together that
nobody else would think of!

272
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,791
I love it!

273
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,500
I have a feeling we're gonna
make the Queen eat her words!

274
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,833
Yeah, well, we'll
see about that!

275
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,708
I can't get over the fact
that you went to France

276
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:53,916
right after high school.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,916
That's so cool and
incredibly brave!

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,250
I didn't really think
about it. I just kinda left.

279
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,125
What was my sister like
back when you guys

280
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,750
went to school together?

281
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,666
Ah. Oh, well,
she was really cute.

282
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,416
And she was smart
and friendly, too.

283
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,625
She was quite popular back then.

284
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:10,875
Huh.

285
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,583
Whereas, I was always
a pretty average guy,

286
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,666
so it was difficult
to get to know her.

287
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,208
Don't be so silly,
that can't be true!

288
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,375
[SANAE] Those two are
getting along pretty well.

289
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,750
Shiori, irresistible
to older men.

290
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,750
Oh, come on.

291
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,625
But look at him,
he's so into her!

292
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,000
[MAKI]
Maybe she's not an airhead.

293
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,750
[RIRIKO]
No, no, she's not dumb at all.

294
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,500
Shii- <i>chan</i> knows
what she's doing.

295
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,375
Would you stop?
She can hear you!

296
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:33,875
I see.

297
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,041
I actually kind of assumed
that you two must have dated.

298
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,291
Wha--?

299
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, you guys were
definitely acting weird

300
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,000
at the restaurant.

301
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,791
Oh, gosh, no. No way!

302
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,625
If we had been, I would
never have left her

303
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:44,791
and gone to France.

304
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,333
But, anyway, none of
this matters because

305
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,375
she never showed up.

306
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,541
Never showed up where?

307
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,458
I'm not coming up with
any dishes at all.

308
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,458
Tell me something,
is it just me or do people

309
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,500
seem to eat <i>somen</i> a lot here?

310
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,125
It's a local thing.

311
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,833
Then why isn't it on
this list from Mr. Bear?

312
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,375
My guess is that they don't
use it in French food.

313
00:13:06,458 --> 00:13:08,125
Yeah, that makes sense.

314
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,375
So, hey, what do you think?

315
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,375
You think those two will
end up going out at all?

316
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,250
You mean Mr. Bear and Shiori?

317
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,125
I do think they'd
make a good couple.

318
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,916
Wish we could talk
about our love lives,

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,458
but that's a short conversation.

320
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,750
[MAKI]
Right?

321
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,916
I fear we've missed the
mark, yet again, chefs.

322
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,125
Tropical Shish-kebab?
Frozen Fried Rice?

323
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,083
Defeated-Samurai <i>Manju</i> ?

324
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,250
Where are the local ingredients?

325
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:37,125
Did you guys even
refer to Kumano's list?

326
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,375
Let's showcase
Manoyama's products!

327
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,291
If the people in
Manoyama won't accept it,

328
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,708
I don't think it'll
ever catch on!

329
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,083
So what did you make?

330
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,791
I made a pumpkin <i>ohagi</i> .

331
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,333
I featured both
rice and pumpkins

332
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,708
that are grown in Manoyama.

333
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,583
You can't tell that
by looking at it.

334
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:53,833
Yeah, it's pretty boring.

335
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,625
You guys keep telling me that.

336
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,291
So I guess I don't
have much of a sense

337
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,166
of what's boring and what isn't.

338
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,500
But out of all of us,

339
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,875
there's no question you're
by far the best cook.

340
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,708
So, I still think you
should lead the project.

341
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,083
I'm so sorry, but I really
don't think I can do it.

342
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:10,875
Awkward.

343
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,458
Anyone have a clue
what to do next?

344
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,208
Well, I see, then.

345
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,916
Sounds like that chef
took you seriously.

346
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,416
[SHIORI]
I'm home!

347
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,125
Welcome back.

348
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,708
Oh, thanks. Hi, Dad.

349
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,250
Something wrong?

350
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:36,625
No. Why don't we go for
a little walk, though?

351
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,666
Heh, heh.

352
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,708
[SHIORI] Wow, it's been a
long time since we've just

353
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,166
taken a walk together,
hasn't it?

354
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,916
[TAKAYUKI] Yeah, too long.
So, kiddo, is there a guy?

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,250
Huh?

356
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,875
I want you to know that
I've got no problem at all

357
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:54,666
with that young man.

358
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,416
[gasps] What do you mean?

359
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,583
Well, it's just that you'll
be a bride someday,

360
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,625
and I think we should talk
about something important

361
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,625
before that happens.

362
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,416
Our neighbor, Takahashi,

363
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,250
said she's decided
to give up her farm.

364
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:08,750
[SHIORI]
Really?

365
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,250
[TAKAYUKI] At her age, it's
too hard to manage it alone.

366
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,166
And her son's got his
own life in Tokyo now.

367
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,750
[SHIORI]
How sad.

368
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,500
[TAKAYUKI] Your mother
and I are, thankfully,

369
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,666
still in good shape.

370
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,583
We'll be fine for
another ten years.

371
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,583
I'm just not sure
what'll happen next.

372
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,291
To get to the point,
I don't want you

373
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:29,166
or your future husband to feel
any pressure to take it over.

374
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,791
Luckily, we've all still
got good day jobs.

375
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,958
We'll be just fine
without the farm.

376
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,583
I don't want anything
to change, though, Dad.

377
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,333
I'm happy the way
things are, now.

378
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,666
Oh, sweet girl. Life is
about change and growth,

379
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,458
so don't be afraid
to embrace it.

380
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,583
[gasps]

381
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:46,583
[TAKAYUKI]
I want you to live your life

382
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,458
the way you want to live it.

383
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,333
I want you to love
who you love and live

384
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,708
wherever you want to live.

385
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,125
And I don't want
you to worry at all

386
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,416
about your mother and me.

387
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,125
[SHIORI] Sayuri, can I
talk to you for a sec?

388
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,791
Sure, come in.

389
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,125
Looks like you're almost done.

390
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,416
I know, shocking.

391
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Not too bad for a chronic
procrastinator, huh?

392
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,208
Hey, what's up, sis?
You look kinda down.

393
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:33,041
[SAYURI]
Wow. That's a lot.

394
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,041
Yeah, it really did
take me off guard.

395
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,791
It sort of came out of nowhere.

396
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,458
I mean, I've honestly
never thought about

397
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,666
what my life would be
ten years from now.

398
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
I guess I was naive
enough to think

399
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,041
things would stay the same.

400
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,541
That's okay, though.

401
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,083
Don't beat yourself up for
not worrying about the future.

402
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,875
I mean, after all, Grandma,
Grandpa, Mom, and Dad,

403
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,541
worked hard so
we wouldn't worry.

404
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,250
I guess so.

405
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,833
Hey, is that your
high school yearbook?

406
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,208
Oh, yeah.

407
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,375
I've realilzed I don't know
much about anything yet.

408
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,291
About myself,
or about this family,

409
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,833
or even about our home town.

410
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,500
Kumano knows way more
about Manoyama than I do,

411
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,250
even though he's been
living in France.

412
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,958
He's sort of amazing, really.

413
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,541
I agree with you.

414
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,458
Actually, if I'm being honest,
I was pretty interested in him

415
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,083
back when we were
in high school.

416
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,333
Oh, really?

417
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,583
Yeah, I liked him.

418
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,208
But I guess it kind of
felt like we lived

419
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,041
in two different
worlds or something.

420
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,500
I found it hard to approach him.

421
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,916
The thing is, he was saying
the same thing about you.

422
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,916
What? Was he, really?

423
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,666
That's so weird. I wonder why

424
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,166
he didn't come like
he promised, then.

425
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,000
[gasps]

426
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,041
Hey, what's this inside?

427
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,458
[MINO] The boss went and had
it updated all on his own.

428
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,416
[YAMADA] He's meeting with
the company right now.

429
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,750
This is supposed to be "deluxe"?

430
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,875
Where's the old ass?

431
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:55,958
Get out here, old ass!

432
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,291
Mrs. Oribe!

433
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,958
[MINO]
Ah! Mrs. Oribe!

434
00:17:59,041 --> 00:17:59,875
Can I help you with something?

435
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,208
You're damn right, you can!

436
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:02,875
What the hell am I
looking at, here?

437
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,416
Whatever possessed you
to hold this thing

438
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,708
on the same day as
our summer festival?

439
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,750
Are you all trying
to start a war?

440
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,041
It's the same day?

441
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,375
[CHITOSE] The Board
of Merchants hasn't heard

442
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,083
a single word about this!

443
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,458
Yoshino, you didn't tell them?

444
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,750
I am so sorry.

445
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,333
I've guess we've
just been so focused

446
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,541
on coming up with a dish.

447
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, so it's your fault.

448
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,333
I suppose I could've
guessed that.

449
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,333
You really go out of your
way to mess things up

450
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,875
around here, don't you, Queen?

451
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,208
Everything you people do is done
solely to please yourselves.

452
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,166
None of the locals
asked for any of this.

453
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,458
None of us want it. At all!

454
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,583
[MINO]
This is bad.

455
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,083
It's an unwritten
rule that we check

456
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,583
with the Board of
Merchants before we do

457
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,875
basically anything at all.

458
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,708
People out here hate
being disrespected

459
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,208
and losing face more than
just about anything else.

460
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:51,625
What the hell was that?

461
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,833
I thought I heard the old
hag's voice a minute ago.

462
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,541
Has something happened?

463
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,500
[USHIMATSU] Oh, right.
I totally forgot about it.

464
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,625
Oh well. Let her be.

465
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,166
We can't do that.

466
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,000
Thanks to a certain someone,
our relationship is in ruins.

467
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,791
And here, I thought
the Board of Merchants

468
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,000
would be so pleased
with all of our plans.

469
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,416
But yet again, I'm reminded
I need to listen

470
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,916
to the people who live here.

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,291
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

472
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,750
Man, I really messed things up.

473
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,208
Hey, no worries, Yoshi!

474
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,000
And anyway, this
isn't all your fault.

475
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,291
Everyone is responsible.

476
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,666
We should've been paying
closer attention.

477
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,125
I think that we should all
go apologize together.

478
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,250
I wholeheartedly agree.

479
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,458
No way in hell I'm going.

480
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,333
You will if I have
to drag you myself.

481
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,666
[USHIMATSU grumbles]

482
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,333
Well, are you just going
to stand there all night?

483
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,583
No, ma'am.

484
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,875
We want to express our
most sincere apologies.

485
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,166
For failing to review
our schedule with you.

486
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,750
Mr. Kadota!

487
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,208
Yeah, we're sorry.

488
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,333
I mean, what can I say that
hasn't already been said?

489
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:03,875
These kids, you know,
they weren't really thinking.

490
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,083
But they didn't mean any harm.

491
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,041
So, please don't
hold it against them.

492
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,333
[CHITOSE] Listen.
I've got something to say.

493
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,750
It's always been the same
with the Tourism Board.

494
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,666
You never ask our opinion.
You just do what you want.

495
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,583
Twenty years ago, you hopped
on that stupid bandwagon,

496
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,166
and changed the
kingdom of Kabura

497
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,041
to the kingdom of Chupakabura.

498
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,416
And to top it off,

499
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
you started selling
that bizarre <i>manju</i> .

500
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,291
Okay, fine, I could
deal with that.

501
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,750
But now, what have you done?

502
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,166
Well I've heard
you're trying to make

503
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,333
a new version of that
<i>manju</i> . Is that right?

504
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:40,833
[USHIMATSU]
So what's it to you, hag?

505
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,708
I dealt with all of
your nonsense because

506
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,750
you were at least using products
that were made in Manoyama.

507
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,166
But now you're working with
some new company, huh?

508
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,666
What is it you're
trying to do here?

509
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,708
And where was that wheat
grown, and the <i>azuki</i> beans?

510
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,166
You've been using cheap imports

511
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,583
that have no
connection to Manoyama!

512
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,958
But as long as
you can get people

513
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,208
to come to your kingdom,

514
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,750
you'll consider that a
big success, won't you?

515
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,833
Do you honestly think that
helps revive the town?

516
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,708
I think I've heard enough now.

517
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,958
You listen here!

518
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,083
We can only grow this
town with more people!

519
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:14,208
Nothing we do here matters
if the town has no future!

520
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,791
Mr. Kadota, please, stop!

521
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:16,791
This is not helping!

522
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,583
C'mon, we came
here to apologize.

523
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,916
More importantly,

524
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,666
how do you plan to
address the current problem?

525
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,291
Can I assume you'll be changing
the date of your event?

526
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,458
[USHIMATSU]
It's too late for that!

527
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:28,000
Then why the hell
did you come here?

528
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,083
I'm so sorry.

529
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,583
I'm really responsible
for all of this.

530
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,875
Yes, and I'm asking how

531
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,958
you're going to take
that responsibility.

532
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,416
It requires more
than an apology!

533
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,500
The special presentation...

534
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,125
...will be canc--

535
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,083
No, we can't!

536
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,416
We have to!

537
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,666
Please, give me some time
to think of a solution.

538
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,208
Something that works
for everybody--

539
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,083
benefiting the Tourism Board.

540
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:50,166
And the Board of
Merchants, too. No.

541
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,916
Something with the needs of
everyone in Manoyama in mind!

542
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,083
Well, Shi.

543
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,166
Do you really think
you can do that?

544
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,791
Yes I can.

545
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,250
I will lift this burden
off of the Queen,

546
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:04,125
and I'll commit to take
the lead on this project.

547
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:42,333
[SANDAL] <i>Cropeacur Yakisoba</i>
is surprisingly tasty!

548
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,875
So, everyone, please try
it at your own risk.

549
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,333
Next time: "The Lady's Scales."
