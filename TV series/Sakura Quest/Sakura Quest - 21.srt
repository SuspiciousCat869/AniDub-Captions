1
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:53,750
Hey, Maki.

2
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,875
How are your rehearsals
for the play coming along?

3
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,333
Oh, going well, I guess.

4
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,750
They're all working really hard.

5
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,166
The singles group didn't
have much else to do.

6
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,916
So they're all
pretty focused.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,416
Aw!

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,250
And Riichan's getting used
to singing in front of a crowd.

9
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,333
Isn't that right?

10
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,500
Yeah.

11
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,916
[MAKI]
Oh, Spanish!

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,208
One of the Cryptids?

13
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,750
Lucia, was it?

14
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,791
Yes, she's at the
Whitsunday Islands,

15
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,208
in Australia.

16
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,291
Sounds like she's still
traveling all over the place,

17
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,458
isn't she?

18
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,791
It's the middle of summer
down there, too.

19
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,291
While here, the new year
means the darkest depths

20
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,500
of winter for us.

21
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,500
[RIRIKO]
A hitchhiker.

22
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,208
Who'd be out in this snow?

23
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,250
Tokyo might be
a little far for us,

24
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,583
but we'd be happy to
get you to the station.

25
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,083
Erika?!

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
[ERIKA yelps]

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,875
Are you okay?

28
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,041
[YOSHINO] Of the three
festival treasures so far,

29
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
we've found the Staff
and the Hanging Drum.

30
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,875
That means one's left.

31
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,166
So we'll be continuing our
search for the Golden Dragon.

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,250
Hide, as well as
Tatsuo and Kazushi

33
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,708
from the Woodcarving District,

34
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:04,958
are all currently hard at
work on the shrine float.

35
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,208
And we've also got the play,

36
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,375
which will reintroduce
the Dragon Song.

37
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,500
We're not just
reviving the festival.

38
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,583
We're reimagining it
and making it brand new.

39
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,666
And that brings us
to why we're here today,

40
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,250
which is in the hopes that you,
the Board of Merchants,

41
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,125
will officially join us
in this effort

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:23,541
and agree to be on the
festival production board.

43
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,708
We want a new festival,

44
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,916
deeply rooted in
Manoyama's history.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,916
We ask:

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,208
Would you honor us
with your help?

47
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,750
I don't mind being
asked for help at all.

48
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,583
But I can't help wondering why
a certain old ass isn't here.

49
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:39,916
Uh... Unfortunately, Mr. Kadota
had a previous engagement.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,166
Huh.

51
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,458
Still, as you say,
this is all for Manoyama.

52
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,375
I don't see any reason to object
to what you have planned.

53
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,833
Wonderful! Thank you!

54
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:50,250
However, the people you see
in attendance here today

55
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,708
are just a small portion
of the Board of Merchants.

56
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,125
If you want to move forward,
we'll need you to go around

57
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,291
and explain this in
person to the shop owners

58
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,125
that couldn't attend
the meeting.

59
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,916
Yes, of course!

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,750
We'll visit each and every shop,
starting tomorrow.

61
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,625
And it's all for Manoyama.

62
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,000
[SANAE] The thing is,
even if we try to visit

63
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,041
each and every shop,

64
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,416
there are some
that are never open,

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,666
even in the afternoon.

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,250
With them in the picture,

67
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,875
it'll be difficult to get every
shop owner's official "okay."

68
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,083
It'll be fine!

69
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,500
I'm sure they'll understand!

70
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,625
[gasps] And do you
know what else?

71
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,750
Maybe the festival will
change some of that!

72
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,125
Maybe they'll come back!

73
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,583
Maybe they'll decide
to open their doors again!

74
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:30,541
Sometimes I really do wish
I had your optimism, Yoshi.

75
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,875
We're back!

76
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,041
Hey, Erika.

77
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,458
What is she doing here?

78
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,041
[MAKI] She was hitchhiking,
so we picked her up.

79
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,291
Where was she hitchhiking to?

80
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,666
To Tokyo.

81
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,458
Jeez! Was she running away?

82
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,333
[SHIORI] I'm afraid you'll just
have to go back home for today.

83
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,458
Your mother must be
worried about you.

84
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,708
No way.
I'm not going back home.

85
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,500
You're still in middle school--
what'll you do in Tokyo?

86
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,375
Good point.

87
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,791
Do you have any money?

88
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,333
Yes, I've been saving all
my New Year's gift money.

89
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,000
You really thought ahead, huh?

90
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,250
Do you have a place to stay?

91
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:07,625
Internet cafes.

92
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,583
No, they wouldn't let a
middle schooler stay there.

93
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,000
Then I'll camp somewhere.

94
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,375
If you sleep outside in Tokyo,
you'll freeze to death!

95
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,708
'Kay, I'll camp
without sleeping, then!

96
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,125
[MAKI]
All right, hang on.

97
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,000
Just have a seat, okay?

98
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,500
Yeah, good.

99
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,166
I mean, I do think
we did the right thing

100
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,541
bringing her here,

101
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,291
but I don't think we're
gonna get very far this way.

102
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,916
Listen, Erika,
today isn't a good day

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,333
for running away with all
the snow and everything.

104
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,583
Tell me, what's so bad
about Manoyama, anyway?

105
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,208
Why don't you
tell me why you like

106
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,708
this crappy town so much?

107
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,333
I have a feeling this
will probably seem

108
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,208
like a boring reason to you.

109
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,666
But this town is where
I was born and raised.

110
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,166
My family is here,
and all my good friends.

111
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,083
I guess that's really
why I love it.

112
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,208
Make sense?

113
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,416
I don't care about
all that family stuff.

114
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,083
And I don't have
any good friends.

115
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,166
That's why I'm leaving!

116
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,541
Wait just a sec.

117
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,500
Okay, tell me what
you think about this.

118
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,083
What if, instead of leaving,
you try moving in here

119
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,000
with us for a little while.

120
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,333
Also...

121
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,291
It can be a fact-finding mission
since Sanae, Maki,

122
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,208
and I have all lived in Tokyo.

123
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:13,333
We can tell you all about
what it's like there, okay?

124
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,166
If you're moving
to a new place,

125
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,291
it wouldn't hurt to get
some information about it

126
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,458
and prepare a little bit
for that move, right?

127
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,208
[door opens]

128
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,458
Welcome, ladies!

129
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,083
Today's specials
are Crystal Fortune

130
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,791
and Plum Crystal Fortune
after-hours drink sets.

131
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,583
Thanks, but we're actually
here to talk to you

132
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,791
about Erika.

133
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:37,958
[ANGELICA]
Huh?

134
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,833
She was apparently
running away from home,

135
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,416
so we have her at our dorm now.

136
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,708
[ANGELICA gasps]

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,708
Evening, Patrasche!

138
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,416
What do you mean, "Patrasche"?

139
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,458
You know what? I'm suddenly
feeling kinda sleepy.

140
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,000
I think I'll take a nap.

141
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
[door opens]

142
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,625
She really ran away!

143
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes, I know,
she's staying at our dorm.

144
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,375
So did you get into
a fight with your mom?

145
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,958
[ERIKA]
We're always fighting.

146
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,791
Yeah, I guess that's how it is
when you're in middle school.

147
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,208
You trying to sound
like an adult or what?

148
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,625
Actually, I am one.

149
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,166
I can remember desperately
wanting to leave the countryside

150
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,250
back when I was
in middle school, too.

151
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,625
I wasn't brave like you,
so I never tried.

152
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,625
I only dreamed about it.
I never did anything real.

153
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,416
But my little sister
is different.

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,416
We're kinda like
polar opposites.

155
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,083
She loves her hometown.

156
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,458
She doesn't care
about the city one bit.

157
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,541
Even though I'm her big sister,
she calls me "little dreamer."

158
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,333
Hey, I'm sorry, is my
chatting keeping you awake?

159
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,750
[ERIKA]
No, it's fine.

160
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,500
All right, I'll be
sleeping in Sanae's room

161
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,666
if you need me.

162
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,166
Get some good rest, 'kay?

163
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,041
G'night, sleep well.

164
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,125
I explained everything
to Angelica as best I could.

165
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,166
It wasn't easy convincing
her not to come over here

166
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,875
and pick up Erika right away.

167
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,708
That's great.
Thanks for doing that.

168
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,166
What's with those bags?

169
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,583
We promised we'd
make sure she still

170
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,000
went to school, at least, so

171
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,500
I brought over her
uniform and textbooks.

172
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,083
Has she gone
to sleep already?

173
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,375
No, but I left the bedroom
because I felt like

174
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,041
I might be keeping her up.

175
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,375
Are you sure she won't leave
in the middle of the night?

176
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,958
Don't worry about it.
I've decided to sleep down here.

177
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,333
Hey, wow,
human home security!

178
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay, I'm heading to bed.

179
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,125
We've got an early morning.

180
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's sleep in the
same room, Sanae!

181
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,666
We can have pillow talk,
and discuss thoughts

182
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,958
on our meetings with
the shop owners tomorrow!

183
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,541
You don't have a clue what
pillow talk means, do you?

184
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,583
[YOSHINO]
Uhh...

185
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,875
I purposefully
ran away from home,

186
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,375
so why am I going
back to school?

187
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,583
Try not to make
such a scary face.

188
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,250
How about if I tell you
a great story from Tokyo?

189
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,041
This one is from
when I used to work

190
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,541
at this adorable little upscale
crepe shop in Harajuku.

191
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,375
A customer came in,
kind of weird.

192
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,750
That place is the holy
land of getting scouted.

193
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,083
All the girls are completely
done up, super fancy,

194
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,041
and of course trying
way too hard.

195
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,750
But this customer stood out

196
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,250
because she was wearing
a pure white wedding gown.

197
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,041
I remember staring and
wondering about her.

198
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,833
Thinking, "What could've
happened to make her

199
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,083
want to eat crepes
in a wedding dress?"

200
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,583
I kept it simple, though, and
just asked her what she'd like.

201
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,333
And then, the girl
in the wedding dress,

202
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,958
eyes bloodshot,
looked directly at me,

203
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,125
and she said--

204
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,250
We're here!
See you after school.

205
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,333
Hold on!
What did she say to you?

206
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,125
I'll tell you the rest on
the way home this afternoon.

207
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,500
You just make sure
to go to class, okay?

208
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,833
[SANAE] I wonder if Erika will
only end up ditching class

209
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,291
and running away again.

210
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, I have a feeling it's
nothing Maki can't handle.

211
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,375
We should try to focus
on visiting the shops!

212
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,791
Let's split them up!

213
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,375
Why don't you take
the shopping district

214
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,375
over in the temple area?
Sound good?

215
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,000
[MINO] Asking people to
join the production board?

216
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,416
Don't you think that's
really something

217
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,625
you should be handling,
Mr. Kadota?

218
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,416
Why should I?

219
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,083
I fully trust the queen.

220
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,791
You need to stop mixing
personal and public affairs.

221
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,958
You've been avoiding
Chitose at all costs.

222
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,791
I don't have any
personal affairs

223
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,041
to mix up with anything!

224
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,750
All I do is public work!

225
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
Come on, boss, please!

226
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,875
Would you mind keeping
it down a little?

227
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,916
Oh, no, sorry, it was nothing!

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,791
Okay, let me know
about the sponsorship,

229
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,833
and you have all our thanks!

230
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,875
You tell me why you like
this crappy town so much!

231
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,083
[YAMADA]
What's wrong?

232
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,708
You're not your
usual cheerful self.

233
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Oh, no, I'm fine!
No worries!

234
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,208
I'm headed off to the meeting
with the event company!

235
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,958
Hey, Riichan,
have you ever wondered

236
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,708
what it might be like
to travel around

237
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,250
like Lucia and the others?

238
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,458
Maybe, but I know I'd never go.

239
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,041
I bet you kinda wish you
could, though, don't you?

240
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,875
You okay, Shichan? What is it?

241
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,958
Yoshino wanted so badly
to get out of the countryside.

242
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,666
So did Maki.

243
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,250
Sanae wasn't in the countryside,

244
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,875
but she wanted to get away
from her home in Tokyo.

245
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,708
Even your granny
wanted more than anything

246
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,541
to leave Manoyama,
way back when.

247
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:24,208
But I've never wanted to get
away and leave my hometown.

248
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,833
Not once in my life.

249
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,041
I'm starting to think I'm
the weird one around here.

250
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,500
[SETSUKO]
If Chitose is fine with it,

251
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,625
then I'm on board, too.

252
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,375
If there's anything we can do
to help put it all together,

253
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,541
I hope you'll let us know.

254
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,625
[YOSHINO]
Thank you!

255
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,458
But girls, what you see
is what you get here.

256
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,333
I'm not sure how much help
we'll really be in the long run.

257
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,041
Oh, no!
Please don't worry.

258
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,500
We're glad to have you on!

259
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,458
[YOSHINO]
All right. Next?

260
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,208
That's good.

261
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,166
Have a bite of this, Yoshi.
It's really amazing.

262
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,375
Delicious!

263
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,666
Isn't it?

264
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,041
It's a croquette from
this little butcher shop

265
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,625
over in the temple area.

266
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,208
I've become kind
of addicted lately!

267
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,000
See, it's things like
this that really get

268
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,375
my mind racing.

269
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,250
I believe the shopping
district still has a chance

270
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,416
to make a comeback!

271
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,958
[SHIORI]
We're back!

272
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,000
That was fast.

273
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,125
Is there anything
I can help with?

274
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,083
No, everything is
taken care of here.

275
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,250
I've got to go pick up
Erika pretty soon, though.

276
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,250
Oh, I was hoping
to lend a hand.

277
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,833
Why don't I go for you?

278
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,541
[school bell ringing]

279
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,500
Why didn't Maki
come pick me up?

280
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,416
Sorry, am I
a disappointment?

281
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,416
[ERIKA] I wanted to hear
the rest of the story.

282
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,208
[SHIORI]
What story do you mean?

283
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,708
[ERIKA] Never mind.
I'll ask her when we get back.

284
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,041
So tell me, why did
you suddenly decide

285
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,750
to run away from home?

286
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,875
You've never even thought
about leaving Manoyama

287
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,833
so I doubt you would understand.

288
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,125
Is that what you think?

289
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,000
Maybe you should
give me a chance.

290
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,208
No?

291
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,791
I left 'cause I had a dream.

292
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,916
I was an adult, and I was at
that restaurant, making curry.

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,083
That sounds like a lovely dream.

294
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,875
Ugh. Yeah, see, somehow
I knew you wouldn't get it.

295
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,458
That is the last thing
I want to do with my life.

296
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,583
That's why.

297
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,041
Delicious!

298
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,958
Hey, what would you think
of getting out of town?

299
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,625
Leaving and closing up shop?

300
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,916
You want some of this?

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
Curry is always best
after three days.

302
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,833
I wouldn't need to go
to school. I could work.

303
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,625
I'd do anything to help out.

304
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,208
I don't wanna waste my youth
in this dumb old town!

305
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,791
What are you talking about?
This restaurant is yours.

306
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,958
For goodness' sake,
I named it after the two of you!

307
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,916
I know that!
Why should that matter?

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,208
Anji and Erika, I mean,
what the hell's that?

309
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:17,125
It's stupid!

310
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,791
What do you mean, "it's stupid"?

311
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,625
Look, if you hate being
in the country that much,

312
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,166
you can just go to Tokyo,
or New York,

313
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,791
or Dubai, or wherever else!

314
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,458
Just the thought
of getting old here

315
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,291
in this dried-up town is
enough to make me depressed.

316
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,916
Scares the hell out of me.

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,208
It's my worst fear.

318
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,458
Next up, the Tanpopo Cafe.

319
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,541
Oh, this is it.

320
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,291
What the heck?

321
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,041
If you're looking for
the café, it closed last year.

322
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,541
And I'm pretty sure
the hardware store

323
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,125
is actually closed up for
their lunch break right now.

324
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,875
[NOGE] Menial work
is rough, eh, Queen?

325
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,125
Not menial at all!
It's important stuff!

326
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,708
Talking to every
shop owner sounds like

327
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,083
a daunting task.

328
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,541
But it shouldn't be too hard,
they're good people.

329
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,791
Hey, so...

330
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,875
I know it might be nosy
to ask this question.

331
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,125
But why do so many people
maintain their shops here

332
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,666
and then choose to leave
them shuttered so often?

333
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,125
You don't beat
around the bush.

334
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:14,166
My apologies if the
question was out of line.

335
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,541
The answer is simple.

336
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,333
The people who own those
shops are living comfortably

337
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,541
for the time being.

338
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,750
I see.

339
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,666
But, and hopefully this
doesn't sound rude,

340
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,833
it doesn't look like
they're making money.

341
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:26,208
Even if their sales
don't support their shops,

342
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,333
they've built up
reserves over the years.

343
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,208
Their children have
grown up and gotten jobs

344
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,458
in the city.

345
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,125
They only need to
support themselves.

346
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,791
They can afford to kick back.

347
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,000
If that's the case,

348
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,625
they should rent them
out to other people.

349
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,041
We have all these shops.

350
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,666
It seems like a
terrible waste for them

351
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,750
to sit empty all the time.

352
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,333
Most of their homes
are on the second floor

353
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,583
of their shops, though.

354
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,041
Understandably they don't
want random people

355
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,708
on their first floor.

356
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:52,833
I mean, it certainly isn't a
simple problem, to be sure.

357
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,083
These people don't really
want their lives to change,

358
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,666
is the thing.

359
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,208
They tend to want things to go
on exactly as they always have.

360
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,833
Plus, think about it,

361
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,958
even if new stores did
open up in this district,

362
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,708
would you really come shop here?

363
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,166
Yeah, of course I would!

364
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,583
The reason I ask is
are you normally a person

365
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:10,833
who comes out here to shop?

366
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,541
Yeah, I've shopped here before!

367
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,416
Although, not very often,
I do have to admit.

368
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,333
I bet you usually buy
everything at the supermarket.

369
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:20,541
Well, yeah, I do.

370
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,916
A lot more often
than not, anyway.

371
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,708
Look, there's no shame in that.

372
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
It's exactly what
everybody else does.

373
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,541
That's the future.

374
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,125
The bottom line is,
shopping districts

375
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,625
aren't relevant anymore.

376
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,750
We're happy to continue
looking after Erika

377
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,083
at the dorm for now.

378
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,250
If we force her to go back,

379
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,625
she'll probably just
run away again.

380
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm so sorry.

381
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,916
I never would've believed
that she would actually

382
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,375
run away like this.

383
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,791
Is Erika coming back
home or not?

384
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,958
Don't worry about
anything, sweetheart.

385
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,791
I'm sure she'll be back
home with both of us

386
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,416
again before we know it.

387
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,958
She was unfriendly
and she cursed a lot,

388
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,833
but it's kinda boring
here without her.

389
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:00,916
[KANEDA]
Yeah.

390
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,666
They're already
drinking at this hour?

391
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,666
Both of you guys
off duty today?

392
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,791
Yep, that's right!
Finally got a day off,

393
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,791
but there's really
nothing to do around here.

394
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,458
So we have decided
to have a drink!

395
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,291
Nothing wrong with that!

396
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,708
Sometimes it's nice!

397
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,208
Get away from the wife and kid,
just shoot the breeze.

398
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,083
You two are peas in a pod.

399
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,458
Yeah, we've been friends
since elementary school.

400
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,791
And Noge, too.

401
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,708
Remember how
we'd go exploring?

402
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,416
And that hill behind the pond?

403
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,166
The time we found the
Shining Dragon there?

404
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,166
Those were the days, huh?

405
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,166
Wait, what is
the Shining Dragon?

406
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,416
Oh, nothing important,

407
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,083
just a legendary secret
treasure that grants you

408
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,708
a single wish!

409
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,291
No way, really?

410
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,250
Yeah, there was a rumor
about it at school back then.

411
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,291
It was said that somewhere
near Sakura Pond,

412
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,541
a long-lost, secret
treasure lay hidden.

413
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,458
All we knew was that it was
called the Shining Dragon.

414
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,291
A Shining Dragon
that went missing

415
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,416
somewhere near Sakura Pond.

416
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,333
Could you possibly mean
the Golden Dragon?

417
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,791
[BOTH]
Hm?

418
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,291
[RIRIKO]
This is the Golden Dragon,

419
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,875
one of the festival treasures.

420
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,583
It was used in the old
Mizuchi festival.

421
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,125
[TAKAMIZAWA] Yeah, that
actually looks an awful lot

422
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,583
like the one we found.

423
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,083
Don't you think?

424
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,208
[KANEDA]
Yep, that's it.

425
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,833
The Golden Dragon.

426
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,250
Was that the treasure
that was attached

427
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,041
to the roof of the
old shrine float?

428
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,458
Yeah.

429
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,041
Someone supposedly pulled
it off before it all sank

430
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,500
into the pond, but it seems to
have gone missing after that.

431
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,291
So Kindaichi and
the others found it

432
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,750
while they were out exploring
when they were really little?

433
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,166
I guess, and if that's true,

434
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,708
then what is the location
of the Shining Dragon now?

435
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,875
They told us they buried it
in Hippo Park, near the school.

436
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,791
[SANAE]
They buried it? Why?

437
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,250
If you'd like
the short answer,

438
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,041
it was because the Shining
Dragon only grants one wish.

439
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,916
They argued about
what to wish for,

440
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,375
but in the end, they couldn't
pick just one thing.

441
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,000
So, they decided to bury
it until they could all agree

442
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,333
on a single wish.

443
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,416
[TAKAMIZAWA]
I'm closing up now, okay?

444
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,458
[KANEDA, NOGE]
Okay.

445
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,500
Guys, this is a very
important secret, you got it?

446
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,208
Swear not to tell anyone!

447
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,166
This is the secret
code that shows exactly

448
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,500
where it's buried.

449
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,250
Nobody gets it all for himself!

450
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,916
[NOGE]
See?

451
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,125
Now there's no way it can be
found unless all three of us

452
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,208
are together!

453
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,625
How stupid.

454
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:18,583
I mean, there's obviously
no way that thing grants wishes.

455
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:21,333
Well, they can't really help it.
They're boys, after all.

456
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,666
I got in touch with Noge,

457
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,125
and he said he'd be
happy to go dig

458
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,750
where they buried the dragon,

459
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,958
but I honestly doubt he's gonna
find anything down there.

460
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:29,958
Hey, Erika?

461
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,541
What would you wish?

462
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,750
I think if I could have
one wish right now...

463
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,541
I would want to be left alone.

464
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,000
Erika, wait.

465
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,708
Don't try to force
her to talk to you.

466
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,625
It won't work.

467
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:42,791
Yeah, but...

468
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,000
So how's everything
going with you guys?

469
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,666
Do you think the folks
in the shopping district

470
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,916
are gonna help us out?

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,375
Some shop owners weren't around,

472
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,916
but we got okays from
the people we did talk to.

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,375
It feels like we're
getting super close

474
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,875
to reviving the festival!

475
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,458
I just hope it does
something to help revive

476
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,041
the shopping district, too!

477
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,208
Right, Yoshino?

478
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,166
Huh?

479
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,583
Hey, are you okay?

480
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,708
You were so upbeat
all afternoon.

481
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:26,750
I guess.

482
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,708
I'm not really sure
anymore though.

483
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:29,791
About what?

484
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,416
I talked to Noge today.

485
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,250
All about the shopping district.

486
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,875
He said everyone is comfortable
the way things are.

487
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,375
And then an outsider
like me comes along.

488
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,583
What right do I have to say,

489
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,500
"let's bring this
place to life!"

490
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,958
Maybe we're being
way too pushy with this,

491
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,250
trying to encourage people
who aren't at all interested

492
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,291
in changing things.

493
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,000
It's exactly like the
people in Warabiya Village.

494
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,625
They're just trying their
best to continue on,

495
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,208
keeping their lives the same.

496
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,333
Well, I'm not going to pretend
that what you're saying

497
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,291
doesn't make any sense.

498
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,875
I keep thinking about it.

499
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,958
One thing Noge said was
that shopping districts

500
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,125
aren't relevant anymore.

501
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,000
[SHIORI] Who is he
to decide that, anyway?

502
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,833
You can't just say
they're not relevant!

503
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,583
I was born in this little town.

504
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,708
I've lived here
for my entire life,

505
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,875
and I'm never, ever going
to give up on loving this place!

506
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,583
We understand, Shiori.

507
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,083
It was Noge who said it.

508
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,166
Right, I'm sorry.

509
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,791
No worries.

510
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,750
No, I'm sorry, Shiori.

511
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,166
It's not right for
the queen to be

512
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,583
such a big fat pessimist, is it?

513
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,208
If they're not relevant anymore,

514
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,333
then we'll find a way.

515
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,083
We can make them relevant again!

516
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,041
Agreed. I believe putting
our heads together

517
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,416
will make all the difference!

518
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,000
[phone ringing]

519
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,625
Hang on a sec.

520
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,541
Oh, it's from Takamizawa.

521
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,666
He said they're digging up
the Golden Dragon!

522
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:52,625
Hey, Takamizawa!

523
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:55,250
You guys are late, Queen.

524
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,625
Where's the Golden Dragon?

525
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,041
We're about to start digging.

526
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,041
But first, we're gonna
have to figure out this code.

527
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,125
Huh?

528
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,541
What am I looking at?

529
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,083
[RIRIKO]
"The Incantation of Rebirth."

530
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,708
[SANDAL]
I've been to Harajuku before.

531
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,666
I was actually scouted
by an agency,

532
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,291
but unfortunately,
I failed the interview.

533
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,500
Next time:
"The New Moon Luminarie."
