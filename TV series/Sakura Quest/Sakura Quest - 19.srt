00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,250
[SANAE] I don't understand
why we had to come

2
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,291
do this at night.

3
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,166
[YOSHINO]
It's urgent!

4
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,625
We're lucky someone
posted that lead

5
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,500
about the festival treasure.

6
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,083
It'll be cool if the
Hanging Drum really is here.

7
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,541
Well, if it is,

8
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,291
then you guys should know
where they'd keep it, right?

9
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,458
I mean, didn't you three
go to school here?

10
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,708
I actually went to
the other middle school.

11
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,291
Yeah, so did I.

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,125
I went to this one, but I don't
remember anything about a drum.

13
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:12,000
It's been ten years
since this place shut down.

14
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:14,750
Not surprising that it's
a little creepy, huh?

15
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,333
[RIRIKO]
This is where he'd pop out.

16
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,583
The Blood-Soaked Santa.

17
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,541
Blood-Soaked Santa?

18
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,166
It's a classic urban
legend from this school.

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,375
How do you know about that?

20
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,916
Nope! Don't wanna
hear it! La la...

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,125
A Santa was driving
on an icy road

22
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,416
when he slid through a curve,
crashed, and died.

23
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,208
He's been wandering ever since.

C'mon, stop trying
to scare us, Riichan!

26
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,958
Okay, why wasn't he flying?

27
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,875
And why would he
come to this school?

It's him! Blood-Soaked Santa!

33
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,083
What's he carrying?

34
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,166
Don't tell me it's
a reindeer's corpse!

35

We'll all be killed.

Would you guys calm down?

Oh, I guess the

45
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,666
The school might've
been shut down,

but it wasn't abandoned.

It's still got running
water and electricity.

I assumed you must have checked
all of that stuff earlier!

[YOSHINO sighs]

I'm really sorry.

00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,416
I shouldn't have called you
a gorilla, Mr. Midorikawa.

Don't worry about it;
he's an ape.

No, Maki,

54
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,791
because that would make
you a little ape girl

55
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,333
and I just can't have that!

56

Shiori, you really gotta work on
your mood-lightening jokes.

Thank you so much for your help
with the film shoot,

Mr. Midorikawa.

The mini-zombies.

Not at all!

61
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,791
The kids loved the
opportunity to do something

62
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,541
others don't get to do.

63
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,791
So, if I may ask,

64
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,041
what brings the Board
of Tourism here tonight?

65
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,916
Well, we're kind of
looking for something.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,875
[IWAO] The Board of Education
has been getting complaints

67
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,833
from around the
neighborhood lately.

68
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,083
Kids hear these rumors
about a Blood-Soaked Santa,

69
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,458
so they get curious and
start poking around.

70
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,458
What? You really think
that's why we're here?

71
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:12,833
[IWAO]
Isn't it?

72
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,166
What the hell are you
doing wandering around here

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,416
at night, anyway?

Mr. Elementary School

You think I'm happy
my beloved halls

Um, sir?

00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,541
We didn't come to snoop
around out of curiosity.

81
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,375
We actually got permission
to enter the school

from the Board of Education.

00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,500
The one from the Mizuchi
Festival fifty years ago.

come in the daytime, though.

Your house is closer.

it won't be cheap.

Couple hundred thousand
yen, maybe.

What? That'll screw up
our entire budget!

Good afternoon!

for a gift today?

Yeah. I guess.

Oh, that looks really nice!

you for anything, huh?

The festival has been
scheduled for next April.

It's already December,

In that case, I strongly
suggest that you add

That's a good point.

be a good person to ask.

So should I start with
more or less vibrato?

[MAKI]
No, that's not what it's about.

477
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,791
It's the same thing with acting.

478
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,125
It's not really about whether
you're good or bad,

479
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,375
but whether you're
able to connect.

480
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,041
It's about being honest.

481

Audiences just wanna
feel something.

Lead them there by
expressing your feelings.

They tried, but they couldn't

So the dog decided to come

And the poor little dog's

[IWAO] I had a meeting with
the Board of Education.

A paper play? Haven't seen
one of those in a while.

a paper play?

I was born this way.

No, you weren't.

You smiled a lot
when you were little.

You know, you should
really stick with acting.

[MAKI] But... I can't
make a living that way.

512
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,333
I took a lot of odd
jobs just to survive.

513
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,875
After a while,

514
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,041
I wasn't sure why I ever went
to Tokyo in the first place.

[IWAO] Who said it had
to make you a living?

00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,541
Is it really that
hard for you, Maki?

Huh?

[IWAO] You smiled a lot,

The audition is tomorrow, right?

Aren't you going?

My goal right now is to
make the festival a success,

00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:10,041
as Chief Handywoman for
the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

I don't think it's the
right time for an audition.

is very worthwhile.

I'm glad I'm here.

But after that, next year,
I don't know what to do.
