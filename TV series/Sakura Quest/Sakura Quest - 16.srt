317
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,333
[USHIMATSU]
What am I--

318
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,750
Dammit!

319
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,166
[USHIMATSU]
I'm not running away!

320
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,291
I refuse to run away!

321
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,583
I'll fight!

322
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,291
I won't run!

323
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,625
I won't!

324
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:54,708
I'm not gonna run off to Tokyo.
I'm staying here!

325
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,708
I'm gonna wake them all up!

326
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,416
Wake up those fools!

327
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,583
Wake up this whole damn town!

328
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,416
[yelling]

329
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,458
[gasps]

330
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,583
Mr. Kadota!

331
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,625
Thank goodness!

332
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,250
It's great to see you waking up!

333
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,041
Oh. Yeah.

334
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,583
Good news. Mr. Kadota's awake.

335
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, really?

336
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,791
I was kinda hoping
he'd kick the bucket.

337
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,916
That's too bad.

338
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:30,416
Doku told us what
happened fifty years ago.

339
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,541
Your singing was
very cool, Grandma.

340
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,291
I think I vaguely
remember that.

341
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,916
He also told us you thought
about leaving Manoyama.

342
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,958
That's all in the past
and it's forgotten.

343
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:45,875
Ririko.

344
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,625
I want you to listen to me.

345
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,541
Whatever you might
be thinking right now,

346
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,583
whatever dreams you
might have for yourself,

347
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,500
when you get old,
you forget about them.

348
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,583
You stop caring
one way or the other.

349
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,583
That's why, granddaughter.

350
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,583
Before that happens to you,

351
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,208
you should get out there,

352
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,166
and you should do
whatever you want to do.

353
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
I wonder what that little
thing over there could be?

354
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,750
I never thought I'd see the day
when they drained the pond!

355
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,958
So that's the
famous shrine float.

356
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,833
It's not surprising that
it's lost its original shape.

357
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,666
You'd never know what it
was unless someone told you.

358
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,875
I wonder if that
thing is a guitar.

359
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:35,750
[MAKI]
What thing?

360
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,000
[SANAE]
I can't tell at all.

361
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,625
[YOSHINO]
This is nice, huh?

362
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,500
Nobody announced it or anything,

363
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,291
but people just kind
of showed up!

364
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,625
And they're all having fun!

365
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,875
I'm sure the pond has seen
some interesting things!

366
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:48,958
[GIRL 16B]
Should we help it?

367
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,666
[speaking Spanish]

368
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,250
A place where people gather.

369
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,291
A place everyone returns to.

370
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,583
You know what I'm thinking?

371
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:05,416
It must have been a
day not unlike this one

372
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,166
when someone first suggested
they hold a festival.

373
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,625
Hey, guys, what would you think

374
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,875
about possibly
reviving the festival?

375
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,541
I'd love that!

376
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,666
[GROUP chattering]

377
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,708
Now that they're leaving,
it's actually kind of hard

378
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,125
to say goodbye.

379
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,333
Yeah, they're headed to
Kushiro in Hokkaido after this.

380
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,250
For Kussie in Lake Kussharo?

381
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,625
How do I tell her,

382
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,333
"When you're back,
the B&amp;B in my heart

383
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,791
will be waiting!" 

384
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,666
You should simplify and say,
"One night, love, please!"

385
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,250
--Claro.
--[KANEDA] Hey, Constanza!

386
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,375
Give me one night. Please, love!

387
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,791
You mind your manners.

388
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,041
[speaking Spanish]

389
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,791
Hasta luego.

390
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,458
[LUCIA speaking Spanish]

391
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,000
[USHIMATSU]
So Queen, tell me.

392
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,333
[YOSHINO]
Hm?

393
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,125
They found some stuff
at the bottom of the pond,

394
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,000
didn't they?

395
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,250
Yeah, there was a bunch
of things down there,

396
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,958
but the maintenance workers
were sure to take it all away.

397
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,791
Oh, I see.

398
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,458
[YOSHINO] Anyway, I've got
something to ask you.

399
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:31,708
[USHIMATSU]
Hm?

400
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,666
[YOSHINO] Would you like
to revive the festival?

401
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,083
The Mizuchi Festival
from fifty years ago?

402
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,791
We could bring it back!

403
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,125
Nobody in town wants that.

404
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,041
It would be a
huge waste of time.

405
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,666
I don't think that's true!

406
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,250
You should've seen
them at the drying!

407
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,333
Everyone was having
a great time!

408
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,916
It felt like a festival!

409
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,333
It was so lovely.

410
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,375
And I think it'd be really
nice if they had a place

411
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,500
to gather like that
here in Manoyama!

412
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:58,208
And, perhaps most importantly
I heard you.

413
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,375
[USHIMATSU]
Huh?

414
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,125
[YOSHINO]
You were talking in your sleep.

415
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,750
"I'm gonna wake them up.

416
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,458
Wake up this whole damn town!"

417
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,041
Do whatever you want.

418
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,875
Revive the Mizuchi festival?
That's crazy!

419
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,750
We'd have to find backers
and start setting up meetings.

420
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,125
We'd need help from every
single person in Manoyama!

421
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,541
That's right,
and we'll convince them!

422
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,666
The budget's a big problem, too.

423
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,791
We have to build a
new shrine float for a start,

424
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,166
and that's just the beginning.

425
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,875
We'll need lots of other things.

426
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,250
What other things?

427
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,041
You know. Other things.

428
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,541
[GROUP]
Hm?

429
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,833
The Three Sacred Treasures.

430
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,791
What, Mr. Shigaraki?

431
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,708
What Three Sacred Treasures?

432
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,041
The Staff, the Hanging Drum,
and the Golden Dragon.

433
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,458
These items have
been passed down

434
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,291
for generations of
the Mizuchi Festival.

435
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,291
If you can't gather
them together,

436
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,375
then you cannot
revive the festival.

437
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,166
The problem, I'm afraid,
is their whereabouts

438
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,708
have been a mystery
for quite some time.

439
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,000
Well, then, okay!

440
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,625
This sounds like our challenge!

441
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,708
We'll find those missing
treasures, I swear!

442
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,416
[SANDAL] That was the first
time Mr. Shigaraki ever spoke,

443
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,250
so I was pretty surprised.

444
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,875
We went to karaoke after that.
It was fun.

445
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,250
Next time:
"The Sphinx's Antics."
