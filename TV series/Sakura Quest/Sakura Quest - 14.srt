1
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,833
Please, I beg you!

2
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,166
You have to stop!

3
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,375
Everything I'm doing
is for the town! I swear!

4
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,000
[NOGE] It's not for the town!
You did it for you!

5
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,250
Yep! As only an outsider would!

6
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,166
We will not forgive her!

7
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,041
[YAMADA]
That's right, we won't!

8
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,875
Death by manju!

9
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,666
[ERIKA]
Eat this, you stupid queen!

10
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,125
[YOSHINO]
No!

11
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,125
Could I have some tea?

12
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,916
Please, I really need
some tea now!

13
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,708
What the hell was that about?

14
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,791
[YAE]
Yoshino!

15
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,666
How late are you
planning to sleep?

16
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,916
Get up, already!

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
'Kay!

18
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,416
[DOKUSHIMA] So, the queen went
back to her hometown, huh?

19
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,041
Yeah, she's taking a
summer vacation, that's all.

20
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,500
Well, you never know,
she might not come back.

21
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,625
Don't be silly!

22
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,541
I'm not; people are
talking about it.

23
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,375
Word is they haven't
seen the other ministers

24
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,791
around town, either.

25
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,166
[SHIORI] That's because
they're all on summer vacation.

26
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,833
Everyone needed a rest
after working on

27
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,333
the Founding Festival.

28
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,416
The Founding Festival, eh?

29
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,250
No vacation could
make up for you having

30
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,791
to take orders from this fool.

31
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,166
[USHIMATSU]
Takes one to know one.

32
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,958
They do deserve a reward!

33
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,250
And Moving Mountains'
ratings are going way up,

34
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,458
but our fight has only
just begun, you know!

35
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,166
Yeah, I'll say it has.

36
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,041
I bet we haven't
even had one percent

37
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,375
of the Manoyama
coupons redeemed yet.

38
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,500
Anyway, here's what you wanted.

39
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,208
Ha! Would you look at that?

40
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,208
I'll use this to perfect
our coming budget

41
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,958
in preparation for the
next Founding Festival!

42
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,458
Should I just forward the bill
for this to the Tourism Board?

43
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,541
Sure. And, I've got
one of these, too.

44
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,833
Come on, you've gotta
be kidding me!

45
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,750
I can't believe you're
using a coupon for this.

46
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,750
[SHIORI] Oh, girls, I wonder
if you really are enjoying

47
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,666
your vacations like you deserve.

48
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:53,250
[phone ringing]

49
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,166
Hey.

50
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,541
[MAKI] Well, how is it
being back in Tokyo?

51
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,208
Oh, you know, Tokyo's Tokyo.

52
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,333
What's up with you?

53
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,375
Uh, very little.

54
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:07,458
I called 'cause I literally
have nothing to do.

55
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought you said
you were staying over

56
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,541
at your friend's
house right now.

57
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,750
[MAKI] Yeah, they go to work
early, so I'm alone here.

58
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,208
Wanna come stay with me?

59
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,625
At my parents'?

60
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,875
No, thanks.

61
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,666
I have a feeling that
might be a little weird.

62
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,416
Plus, I'm going to see
a friend's play tonight,

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,458
and we're going drinking after.

64
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,958
[SANAE] I'm actually going
drinking with friends

65
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,125
tonight, too.

66
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,500
[MAKI] All right!
Look at us, having fun!

67
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,125
[SANAE]
Yeah.

68
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,750
Hey, what's wrong?

69
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,166
I don't know;
just feels weird.

70
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,583
I seriously feel like
an outsider now.

71
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,500
[TAKAMIZAWA] Everything's back
to normal in Manoyama today.

72
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,291
Back to the old
routine already. Gah.

73
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,166
Though, I have to admit,

74
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,250
that TV show's bringing
in more weirdos

75
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,791
than I've ever seen before.

76
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,416
[CHITOSE] Are you helping out
the Tourism Board again?

77
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,458
The queen is on a
little break, isn't she?

78
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,583
There's no need to worry.

79
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:09,625
I'm not going to try
to stop you.

80
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,541
Nothing Ushimatsu does
ever sticks, anyway.

81
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,375
Things always end up
going back to normal.

82
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,041
I mean, you saw
how it all ended up

83
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,916
at the Founding Festival.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,250
I guess.

85
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,416
But I'm proud of how
hard we all worked on it.

86
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,375
Yay! We can work on this
while Yoshino and the others

87
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,708
are on vacation!

88
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,000
B&amp;Bs?

89
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,666
Right! Mr. Kadota wanted
us to study up on it

90
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,416
for the empty houses in town.

91
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,458
He hopes to be able to work
this into next year's plan.

92
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,791
Once summer break ends,

93
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,208
we can get even more
ideas from the other girls.

94
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,541
Next year, though.

95
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,416
[SHIORI] That's right.
I had forgotten.

96
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,375
The queen's official
term is only one year long.

97
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,708
[YAE]
Oh, these are surprisingly good!

98
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,541
I can send you a ton
when I get back.

99
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,666
We've got plenty of 'em
left over, that's for sure.

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,666
So tell me about your job.
Is it going well?

101
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,375
I hope you won't
let your TV appearance

102
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,750
go to your head, now.

103
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,875
Life isn't that simple
most of the time, you know.

104
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,041
Yeah, I know that.

105
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,875
[YAE] Your contract
is one year, right?

106
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,791
What do you plan
to do after that?

107
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,541
I haven't really
thought about it.

108
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,625
[YAE]
Still using that line, huh?

109
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,291
If you're living out
in the country, anyway,

110
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,083
then you might as well
just come home!

111
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,916
Dad knows someone
in a company nearby

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
who can put in a
good word for you.

113
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,958
It's not a huge
company or anything.

114
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,083
They make kamaboko
and other stuff,

115
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:42,916
but for Azumigaura,
it's pretty--

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
What's the matter? Hey!

117
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,041
Young lady, don't you walk
away while I'm talking to you!

118
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,708
I said I'd have lunch
with Saku today,

119
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,250
so I have to go.

120
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,416
Oh, really?

121
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,791
See you later, then.

122
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,500
[SAKUMI] I have to be back
in exactly one hour.

123
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,500
I'm so sorry I don't
have more time!

124
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,291
Government jobs are really
strict about all that stuff.

125
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,000
[YOSHINO] Still in the
Welfare Department?

126
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,166
New Residents Support
Department now.

127
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,958
It's kind of like the rural
revival stuff

128
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,583
you're doing, actually!

129
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,541
Oh, really?

130
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,041
I read all about it online!

131
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,750
You've been working
crazy hard, haven't you?

132
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,791
I don't know.
It's not very going well.

133
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,291
What? You got P'tolemaius
to come out for a show!

134
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,166
Okay, I say that, but I
understand what you mean.

135
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,333
To revive a town,

136
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,000
increasing permanent
resident population

137
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,833
is more important than tourism.

138
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,625
And that's no small
task, am I right?

139
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,666
Right!

140
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,791
Permanent resident population.

141
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,291
[YOSHINO] "In contrast to the
temporary resident population,

142
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,458
which comprises visitors
to a region,

143
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,208
this describes the
number of residents

144
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,541
that have permanently
settled there."

145
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,750
[SAKUMI]
What is it?

146
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,791
Sorry. I had a thought.

147
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,958
I realized I don't count
as a permanent resident

148
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,833
of Azumigaura anymore.

149
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
Oh, well.
That's the way it goes.

150
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,916
It's a problem all towns
like ours deal with.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,791
We have some strategies
to assist people

152
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,000
moving back to the
country from the city,

153
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,875
but some people, like you,
take up a new rural residence.

154
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,250
I'd like to bring that up
with my boss, actually.

155
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,416
New rural?

156
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,041
[SAKUMI] Like taking a job
in a small town

157
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,208
that wasn't the one
you grew up in.

158
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,166
From the country,
to the city, to the country.

159
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,750
Wow, I'm pretty impressed, Saku.

160
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,416
You really know your stuff.

161
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,708
[SAKUMI laughs]

162
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,541
Whatever, you're
the queen, here!

163
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,041
What is a B&amp;B?

164
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,125
Making a normal residence
available to the general public

165
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,500
as paid lodging for vacationers.

166
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,125
This could help since
there aren't many places

167
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,083
to stay in Manoyama.

168
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,750
There's a site where
travelers can look

169
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,708
to find houses to stay in.

170
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,833
Manoyama absolutely must
take advantage of this!

171
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,791
Or so Mr. Kadota says.

172
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,625
It's true that if
we'd had more lodging

173
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,833
during the Founding Festival,

174
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,416
people would've been
able to spend more time

175
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,791
exploring the town.

176
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,541
There are plenty
of empty houses.

177
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,916
Yeah.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,833
It'd be so great if we could
take advantage of that!

179
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,875
It's too bad the Tourism
Board can't take charge

180
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,375
of all of them together,
you know?

181
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,000
I wouldn't want to rent
my place out to strangers.

182
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,375
That's true.

183
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,083
I guess it'd be hard to
know who you'd end up with.

184
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,041
Some of the owners probably
won't like that at all.

185
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,250
Okay, tell me this:

186
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,541
What would it take to
make you comfortable

187
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,083
renting out your house
if you were an owner?

188
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,958
Umm, maybe if it's a girl.

189
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,333
Oh, good point.

190
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,916
That makes a lot of sense to me.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,416
And some guests
might prefer staying

192
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,958
in women-only houses.

193
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,083
And they must love UMAs.

194
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,000
[SHIORI] That might prove
a little bit trickier.

195
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,500
[ANGELICA]
Well, personally,

196
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,541
I wouldn't care who it was
as long as they paid me

197
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,500
up front.

198
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,750
[door opens]

199
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,583
[ANGELICA] Hey, this is
a rare sight! Welcome!

200
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,958
Oh, sorry, I'm not
actually here to eat.

201
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,625
Just workin' the beat today.

202
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,208
We've gotten a lot of reports
of suspicious persons.

203
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,083
I get it. There's one
sleeping right over there.

204
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,041
I can't eat another bite.

205
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,750
However, that tuna...

206
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,750
I've got room for that.

207
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,083
[KANEDA] He's not the one
we're looking for right now.

208
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,166
We just got a report that
some people were poking around

209
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,125
an empty house, actually.

210
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,625
An empty house?

211
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,958
How strange--we were just
talking about the vacant homes.

212
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,583
Having lots of empty
houses looks bad

213
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,791
for the town, so, converting
them to B&amp;Bs

214
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,500
would kill two birds
with one stone!

215
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,333
It'd be even better if people
moved into 'em, though.

216
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,958
Especially if some
of those people

217
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,875
could be pretty young ladies.

218
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,833
If they would take up
residence in the empty house

219
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,083
of my heart, forever!

220
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,333
Enough with the poetry.
Back to earth now.

221
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,041
Erika! Shame on you.

222
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,416
Poems provide comfort.

223
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,958
Especially to those
who would otherwise

224
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,750
be crushed by the horrible
reality of their existence!

225
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,541
Oh, gee. Thank you?

226
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,125
I agree with her!

227
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,416
No worries, friend!

228
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:07,875
[YOSHINO] Huh. I guess the
Azumi Festival is tonight.

229
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,458
[NAGISA]
Hey, sister!

230
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,083
[YOSHINO]
Nagisa!

231
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,375
Where were you headed?

232
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,625
Can you give me a ride?

233
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,750
No, come on.
Riding on the back's illegal.

234
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,000
[NAGISA]
Aww! Gimme a break!

235
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,291
[YOSHINO]
Plus, I can't ride up this slope

236
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,416
with you on the back.

237
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,000
Nah, I think you
underestimate yourself!

238
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,333
I need to get home
and take a long bath.

239
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,833
Then change into my
yukata for tonight!

240
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,541
Oh, you are planning
to go to the festival.

241
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,208
You better!

242
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,541
[sighs]

243
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,208
You sure have it easy, huh?

244
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,750
Not a care in the world.

245
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,041
You seem kinda down.
Are you okay?

246
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,375
Yeah, it's just not
very easy to be an adult.

247
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,958
You'll find out soon enough,
whenever you move out.

248
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,750
Man, I just can't wait!

249
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,291
Have you even thought
about what you wanna do

250
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,625
after high school?

251
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,833
Those three years are
gonna fly by, believe me.

252
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,500
I don't care about
moving to Tokyo

253
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,875
or anything like that.

254
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,250
All of my friends are here,
and I really like it.

255
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,416
I don't mind if
nothing ever changes!

256
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,958
But what'll you do about work?

257
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,625
I guess Dad knows
this one company

258
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,333
that makes kamaboko
or something,

259
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,625
so Mom said they could
prob'ly get me a job there.

260
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,541
You know,
like if I wanted 'em to.

261
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,666
Good grief.

262
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,375
I guess Mom really
loves her fish cake.

263
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,041
What's wrong with kamaboko?

264
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,541
I think it'd be
a pretty great job.

265
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,291
I'd be dealing with
locally caught fish

266
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,541
and locally made kamaboko.
Cool!

267
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,916
And after work,

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,958
I could hang out with Akkun
and all my friends here.

269
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,541
And eventually I'd marry Akkun

270
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,708
and then we'd both
live happily ever after!

271
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,333
--Who's Akkun?
--[NAGISA] Boyfriend!

272
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,708
Boyfriend?! You little...

273
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,125
[NAGISA laughs]

274
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,708
Still, aren't you
worried your life plan

275
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,541
seems so expected and normal?

276
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,250
Don't you remember what
Dad has always said to us?

277
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,208
"Achieving simple,
normal happiness

278
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,833
is the hardest thing to do."

279
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,583
Oops, I killed the mood.

280
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,833
It's fine!
It doesn't change things.

281
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,666
I still want to do something
that only I can do.

282
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,000
And somewhere other than here!

283
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,166
Oh, Yoshino.

284
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,666
You're always gonna be
the little dreamer

285
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,333
of the family, aren't you?

286
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,541
[KAORU] What? Don't tell me
you still haven't quit, Yuki!

287
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:18,916
You need to get the hell out
of that company altogether.

288
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,416
Yeah. It's complicated, though.

289
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,750
How's it been having
your own company, Kaoru?

290
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,875
Hmm, we've got plenty
of pitches ready,

291
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,791
but capital is hard to come by.

292
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,041
VCs are hesitant
with young startups.

293
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,333
You've got it nice, Eri.

294
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,083
Living on one of your dad's
properties.

295
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,333
I do still have to pay
rent you know!

296
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,291
Though I guess
it is pretty cheap.

297
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,333
But enough of that.

298
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,125
Let's talk about
something else, huh?

299
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,625
Well, we could always
discuss the new

300
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,291
child-rearing subsidies system.

301
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,500
Why? You're pregnant?

302
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,666
[KAORU] Are you kidding?
No way, not me.

303
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,625
I'm talking about how
businesses are eligible

304
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,875
for these new subsidies
if they hire a mother.

305
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,083
And if you play
your cards right,

306
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,375
it ends up being
a great benefit

307
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,625
for working mothers, too.

308
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,791
It's a total win-win.

309
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,125
How 'bout you, country girl?

310
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,375
Are you planning to
stay out there forever?

311
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,708
I don't know.

312
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,541
My contract's for a year,
so I'll wait and see.

313
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,708
But isn't it boring
out in the country?

314
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,375
It's interesting in its own way,
different from the city.

315
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,000
Hey! I'm actually trying
to get a brand new project

316
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,291
off the ground right now.

317
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,916
Why don't you join me in it?

318
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,208
You could resign from
that "Ministry of IT" thing

319
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,208
way out in the
middle of nowhere.

320
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,541
My project is
much more exciting!

321
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,833
Thanks, Eri.
But believe it or not,

322
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:25,708
I actually find my current
job pretty interesting.

323
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,208
Plus, it's my duty.

324
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,833
I feel like I want to see this
thing through to the end.

325
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,125
I get it. That's too bad.

326
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,250
All right, then,
I'd be happy to join you!

327
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,500
You should get your
own company sorted first!

328
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,083
You jump at every new thing!

329
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,583
It seems like you've
really changed a lot, Sanae

330
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:41,916
[SANAE]
Huh?

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,916
[YUKI] You're so much more
assertive than you were

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,083
when you were here.

333
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,791
You seem more grounded, too.

334
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,333
Well, I don't wanna run
away from anything anymore.

335
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,666
What did you think
about my performance?

336
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,083
[MAKI]
The narrative was weak,

337
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,708
but your performance was
definitely a cut above the rest.

338
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,208
Thank you so much, Maki.

339
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,666
I know you're not someone
who throws out

340
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,875
a compliment easily,
so that means a lot from you!

341
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,125
Thanks, but I'll admit,

342
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,708
I'm more than a little
surprised we ended up

343
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,125
having dinner together.

344
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,541
I totally thought you
invited me to be polite.

345
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,250
No way! Are you kidding?

346
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,541
Don't say crazy
things like that, okay?

347
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,708
Come on, now, I want
you to drink with me.

348
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,791
To us!

349
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,333
So, have you thought
about it more since we talked?

350
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,583
[MAKI]
Hm?

351
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,833
[MOE] I meant...
Are you really done with acting?

352
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,708
Well, I don't know.

353
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,708
Do you know Ryotaro Kurose?

354
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:37,125
[MAKI]
The film director?

355
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,208
That's right.

356
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,833
He's a fresh up-and-comer.

357
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,916
He's gotten lots
of awards overseas.

358
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,375
He's got this really cool
workshop coming up, see?

359
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,625
What do you think about that?

360
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,458
What do you mean,
what do I think?

361
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,625
He might have his eye open,
looking for new talent

362
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,083
for his next project.

363
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:56,083
This could seriously be
a big chance!

364
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,166
I guess it could.

365
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,958
[MOE]
You don't need to guess, Maki!

366
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,958
You know that's what
it could very well be!

367
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,458
Come apply with me!

368
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,916
Of course, I know it's an
audition just like any other,

369
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,583
so who knows, right?

370
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,583
Come and apply with you, huh?

371
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,916
[MOE] Do you not want
to do it with me?

372
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,583
Don't tell me you're worried
that you're gonna be

373
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:15,250
the only one to get cut
or something like that.

374
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,291
It could easily
go the opposite way,

375
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,625
or both of us could
totally get cut.

376
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,000
But you can't know
what'll happen

377
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,375
unless you actually
give it a try!

378
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,791
I don't want you
to give this up!

379
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,583
It seriously breaks my heart.

380
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,875
I just wanna see
you acting again!

381
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:34,166
Thank you, Moe.
I'll think about it.

382
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,125
Okay, this is yours, then.

383
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,375
That's the end of
all serious-talk.

384
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,458
I swear I'll talk about only
fun things now, okay?

385
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,541
[giggles]
Oh! Get this!

386
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,000
The author of this play
is a huge fan of Sonoda,

387
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,000
the director!

388
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,041
So, he wrote--

389
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,958
[CROWD chattering]

390
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,875
[NAGISA] I think Azumi
Festival is the one thing

391
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,791
that has stayed exactly the same
ever since we were little.

392
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,333
What are you talking about?

393
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,291
Nothing has changed around here.
It's not just the festival!

394
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,250
How can you say that?
That's not true!

395
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:06,750
For example,
the elementary school

396
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,625
has air conditioning now.

397
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,541
They sure didn't have
that when we were little.

398
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:11,750
I'll be honest, though.

399
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,125
When we were little,
I did look forward to

400
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,333
the Azumi Festival
every single year.

401
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,208
I'd brag to the kids
in the next town over

402
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,833
about our shrine floats and all.

403
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,916
[NAGISA gasps]

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,208
Hey, over here!

405
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,666
I'll see you later, sis!

406
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,041
I'm going to check out
the festival with Akkun!

407
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,541
[YUIKA]
Oh, Yoshino!

408
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,541
I can't believe you're
back in town!

409
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:35,666
[YOSHINO laughs]

410
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,375
Yuika! Miyako! And Natsuki!

411
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,458
It's been a while!

412
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,708
We've been seeing you online!

413
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,541
You gorgeous queen, you!

414
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,000
Thank you, peasant.
You may approach us.

415
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,791
[MIYAKO]
As you command, my queen!

416
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,708
[BOTH laugh]

417
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,041
How are you guys?

418
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,333
Are you doing well?

419
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,833
[YUIKA] Heh! Believe it or not,
I'm a mom now.

420
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:56,041
[YOSHINO gasps]
Is it a boy or a girl?

421
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,875
I have twins,
a boy and a girl.

422
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,958
Where are they?
I wanna meet them!

423
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,958
[YUIKA] They're actually at
home tonight with my husband.

424
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,416
Oh, well, that's too bad.

425
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,666
Wait, how come Saku
isn't with you guys?

426
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,000
[MIYAKO] I guess she's
busy running the festival.

427
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,125
I thought she was in
New Residents Support?

428
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:13,250
Oh, that doesn't
matter for the festival.

429
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,875
They're always shorthanded.

430
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,666
Azumi Matsuri has grown
pretty popular recently.

431
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,500
People even come from
other prefectures.

432
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,041
I guess it does
seem like more people

433
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,458
than there used to be.

434
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,750
Oh, Grandma's here!

435
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,125
I'll see you later!

436
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,083
[YOSHINO]
Okay!

437
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,416
[NATSUKI]
All right!

438
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Time for me to be off
to carry the shrine float!

439
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,791
Nobody's changed, have they?

440
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,500
You should move back, Yoshino!

441
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:38,750
[SOICHIRO]
Yoshino!

442
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,916
[YOSHINO]
Oh, hi, Dad!

443
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,541
I'm gonna get
going now, I guess.

444
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,166
It was so good to see you!

445
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,833
[YOSHINO]
You, too! Later!

446
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,541
[YAE]
Nagisa isn't with you?

447
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,333
Uh... heh.

448
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,000
Um, she was.

449
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,541
Is she with Akkun now?

450
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,916
Yeah! She is!

451
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,708
So you guys do know about him.

452
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,041
[SOICHIRO laughs]

453
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,833
Well, it's not like they
have a reason to hide it!

454
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,416
My very first date
with your mother

455
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,291
was a night at a festival,
in fact, wasn't it?

456
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,833
That's right!

457
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,041
And I had missed the bus and
was afraid that I'd be too late.

458
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,541
So your grandpa
had to drive me

459
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,333
to my first date
with your father!

460
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,625
But you're not originally
from Azumigaura.

461
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,750
Must have been quite
the drive, huh, Mom?

462
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,875
[YAE]
That's right.

463
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,791
I was raised a lot
closer to the city.

464
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,041
Thought so.

465
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,541
What was it that made
you decide to live here?

466
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:25,000
What do you mean? Isn't it
obvious? I was here, of course!

467
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,083
Sure, that was part of it!

468
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,791
But I also genuinely thought
that this was a lovely town.

469
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,666
I thought, "I could
live in a place like this!"

470
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,583
[SOICHIRO] I went right for it
and asked her out on a date.

471
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,500
The first thing
I wanted her to see

472
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,125
was this town where I
lived and had built my life.

473
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,333
[YOSHINO]
A place everyone returns to.

474
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,250
A place where people gather.

475
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,958
A place you want
to brag about.

476
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,750
What is it?

477
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,375
It's nothing,
I just thought it was nice.

478
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,500
I'm suddenly really glad
that I came home to visit.

479
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,083
You came back outta nowhere,
and you seemed kind of down.

480
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,541
I wondered what had
happened to bring you home.

481
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,958
Yeah, sorry about that.

482
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,375
I'll make sure that
I can come back

483
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,208
with my head
held high next time.

484
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,333
Maybe it would
be good if I went

485
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,916
to visit you
there sometime first.

486
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,208
In Manoyama?

487
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,583
[SOICHIRO] We all went
there together once

488
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,083
when you were little.

489
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,958
The cherry blossoms were
beautiful there, remember?

490
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,458
Was Nagisa not
born yet at that point?

491
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,708
That's right!

492
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:38,791
We can bring Nagisa and
Akkun along this time!

493
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,333
Wow! Akkun, too?

494
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,375
What, what?
What're you talking about?

495
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,000
[SOICHIRO]
Well, speak of the devil!

496
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,583
[YOSHINO] Oh, that grilled
squid looks delicious!

497
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,416
[NAGISA]
Want some?

498
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
[YOSHINO]
Are you sure?

499
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,750
Okay, yeah!

500
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,916
[SOICHIRO] Yeah, I think
we should take credit

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,541
for them being good kids.

502
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,833
Hmm... Not bad, ladies!

503
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,750
Thanks! That means so much!

504
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,750
"Manoyama B&amp;B Proposal."

505
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,500
I feel sure we can
apply with this!

506
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:08,125
Except it won't
be easy to comply

507
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,291
with all the laws the
hospitality industry has,

508
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,125
you know.

509
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,541
We can do it!

510
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,875
I think we should start by
seeing what kind of shape

511
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,250
the open houses are in!

512
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,125
This one is a little
far from the station,

513
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,208
I know, but it's still pretty
new and in great shape.

514
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,750
If the owner said it was okay,
I think it could work well.

515
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,916
Someone's there.

516
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,291
Is anyone here?

517
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,291
We're just with
the Board of Tourism!

518
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,708
I wonder if this could be what
Kindaichi was talking about.

519
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,791
The prowler sneaking
into empty houses?

520
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,958
[RIRIKO]
Mm-hmm.

521
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,791
[GROUP]
Hola! Hola!

522
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,291
[speaking Spanish]

523
00:21:50,250 --> 00:22:00,208
[speaking Spanish]

524
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,625
[Spanish continues]

525
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,583
[SANDAL] The Lamaze
breathing method goes

526
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,125
"hee hee hoo!" Like that.

527
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:46,416
"Hee hee hoo, hee hee hoo!" 

528
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,166
Next time:
"The Queen's Return."
