00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,583
I certainly never would have
thought they'd come to Manoyama!

157
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,333
I wonder if our shop
will be on TV?

158
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,791
They want the Board
to set up food stalls?

159
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,208
This area, between the
gate and the palace.

160
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,541
That'll get the most
foot traffic, I think.

161
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,166
Really, I couldn't
care less about

162
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,458
celebrating that silly
Kingdom's anniversary.

163
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,958
[AMAMIYA grunts]

164
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,541
[CHITOSE] It's fine that they're
asking us to set up food,

165
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,666
but if the place ends up being
empty, that would be a disaster.

166
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,916
No, it's okay. People will
come to this. Probably.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,958
And how do you know that?

168
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,708
Everyone is working so
hard to support Manoyama.

169
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,333
Case in point,
I'll help with the food.

170
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,208
Okay, then.

171
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,458
I'll talk things over with
the Board of Merchants.

172
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,708
Thanks, Grandma.

173
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:30,333
Young man, I want you to
make sure to use that part.

174
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,458
[AMAMIYA] Do you think it's fair
to say that the Queen's passion

175
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,916
for rural rejuvenation
was what ultimately led

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,583
you join the team here?

177
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,708
You're wro-- right.

178
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,083
Tell me honestly, Ms. Oribe,

179
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,708
how do you feel
about the Queen?

180
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,791
Well, she always seems
to understand me,

181
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,708
so I like her pretty well.

182
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,166
I understand your role here
is the Minister of Puma.

183
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,250
Do you particularly like pumas?

184
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,291
No, I'm Minister of UMA, or uma,

185
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,958
which is not the
same as puma at all.

186
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,958
It's a term created by
a Japanese person.

187
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,583
What they're actually
called is "cryptids"

188
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,708
and they're fascinating.

189
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,791
I'm currently studying
the Mothman.

190
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,875
His composition's linked
to the digestive system of

191
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
both humans and insects,
which suggests--

192
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,375
[YOSHINO] I propose a toast.
To our great work today!

193
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,875
[ALL]
To our great work today!

194
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,708
Here you go, girls!

195
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,375
Manoyama's official new
specialty, the Happy Somen!

196
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,208
I apologize for the wait.

197
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,958
No worries! Thank you, Erika.

198
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,291
We're truly pleased to
have you back, as always.

199
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,500
Hold the phone. Are you
wearing make-up tonight?

200
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,708
[ERIKA] Why don't I get that
out of the way for you, sir?

201
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,583
Hey, no one said
I was done, though!

202
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,666
[BOTH giggle]

203
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,750
Is there a problem
or something, Amamiya?

204
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,958
Go ahead and stop recording.

205
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,000
The truth is, I've just been
trying to figure out how

206
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,541
I can frame the queen.

207
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,041
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

208
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,625
The others have all had a touch
of drama to their stories,

209
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,083
you know? But so far,

210
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,750
it feels like you don't really
have anything like that.

211
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,000
[YOSHINO gasps]

212
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,208
[AMAMIYA] You failed to
find work out of college

213
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,125
and were crowned due
to mistaken identity.

214
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,708
It works as an initial hook,
but honestly,

215
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,875
I want an element that will
move our viewers a little more.

216
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,416
Move them how, exactly?

217
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,416
Yeah, it just feels a
little too "normal".

218
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,916
Could you please not
call me "normal", okay?

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
[SHIORI exhales]

220
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,208
[KUME] How's it going?
Is it good? The footage?

221
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,750
Thank you for the tea.

222
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,375
Yeah, I was able to get most of
the comment sections shot.

223
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,666
[KUME] Well, good for you,
but everyone is a little bit

224
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,875
worried that it might not
be that entertaining.

225
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,666
They shouldn't be.
Honestly, I have a secret plan.

226
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,166
[SHIORI]
Yoshi.

227
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,500
[YOSHINO]
Hm.

228
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,458
I wish he hadn't said that
to you. There are plenty

229
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,625
of ways that you aren't
normal at all, really!

230
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,875
Yeah. Hm?

231
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,250
He was being provocative.
It's all for TV ratings.

232
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,458
Maybe I am just normal, though.

233
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,166
I had hoped that being
made Queen here

234
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,083
could maybe change that. But it
feels like I'm the only one

235
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,500
who hasn't really grown at all.

236
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,000
That's not true!

237
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:57,416
If anything, you're just a late
bloomer, that's all it is!

238
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,625
I know all of us have
definitely been influenced

239
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,416
by you to some degree.

240
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,291
Yeah, a bit.

241
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, I second that.

242
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,875
Thanks, you guys.

243
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,041
[ALL chuckle]

244
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,041
So, what were you
doing in here, anyway?

245
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,125
Do you mean you
really don't know?

246
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,625
That little girl
right there is Yoshi!

247
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,375
[SANAE]
What? Really?

248
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,583
[RIRIKO] The 10,000th visitor
to the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

249
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,250
[SANAE] Well, that's some
real life drama!

250
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,833
Why haven't you said anything?

251
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,041
Amamiya is going to
cry tears of joy!

252
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,666
Oh, you think so?

253
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,166
Yeah, and I bet you Mr. Kadota

254
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,291
would go straight up
bonkers over it, too.

255
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,250
[RIRIKO] The Queen of destiny,
chosen by the heavens! Chupa!

256
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,958
The legends were all
totally true! Kabura!

257
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,791
He'll be a pain,
let's keep it a secret.

258
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,625
[YOSHINO]
Mm. Agreed.

259
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,125
I have some bad news. We were
only able to raise 30 percent

260
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,708
of our sponsorship goal.

261
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,875
At this rate, we'll be forced
to reduce the scale of the

262
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:55,541
trivia contest, for sure.

263
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,291
We can't! That's the biggest
draw of the whole festival!

264
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,791
[RIRIKO] We could get rid of
the grand prize trip to Guam.

265
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,625
If we do that, we won't get
any guests from outside of town!

266
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,875
Our first goal has to
be getting them here.

267
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,500
And then, once they're here,
we'll give them a bunch of

268
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,083
coupons so they'll stay.

269
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
And so they'll come back.
That's the ultimate goal.

270
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,708
[YOSHINO]
Hm.

271
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,375
It's good that you're trying to
extend the value of the event,

272
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,125
but how do you plan on
covering that in the budget?

273
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,083
I think it might be a
little too much to ask

274
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,583
of the Board of Merchants.

275
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,583
There's no way that old hag
would listen to us, anyway.

276
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,750
We can't ask them
for any more.

277
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,166
Then there's the issue
with traffic management.

278
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,625
We've hired some part-timers,
but it's not enough.

279
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,375
So, what should we do, now?

280
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,166
[door clatters]

281
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,958
[AMAMIYA]\
Excuse me.

282
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,333
I did it! I honestly did it!

283
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,458
Brace yourselves:
Ptolemaios has just agreed

284
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:42,125
to play at the
Founding Festival!

285
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,250
[ALL]
Huh?

286
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,750
You mean the Ptolemaios?

287
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:45,500
[YAMADA]
You're kidding!

288
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,750
Wow!

289
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,875
Ptolemaios. He advocated
for Geocentrism...

290
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,250
[MAKI]
No, Rii- <i>chan</i> , not Ptolemy,

291
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,375
What's that?
Talkin' bout Tally-who?

292
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,041
It's a band called Ptolemaios!

293
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,708
They've just had
their big break!

294
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,125
Tickets to their shows
sell out instantly!

295
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,791
[MINO]
My wife's a huge fan of theirs.

296
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,291
[MAKI] Hey, it's the soda
commercial that Moe's in!

297
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,416
[YAMADA]
That's right!

298
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,375
Their song's in the
swimsuit version!

299
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,875
You mean it? Those guys
are really coming here?

300
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,958
They are. I used some
connections I made

301
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,041
back in my old
college media club.

302
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,958
That led me to their
managers in Tokyo.

303
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,583
--[ALL gasp]
--[SHIORI] So cool!

304
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,708
Seriously, this is
pretty amazing.

305
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,541
I'm sure they wouldn't
normally do an event

306
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,041
in the middle of nowhere, right?

307
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,250
This concert alone will
probably draw people

308
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:28,750
here from the entire country.

309
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,916
Ha! You very much remind me
of my young self, you know.

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,291
I like you a lot, chupa.

311
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,208
But there's no way we could
possibly have the budget

312
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,291
for such a famous act!

313
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,208
Nothing to worry about.
It's all taken care of.

314
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,750
My boss has agreed to make it
an official corporate event

315
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,083
for our network.

316
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,708
It will be an excellent
opportunity for us, also.

317
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,791
[YOSHINO] Okay, so, just to
clarify, does that mean

318
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,958
that Northern Living will
be covering the costs?

319
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,458
Correct, that burden
is not on you and now

320
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,541
we can openly promote
the Founding Festival.

321
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,083
Honestly, it kills two
birds with one stone.

322
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,833
It's amazing.
That's free publicity!

323
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,416
Everyone involved
will benefit from this.

324
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,750
It's a genuine win-win!

325
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,875
Oh, but we had planned
to hold the trivia contest

326
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,291
in that big area right
in front of the palace.

327
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,791
You can go on ahead with
whatever you have planned.

328
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,208
We'll handle the show
from here on out.

329
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,041
Right now, we intend to use
that area down by the pond.

330
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,416
You sure that'll work okay?

331
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,666
Won't there be
problems with sound?

332
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,250
"Are you sure?", "But, this,"
"Are you sure?", "But, that."

333
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,666
[ALL]
Huh?

334
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,166
[AMAMIYA] Quitters are forever
coming up with excuses.

335
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,791
That's why Manoyama will
always be a middle-of-nowhere

336
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,500
Podunk town! This is
a huge chance for you!

337
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,416
What could possibly
make you hesitate?

338
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,541
Honestly, nothing!

339
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,750
[YOSHINO, SHIORI gasp]

340
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,416
[AMAMIYA] I'm sorry. Let's just
tackle this head-on, okay?

341
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,666
Head-on.

342
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,541
At least we know he's
a little bit passionate

343
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,750
about the project.

344
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,375
Well, the show is called
"Moving Mountains".

345
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,583
Okay, let's check in with
our guy in the field!

346
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,375
Apparently he's got a pretty
big announcement for us!

347
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,875
Let's give him a call! Amamiya!

348
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,791
Hello! I'm here, back in
my hometown of Manoyama,

349
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,291
visiting the Kingdom
of Chupakabura!

350
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,333
Pretty chill, huh?
Just a palace, no big deal!

351
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,666
[KUME laughs]

352
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,666
He's actually not
too bad, really.

353
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,208
And here are the members
of the wonderful

354
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,541
Manoyama Tourism Board.
Hi there, ladies!

355
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,000
Hi! Great to be here!

356
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,916
[KUME] Oh! Might those five
lovely young women be...?

357
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,666
That's right!
Those in the know, know!

358
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,125
They're the Manoyama
Revival Gals!

359
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,791
Honestly, aren't they so lovely?

360
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:22,958
[GIRLS chuckle]

361
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,125
Well then, the Kingdom's
Founding Festival,

362
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,625
being held on August 27th,

363
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,541
is right around the corner,
and as a very special guest,

364
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,666
they've got none other than--

365
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,750
A frozen mammoth is coming!

366
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,333
[YOSHINO]
Get off!

367
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,791
[AMAMIYA] Actually, there's no
mammoth, frozen or totherwise.

368
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,291
But! The famous rock band
Ptolemaios will be playing!

369
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,625
[KUME]
Wow! That is a surprise!

370
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,666
[AMAMIYA] More details as soon
as we have them! Stay tuned!

371
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,958
Take it away, Gals!

372
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,208
Come on down, chupa!

373
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,500
[GIRLS]
To Manoyama, kabura!

374
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,125
[SANAE sighs]

375
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,708
Jeez, that totally
wiped me out.

376
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,500
Well, this was our first time
on a national live broadcast!

377
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,791
So we're "Revival Gals", huh?

378
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,083
Oh, man,
they're already posting.

379
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,916
I don't like these
people's tone.

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,375
Isn't it good that they're
talking about it, though?

381
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,000
But what's with this
"gals" thing? Can we not?

382
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,375
I guess Amamiya can be a little
on the heavy-handed side, huh?

383
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,875
Yeah, there's no
doubt about that.

384
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,083
But at least he is passionate
about improving Manoyama.

385
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,875
And we do have our goal
of 6,000 attendees.

386
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,625
I can put up with him if
he brings in more people.

387
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,250
And I support any
decisions you make, Yoshi.

388
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,833
Thanks.

389
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,250
I think we need to do whatever
we can to make the concert work.

390
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,125
So, in that case, with regards
to the trivia contest budget,

391
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,625
It might be time to bring
out the battering ram.

392
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,625
Sounds pretty intense.

393
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:36,541
We'll smash it head-on!

394
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,375
[YOSHINO] To the Board of
Merchants, the Community Club,

395
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,541
and all other attending groups,
thank you very much

396
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,875
for taking the time to
gather together like this.

397
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,000
I came here today to
ask some favors of you.

398
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,791
For the upcoming Chupakabura
Founding Festival,

399
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,708
we are planning on making the
main event a trivia contest,

400
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,875
open to anyone who
wants to participate.

401
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,375
We anticipate it being popular.

402
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,000
However, we don't
have enough staff,

403
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,375
so if anyone here would
be available to volunteer,

404
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,375
we'd certainly
appreciate your help.

405
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,000
Can I be blunt here? If you
don't have enough people,

406
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,750
why don't you just do what
you can with what you have?

407
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,166
Maybe limit the participants?

408
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,291
Thanks for that point,
Takamizawa.

409
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,958
The festival's purpose is to
introduce as many people as

410
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,458
we can to the town.

411
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,833
The trivia questions will even
be set up to teach people

412
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,125
all about Manoyaman
products and landmarks.

413
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,333
The members of the board will
already have their hands full

414
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,375
running the food stalls.

415
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,625
[NOGE] Do you think anyone
will actually show up?

416
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,958
We had that one Founding
Festival ten years ago,

417
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,291
but it was a big flop.

418
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,125
Nobody goes to the
Kingdom itself anymore.

419
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,666
Well, we have news for you!

420
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,958
Ptolemaios will be coming to
play at the Founding Festival!

421
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,666
[TOWNSFOLK]
Huh?

422
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,416
[ANGELICA]
Wait, like the astronomer?

423
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
They're a super popular
band right now!

424
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,708
You know, they've got that
song in the soda commercial?

425
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,250
Oh!

426
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,916
[YOSHINO] We're working with
the TV network's event division,

427
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,083
so we'll have more
attendees than ever before!

428
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,125
It's a perfect opportunity to
raise interest in Manoyama!

429
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,833
You mentioned a second favor.
What's that about?

430
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,166
It's about the prize
for the trivia contest.

431
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,708
What we'd like to do is give out
coupons that can be used

432
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,583
all around Manoyama to
anyone who participates.

433
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,166
They'd be 500 yen a person,
and look like this.

434
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,875
But who will cover the cost
of those goods and services?

435
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,166
We can't possibly use
the city's subsidies

436
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,750
for something like that, can we?

437
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,583
Correct, we can't.

438
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,666
And we weren't able to raise as
many sponsorships as we needed.

439
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,833
Oh, no! Why was that?

440
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,333
Go ahead and pull that
back to a wide shot.

441
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,291
[NUNOBE] Are you telling us
that we should sacrifice

442
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,375
for the stupid Kingdom? Why on
earth would we ever do that?

443
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,625
I'm sure that it probably sounds
like a very selfish request,

444
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,791
but we truly need your help

445
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,625
to make the Founding
Festival a success!

446
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,458
Well isn't that
convenient for you?

447
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:50,083
[YOSHINO gasps]
Convenient?

448
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,583
Don't give up.

449
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,000
This is for the town, isn't it?

450
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,833
This is for your hometown,
am I right?

451
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:01,041
Don't you want the town
you live in to bustle?

452
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,208
To come alive and keep growing?

453
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,333
Isn't it important to get people
to come back to Manoyama,

454
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,541
over and over?
Again and again?

455
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,250
You don't understand.
Think about it.

456
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,916
Getting more tourists isn't
actually going to help

457
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,833
a bookstore!

458
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,208
Or a tatami mat shop, either.

459
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,708
Okay, then, what if we
limited it to restaurants?

460
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,333
Then you ought to make the bus
free for them at the same time.

Don't be ridiculous.

[NOGE] That's what
they're basically saying,

463
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,250
though, isn't it?

464
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,125
You know. I think
it's a great idea.

465

[MEN]
Huh?

466
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,333
[KUMANO] These people are making
the trip all the way out here

467
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,958
after all and
that's something.

468
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,416
We can give them
a little discount

469
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,458
and if they tell their
friends, we'll profit!

470
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,708
[ANGELICA]
Hm. Well, Yoshi, I'm in.

471
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,083
Thanks, Angelica.

472
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,916
Each of our products
are pretty expensive,

473
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,916
so I'm not sure how
much it'll help you,

474
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,166
but it feels a whole lot
better than doing nothing.

475
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,958
Don't you think so?

476
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:57,000
Alright, Yoshino. This festival
is for Manoyama, correct?

477
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,250
Since that's the case,

478
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,291
the Board of Merchants
will lighten your load.

479
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,750
Will you, really?!

480
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,208
But surely you don't expect
all of us to participate!

481
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,375
The Board of Merchants has
always had a reserve fund,

482
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,791
hasn't it?

483
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,166
If we don't use it at time
like this, when would we?

484
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,916
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

485
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,666
Okay, the Community Club is in!

486
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,791
We don't have money,
but we have volunteers!

487
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,166
Uh, me too?

488
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,916
They organized the
matchmaking tour for you!

489
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,041
Well, I guess I could
maybe volunteer.

490
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:26,500
Everyone. Thank you
so very much!

491
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,500
If we're going to do it, we
might as well do it right,

492
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,000
is what I think.

493

[TAKAMIZAWA] We're behind you,
Queen! And you, ministers!

Thank you again, everyone!

This is great!

Yeah!

499

[AMAMIYA] Okay, I've got a
question for you, Queen.

500
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,250
Alright!

501

[AMAMIYA]
Can you tell me, honestly,

502
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,208
what effect your efforts
at rural rejuvenation

503
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,041
have had on the town so far?

504
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,041
Well, I-- nope!
You'll see at the festival!

[YOSHINO]
Yeah.

508
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,208
It's weird, I feel like they're
trying to show us how much

509
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,375
more they have invested in this.

510
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,416
Well, what I say is, if we
can use it, we should.

511
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,291
I guess, if it'll make
everyone happy, then yeah.

512
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,166
Just like the song, though,
it started with a mistake.

Huh?

514
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,208
You're doing a really
good job here, kid.

515

Your hard work brings glory to
the name of the Queen, chupa.

I think you're being
way too kind, kabura.
