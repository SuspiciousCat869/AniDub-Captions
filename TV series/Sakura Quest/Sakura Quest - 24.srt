1
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,875
[USHIMATSU] I think we may be
facing the end of Manoyama.

2
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,250
[YOSHINO]
What?

3
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,708
[USHIMATSU] I've been
hearing rumors for a while,

4
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,333
but plans are apparently
moving forward, now.

5
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,250
We'll be absorbed into Tomikura.

6
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,208
[gasps]

7
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,375
We'll be what?

8
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,708
As head of Manoyama's
Board of Tourism.

9
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:57,458
I've been secretly invited to
serve on the Absorption Council.

10
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,625
[YOSHINO sighs]
Absorption.

11
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,375
[MAKI] I always figured it
was only a matter of time

12
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,291
before something
like that happened.

13
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,875
Surely, it's not happening
right away though, right?

14
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,208
Well, normally,
they set up a council

15
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,791
and then slowly start
to readjust things

16
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,708
while getting residents'
opinions along the way.

17
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,875
It can take up to two years.

18
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,291
So, in two years,
Manoyama might be gone.

19
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,375
It might be gone in name,
but it's not going to disappear!

20
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,125
Yeah, the district
names might stay,

21
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,500
but oftentimes, a city gets
renamed something weird

22
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,166
after being absorbed.

23
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,083
As far as I can tell
from these examples,

24
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,958
it doesn't seem like
all that bad of a thing

25
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,625
to happen to a town.

26
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,916
But, I'm not ready
to say goodbye

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to the Manoyama of my childhood.

28
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,083
It's incredibly sad.

29
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,916
That's why what we do
now is so important!

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,083
We have to work hard.

31
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,125
We'll keep Manoyaman
culture alive!

32
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,333
That should be our goal

33
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,208
while we're planning
the Mizuchi Festival!

34
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:55,291
We'll fill it with things
Manoyamans hold dear,

35
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,041
and all they want
to keep holding dear.

36
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,250
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,000
Sitting here worrying
isn't going to help.

38
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,208
[YOSHINO]
Nope!

39
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,500
We need to focus our
efforts on making sure

40
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,875
the Mizuchi Festival
is a great success!

41
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:10,708
[YOSHINO]
Nice!

42
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,541
We can start hanging
them up all over town!

43
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,125
[YAMADA]
Hey, the happi have arrived!

44
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,041
Wow!

45
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:16,000
They're so cute!

46
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,583
Go on, try one on, Yoshi!

47
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,250
Sure!

48
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,333
Look at this!

49
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,916
Too bad we only have enough
for council members

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,166
and people carrying the float.

51
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,958
You know what would be awesome?

52
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,333
If we could get enough happi

53
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,666
for all the different people
that are helping out.

54
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,500
I'm afraid that's just
not possible on our budget.

55
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,000
Lemme dream, huh?

56
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,916
Good morning, Mr. Kadota!

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,083
[USHIMATSU]
Hey.

58
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,791
Today, let the festival
make you forget

59
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,333
all about the absorption!

60
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,750
And if you can't forget,
we'll expand our territory,

61
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,250
and call ourselves
Chupakabura City.

62
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,958
Or, maybe we won't
attempt any of that at all.

63
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,500
Hmph! You're a fool.

64
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,500
Wow, kinda looks like
all this talk about absorption

65
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,458
has been quite
a shock for the boss.

66
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,208
Is it bad that I'm
hoping it might make him

67
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,500
calm down a bit, though?

68
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,708
In his youth he was apparently
always known as the young fool.

69
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,333
He's already lost
the young part,

70
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,375
so, is he really going to
lose the foolish part next?

71
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,750
Isn't that good?

72
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,916
I don't know.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think it's kind
of sad, to be honest.

74
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,791
My dear queen,
you're adopting his crazy.

75
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,958
[USHIMATSU]
Hey, I know her!

76
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,166
I know this creature!

77
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,833
This is the dragon girl
and she's a menace!

78
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,000
[SHIBUKAWA]
What's so menacing about her?

79
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,375
Well, boy, if she's
actually a dragon,

80
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,500
then she's got to be
a menace, period!

81
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,750
Dragons are extremely
intelligent creatures, though.

82
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,208
If we decide to befriend her
and receive her knowledge,

83
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,208
she could help the
village tremendously.

84
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,166
What on earth
are you talking about?

85
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,541
Befriending a dragon is
totally absurd, Elder!

86
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,708
[TAIRA]
People of the village!

87
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:43,958
Which are you going to believe?

88
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,000
The words of the Elder
or those of the Chief?

89
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,291
Did they come to you, too?

90
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,750
Are you on the council?

91
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,625
Yes, they contacted
me yesterday.

92
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,208
I've been wondering what
would be the best thing

93
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,791
for the future of the town.

94
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,541
What are you so upset about?

95
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,916
Manoyama has survived
as long as it has

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,750
by getting knowledge
from outside,

97
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,041
and then, consistently
changing with it.

98
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,208
We had completely forgotten
that important part of our past,

99
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,541
but the queen, an outsider,
has thankfully reminded us.

100
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,083
Yes, I am fully
aware of all of that.

101
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:19,958
Then, see?

102
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,416
There's nothing to worry about.

103
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,958
So, before we start
squabbling over absorption,

104
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,583
there's one thing
that we should do.

105
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,541
We have to commit to
making completely certain

106
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:31,416
that future generations
don't forget, the way we did.

107
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,291
[USHIMATSU]
Hmm...

108
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,875
[ANGELICA]
Welp, there we go!

109
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,541
Hey, by the way, I heard
about the absorption thing.

110
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,083
Yeah, I guess the time
has finally come, huh?

111
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,250
Getting absorbed by
Tomikura will be totally boring.

112
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,458
We should join
Harajuku, instead!

113
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,291
I'm not sure
that's how it works.

114
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,916
I like absorbent things.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,916
It helps a lot if they
happen to be quilted, too.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,583
We're not a paper towel, though.

117
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,333
So, are all you guys
completely against this?

118
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,916
Well, yeah, I'd rather
not get absorbed, right?

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,625
I don't know, Manoyama's
budget is pretty tight,

120
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,458
so if we get absorbed
by Tomikura,

121
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,708
it'll probably end up improving
quite a few things around here.

122
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,250
We'll be the minority though,

123
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,666
so it will be hard to
get them to listen to us.

124
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,416
And then, there's a good chance
our culture and traditions

125
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,041
will be discarded and forgotten.

126
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,041
Even if we revive the festival,

127
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:22,541
you think it won't be enough
to pass those things down?

128
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,208
Look, remember, what's important
is how strongly everyone feels

129
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,458
about keeping the
Mizuchi festival alive.

130
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,000
That's a good thing.

131
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,458
It'll be just fine.

132
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,375
I'm sure!

133
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,458
Yes!

134
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,250
We'll make it so
awesome that everyone

135
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,541
will be sure to love it!

136
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,791
And, we can always have
a local referendum, too.

137
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,333
In the end, the
responsibility's all up to us.

138
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,916
[door opens]

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,125
[ANGELICA]
Welcome, sir!

140
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,416
[YOSHINO]
Amamiya?

141
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
It's good to see you again.

142
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,791
Been a long time since
the Founding Festival.

143
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,166
Anyhow, I heard you
might be here, so...

144
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,250
I'm glad you found me.

145
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,541
What's going on?

146
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,625
Well I...

147
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,375
Look, honestly,

148
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,708
there's something
I wanted share with you.

149
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:00,833
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

150
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,833
[MAKI]
Huh?!

151
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,541
What do you mean,
"casting change"?

152
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,166
They want you to put
a local idol in the play.

153
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,541
Some star from
Northern Living Television.

154
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,041
[MAKI]
What the hell?

155
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,583
The idols are all in the variety
show that Kume hosts, too.

156
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,500
They say that their
idol would, of course,

157
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,458
play the role of
the dragon girl,

158
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,333
and they also want her
to take Riichan's place

159
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,041
in singing the dragon song.

160
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:23,625
Wha?

161
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,125
Kind of pushy.

162
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:27,041
He's got the
prime-time live slot,

163
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
and he's willing
to let us use up all of it

164
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,916
for a live broadcast
of the Mizuchi Festival.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,125
Man, I don't know,
I mean, even if he is--

166
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,333
Uh! No worries!

167
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,750
Of course we aren't
going to agree to that.

168
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,000
Right.

169
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,416
That's why Amamiya came
to give us a heads up.

170
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,166
Kume is going to be stopping
by with a proposal for you.

171
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,833
Think very carefully
about what it would mean

172
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:49,208
for Manoyama, before you reply.

173
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,125
"Honestly"? He's on our side?

174
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,875
He apologized for what happened
with "Moving Mountains."

175
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,083
Kume edited it to
maximize their ratings,

176
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,625
and Amamiya couldn't
very well go against him.

177
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,083
Apparently, it was not
what Amamiya wanted.

178
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,250
I think it'll just be a repeat
of the Founding Festival.

179
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,666
I feel like we should
definitely refuse.

180
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,708
Still...

181
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,500
[MAKI]
A TV broadcast.

182
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,458
Considering how many people
would learn about the festival,

183
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,666
turning him down outright might
be a little foolish on our part.

184
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:19,750
[YOSHINO] We all really
put our heads together

185
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,916
to come up with
these compromises.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,916
She can take
the role of a villager,

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,125
or she can not
participate in the play,

188
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,000
but instead come to
the festival to do a report

189
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,458
on the food there.

190
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,041
[USHIMATSU]
I've got a question.

191
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,500
Huh?

192
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:34,958
Are these proposals based
on what you'd actually like

193
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,583
to have happen with this thing?

194
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,083
You don't think you'll
regret it later?

195
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
Don't think so. I don't know.

196
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,666
[YAMADA] Northern Living
Television is here!

197
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,708
[USHIMATSU]
Hmm?

198
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,250
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

199
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,416
[KUME]
Well, what do you think?

200
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,416
They're all pretty cute,
aren't they?

201
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,875
We're really looking forward

202
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:51,916
to working with
you again, Mr. Kadota!

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,541
Ah! Here's a thought!

204
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,416
After the Mizuchi Festival,

205
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,333
maybe you could also
consider one of them

206
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,375
to be the next
Queen of Manoyama!

207
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,416
Listen, we really appreciate
you bringing this to us,

208
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,708
but we were hoping
you'd take a look

209
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,833
at our suggestions now.

210
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,875
Suggestions?

211
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,291
Well, yeah. So, for example--

212
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,500
We won't negotiate!

213
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,125
Sorry, but we're through here.

214
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,333
We can't possibly
accept this proposal.

215
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,458
Wait, hang on now!

216
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,750
What seems to be
the problem, Mr. Kadota?

217
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,916
Having the festival
broadcast live isn't exactly

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,125
a bad deal for Manoyama!

219
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,958
I've heard there
are talks of Tomikura

220
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,875
absorbing Manoyama, too.

221
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,791
It's all the more reason
to really put this festival

222
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,041
on display, and try to--

223
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,541
We're trying to revive
a traditional festival!

224
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,791
It's imperative that we be
able to do things <i>our</i> way!

225
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:37,625
[KUME]
Of course, but--

226
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,125
This festival
belongs to Manoyama!

227
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,333
We're not going
to let you mess with it!

228
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,125
Uh...

229
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,250
[MINO]
Jeez, boss!

230
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,791
Did you have to yell
at him like that?

231
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,500
[YAMADA] I know we can't accept
all of the proposal, as-is,

232
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,958
but I think it would have
been better to negotiate a bit

233
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,583
and have the chance
to show off our town on--

234
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,750
Oh, shut up!

235
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,166
The word "negotiate"
has never been

236
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,666
a part of my vocabulary!

237
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,166
What? What? What's so funny?

238
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,666
Sorry.

239
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,916
Nothing, really, just thinking
you're a fool, that's all.

240
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,875
You're certainly
one to talk, Queen.

241
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, stop.

242
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,291
You just happened
to remind me of it.

243
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,791
I hope, when I'm older,

244
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,791
I'll still be as much of
a young fool as you are!

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,750
So, now, the Shrine
Float is seaworthy!

246
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,458
On the night of
the Mizuchi Festival,

247
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,500
this float will make
its way around the city,

248
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,000
and then return to Sakura Pond!

249
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,375
[RIRIKO]
Cut. Okay.

250
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,958
People of Manoyama,

251
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,750
get ready for the
Mizuchi Festival revival!

252
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,666
The countdown is
a really good idea, I think.

253
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,375
[SANAE] And we'll upload
new content daily, too,

254
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,250
so it stays fresh!

255
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,166
Look, lots of people are already
posting clips of their own!

256
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,875
This is so fun!

257
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,916
My car is ready to go!

258
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,375
It's decked out
in festival mode.

259
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,041
[RIRIKO] Masa's bragging
about his big kabura again.

260
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,916
Looks like he's
counting down, too.

261
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,166
[SANAE] Hey, did Kosuke figure
out where he's going to college?

262
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,541
A music college in Tomikura,
majoring in percussion.

263
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:13,916
Wow!

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,291
He's really going to be
a professional taiko player!

265
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,333
[YOSHINO] This float will
make its way around the city,

266
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,083
and then return to Sakura Pond!

267
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,625
[SANAE] We don't need to rely
on Northern Living Television!

268
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,875
We've got the Manoyama Channel!

269
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,125
[SHIORI laughs]

270
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,166
This is a festival for
Manoyamans, after all!

271
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,583
[YOSHINO]
That's right!

272
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,666
It's far more important
to try to get people excited

273
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,833
inside the city, rather than
focusing on people outside!

274
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,708
[buzzing]

275
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,208
Momonga Agency?

276
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,333
This is Yoshino!

277
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,750
Good to hear from you!

278
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,958
Hold on just a sec.

279
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,166
[MAKI]
Huh?

280
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,083
[SANAE] Come on,
we can't let them outdo us!

281
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,875
We've got to think up
something really innovative

282
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,666
and unique that we can post!

283
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,333
Oh, what's this?

284
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,708
[roars]

285
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:03,625
[screams]

286
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,458
Oh no, the Chupakabura!

287
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,583
It's a little
embarrassing now, isn't it?

288
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:11,416
Right? I can't even
believe we made this thing.

289
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,541
I didn't know that page existed.

290
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,625
Do you think Yoshino
has grown up a little bit,

291
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,458
compared to back then?

292
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,500
Yeah, I think so, for sure.

293
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,875
Huh? Look at this.

294
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,041
Oh!

295
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,750
Come to think of it,
we did discuss that.

296
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:26,791
That's right!

297
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,083
You guys, I've got an idea!

298
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,041
Come on, you can't possibly
eat ten servings of katsudon!

299
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,916
[CHALLENGER]
I can! I can eat 11!

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Here you go, tea is served.

301
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:47,708
Oh! Is this the program
that you shooed away?

302
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,833
[USHIMATSU]
Hmph!

303
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,041
[KINU chuckles]

304
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,958
Are you regretting it now?

305
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,666
I don't regret it at all.

306
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,416
But I can't help wondering if
there might not be something

307
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,791
that I could do for
Manoyama on my own.

308
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,500
Something that only I could do.

309
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,750
[MINO]
Yes!

310
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,875
Of course, we'll happily
accept your donation!

311
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,291
Thank you so much!

312
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,541
Would you like us
to email those forms,

313
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,166
or fax them to you?

314
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,125
[MINO]
Uh... You don't have either?

315
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,083
[YAMADA]
Okay, thank you for calling!

316
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:20,666
[YOSHINO] Umm, I'd be happy to
go and deliver those directly.

317
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,958
Oh, thank you. Yes, please!

318
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,375
Sorry to keep you waiting.

319
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,166
Man, we're getting more
and more individual donations!

320
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,333
I know!

321
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,541
The whole town is
really coming together,

322
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,416
all for the sake
of the festival!

323
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
[OBASAN] Thank you for
coming out here like this!

324
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,750
[YOSHINO]
Oh, not at all!

325
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,541
Thank you for your help!

326
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,250
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

327
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,083
Kumano? Sayuri?

328
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,000
Huh?

329
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,500
What are you guys doing?

330
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,916
Are you scouting out
a rival restaurant?

331
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,166
Well, not exactly.

332
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,666
I guess I've been inspired.

333
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,250
I might open a new location
in the shopping district.

334
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,250
Its specialty would
be French toast!

335
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,666
Oh!

336
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,291
[SANAE] Running off to France,
opening restaurants.

337
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,833
Kumano is quite the go-getter!

338
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,166
Cool, huh?

339
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,500
They found a cafe that
closed up shop last year.

340
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,208
The owner said he'd let
Kumano rent the space!

341
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,458
Hello there!

342
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,708
I thought you guys might
like some croquettes!

343
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,625
Oh, those croquettes
from the butcher!

344
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,625
--[TAEI] Thank you!
--[KOTOMI] Oh yummy, Thank you!

345
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,958
After all this, now it seems
like the shopping district

346
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,416
is full of energy.

347
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,541
It certainly is.

348
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,750
Maybe I'll open an office

349
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,125
in the shopping district
after the festival.

350
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,541
[MAKI]
What'll you do, Queen?

351
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,041
Uh. What do you mean?

352
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,750
You got a call from your
agency earlier, didn't you?

353
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:34,166
Ah... Yeah. They called
about the contract ending.

354
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,625
Will you go back to Tokyo?

355
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,125
Huh?! Oh, Yoshi, you're not
gonna stay in Manoyama?

356
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,166
I'm still thinking it over.

357
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,291
I was considering moving
back to my hometown, too.

358
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,833
So, does that
mean you gave up

359
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,041
on finding a "not normal"
job in Tokyo?

360
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,000
[YOSHINO]
Yeah.

361
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,250
Even if I got a job like that,

362
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,333
I'm sure it would seem
normal after a while.

363
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,791
I think anything would.

364
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:59,125
And even in a totally normal
job, you find inspiration.

365
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,291
I know in Tokyo
there's always a lot going on,

366
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,750
but I don't think inspiration

367
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,000
always has to come
from the outside.

368
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,250
It's within yourself.

369
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,916
So, you can really
find it wherever you are.

370
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,208
That's what I've learned from
coming here and experiencing

371
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:15,916
so many different
things with all of you.

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,583
Whatever your job is,
if you invest yourself,

373
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,041
you can find inspiration in it,

374
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,250
and mine it for
all that it's worth.

375
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,333
That's what I believe now.

376
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,333
That's so cool.

377
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,125
Agreed, well said.

378
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,125
You have really
grown a lot, girl.

379
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,375
You know what?

380
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,458
You've inspired me in
so many ways this year.

381
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,666
You, too.

382
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,041
I only learned this
stuff because of you.

383
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,458
You've made me better.

384
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,958
Thank you.

385
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,916
So, at the very end,
the float will travel

386
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,541
across the water and
return the shine here.

387
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,666
[DOKU]
Yep, that's why

388
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,083
we're scrubbing away
50-year-old grime.

389
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,625
I de-grime in a bath for 50
minutes three times a day.

390
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,625
Someone's obsessed
with cleanliness, isn't he?

391
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,000
[laughs]

392
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:06,958
What is this?

393
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,041
[YOSHINO]
What? What?

394
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,291
There are names carved here.

395
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,250
Probably the names
of the people involved

396
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,666
with Sakura Pond's construction.

397
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,291
It's okay, Leave this to me.

398
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,250
This shrine was
moved to this spot

399
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,666
when they were working
on the reservoir

400
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,875
and making Sakura Pond,
isn't that right?

401
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,208
Yeah.

402
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,875
All of that happened well
before I was even born.

403
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,000
They apparently called
in a foreign civil engineer

404
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,375
for the designing of the pond.

405
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,041
I've finally found it.

406
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,208
Proof of their life here.

407
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,041
These are my roots.

408
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,833
Now that you mention it,
didn't you say your name was...

409
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,416
He's Alexandre Sena
Davis Celibidache.

410
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,666
My middle names are
from my great grandmother

411
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,791
and my great grandfather.

412
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:55,333
They met in Manoyama,
and fell in love at Sakura Pond.

413
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,791
So, your ancestors
actually made Sakura Pond!

414
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:58,875
That's amazing!

415
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,500
And it's super romantic, too!

416
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,083
I bet they went to the
festival together, huh?

417
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,708
They must have.

418
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,125
What a crazy
find this is for me.

419
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,375
And now I'll go to the
festival, just like they did.

420
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:24,583
Two days left until
the Mizuchi Festival!

421
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,208
Aaah! You little thief!

422
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,416
[SANAE]
Yep. Ridiculous as always.

423
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,583
But look!

424
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,833
Now everything is
finally coming together.

425
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,875
The cherry blossoms
are looking good.

426
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,250
At this rate,

427
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,750
they're going to be in
full bloom for the festival!

428
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:41,333
Yoshino! Can you give me a hand?

429
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,750
What's up?

430
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,250
Could you get in there
and then hold the doors

431
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,041
from the inside for me?

432
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,500
[YOSHINO]
Got it!

433
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,000
Wow, pretty realistic in here!

434
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,458
Huh?

435
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,916
Oooo, it's dark.

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,500
I can't see anything!

437
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,375
Where the heck are the doors?

438
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,666
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

439
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,833
Maki? You there? Hello?

440
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
They're locked!

441
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,500
What's going on out there?

442
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:17,375
[cheering]

443
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,833
[SHIORI]
Ready, and...

444
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,291
[ALL]
Happy birthday to our queen!

445
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,416
Oh, wow.

446
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,291
You guys remembered the day.

447
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,250
We very nearly forgot
with all the festival prep.

448
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,666
Oh! The happis!

449
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, but to be clear,

450
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,416
we weren't trying to wish
you a "happi" birthday.

451
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,250
Remember what
you said the other day?

452
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,250
How you thought it'd be
nice if we had a happi

453
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,500
for everybody helping
out with the festival?

454
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,541
Turns out, everyone
agreed with you.

455
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,916
So we went out
and got the same ones.

456
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,541
Oh, you guys.

457
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,000
[YOSHINO]
Wow.

458
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,750
A Japanese-style cake?

459
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,125
That's right.

460
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,625
A Western treat, crafted
by a Japanese confectioner.

461
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,833
So, it's not normal.

462
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,375
It's a special cake.

463
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:01,000
All right, I think it's time
for her to blow out the candles.

464
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,791
Come on, do it, Yoshi!

465
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,041
[YOSHINO]
Mm.

466
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay.

467
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,958
Thank you, everyone!

468
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,083
Happy birthday!

469
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,083
[SHIORI]
Happy birthday! 

470
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,541
[YOSHINO]
Thanks for being you!

471
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,375
Now, let's go, and make
this festival the best, ever!

472
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,166
[YOSHINO]
Good morning, everyone!

473
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,125
I want you to know,
it's your hard work

474
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,375
and commitment that
have made all this possible!

475
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,333
The Mizuchi Festival is back!

476
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,541
Let's all enjoy it and
have a great time today!

477
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:54,208
[MEN] Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

478
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:09,083
[USHIMATSU]
This festival. This town.

479
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,291
I can't let them disappear.

480
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:45,291
[USHIMATSU]
Oh! Squeaky-clean now, huh?

481
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,625
Hmm? What's with this rock?

482
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,958
The names of the
people that originally

483
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,125
created Sakura Pond
are carved there.

484
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,333
Including Sandal's
great grandmother

485
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:57,458
and great grandfather, too!

486
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,500
[USHIMATSU]
Hmm...

487
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,166
We might be able to use this!

488
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,500
Use it for what?

489
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,833
[USHIMATSU] We can make
sister cities of Manoyama

490
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,208
and Sandal's hometown!

491
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,625
You're right.

492
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,750
"The two hometowns of a
couple who met here long ago."

493
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,500
I can't think of a
more perfect set up

494
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,708
for sister cities, can you?

495
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,791
No, and if Manoyama
had a sister city,

496
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,833
it might just be enough
to give us some leverage

497
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:22,291
in the absorption.

498
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,958
[MINO] What kind of leverage
are we talking about here?

499
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,208
I don't know!

500
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,458
But anything's gotta be better

501
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,750
than sitting here
twiddling our thumbs.

502
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,541
Sandal, I'm gonna need
you to put me in touch

503
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:32,750
with your town's mayor!

504
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,291
I'm not actually
friends with the mayor.

505
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:38,291
But we do follow each
other on social media.

506
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,750
Oh, wow, what a coincidence!

507
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,416
Mayor Naumann
happens to be in the middle

508
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,166
of a private trip right now.

509
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,333
"Seeing cherry
blossoms in Japan."

510
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,583
In Kanazawa.

511
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,541
Has he posted
anything from there?

512
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:53,125
"The cherry blossoms at
Kenroku-en have already fallen."

513
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,833
Yes, this is our chance!

514
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,083
He's gotta see Sakura
Pond's cherry blossoms

515
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:58,125
and the Festival!

516
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,208
And, while they're at it,

517
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,500
we'll discuss
becoming sister cities!

518
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,583
Have you lost your mind?

519
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:03,416
I'm driving straight
to Kanazawa!

520
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,208
Wha?

521
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,875
Mr. Kadota?

522
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,125
[YOSHINO]
What! He left for Kanazawa?

523
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,416
[CHITOSE] Can't that idiot bring
himself to act like an adult,

524
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,583
just this once?

525
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:18,208
[DOKU]
Same old Ushimatsu.

526
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,208
The idiot who once destroyed the
festival and made it disappear

527
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,666
is now the guy tryin'
to keep it alive.

528
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,666
He swore that he would
definitely be back in time

529
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,541
for the dragon play, though.

530
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,958
Do you girls trust him?

531
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,416
You just never know.

532
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,958
It could be like 50 years ago.

533
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,125
It's okay!

534
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,000
I believe we can trust him!

535
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,958
[SANDAL]
It was a long, long trip,

536
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,208
but we're finally coming
to the end of the journey.

537
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,458
Thank you, Manoyama
and Chupakabura.

538
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,291
And thank you, five heroes.

539
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:48,458
Next: "The Kingdom
of Cherry Blossoms."
