I'll try and explain.

140
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,000
I spent a lot of time in
this house, growing up.

141

There was a sweet
old woman who lived here.

She passed away a while back,
but this place still holds a lot

wanted to burn it down

for the movie,
it really hit me hard.

146
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,958
A house isn't merely
a pile of wood.

147
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,583
It's full of the
lives and memories

of the people who lived there.

149

But what about the movie?

150
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,708
They brought their entire
shoot here under the condition

151
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,541
that they'd be able
to use a house.

152

will do for the town!

Yeah, I know that, but, I--

find a replacement house,

you didn't seem to have
a problem with that.

So you don't care
about the memories

those other houses?

158

You don't mind burning houses

159
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,083

to do with you.

This book is still here, though.

00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,333
[RIRIKO]
Yes.

207
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,250
I started when you
were in sixth grade.

Oh, wow.

00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,000
[RIRIKO]
Uh, so. Um...

Thanks for helping me
the other day.

211

[MAKI]
That? Sure.

212
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,666
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

213
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,875
But, I--

214
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:05,708
Acting is living in
an imaginary situation.

215
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,666
Don't think about
the performance.

216

Just be present in
that moment in time.

It really can be as
simple as that. Cool?

Yeah.

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,750
So? How was it?

Did you end up
enjoying it at all?

221
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,333

Mm...

Yep, we did it, too.

226
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,208

227
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,000
and didn't get to
play Snow White.

[MAKI chuckles]

232
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,291
I remember one year,
there was a girl

233

with a huge smile that was the
most graceful tree I ever saw.

In truth, it probably was.

since you were a little kid?

Yeah, I guess.

[MAKI]
Hey, here's a tip.

239
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,625
You've gotta do
more than "like" it

240
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,916
or you won't get far,
kid. Trust me.

Still not really
following the plot, here.

248
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,250
Basically, the house
is a special place

249
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,500
that links our reality
to an alternate one.

So they're going to burn
the whole house down

251

to block off the entrance?
Yeah, I don't get it at all.

No worries. I should
apologize, too.

about the house?

It doesn't really matter,
when it comes down to it.

It was never my
decision to make.

But it did occur to me
that she might've actually

266
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,458
liked this--having the house
preserved in this movie,

267
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,125
rather than it just
being forgotten.

Agreed. I want to
shoot it that way.

Well, now! Atta girl!
That's the spirit!

Moe, you really shouldn't make
these decisions on your own!

only natural for her

she loves until the very end?

a big investment in you

I know I'm a bit taller,

the sound in that direction.

Okay, the director says

357

he wants us to move
two meters to the right.

358

Okay, so, you're going
to run over this way,

and then jump into
that hole, right there.

There is a fire
truck standing by,

so if things get really
dangerous, we'll stop shooting.

if the Queen might have

It's the woman that
used to live here.

[MOVIE PRODUCER 7A]
If it's true, we'd love to shoot

476
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,750
a big-time, knock-your-socks-off
movie in your town!

477
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,375
I really think he might
have oversold us.

478
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,750
[SANDAL] The movie
wrapped, but apparently,

479
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,291
my scene was cut.

480
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,125
Boo.

481
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,250
Mr. Sonoda, you're fired.

482
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,375
Next time: "The Fairy's Recipe."
