I came here without

Wait a second, Rii- <i>chan</i> !

163
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,458
Open up!

164
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,833
So, listen.

165
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,458
Shiori tells me you might
know about the Chupakabura.

166
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,750
Can you explain it?

167
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,833
U.M.A.

168
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:19,833
U.M.A.?

169
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:22,333
An Unidentified
Mysterious Animal.

170
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,041
"Chupa" is the
Spanish word for "suck"

171
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,208
and "cabra" means "goat,"

172
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,208
so it literally means a creature

173
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,791
that sucks the blood of goats.

174
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:31,833
The earliest sighting was
in 1995 in Puerto Rico.

175
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:34,208
There have also been
sightings in Chile, Mexico,

176
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,083
and America,
however, no sightings

177
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,291
have ever been
reported in Japan.

178
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,208
The sighting here in Manoyama
was most likely a weasel.

179
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,708
I knew you'd
be able to help us!

180
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,791
Thank you!

181
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,166
[SHIORI]
She knows a ton about the occult

182
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,375
and things like that!

183
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,666
Pretty handy, huh?

184
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,208
Yeah, for sure.

185
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,916
I think we should really
push the occult theme

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,291
in the town's marketing!

187
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,375
And we need to create
a whole new website!

188
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,583
Uhh...

189
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't know about
a new website

190
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,750
when the best I can do
is post photos to a blog.

191
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,083
[YOSHINO]
That's okay, who should I ask?

192
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:03,625
Well, we really
need to find a local

193
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,250
web designer to do it.

194
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,041
I remember there was
a woman that moved here

195
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,375
from Tokyo last year.

196
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,375
I'm pretty sure she
started up some sort of

197
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,166
web-related business, so...

198
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,458
Ah! Here it is!

199
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,625
Yes!

200
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,625
[YOSHINO]
Excuse me!

201
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,083
Hello? We're here with
the tourism board!

202
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,708
Maybe she's not home.

203
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,333
[SANAE] It's been six months
since I arrived in Manoyama.

204
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,666
The long winter has at
last given way to spring.

205
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,166
It's finally time to
fully enjoy the benefits

206
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
of a natural lifestyle here.

207
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,541
Today, some locals
gave me some vegetables,

208
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,250
so I used them to try out
this new radish dish.

209
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,458
With the breath of spring,

210
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,208
all the little bugs
have woken up hungry.

211
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,541
So perhaps the thing I should do
with all this bounty is share.

212
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:53,750
Hm?

213
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,541

00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,458

Are you hurt?

00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,291
Tell me!

220
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,375
[YOSHINO]
Your headphones!

221
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,958
So sorry to barge in!

222
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,500
We're with the tourism board
and we really need your help.

223
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,541
[SANAE]
The tourism board?

224
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,166
What was that screaming about?

225
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,333
[SANAE]
Oh. That?

226
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,875
It was nothing, really.

227
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,916
I'm just fine.

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,166
I kicked the corner
of my armoire.

229
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,833
It's lovely living
in the country!

230
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,833
There aren't any armoires
in the city, you know!

231
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,750
Well, that might not be true,
but I never kicked them there!

232
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,208
I swear, only out here in
the country, for some reason.

233
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,250
I mean, am I right?

234
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,083

[SANAE] It's a bug,
it's a bug, it's a bug!

[whimpering]

238
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,333
[SANAE]
I see.

239
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,083
I guess it's not easy
being the queen, is it?

240
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,916
Yeah, it's not what
I thought it would be.

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,416
Do you think you
can build a website

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,625
in two days?

243
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,125
I'm afraid we don't
have much of a budget

244
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,208
to speak of.

245
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,166
Aww.

246
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,250
Sure, I'll do it.

247
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,833
After all,
it's for the town, right?

248
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,625
Suppose I should help
them out if I'm able.

249
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,958
Thank you so much!

250
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,208
So, what kind of site
did you have in mind?

251
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,666
It's gotta go "boom,"
like, have major impact,

252
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,875
and it has to have an air
of the occult to it somehow

253
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,916
and also be fancy and cute.

254
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,375
And we need an online store!

255
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,625
There's no way I could
build an entire online store

256
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,750
for you in two days;
I would need at least a month

257
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,041
to set up the system.

258
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,583
A whole month, really?

259
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,375
Man, I was convinced
we could've sold

260
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,250
a thousand boxes online.

261
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,583
Maybe you should
try to think of it

262
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,833
the other way around.

263
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,125
[YOSHINO]
Which other way?

264
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,833
These days, you can
easily buy delicious food

265
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,708
from all over the country
just while sitting at home.

266
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,833
So if you emphasize the fact
that you can only get these

267
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,291
by coming here in person,
they'll seem more rare

268
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,666
and worth getting.

269
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,041
Exclusive.

270
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,083
But do you actually believe
that could work? Truly?

271
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,541
Oh, don't worry,
you just leave all that to me.

272
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,958
[screams]

273
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,750
Can we get out of here?

274
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,583
[SANAE]
Hmm...

275
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,958
This place is perfect.

276
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,833
I'll be able to get
tons of work done.

277
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:02,750
Here you are.

278
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,083
[SANAE]
Oh, thank you.

279
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,541
All right, why don't
we start by talking

280
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,666
some more about
the design you want.

281
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,583
Now, considering
the major time crunch,

282
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,041
we'll keep it as
simple as possible

283
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,416
while still maintaining
that bold feel.

284
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,375
You mentioned looking for a kind
of fancy occult vibe, right?

285
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,750
So how 'bout "Fancyccult"?

286
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,833
Yeah! Fancyccult!

287
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,666
How lovely!

288
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,083
Are you kidding me?

289
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,208
It'd be quite challenging
to come up with content

290
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
for a strictly occult
theme, so...

291
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,375
we'll push the subculture,
but keep it cute.

292
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,125
But I need something
for the copy. Hmm...

293
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,875
"A little treat from the
depths of the vampire forest."

294
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,083
Yes! That's it!

295
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,791
And there's lots of
wild garlic on the hill

296
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,000
behind our house!

297
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,541
So now we need to
look at text and photos.

298
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,500
Think you ladies could
help me out with that?

299
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,125
What's going on with you?

300
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,500
Nothing's going on.

301
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,333
That girl that just came by
is the new queen, right?

302
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:57,791
I wonder what that old man
is plotting over there.

303
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,500
Don't you get roped into
anything stupid, you hear?

304
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,708
[SHIORI] It looks abandoned
in these pictures.

305
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,041
Makes it feel occult-y.

306
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,916
You mean Fancyccult.

307
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We can touch up the photos.
They'll be okay.

308
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,500
Isn't that deceptive?

309
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,625
No more so than
putting on makeup.

310
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,250
What are your thoughts
about the text?

311
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:22,083
Oh! Yes, here,
I underlined the parts

312
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,625
that I thought might be useful.

313
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,750
Thanks, that's great.

314
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,166
All right,
I'll get started, then.

315
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey, thanks again, so much!

316

'Kay!

317
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,000
I guess we can go work on
getting the stand ready.

00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,041
Let's go!

319
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,375

Let's see.

324
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,541
You're really
good at this, Maki!

325
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,500
I've done it on
my part-time jobs.

326
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,375
Oh, like to prepare for a role?

327
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:50,500
Don't I wish.

328
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,125
No, it's to pay my bills.

329
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,000
When you're an actor,
you have to take side jobs

330
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,416
in order to survive.

[YOSHINO grunts]

Hang in there, my queen.

333
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,625
The entire next year of my life
is riding on this.

334

If I wanna go home, I have
got to make this thing work!

Yoshino.

336

You really can't wait
to get out of here, huh?

337
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,000
[MAKI]
So...

338
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,583
What are you gonna
do when you get back?

339
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,666
What's waiting for
you there in Tokyo?

340
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,500
Uh, what's waiting there?

341
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,083
Everything's waiting there!

342
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,625
Tokyo is everything!

343
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,041
[YOSHINO] Maybe you should
take a little break

344
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,750
and get some sleep.
What do ya think?

345
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:28,833
I'm fine.

346
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,125
When I lived in Tokyo,

347
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,958
I would work through
the night on the regular.

348
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,125
Can you tell me something?

349
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,125
Why'd you leave Tokyo
to come live in this place?

350
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,166
[SANAE]
Hmm...

351
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,416
I kind of got tired
of the rat race.

352
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,916
Plus, nowadays,

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,666
there's no reason to force
yourself to work in a big city.

354
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,666
[YOSHINO]
But... I mean,

355
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,916
isn't Tokyo literally the
economic center of the country?

356
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,458
Yeah, that's a fact.

357
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,916
So there are more
opportunities there

358
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,166
than anywhere else!

359
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,458
What kind of
opportunities do you mean?

360
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,000
Well, there's...
anything and everything.

361
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:02,958
[SANAE]
What happened?

362
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,333
Couldn't find work?

363
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,458
Thirty-two applications
and not even one job offer.

364
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,791
Well, don't let it get to you.

365
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,958
You don't need Tokyo.
With the right mindset,

366
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,916
I believe you can
find work anywhere.

367
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,791
Just my two cents!

368
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,791
[YOSHINO sighs]

369
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,791
Wonder if she's right.

370
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,750
It's done.

371
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,958
[YOSHINO]
Fancyccult!

372
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,666
[SHIORI]
Oh, it's so adorable!

373
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,458
All that's left is
to post some links to it

374
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:49,833
on some other sites.

375
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,541
Okay, girls.
Now you're ready to go!

376
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,500
[YOSHINO]
How'd we not sell a single one?

377
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,583
Well, it is only
the first day.

378
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,375
Your journey has just begun!

379
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
I think it's more than that.

380
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,500
We're not getting nearly
enough traffic on the website.

381
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,500
[SANAE]
Huh?

382
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,291
[SANAE]
What?

383
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,833
Seventy-six? Aww.

384
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,666
I wonder if Fancyccult
is too avant-garde

385
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,291
and freaky for people.

386
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,833
[YOSHINO] What I've been
wondering is how the heck

387
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,125
Mr. Kadota was planning
to sell all these manju

388
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,750
in the first place.

389
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,333
Apparently, his original plan
was to have that actress,

390
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,625
Yoshino Tsubaki, sell them
to people directly.

391
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,500
Yes, we can use that!

392
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,625
You can count me out!

393
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,458
My acting days
are long behind me.

394
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,583
[YOSHINO]
What? Me?

395
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,916
It makes perfect sense!

396
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,541
And you'll do great, Yoshi!

397
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,416
I guess, but I'm wondering...

398
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,708
It's the "beautiful queen"
part that I question.

399
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,208
Don't be silly.

400
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,000
I was totally planning to
touch up your photo, anyway.

401
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,000
That's not really
what I meant, though.

402
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,875
Is it more like you're
feeling weird and awkward

403
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,708
about being referred
to as "beautiful"?

404
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, okay, we'll
embrace that, then.

405
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,958
Little question mark
next to the word.

406
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,583
How about "relatively pretty"?

407
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:00,791
Thanks for that.

408
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,291
Just put, like, a little
asterisk right there

409
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,541
next to "beautiful."

410
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,958
Sure, great, but what's
the alternate word then?

411
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,375
[YOSHINO] "Buy them directly
from the hand of the beautiful

412
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,208
(based strictly on
individual opinion)

queen of our land."

414
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,416
I mean, at least
that's kind of funny.

415
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Or, we could change
the whole concept.

416
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,041
Just lay it all out there.

417
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,916
"I ordered way too
many of these things.

418

Please help us out
and buy some."

--Great.

420
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,541
Doesn't that make it
sound like it's all my fault?

421
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,916
[YOSHINO]
Yay!

422
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,500
How did it go?

423
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,125
Sold three boxes.

424
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,833
Met Shiori's whole family.

425
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,250
So it wasn't a total loss.

426
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
Yeah, my family
felt bad for us,

427
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
so they came out to buy a few.

428
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:43,875
That's all we sold?

429
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,375
Even after the queen
apologized for everything?

430
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,708
Well, she may
be the queen,

431
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,958
but nobody actually
knows who she is.

432
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,208
And I don't think
anyone is reading this.

433

Just for the record,

434
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,166
everything you say is negative!

435
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,208
I'm only doing this because
I want to help Manoyama.

Come on, you guys,

Anyway, I tend to agree
that it's hard to connect

Hey, Maki...

You look like you have an idea.
Have you come up with something?

00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,166
Yeah. I think a video
would have more impact.

I'll take care of this!

481
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,916
[MAKI roaring]

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,083
[roaring continues]

483
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,333
[RIRIKO]
Cut. Take two.

484
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,625
[MAKI roaring]

485
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,666
[SANAE, SHIORI yell]

486
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,625
[SHIORI]
Oh, no! The Chupakabura!

487
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:22,958
Don't worry!

488
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,416
She freed the sword.

489
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,708
Mr. Kadota!

490
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,583
The queen freed
the sacred sword!

491
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,750
[MAKI roaring]

492
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,791
Ha!

493
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,083
[MAKI yelling]

494
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,083
The terrible,
vicious Chupakabura

495
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,375
is now the
delicious Chupakabura!

496
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,541
[MAKI] A little treat from the
depths of the vampire's forest:

497
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,250
Chupakabura Manju.

498
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,375
So delicious, it's fancyccult!

499
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,166
[YOSHINO sighs]

500
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,750
How are there
still no customers?

501
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,041
[harmonica music]

502
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,041
Look at that!

503
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,291
[harmonica music]

504
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,875
Manju are scary.

505
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,916
But I'll take one.

506
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,166
After all that work,
we still only sold one box.

507
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,875
Our video got a
fair amount of plays.

508
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,750
Maybe we should
all watch it again.

509
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,083
Or the "making of" short.

510
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,041
What? When did you
put that together?

511
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,375
[SANAE]
Oh, shoot!

512
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,541
We should have made that
an unlockable bonus video!

513
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,875
The expiration date
has officially passed.

514
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,791
So you failed
your first trial.

515
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,333
No worries, Yoshi!

516
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,625
[YOSHINO groans]

517
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,708
Hey, wait!

518
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,375
No, I say we eat them all!

519
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,916
They just expired, didn't they?

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,250
I'll take a pass. Thanks.

521
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,083
[MAKI]
There's no need to be neurotic.

522
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,083
It's okay, the date
is "best enjoyed by,"

523
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,000
not "must be consumed by."

524
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,166
Mr. Kadota said that we
were allowed to give away

525
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,708
whatever didn't
sell to commemorate

526
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,500
the coronation of the new queen.

527
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,458
Even though they're
already expired?

528
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,666
[MAKI] I told you,
don't be so neurotic.

529
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,333
These are actually really good.

530
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,291
All the ingredients come
from right here in Manoyama!

531
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,625
Hey, you're right.
They really are tasty.

532
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,541
I could eat ten more.

533
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,916
Really? At this hour?

534
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,916
You know, this is the
most fun I've had in a while.

535
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,125
Yeah, me too.

536
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,250
To be honest, you were the
first people I'd talked to

537
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,666
in, like, two weeks.

538
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,125
I was turning into a hermit.

539
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,125
I was even considering
moving back to Tokyo.

540
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,958
Hey! Why don't we all go
cherry blossom viewing?

541
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,416
It'll make for
a great wrap party.

542
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,458
[YOSHINO]
That sounds great!

543
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,916
The blossoms at
Cherry Blossom Pond

544
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,958
are supposed to be
gorgeous, right?

545
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,208
Hey, hold on.

546
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,875
Does that mean you're
not going back to Tokyo?

547
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,250
Because the cherry
blossoms won't even be

548
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,875
in full bloom for
another two weeks yet.

549
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,041
Oh.

550
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:05,916
Well, guess I'll stay till we
can see them together!

551
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,416
[SANDAL] In order to
save the desolate town,

552
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,041
our new queen has
freed the Sacred Sword.

553
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,500
Next time:
"The Cry of the Mandrake."
