Well, I heard that you

157
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:19,208
broke the dragon god at
Sakura Pond yesterday!

158
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,500
[RIRIKO sighs]

159
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,958
[RIRIKO] I wonder. The dragon,
what did she do after that?

160
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,833
[GROUP chatters]

161
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,708
[YOSHINO] It was no use.
She wouldn't let me see her.

162
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,583
[SANAE]
She really is in a bad mood.

163
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,458
She's holding a grudge because
of the matchmaking? Wow.

164
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,458
What?

165
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,291
We heard about it
from Takamizawa.

166
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,166
Rii- <i>chan</i> 's mother
was an outsider.

167
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,666
She apparently moved
here so she could

168
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,083
marry Rii- <i>chan</i> 's father.

169
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,458
[YOSHINO gasps]

170
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,041
[SANAE] But she couldn't
adjust to life in Manoyama,

171
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,541
so, she left.

172
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,833
I see.

173
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,625
Did you know that, Shiori?

174
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,291
[SHIORI] Mm-hm. Rii- <i>chan</i> has
talked to me about it before.

175
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,416
I guess her mom decided
she didn't want to become

176
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,458
an oribe, after all.

177
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,250
C'mon! Lunch time!

178
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,791
[CHITOSE]
Huh?

179
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,166
[SHIORI]
So, her dad didn't end up

180
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,416
taking over the confectionary.

181
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,541
He followed his wife instead,
leaving Manoyama,

182
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,791
and he got a normal,
white-collar job.

183
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,916
But then, shortly after
Rii- <i>chan</i> was born,

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,250
they got a divorce, anyway.

185
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,416
Man. That means from
Chitose's perspective,

186
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,166
her son was tricked,
lured away,

187
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,125
and left brokenhearted
by an outsider.

188
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,625
What happened to her dad?

189
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,416
[SHIORI] He was appointed
to a position overseas

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,833
right after the divorce,
so it was decided that

191
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,166
living with Granny Chitose made
the most sense for Rii- <i>chan</i> .

192
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,000
[YOSHINO gasps]

193
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,583
[RIRIKO
"The dragon kept to herself,

194
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:42,250
staying deep inside the cave,
and eventually, she died alone."

195
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,625
[sighs]

196
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,500
"When the villagers came
to learn of the dragon's death,

197
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,750
they were incredibly sad."

[GROUP chuckles]

200
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,625
[YOSHINO] You think, maybe,
we've done a bad job with this?

201
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,500
No, I don't think so. I mean,

202
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,375
look at how happy the guys
are from the Community Club!

203
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
They make really
wonderful souvenirs!

204
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,000
And right now, we've got
a two for one special!

205
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,875
[SANAE] I know this is
a sales opportunity,

206
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,458
but you're single, right?

207
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,083
You sure you don't
want to join the tour?

208
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:18,291
I'm focusing on honing my craft.

209
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,125
Marriage will have
to come later!

210

What do you think of
this little guy, Kiyomi?

'Cause if you like it, I'd be
happy to pick it up for you.

212
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,000
h, thanks. But I don't think
my place is big enough for it.

213

[MAKI gasps]

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,708

Hm? What? What is it?

00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,250
[KIYOMI gasps]

216
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,583
Look at that.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,416
[KIYOMI]
The dragon?

218
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
[KANEDA]
It's just a coincidence, girls!

219
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:39,708
[RIRIKO]
'Scuse me.

220

Huh?

[MAKI]
Hey! Are you feeling better?

222
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,458
[RIRIKO] I went to the library
to read up on the dragon.

223
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,208
[KANEDA]
Can we drop that stuff, please?

224
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,166
I'm afraid you're
scaring the ladies!

225
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:50,875
But, this--

226
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,041
No "buts", I mean it!

227
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,375

the mood in there!

229

[MAKI]
Hang on!

230
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,291
[KANEDA] Look, you might
like your legends and UMA.

231
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,208
And all that other weird stuff,

232

but normal girls
aren't like that, okay?

233
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,250
If you're gonna talk to them
about something, keep it fun!

234
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,000
They need to like it here.

235
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,500

Okay, then. Forget it.

Hey. You okay?

243
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:37,500
You've been acting different
since yesterday.

244
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,541
Not since yesterday.
I'm a weird girl.

245
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,125
I've always been a weird girl.

246
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,875
But that isn't-- Okay, yes,
you might be a little weird,

247
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,458
but all of us are,
in different ways,

248
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,833
and that's part of what
makes us who we are!

249
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,416
You mentioned the library
and reading about the dragon.

250
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,708
Did you find out anything?

251
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,083
[RIRIKO gasps]

252
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,375
[YOSHINO]
Hm?

253
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,375
[RIRIKO] There's another
interpretation of the tale

254
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,583
of the dragon. A completely
different interpretation

255
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,833
that everyone here in Manoyama
seems to have forgotten.

256
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,875
The dragons were
extremely wise.

257
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,541
The villagers threw
a party in order

258
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,250
to welcome the dragon girl.

259
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,750
They were hopeful and excited
to learn from her great wisdom.

260
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,416
[RIRIKO]
They thought that a fun,

261
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
lively dance would encourage the
dragon and bring her closer.

262
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,166
But, when the dragon girl saw
them dancing around the fire,

263
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,666
she got scared, and she ran
away right then and there.

264
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,541
By the time they realized
their mistake, it was too late.

265
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,750
The dragon girl ended up dying
alone, deep in a dark cave.

266
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,416
And unfortunately,
at that point,

267
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,291
the humans forever lost their
chance to learn from her.

268
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,916
"We created a song to
comfort the poor dragon.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
In her solitude, and we sing it
for her with our whole hearts."

270
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,250
Nobody knows the song anymore.

271
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,250
The Manoyama Dance remained,

272
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,958
but the song was
forgotten in no time.

273
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,708
The point is, Manoyama was
originally a place that

274
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:05,833
accepted and welcomed outsiders.

275
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,000
Rii- <i>chan</i> . That's amazing.

276
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,000
This is really
quite a discovery!

277
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,625
And it's so perfect
for our tour, so...

278
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,583
...let's go and tell
everyone about it!

279
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,875
Come on, you know nobody's
really interested

280
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,083
in that kind of story.

281
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,958
Then, we'll have to
make them interested!

282
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,000
Before the firefly tour,
we'll convince them we're

283
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,500
putting on a little
comedy show

284
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,708
and then hit them with the
dragon story! Good idea, right?

285
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,166
Or, maybe that's a
wee bit too much.

286
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,083
Anyway, we'll figure out
something and it'll be perfect!

287
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,541
How are you able
to smile like that?

288
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,750
Uh...

289
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,833
I can't do that. I can't
be the way you are.

290
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:39,833
[YOSHINO sighs]

291
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,458
You don't know the
Manoyama Dance,

292
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,458
but you don't even hesitate to
commit yourself to learning it.

293
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,000
You left the countryside
for Tokyo on your own.

294
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,000
You actually worry
about being too normal.

295
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,958
We couldn't be more opposite.

296
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,500
You have all the
things I don't have,

297
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,583
and you can do everything
I can't do! Everything!

298
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,958
I'm so sorry.

299
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,375
[YOSHINO gasps]

300
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,541
[RIRIKO] It's not that I want
to be like you, exactly.

301
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,541
I am who I am.
I want to be that.

302
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:12,000
But that, must not be enough,
because nobody sees me.

303
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,416
It seems like nobody
understands me!

304
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,250
[YOSHINO] Hm. I don't
think that's true.

305
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,000
I think people here
might understand you

306
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,666
better than you know.

307
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,583
I mean, for instance,
from my point of view,

308
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,708
you're a way more impressive
human being than I am.

309
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,958

[KIYOMI]
Yes! But we--

465
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:58,000
We have a problem because
Kiyomi's parents have always

466
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,083
been completely against
her marrying me.

467
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,416
All the more reason for you
to come elope in Manoyama!

468
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,875
A town for elopers.

[USHIMATSU] Yeah!

471
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:10,708
If we welcome elopers
from all over the country,

472
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,083
I'm sure it'll to give
our population a boost!

So, the dragon,

474
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,250
surrounded by all of
her friends, finally smiled.

[SANDAL] I sent some manju
to my mom, back home.

478

She likes chunky azuki bean
paste, but I like it smooth.

479
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,208
Whatcha gonna do?
