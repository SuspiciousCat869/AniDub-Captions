1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:23,166
They were asking about
that, so tell the office.

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,791
Hello, can I
help you, gentlemen?

3
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,625
We're fine.

4
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,958
[SANAE]
Say cheese!

5
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,500
[SANAE]
Okay!

6
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,500
The dragon play is
really coming along!

7
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,916
Way to go, you guys.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This will be posted on
the Manoyama channel.

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,916
Hey, Maki.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,500
I understand that the dragon's
song is the theme here.

11
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,541
But, I don't think it's
a very good message.

12
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:48,916
Yeah, letting the dragon die

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
because of a misunderstanding
is a sad ending.

14
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:55,250
I know, I've been a little
concerned about that, too.

15
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,416
Some adjustments
might be a good idea.

16
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,750
[YOSHINO] I wish Manoyama
was this lively, don't you?

17
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,916
I don't know.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,750
I kinda wonder why a
company in Tomikura

19
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,333
wants to help out with
the Mizuchi Festival.

20
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,208
Huh...

21
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,958
Oh. I think that's it!

22
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,125
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

23
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:18,041
I'm Kudo, the CEO here.

24
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,541
Did you notice the pastry
shop on the first floor?

25
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,750
I'm the one who runs it.

26
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,750
Oh! Right, it's called Belem!

27
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:28,291
It smelled incredible
when we passed by!

28
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,583
[KUDO]
You know, I really enjoyed

29
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,791
the school's Closing
Ceremony a few weeks ago.

30
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,458
Are you a graduate of
Manoyama Second Middle School?

31
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:35,875
I am!

32
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,166
And I heard that you're
trying to revive the festival

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,333
that used to be
held 50 years ago.

34
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,041
I'd love to help out with
that in whatever way I can.

35
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,333
Wow, thank you so much!

36
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,625
That's kind of you!

37
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,875
No, really,
the pleasure's all mine.

38
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,625
I felt like it was about
time to contribute

39
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,458
to my hometown if I could.

40
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,416
So, getting down to business.

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,041
Currently, we have two stores
in Tomikura and one in Tokyo.

42
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,541
And, now,

43
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:02,416
we're considering opening up
a new location in Manoyama.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,125
Really? A new store?

45
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,083
[KUDO] Naturally,
we know the risk of opening

46
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,916
a business in a small town.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,875
But, as I think we all realize,
unless someone does something,

48
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,541
Manoyama's decline
will continue.

49
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,125
The best case scenario
would be for someone

50
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,500
to rent a shop to us
in the shopping district.

51
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,083
Well, we'd love to help!

52
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,333
We can start asking
around for you.

53
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,833
[MINO]
This is delicious!

54
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,541
This isn't a typical
Manoyama egg tart, is it?

55
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,000
Nope, this is called a <i>pastel</i>
<i>de nata</i> and it's from Portugal.

56
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,250
[SANAE] Who knew Portuguese
desserts were so insanely good?

57
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,958
I can hardly believe
a pastry shop like this

58
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,541
would come to Manoyama!

59
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,708
Of course they would!

60
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,083
<i>Obrigado</i> !

61
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,666
[MINO] Still, you know that
if they want to join the

62
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,750
shopping district, we'll need to
go discuss it with Mrs. Oribe.

63
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,500
Yeah, I wonder what she'll say.

64
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,750
We still haven't even
received the official approval

65
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,666
from her regarding the festival.

66
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,000
She'll say yes.

67
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,666
Even that old hag couldn't
possibly turn this down.

68
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,125
Now let's go!

69
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,625
Gutsy, bringing a
proposal for a pastry shop

70
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,625
to a Japanese confectionary.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,750
It's just, we thought
it was a great chance

72
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,125
to liven things up in
the shopping district.

73
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,750
They contacted the
tourism board about this.

74
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,666
If we hadn't held
that closing ceremony,

75
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,125
none of this would be happening.

76
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,416
That's a very
patronizing way to put it.

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,250
Look, all I'm saying is
that it's going to be good

78
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,833
for both sides.

79
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,750
[CHITOSE]
All right.

80
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,750
I've got to consider the
needs of the shopping district

81
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,458
ahead of my personal concerns.

82
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,625
I'll talk with the shop owners
whose stores have shut down.

83
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,666
Thank you... very much!

84
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,208
[CHITOSE]
By the way, old ass.

85
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,750
What do you want, hag?

86
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,500
I want to know what's going
on with the Mizuchi festival.

87
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,458
Whether or not the Board
of Merchants participates,

88
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,083
depends on your attitude.

89
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,666
You'd do well to remember that.

90
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,166
Okay, fine then, we'll go ahead
and include you officially.

91
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,125
Good enough, hag?

92
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,041
Show me some respect in my shop!

93
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,708
Go on!

94
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,958
'Scuse us, we'll be going.

95
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,583
[MAKI]
What is this? It's so good!

96
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,958
[SANAE]
I know, right?

97
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,916
That crispy crust,
with that thick, rich custard.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,416
Oh! The contrast
is just amazing!

99
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,208
Even so, I'm blown away that
Chitose gave the okay for this.

100
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,125
She's always been very level
headed when it counts, though.

101
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,333
So Mr. Kadota's actually the
one with the screw loose, huh?

102
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,500
[laughs]

103
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,791
[SANAE]
Huh? Yoshino?

104
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,833
Huh?

105
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,375
What's wrong?
You seem out of it.

106
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:28,041
I realized there are only two
months left till the festival.

107
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,333
Once it's all over.

108
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,833
What the heck am I gonna
do with my life after that?

109
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,083
I mean, the queen contract
is for one year, right?

110
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:40,291
Shiori was already on the
Tourism Board when I got here,

111
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,583
Sanae, you have your work as a
web builder so you'll be okay.

112
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,666
Maki, you just started
an acting troupe.

113
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,708
And Riichan's family
has the confectionary.

114
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,666
I'm the only one with nothing.

115
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,958
What should I do?

116
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,208
How do you feel about it?

117
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,416
Are you considering
going back to Tokyo?

118
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,875
Oh, I don't know.

119
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,125
Even if I did, I might
not find anything there.

120
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,541
And I really like
it here in Manoyama.

121
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,166
Then why shouldn't you
just keep going as the queen?

122
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,708
It's not like Mr. Kadota's
letting you go.

123
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,916
I'm sure he'd figure
out something.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,375
Yeah, maybe.

125
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,583
[SANAE]
Well, for now, we drink!

126
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,208
Girl, why do you
always have to do that?

127
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,083
[SANAE]
Do what?

128
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,458
I'm just brightening the mood!

129
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:21,333
Life is short so you
better drink up, little lady!

130
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,458
Maki, would you get some ice?

131
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,208
Jeez.

132
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,708
[CHITOSE]
So, that's a no?

133
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:29,208
Your place does have
separate entrances

134
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,166
for both the first and second
floors, isn't that right?

135
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,083
Right and it's not that
I mind renting the shop out.

136
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,750
It's just that I don't
think I can handle

137
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,000
that sickly sweet smell.

138
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,583
That burnt custard smell,
you know what I mean?

139
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,041
If that was wafting up 24 hours
a day, I think I'd... Ew!

140
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,541
That's okay.

141
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,291
I understand and I'm sorry
to bother you about it.

142
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,625
[IWASHITA] I tried a few places,
too, but it was no good.

143
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,500
None of them want
to rent out their shops

144
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,458
because they live
on the second floor.

145
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,666
I can definitely
understand how they feel.

146
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,250
I really thought someone
would be interested, though.

147
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,833
We've hit a pretty
substantial roadblock, here.

148
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:07,083
I'm honestly getting
a little worn out.

149
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,666
Come on, Chitose!

150
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,166
You can't possibly give up now.

151
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,958
[NUNOBE]
I agree!

152
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,000
[YOSHINO] Well, they haven't
been able to convince anyone.

153
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,416
There's still one possible place
they haven't tried yet, though.

154
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,916
The owner doesn't live
there anymore, either.

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,083
Oh, are you talking about
the old grocery store?

156
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,291
Maybe.

157
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,625
Is Belem Pastries really
coming to Manoyama?

158
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,208
Wait, how did you find out?

159
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,041
I would go there every day!

160
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,125
I mean, I could even work there!

161
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,250
Yeah, it's pretty
great news, huh, Erika?

162
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,958
If really are planning
to work there,

163
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,208
then it better be when
we're closed here, young lady!

164
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,708
Hey, it's not
exactly official yet,

165
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,083
so try to keep it
under wraps, okay?

166
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,083
[CHITOSE]
Hmm...

167
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,750
It's been quite
a while, Akiyama.

168
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,958
[SHIORI]
Here we are--

169
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,541
the old grocery store
Riichan mentioned earlier.

170
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,541
Oh, sure, Akiyama's shop.

171
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,000
He bought a place outside
town a while back.

172
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,708
He lives out there now.

173
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,250
Since nobody
lives on the property,

174
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,375
maybe he'll be
easier to convince!

175
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:22,916
And you know what else?

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,083
Akiyama already rented this shop
to an out-of-towner before,

177
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,916
a few years back.

178
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,458
If I remember,
the store sold accessories,

179
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,416
but they went out of
business pretty quickly,

180
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,583
Well then, seems
this is a great opportunity!

181
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,916
Yep! Right, because he might
be willing to rent it out again!

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,083
Okay!

183
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,041
Let's go talk to the
man ourselves, then.

184
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,958
Hang on, Mr. Kadota!

185
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,833
Hey, guys! Mind if we come in?

186
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,958
How's everything
been going in here?

187
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:51,833
Going well!

188
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,166
Thanks for asking.

189
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,708
I think we'll be able
to open up by next month.

190
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,625
So soon!

191
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,583
That why Sandal's helping too?

192
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,458
Is jazz fusion the
musical equivalent

193
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,583
of, like, Japanese fusion?

194
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,041
We're not talking
about cuisine, here.

195
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,416
Oh, hey. I wanted to read this.

196
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,666
Nice, the Shining Dragon.

197
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,291
I used it to wish for
success for my new business.

198
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,958
I thought, what could it hurt?

199
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,791
I wonder if it'll help at all.

200
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,041
I think miracles can happen
for those who believe.

201
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,125
Whatever you do,
what matters is how you feel.

202
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,958
Oh, they're back.

203
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:32,958
[USHIMATSU]
So, what do you think?

204
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,708
Good idea, right?

205
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,291
And now, a visit
from the Tourism Board.

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,333
No matter how many times
you ask, my answer is no.

207
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,333
Oh, come on, now, Akiyama.

208
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,041
It'd be for the whole town.

209
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,916
Don't you think it's kind
of a waste and a shame

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,625
for the town to keep
the store closed

211
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,083
while you're living
all the way out here?

212
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,541
No, I really don't.

213
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:54,708
What happens to that store
is my business, not yours.

214
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,625
Legally that is true, but at
this rate the shopping district

215
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,583
is going to die off, completely.

216
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,041
We're asking you.

217
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,625
Can you please
do this to help us

218
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,750
try to save the
shopping district?

219
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,125
Sorry, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

220
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,250
Huh?

221
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,375
[SANAE] Aw... It seemed
like such a good set-up, too.

222
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,000
I can't imagine why
he would be against it.

223
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,291
Who knows. I wonder if he thinks
the district is beyond saving.

224
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,625
I have no doubt people would
want to come to Belem, though.

225
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,958
It's a big, fat waste.

226
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,250
[ERIKA] Are you guys
still going on about that?

227
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,791
If nobody else will
rent their place,

228
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,208
that's all the more reason
to take over this store!

229
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,291
Erika!

230
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,791
You're upsetting
your mother right now.

231
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,500
But I absolutely
must have <i>pastel de nata</i> !

232
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,458
I want it, I want it, I want it!

233
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,125
I'll make you some <i>nata de coco.</i>

234
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,166
You'll make do with that.

235
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,708
No!

236
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,375
It's obvious the town would
be better off with that shop,

237
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,333
but nobody's
doing anything about it!

238
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,791
That's why this place
a pit of despair!

239
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,291
And strike.

240
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,333
[MAKI]
Yeah, a fastball.

241
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,000
[RIRIKO]
It's my grandma.

242
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,708
She says the Board
of Merchants is holding

243
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:56,541
an emergency meeting,
and they would like

244
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,375
the Tourism Board
to attend if we can.

245
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,333
Meaning, us, too?

246
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,083
[MAKI]
Okay, today we'll be going over

247
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,500
the second half of the play.

248
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,333
I've added a final scene
in hopes of making

249
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,250
the folk tale theme
more easily understood.

250
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,458
Why don't we take it
from in front of the cave,

251
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,708
the part where
the villagers are parading.

252
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,500
[CHITOSE] I didn't call you all
here for this meeting in order

253
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,958
for us to talk about
the pastry shop.

254
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,583
I called you because
I thought it was time

255
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:31,958
we discuss the future of the
Manoyama Board of Merchants.

256
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,750
Undoubtedly, you are all aware
that Noge Books is planning

257
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,125
to open up a cafe soon
in the closed middle school.

258
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,916
Mr. Noge, how's it going?

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,333
Uh, well!

260
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,541
We got lucky in that the
school has plenty of parking,

261
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,125
and it's in a really
good location, too.

262
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,708
Interesting.

263
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:50,916
It's possible that area may be
the center of the town someday.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,375
And, if that's what
comes to pass.

265
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,500
Then I think it would be time
for the Board of Merchants

266
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,541
to seriously
consider disbanding.

267
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,291
[gasps]

268
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,916
Are you kidding me?

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,541
I'm definitely not.

270
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,541
Nowadays, most people
buy their everyday goods

271
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,583
at the supermarket,
and many times,

272
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,708
it's easier to order things
you need off of the Internet.

273
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:11,541
Are you saying we
should just sit around

274
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,666
and wait for the town to die?

275
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,583
What choice do we have if
people keep closing their shops?

276
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,041
Why force ourselves
to keep going

277
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,041
if people don't
want to stay open?

278
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,500
Hold on.

279
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,791
Some of us here are nowhere
near ready to give up yet!

280
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,333
Please don't say you're
disbanding us now!

281
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,458
[USHIMATSU]
The wood-carving district

282
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,250
is still a viable
tourist destination!

283
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,250
It's the shopping district
that's the problem, right?

284
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,125
Yes. Throughout our history,

285
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,166
Manoyama has always
adjusted our business

286
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,916
to the changing times.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,916
However, now the
very foundation of the way

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,708
we conduct our business
is quickly becoming obsolete.

289
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,208
On top of that, even if we
try to think of a new role

290
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:51,208
for the shopping district,
everyone here is old.

291
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,791
If we're no longer needed,
it's just a sign of the times.

292
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,750
All we can do is accept it.

293
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,541
I've taken over
my family's soba restaurant

294
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,166
and turned it into
a successful bistro.

295
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,166
We could have a
new generation of shops.

296
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,333
I believe that.

297
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,166
That's nice,
but my kid left for the city

298
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,708
and never comes back home.

299
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,708
Hold on, I don't understand
what there is to discuss here.

300
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,208
All we need to know is
that having Belem Pastries

301
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,208
come to town is
good for everyone.

302
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,500
That's all that really matters.

303
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,125
Isn't that enough?

304
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,958
Might sound fine to the people
who've already closed up shop,

305
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,708
but some of us folks
are still hanging in there!

306
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,750
It's true.

307
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,000
Everyone is
gritting their teeth,

308
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,041
staying open despite
the lack of customers.

309
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,541
But, this is a time
when we should all

310
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,166
be working together
in order to innovate

311
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,625
and stick it out!

312
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:35,875
Come on, we can do it!

313
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,375
There are so many of us!

314
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,791
All right then,

315
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,375
why don't you let someone
else use your store, huh?

316
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe because we tatami
makers have our pride, okay?

317
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,625
[NUNOBE] Mr. Shiozaki,
is it fair to say <i>that</i>

318
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,166
to those of us still
conducting business?

319
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,708
Let's try to straighten
out this conversation, 'kay?

320
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,166
We'll keep it simple.

321
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,333
What do you think should happen

322
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,500
to the shopping district,
going forward?

323
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,500
The answer is obvious!

324
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,750
The district
should stick around.

325
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,875
I have something
I'd like to say.

326
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,708
It's true that,
thanks to the many efforts

327
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,166
of our very hardworking
Tourism Board.

328
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,750
Manoyama has steadily been
getting more attention lately.

329
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,083
However, it hasn't exactly
led to the revitalization

330
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,250
of the shopping
district, has it?

331
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,666
For that to happen,
the shopping district itself

332
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,208
needs to have some
actual draw of its own.

333
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:18,375
But despite knowing that,

334
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,666
we still can't seem
to agree on a place

335
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,250
for the pastry shop.

336
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,916
So, that's why I think
we should consider

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,333
recommending the school.

338
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,250
What do you all think?

339
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,083
Are you kidding?

340
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,166
Why do that?

341
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,083
So, you're okay
with things as they are?

342
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,541
--That's--
--Calm down, Mr. Iwashita.

343
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,458
How about it, Akiyama?

344
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,000
Will you work with us?

345
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,375
It's for the benefit of the
shopping district, after all.

346
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,541
[IWASHITA]
He's right, Akiyama!

347
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,541
Why on earth would you say no?

348
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,750
You don't live there anymore.

349
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,541
And no one is implying
that you should rent

350
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,083
your shop out for free.

351
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,416
Belem is a reputable
company, Akiyama.

352
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,791
You should consider it.

353
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,416
It could really help us.

354
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,416
Lots of young customers
would come through.

355
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,416
The district really
needs that kick-start.

356
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,708
Please.

357
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,291
Hurry up and make a
decision already, Akiyama!

358
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,458
You have the power to put this
whole issue behind us for good.

359
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,500
Come on!

360
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:03,833
[TATSUO]
Please consider it, Akiyama!

361
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,541
[MIURA] For the good of
the district and the town!

362
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,416
[NUNOBE]
Please, we need you!

363
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,750
Come out here and party!

364
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,083
It's heaps of fun!

365
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
We've got tons of
booze to share with you!

366
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,000
[TAIRA]
Quit hiding in there!

367
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,583
Don't be shy, come on out!

368
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:16,958
They'll end up
burning me to death

369
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,291
and they don't even know it!

370
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,708
Go away!

371
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,041
[IWASHITA]
Come on, Akiyama!

372
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,500
Just do it, would you?

373
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,291
[NUNOBE] The town really
needs your help right now!

374
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,125
[CHITOSE]
Okay, that's enough.

375
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,208
I believe Akiyama
must have his reasons.

376
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,625
There are lots
of other available,

377
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,166
closed shops besides his.

378
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,125
Yet, the existence
of the shopping district

379
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,208
is in real danger, so...

380
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,000
Maybe we should just accept
that our time here is up.

381
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:43,833
Stop it!

382
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,250
Don't you give up so easily!

383
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,791
Come on, Queen,
why don't you say something?

384
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:48,958
I don't know.

385
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,291
You've got to try
to convince these people

386
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,333
that it's for the
town's benefit!

387
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,916
I don't want too, though.

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,916
Huh?!

389
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,083
I can't.

390
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,291
This is exactly like
the dragon's story.

391
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,250
None of you are trying
to see it from the other side.

392
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,208
What're you saying?

393
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,916
[YOSHINO] I personally feel
like most of you are right.

394
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,250
And, that you're saying
what you're saying

395
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,125
for the good of the town.

396
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,416
But, for those
who aren't interested,

397
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,000
you're trying
to force it on them.

398
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,791
[USHIMATSU] Is the queen giving
up on revitalizing the town?

399
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,208
No, but this kind
of revitalization

400
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,250
doesn't work for everyone!

401
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,666
Maybe it's idealistic, but...

402
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,791
Listen.

403
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,333
I believe, in order
for this to work,

404
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,791
every one living here must feel
a personal drive for change.

405
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,250
But, if you decide things
by majority rule,

406
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,916
and then, this happens
at the expense

407
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,333
of someone giving something up.

408
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,916
Then, that's not
revitalization at all!

409
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,750
It's just development!

410
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,333
Uh...!

411
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,625
[YOSHINO]
I believe,

412
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,750
nothing like this should be
forced on anyone.

413
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,041
That's not okay.

414
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,333
The answer is for us
to come together,

415
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,958
and save the shopping
district as a team!

416
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:56,458
I think the queen's
right on this one.

417
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,083
[AKIYAMA]
I'm sorry, everyone.

418
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,791
But please, I beg you
to try to understand.

419
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,875
I don't want to go through
that same awful thing again.

420
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,708
Why? What the hell
happened, Akiyama?

421
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,625
[CHITOSE]
His tenant flew the coop.

422
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,416
Wait, he took off?

423
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,875
You mean the kid that
ran the accessory shop?

424
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,541
How come you never said
anything to anyone about it?

425
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,916
If people found out,

426
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
then the Board of Merchants'
contempt for outsiders

427
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,333
would have grown even
stronger than it already was.

428
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,416
To his great credit,

429
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,958
Akiyama didn't
want that to happen.

430
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,333
I was the only one to whom
he told the whole story.

431
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:30,875
He's been holding
this information in

432
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,541
for a very long time.

433
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,750
When he came around,

434
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,791
looking for a space
to rent eight years ago,

435
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,458
I was anxious to help him
out as much as I could.

436
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,208
He had no ties to Manoyama,

437
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,375
but he said he wanted
to liven things up.

438
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,541
That made me happy.

439
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,750
But, to my surprise,
within less than half a year.

440
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,875
He suddenly up and
disappeared without a trace.

441
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,875
Unfortunately,
I was the guarantor

442
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,833
on his loan from the bank.

443
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:02,708
This is what came from me
putting my faith in an outsider.

444
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,333
Now I would just like
to be left alone.

445
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,875
All right, then.

446
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,000
I can see that forcing the issue
would be foolish and cruel.

447
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:13,833
Maybe we should just
forget the whole thing, huh?

448
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,333
How does that sound?

449
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,166
Yes.

450
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,083
[SHIOZAKI]
Um...

451
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,458
[CHITOSE]
Huh?

452
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:22,250
If you'd like to offer
my place to Belem, you can.

453
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,166
I, of course, had no idea what
happened to Akiyama before.

454
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,375
I thought he mistakenly
assumed the tenant

455
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,208
would make a lot of
money off of his generosity.

456
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,666
And then, meanwhile,

457
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,625
I've been upset about
something silly, like the smell.

458
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,125
I feel ashamed.

459
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,125
I'm sorry.

460
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:40,833
We have our answer, then.

461
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,541
[SHIOZAKI]
Mm-hm.

462
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,208
Thank you, Mr. Shiozaki!

463
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:50,541
Mr. Akiyama,

464
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,125
I'd like to apologize for
trying to force this on you,

465
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,458
and I hope you're
willing to forgive us.

466
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,708
Of course I do,
and I'm sorry, too.

467
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,375
Thank you, Queen.

468
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,208
You're an interesting one.

469
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,625
We're lucky to have you.

470
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,791
I've seen you on
TV just like everyone else.

471
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,333
I've heard quite
a few rumors, too.

472
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,583
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

473
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,875
Okay.

474
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,125
From what I understand,

475
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,666
you don't have any
personal ties to Manoyama.

476
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,250
Why do you work so hard for us?

477
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,291
Well, I guess.

478
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,625
I'm an outsider,

479
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,541
and Manoyama has been
good enough to take me in.

480
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,333
I see.

481
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,041
Thank you, Queen.

482
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,041
Okay, last scene.

483
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,541
In our show,
the dead dragon is going

484
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,250
to suddenly appear
before all of the villagers.

485
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,833
The dragon has learned how
the villagers are feeling,

486
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,166
and she comes to see
them in spirit form.

487
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,375
"Worry not.

488
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,541
I bear you no grudge
for what happened to me.

489
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,000
In truth, you wanted
to join hands with me,

490
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,708
and understand me."

491
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:55,458
And so, the people stand
before the vision of the dragon.

492
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,750
And with this
newfound understanding,

493
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,625
the young villager girl
offers the dragon's song.

494
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,375
Okay!

Hey, hag.

[CHITOSE]
Hmm?

499
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,125
About the thing with Akiyama.

500
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,625
I had no idea that's
what happened to him.

501
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,375
That's really awful.

502
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,041
So, yeah, I'm sorry.

Huh?

00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,708
And for what
happened 50 years ago.

Hmm? What was that?

506
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,333
I'm trying to apologize!

507
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,875
Would you let me?

508
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:36,833
Huh?

509
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,291
Hmph!

Just stop worrying.

514

The Board of Merchants

Thank you so much!

Your turn, Mr. Kadota.

Uh, yeah, thanks,
I guess we owe you one.

520
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,916
You'd think, by this age,

521
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,791
you'd've learned how
to thank someone properly.

522
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,958
Would you be quiet?

Oh, I know!

On the day of the festival,

why don't you two get up
on stage together?

Maki was just complaining
that they don't have

527
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,208
enough extras yet for the
villagers in the dragon play.

Oh, the play, huh?

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,416
Yeah, maybe.

530
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,166
I guess I'd be up for that.

playing a zombie.

Thank you so much for this.

So, what are you going
to use it for, anyway?

547
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,750
As a prop in the play?

Not quite.

549
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,458
I actually want to use it
as one of the treasures

in the Mizuchi Festival.

Wait, what are
you talking about?

of the golden dragon?

Yeah!

If we make a brand new one

it's going to be
super expensive.
