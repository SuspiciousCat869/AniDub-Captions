[SENIORS]
Hey, hey, ho!

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,291
Hey, hey, ho!

00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,500
[phone ringing]

4
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,083
Hey, Sanae.

5
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,041
[SANAE]
What the hell are you doing?

6
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,166
Being a hostage, basically.

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,541
A hostage?!

8
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,125
Please tell me they
haven't got you tied up

9
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,583
or anything.

10
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,708
[YOSHINO] No, it's not like
I'm here against my will.

11
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,625
[SANAE] Okay, whatever,
just get back here.

12
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,708
No way!

13
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,958
Come on, this is
the first time anyone

14
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,375
has really needed me!

15
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,375
I'm a hostage and
I'm gonna play the part!

16
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,791
--Are you nuts? Yoshino?
--[dial tone]

17
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,791
What's going on?

18
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,583
Well, I think we've been had.

19
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,833
What?

20
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,375
This whole time,
the professor's been using us

21
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,583
for his own gain.

22
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,375
This is what he's
really been after.

23
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,291
An at-home coup d'état.

24
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
That's right.
He wants to use our livestream

25
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,166
to call attention to the
sad state of Warabiya.

26
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,166
I will now state our demands.

27
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,125
First, I want you to send
a real cameraman

28
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,791
to cover our protest here.

29
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,708
I would also like
three cases of beer

30
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,833
and some snacks.

31
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,750
And if possible,
a single malt whiskey,

32
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,833
which I'll pay for.

33
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,416
He's actually making demands.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,458
Giving them some beer
isn't that big a deal, right?

35
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,375
I'm not sure that's
the problem here.

36
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,708
Look.

37
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,041
We're getting some comments.

38
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,416
[SHIORI] Yoshi doesn't seem
to care about giving

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,750
a bad impression.

40
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,708
[MAKI] That was a pretty
mean thing to say, Shiori.

41
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,833
[YOSHINO] Hey, everyone,
the tea is ready!

42
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,958
She seems right
at home, doesn't she?

43
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,708
Anyhow, we've gotta do something

44
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,458
before it gets
negative attention.

45
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,416
Okay.

46
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,583
Oh, I think I've
forgotten my meds.

47
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,750
Well, go get 'em.

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,375
We're not in any big rush.

49
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,708
All right, we'll go
ahead to Shige's, then.

50
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,833
[MASA]
Okay.

51
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,875
We'll see you later,
right, fair Queen?

52
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,083
Roger that!

53
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,416
Nobody's gonna take
away our bus route!

54
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,791
[GORO]
I think that about does it!

55
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,958
[MICHIYO]
We really appreciate it, Queen.

56
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,125
This should hold
us over for a while!

57
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,791
You're a very hardworking
hostage, aren't you?

58
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,125
Not at all!

59
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,666
But hey, what exactly do
we do from this point on?

60
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,083
We're committing treason.

61
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,333
But we're not going to do
anything illegal, though.

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,333
Well, not for now, anyway.

63
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,666
[GROUP]
Cheers!

64
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,416
I'm sorry about earlier today.

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,875
Didn't mean what I said.

66
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,375
No, I was being childish.

67
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,916
I've got some good
fertilizer for you, buddy.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,416
C'mon, Queen,
have a little bit more!

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Thanks, yeah, I'll have more.

70
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,166
But Professor, are you
sure this is the best way?

71

[SUZUHARA chuckles]

72
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,291
Nobody would ever
pay any attention to us

73
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,291
if all we chose to do
was pout and whine

74
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,125
over our lot.

75
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,833
People are drawn to drama.

[HIDE] Seems like you're
always up to something, Masa.

is totally my type, though.

gifts of beer and snacks.

The beer and stuff is here!

Hey, listen.

Have you really
thought this through?

85

Sanae was pretty upset.

86
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,375
It's got nothing to do
with the tourism board though.

87
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,041
I'm staying up here completely
of my own free will.

88
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,500
I just really want
to stand with them

89
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,375
and help them out.

just spend the night.

Come on, how about it?

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,291
We just opened a bottle,
but of course,

98
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,416
it might be wasted on tanukis.

what is she doing, anyway?

I'm so sorry.

I know she's making

There's opportunity in crisis!

blocking anything.

[DOKU]
Oh, it's the delivery!

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
If the sensor detects
an approaching car,

145

it'll automatically
move us off to the side.

You're a pain in the ass!

Yeah, of course!

162
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,666
Sorry about yesterday.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,708
I was actually about to
go mushroom gathering

164
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,833
with the ladies.

165
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,208
Any of you girls wanna come?

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,166
Totally!

167
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,875
It's my job, so...

168
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
I think I might...

169
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,041
[MAKI] Yeah.
Wanna head back together?

170
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,416
[SUZUHARA] Would you
like some tea, Mr. Kindaichi?

171
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,541
[KANEDA]
No, I can't, I'm on duty.

172
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,750
You're just as uptight
as ever, aren't ya?

173
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,333
Only pick the mushrooms
we showed you, okay?

174
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,333
Right!

175
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,583
There were a
whole bunch of them!

176
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,000
Wow, that's awesome, Yoshi!

177
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,000
[YOSHINO laughs]

178
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,791
[KIYO]
Oh, those are tsukiyotake.

179
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,125
If you eat one of those,
you'll turn ugly and die!

180
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,291
Wha--?

181
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,083
[YOSHINO]
But they look exactly the same!

182
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,333
I wonder how they
tell the difference.

183
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,958
[SUZUHARA] We can get
just about everything we need

184
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,625
from the internet now.

185
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,833
Withstanding a siege isn't
as hard as one might think.

186
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,750
[SANAE] But you know
you can't do it forever.

187
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
Professor, how long
are you planning

188
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
for this to continue?

189
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,333
What's your end game? What's the
goal you're working towards?

190
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,666
I'm doing this to make
the people of Manoyama

191
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,333
aware of this problem.

192
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,666
And, look--our supporters
are increasing.

193
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,875
I guess.

194
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,541
Still, I just wonder
if you're actually going

195
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,791
to solve anything.

196
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,541
[SUZUHARA]
I can understand that.

197
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,916
But, this village will
disappear, eventually.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,916
I just wanted to
be able to document

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,625
a bit of their culture
before that happens.

200
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,083
Today I'm going to
show you folks

201
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,541
how to prepare Warabiya soba.

202
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,666
The most important
ingredient for this is water.

203
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,583
You can't make a good
soba without good water!

204
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,208
Always remember that, friends!

205
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,416
[GORO]
Look for yourself!

206
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,375
Aren't these the
most massive daikon

207
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,583
you've ever seen?

208
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
"Why are they so huge?"
you may ask!

209
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,916
Because we've
got the best manure!

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,583
[SUZUHARA]
You see? It's happening.

211
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,708
They're already beginning
to use the Internet

212
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,208
to pass them along.

213
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,166
The traces of their lives.

214
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,291
A digital archive?

215
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,666
Yes, exactly.

216
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Hey, what are you
guys doing with those?

217
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,416
[MASA]
We're making a snow barrier.

218
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,916
We build barriers
around our houses now,

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,666
before the snow piles up,
to protect our windows.

220
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,166
Oh, wow.

221
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,625
It must be hard if you have
to build one for each house.

222
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,875
It is.

223
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,666
But that's why they all
work together out here.

224
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,541
When you live in the snow,
everyone helps each other out!

225
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,541
This machine is amazing!

226
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,333
I feel like it's taken
about fifty years off!

227
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,666
I've made some improvements,

228
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,916
but do you recognize
a Hercules Mark 3?

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,416
[YOSHINO, SHIORI laugh]

230
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,458
Will this get me into
the big leagues, I wonder?

231
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,500
[yells]

232
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,875
[SUZUHARA]
Thanks to all of you,

233
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,125
the culture and customs
of Warabiya will spread.

234
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,541
They'll be passed on
rather than forgotten.

235
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,708
I'll rescind our
declaration of withdrawal

236
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,958
from Chupakabura
when the timing is right.

237
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,500
Don't worry about that.

238
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,333
It's hard to believe
this was actually your goal.

239
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,083
You're saying you knew
it wasn't going to happen

240
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,291
from the start?

241
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,875
No, guess I still have
some small amount

242
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,708
of hope for us.

243
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,958
Hope that one day Manoyama
might change for the better.

244
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,208
I'll ask you again,
and be honest.

245
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,000
Why did you choose
to come to Manoyama?

246
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,625
You made the
decision to move here

247
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,416
on your own.

248
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
So, now that you're here,

249
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,416
what's the next step
on your journey?

250
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,125
[SANAE] To tell you the truth,
I don't know yet.

251
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,916
[MICHIYO coughing]

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,083
You okay, Michiyo?

253
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,833
Oh, sure.
It happens all the time.

254
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,791
I'm sorry to put you
out like this.

255
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:52,875
You're not.

256
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,250
The hospital's just up
ahead of us now.

257
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,875
[MICHIYO] I can still handle
most things these days,

258
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,916
but driving is too much.

259
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,541
[TAKAMIZAWA] Hey. Last
bus is in five minutes.

260
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
You can wait inside for it,
if you want to.

261
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,833
Isn't there anything
we can do?

262
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,416
I mean, about the
bus route problem?

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,666
Believe me, I understand
that none of this is easy.

264
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,000
But there's a way.

265
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,083
I know for a fact that
we we can figure this out.

266
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,375
You know? Like if everyone
would work together,

267
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,416
I know we could
come up with something.

268
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,166
I'm afraid some things just are
the way they are, Queen.

269
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,666
[YOSHINO]
What about the professor?

270
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,041
He's over eighty years old,
and he hasn't given up yet.

271
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,125
[sighs] The old man's
just throwing a fit.

272
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,375
No, he's not!

273
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
He knew they had
run out of options!

274
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,791
Takamizawa, do you
love this town?

275
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,291
Do you really care?

276
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,166
What?

277
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,541
Are you okay with all of this?

278
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,333
You think everything's
fine the way it is?

279
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,791
No, of course I don't!

280
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,041
I spend my life sitting
right there in that seat,

281
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,125
watching this town
day after day.

282
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,833
For over fifteen years now.

283
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,416
One day, the florist
goes out of business.

284
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,166
The next, an empty house
is crushed by snow.

285
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,583
Then, the elementary
school shuts down.

286
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,458
You really think it's possible
for a person to feel nothing?

287
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,833
Watching their hometown
crumble around them?

288
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,416
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,083
That was really presumptuous of
me. I can see I was out of line.

290
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,375
It's time. You coming?

291
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,416
There's room for you.

292
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,666
[YOSHINO]
I'm heading back.

293
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,333
[TAKAMIZAWA]
So.

294
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,208
Now, all the older folks know
how to use the internet, huh?

295
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,958
[SANAE]
Huh?

296
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,333
Think you could help me?

297
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,875
As the minister of IT and all?

298
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,333
You know, it's so funny.

299
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,291
I had something I wanted
to talk to you about, too!

300
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,125
I guess it's okay to stray
from the route sometimes.

301
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,208
[MASA] Now this here is
a Hanging Toro lantern.

302
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,541
You'll find, every house
here in Warabiya has one.

303
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,541
Look it.

304
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,875
Ya see what I mean?

305
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,500
They're to make sure
nothing out of the ordinary

306
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,875
is happening at our
neighbors' houses.

307
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,500
If the lantern's not lit,
then it means something

308
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,166
might have happened, so we
should go check on them.

309
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,583
It's a simple way
to tell if someone's safe.

310
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,750
I see.

311
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,666
File it under
"special local knowledge."

312
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,625
[SUZUHARA] You can't
survive out here in the cold

313
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,416
unless you help each other out.

314
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,583
If you think about it,
it's just like shoveling snow!

315
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,750
Yes, looking out
for others is looking out

316
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,333
for yourself, isn't it?

317
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,583
You see, Queen,

318
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,541
I was interested in
the thought processes

319
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,416
and knowledge of people
living in snowy areas.

320
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,833
That's why I moved here.

321
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,375
But wait, what happened
to the person

322
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,041
that used to live here?

323
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,750
Oh, they moved
to a senior home

324
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,666
in the same town
where their son lives.

325
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,791
The professor was about
to retire around then,

326
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,583
so he bought up
the entire property.

327
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,041
So it worked out well.

328
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,666
Okay! I think it's time to eat!

329
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,791
[SHIORI]
We're back!

330
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,666
Sanae, I got
the list of districts

331
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,250
from the Board of Tourism!

332
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,166
So we pick out the
addresses from the districts

333
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,541
one at a time, right?

334
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,500
Just leave it to us.

335
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,875
[SANAE]
Thanks! I sure will!

336
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,833
[MASA]
Here, have another, Sandal!

337
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,041
Gosh, this food is delicious!

338
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,083
[YOSHINO] It's a persimmon
mushroom mayonnaise risotto

339
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,541
topped with fava beans!

340
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,791
And it was made
by the queen, herself!

341
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,541
I read food in snowy
areas tends to be high in salt.

342
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,125
Well, mayonnaise is
surprisingly very low in salt!

343
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,500
[MASA]
Hmm?

344
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,541
She's being so very
considerate because she knows

345
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,166
I have high blood pressure.

346
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,833
She's simply a wonderful queen!

347
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,208
[YOSHINO chuckles]

348
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,958
That's why you've got
to take down that old loony,

349
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,333
Ushimatsu, and then take over
the Board of Tourism yourself!

350
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,250
She returns to
betray her master.

351
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,583
Poor Ushimatsu.

352
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,125
I think he's really trying,
but if you ask me,

353
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
the problem is,
he's still a pup.

354
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,125
If you become the permanent
Queen of Chupakabura,

355
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,416
we'll all happily pledge
our loyalty to you.

356
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,125
Kind of reminds me of Snow White
and the Seven Dwarves!

357
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,833
Oh, goodness, you're right!

358
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,666
And we've even got
a prince, haven't we?

359
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,291
[GROUP laughing]

360
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,125
No, no, you've all got it wrong.

361
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,000
The true prince
will arrive on a bus!

362
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,375
[GROUP laughing]

363
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,250
[YOSHINO]
And down, up!

364
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,958
And back, and, up!

365
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,416
And down--

366
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,333
[HIDE] Hey, there's
something down below!

367
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,375
[GROUP]
Huh?

368
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,375
It's the Manoyama
On-Demand Bus!

369
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,583
Take a flier!

370
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,708
What an incredible idea.

371
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,916
Yeah, so, it won't
follow a regular route.

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,625
It only runs when
someone specifically

373
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,708
makes a reservation!

374
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,166
[TAKAMIZAWA]
It's a bit of a hybrid.

375
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Something between
a bus and a taxi.

376
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,625
It's a little more
expensive than a bus,

377
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,750
but you can get a ride
whenever you want!

378
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,083
And on the business side,

379
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,750
it's a lot more efficient
than running a big bus

380
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,041
that nobody rides.

381
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,333
Wha--?

382
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,791
How has no one ever
thought of this till now?

383
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,208
[TAKAMIZAWA] I actually
did present the idea

384
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,458
to my company once before.

385
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,916
But then, red tape.

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,416
So it didn't go through.

387
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,625
I bet hiring someone
to take reservations

388
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,000
drove up the cost.

389
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,166
The solution
created new problems.

390
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,666
That's right.

391
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,875
But now that these seniors
know how to use the internet,

392
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,833
it's opened up lots
of other options.

393
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,250
Then you can
open up this page

394
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,166
just like I showed you,
and tap the word "reservation."

395
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,708
After that, all you need to do

396
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,833
is choose the best pickup time
and your preferred location!

397
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,208
[MICHIYO]
Oh, it's so easy!

398
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,708
As of now, it'll be
limited to Manoyama,

399
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,666
but we've already put in
all the different addresses,

400
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,125
like a car GPS.

401
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,333
Sanae put a lot of effort
into developing the program!

402

[YOSHINO]
She's amazing!

the testing phase,

[HIDE]
Didn't you throw out your back?

419
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,708
The on-demand bus
goes door to door,

420
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,708
so no walking to the bus stop.

421
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,125
And it's carpool,
so it's cheaper than a taxi.

422
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,583
It's so perfect for Manoyama!

423

You know,

00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,541
I'm kinda blown away by how
hard you've worked on this.

I take real pride in my work.

Without this job, I wouldn't
be able to feed my family.

428

take over one day.

476
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,208
[music continues]

477
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,375
[thud]

478
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,125
[phone rings]

479
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,833
Hello! This is the queen!

480
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,875
It was so sudden, huh?

481
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,041
I hope at least
he didn't suffer.

482
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,333
I just can't stand
the thought of that.

483
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,208
[KANEDA] He gave his will
to the notary ten years ago.

484
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,750
Left it all to the
municipal government.

485
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,250
I remember exactly what it says.
"I've prepared the funds to have

486
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,666
any and all
buildings demolished.

487
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,666
You can keep or reuse
them as you will.

488
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,583
As to what's inside, you can
do whatever you want

489
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,166
with all of that."
Very succinct.

490
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,583
He was a pretty cool guy.

491
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,916
He had a really nice smile.

492
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,375
That's an older photo.

493
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,750
I was able to blow it up.

494
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,083
[SHIORI] It still doesn't
feel real, does it?

495
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,125
[YOSHINO]
No.

496
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,291
[GORO]
Masa, I'm going to be honest.

497
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,666
I couldn't understand a
single bit of your eulogy!

498
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,750
[MASA]
It was dark.

499
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,500
I couldn't see the
paper properly.

500
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,541
What's this?

501
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,750
The professor's
research notebooks.

502
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,958
In the 20 years
since he arrived here,

503
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,166
he never skipped a single
day as far as I could tell.

504
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,875
He was doing research
the whole time he was here?

505
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,125
[SUZUHARA] The regions referred
to as "marginal villages"

506
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,958
do not simply fade
out of existence.

507
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,500
Through my current tests,

508
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,958
I have now found what I believe
to be a valuable case study.

509
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,083
[SANAE] So, this is what he
meant by "putting down roots."

510
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,750
[MASA]
Oh, that's right!

511
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,125
I suppose we need
to get a hold of Sugita.

512
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,250
Ah, of course.

513
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,833
Do you have his son's number?

514
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:55,875
Um, no.

515
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,583
Hold on, did you
just say Sugita?

516
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,041
[MASA]
Hm? Oh, yeah.

517
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,291
The guy that used
to own this place.

518
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,458
The message on
the bulletin board.

519
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,500
No way!

520
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
[YOSHINO] It's... It's one of
the festival treasures!

521
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,125
The Staff!

522
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,541
[RIRIKO] It even says
"Mizuchi Shrine" on it!

523
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,750
So that means it was
here all along, then.

524
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,958
He knew.

525
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,500
He knew it was here
and he didn't tell us.

526
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,541
[MASA laughs]
That's just like him!

527
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,625
Wait a minute.

528
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,666
Who wrote that message
on the board?

529
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,750
We checked so many places
and never found anything!

530
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,791
Maybe it was the professor.

531
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,583
[RIRIKO]
Signed, "Fawkes."

532
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,416
So he's a fox.

533
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,000
Just like we're the tanukis.

534
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,083
Huh?!

535
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,625
Still not going easy on us.

536
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,208
Nope, he's not.

537
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,583
How the hell are we
gonna move this thing?

538
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,375
Hey, I know!

539
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,833
I love the new bus.
It's so convenient!

540
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,041
Hey, now.

541
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,750
Just promise me you
won't abuse it, okay?

542
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,750
It's still in the testing phase.

543
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,583
[YOSHINO]
Oh, you can be so uptight!

544
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,083
[TAKAMIZAWA] I know you are,
but what am I?

545
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,416
[laughs]

546
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,541
[SANAE] I don't have any
ties to Manoyama, either,

547
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,708
just like you
when you came here.

548
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:11,083
But connections are something
you make for yourself.

549
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,625
I don't know what
the future holds for me,

550
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,833
but I wanna see what
I can do here for now.

551
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,000
Thank you, Professor.

552
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,041
Thank you.

553
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,250
Hey, anyway...

554
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,333
Isn't this thing gonna bring
us bad luck or something?

555
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,791
No, no worries there,
Takamizawa!

556
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,000
Right!

557
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,458
We have good intentions,
that's what matters!

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,625
[SANDAL] Does the soul have
a place to which it returns?

559
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:45,291
Tonight, I shall contemplate
this question, whiskey in hand.

560
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,375
[SANDAL] Next time:
"The Foggy Folklore."
