Illiterate boor!

3
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,458
[SASHA]
That's enough, you two!

4
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:53,000
What are you doing?

5
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,041
[SASHA] Hmm?

6
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,166
[BOTH] Um, it's because
she came at me!

7
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,166
It's her fault!
Uh! Not you!

8
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,041
If you want to fight...

9
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,500
then I guess I'll just
have to fight too.

10
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,791
[BOTH gasp]

11
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,083
To save time, you can
both come at me at once.

12
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,250
If either of your blades
manages to draw blood,

13
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,958
I'll give you a prize.

14
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,958
[SASHA] Which is...
I know! The two of you

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,125
get to order me
around for a day!

16
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,333
If you don't want to fight me,
you can just make up.

17
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,416

Want some more?

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,583
[BOTH] Mm-mmm.

23
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,375
[SASHA] You should only
turn your dragon gear

24
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:40,708
on another person
when there's a good reason.

25
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,750
And a feud like this isn't one.

26
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,583
Now, shake hands and make up.

27
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:49,041
Come on...

28
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:29,125
[bird caws]

29
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,833
Hello! I really appreciate
you making the journey here!

30
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,833
That's our agreement!

31
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,166
[SASHA]
And these little fellas,

32
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,833
well they're even happier
than I am to see you.

33
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:00,416
So... Let's start off
with the most important stuff.

34
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,458
The woman who's marched
an army into your land

35
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,833
without any reason or warning!

36
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,708
Elizaveta Fomina...

37
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,708
Flash Princess
of the Thunder Swirl.

38
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,291
[growls]

39
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,458
What could possibly
motivate her to do this?

40
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,750
[SASHA] I'll explain.
But I need you to stay calm.

41
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,083
[gasps]

42
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,083
It was the middle
of last summer.

43
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,666
Elizaveta and I
were campaigning together,

44
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,708
fighting a pirate band
that was raiding the coast.

45
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,791
And just as we finished up,

46
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,041
she accused me
of not being fair.

47
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,166
According to her,
my soldiers funneled

48
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,583
the pirates toward her lines,

49
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,791
so they had to
bear the full brunt.

50
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,750
[ELEN]
Is there any truth to that?

51
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,375
I read the reports,
but I can't say either way.

52
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,750
I haven't been able
to talk to her,

53
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,375
because she abruptly stopped
writing me in the fall.

54
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:48,541
And that's when Lady Elizaveta
mobilized her men against you?

55
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,000
She was just looking for
any excuse to invade!

56
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,708
Being ill, you'd think
these little ones

57
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,208
would find me unworthy
of being a war maiden

58
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,208
and choose someone else...

59
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,083
[SASHA] Then I wouldn't
have to turn to you now,

60
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,916
or even be in
this situation at all.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,458
But, they don't agree.

62
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,083
[ELEN] Well, I think
it's a beautiful thing!

63
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,333
War maidens are chosen
by their Dragon Gear...

64
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,750
and because of this,
my problem is now yours.

65
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,458
Stop worrying about it, Sasha!

66
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,583
I'm happy to be here;
it's no problem.

67
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,291
I'll drive that scheming
Elizaveta out of Legnica!

68
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,958
And let you get back
to recuperating!

69
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,458
[SASHA] That reminds me...

70
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,333
From what I hear,
you've been on some interesting

71
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,125
military adventures lately.
In one of Sofy's letters,

72
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,708
she mentioned something
about you even going to Brune?

73
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,833
[ELEN] Yes. There's a young
count in all kinds of trouble.

74
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,666
I couldn't abandon him
to the dukes there,

75
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,125
so I'm lending him a hand.

76
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,958
Seems like it's more you
who's been lent a hand by him.

77
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,125
Oh, please, Lim; don't act
like you're above it all.

78
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,208
I have vivid memories
of him saving your life

79
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:48,916
with his mouth
right on your breast...

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
Uh!

81
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,125
Sounds like you've both really
taken to this Brunish noble.

82
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,875
He's a fascinating fellow.

83
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,583
If you get to talk to him,
you'll like him right away, too!

84
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,291
Sasha, I have to bring him
here sometime to say hello.

85
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,083
And I might even
let you borrow him...

86
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,000
[ELEN] ...for a little bit.

87
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,291
Well then, that all
sounds like a lot of fun.

88
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,583
I'll make sure I hold on
a little longer.

89
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,583
[LIM] Mm?

90
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,125
[KUREYS] A Zhcted army?

91
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,000
I have been hearing
through our spy network

92
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,416
that a minor nobleman
in Brune formed an alliance

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,208
with a Zhcted Army. Huh.

94
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,000
They've committed
several thousand soldiers,

95
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,083
but why? What does
Zhcted have to gain

96
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,750
from allying with
such a lesser partner?

97
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,416
Hmmm.

98
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,625
[KUREYS] Listen up!

99
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,291
Send an envoy to this girl!

100
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,041
If the war maiden
is as beautiful as

101
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,958
her reputation holds,
then give her my full support!

102
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,166
[ADVISORS] Sire...

103
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,625
[KUREYS] If she's
more man than woman,

104
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,250
tell the envoy he's welcome
to return empty-handed!

105
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,541
[laughs]

106
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,041
[MILA]
That's your first demerit.

107
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:48,125
[TIGRE] What?

108
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,583
Your greeting began
with you saying,

109
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,208
"Thank you for saving us."

110
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,500
It's not smart
to assume generosity.

111
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,833
[MILA] For all you know,
I might demand

112
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,375
compensation for the help.

113
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,166
And what should I make
of you giving me this tea

114
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,500
before I said a word?

115
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,750
I make tea for
everyone I parlay with,

116
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,458
even those I hate.

117
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,416
[MILA]
This way, if talks go badly,

118
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,375
I have something
to throw in their faces.

119
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:10,583
All right, Ludmila,
what are you doing here?

120
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,375
Why do you think I'm here?

121
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,666
Do you want me?

122
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,208
[gasps]

123
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,000
[MILA] I'm asking if you want
me and the four thousand men

124
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,541
under me to be your allies.

125
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,708
Of course!

126
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,625
[MILA] Second demerit!

127
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,375
I know you're hard up,
but you're coming across

128
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,250
too desperate and it gives
away your bad position.

129
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,041
And I will not enter into
an alliance with a fool.

130
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,666
Please help me, Ludmila!

131
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,000
[MILA gasps]

132
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,333
[TIGRE] I don't have
anything of worth

133
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,208
to offer you right now,
but if you can wait until

134
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,500
the war's over, I promise
I'll come up with something.

135
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,541
[MILA]
Lift up your head, Tigre.

136
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,583
I wonder what's
a better description.

137
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,750
Are you honest out of
moral conviction,

138
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,583
or, because you're a fool...

139
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,291
Either way,
you've passed the test.

140
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
So you are helping me?

141
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,416
[MILA] The negotiation
is only just starting.

142
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,458
First up, show me what
my help is worth to you...

143
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,875
[TIGRE] Um...

144
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,916
[MILA] In the battle
at the Tatra Mountains,

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,250
you guys were able to
destroy the ancient citadel's

146
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,250
rear gateway, right?

147
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,333
[MILA] The fact is,
that gate had a very unique,

148
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,958
and very clever design.

149
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,125
It got its structural strength
from three plates of iron,

150
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,833
with each plate having
oak planks between them.

151
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,875
[MILA] Even Arifal couldn't
knock down that gate.

152
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,541
It was you who did it.

153
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,833
[MILA] Did she
tell you to keep quiet?

154
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,916
[chuckles softly]

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,833
You know...
I once bought into the idea

156
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,291
that you were different--

157
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,708
As straight and true
with your words

158
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,041
as you are with your arrows,

159
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,083

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,458
Yes, a pledge to
withdraw troops and begin

317
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:44,625
formal negotiations
regarding the pirates.

318
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,291
How about the first term
be that you and I agree to

319
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,041
a non-aggression pact
with each other for one year?

320
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,291
I want to add one condition.

321
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,875
And what might that be?

322
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,791
Say you're sorry to Sasha.

323
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,875
I'll spare you
from having to grovel,

324
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,875
but I do want a sincere,
honest apology.

325
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,333
Very well. As you wish.

326
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,416
[NARRATOR] And with that,
the Battle of Boroslow

327
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
comes to an end.

328
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:19,000
Both armies withdraw, to lay
the groundwork for a new peace.

329
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,000
And with the
Legnican Army helping to

330
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,958
speed their journey,
the next morning sees Ellen

331
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,083
and her forces
leave for Leitmeritz.

332
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:33,666
[ELEN] Don't do anything rash,
Tigre. We're coming.

333
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,916
--[MILA] Just one battle.
--[TIGRE gasps]

334
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
[MILA] We will defeat the
Muozinellan invasion force

335
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,458
in just one battle.

336
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,000
[RYURIK] You think we can?

337
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,291
[MILA] It's not about whether
or not "we can." We have to.

338
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,625
[TIGRE] Sounds like Elen.

339
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,458
[MILA clears throat]
Another demerit!

340
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,791
I know we've been at this
for a while and you're tired,

341
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,875
but you're responsible
for thousands of men!

342
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,666
Listen during war councils!

343
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,458
Sorry!

344
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,541
All right,
let's go over it again.

345
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,416
[MILA] Your soldiers probably
only have the strength

346
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,791
to manage one more battle.

347
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,791
It's not that I'm blaming them,

348
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,250
[MILA] I just hope
this isn't too reckless.

349
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,083
Well... we are
used to taking risks...

350
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,708
As long as
you think it can work.

351
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,583
It's the best move
we have. Just like when

352
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,958
you fought against the army
of twenty thousand.

353
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,333
[MILA]
When you're outnumbered,

354
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,625
wear down their strength
by attacking their supplies,

355
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,958
or kill their commander.

356
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,750
In this case, hitting
their provisions won't work.

357
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,541
They'd wipe us out
before we even got close

358
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,916
to their supply train.

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,791
Seems to me that you're
describing a job for

360
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,541
Sir Tigrevurmud's bow.

361
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,208
Perhaps, but this enemy
commander has real talent.

362
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,916
Wait, you've
heard of him before?

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,041
Yes, his name is
Shahin Balamir.

364
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,125
He also goes by
the nickname "Barbaros,"

365
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,375
and he's the brother of
the Muozinellan king.

366
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,708
So he's famous?

367
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,833
Must be, judging by
how she talks about him.

368
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,541
[MILA]
Oh for crying out loud, Tigre!

369
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:49,416
Hasn't Eleonora been
teaching you anything

370
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,375
about statecraft
and politics?!

371
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,625
I guess not.

372
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,666
I believe it happened
ten years ago.

373
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,125
Basically, Sachstein built
a navy of a thousand ships

374
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,416
to invade Muozinel.

375
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,875
When this force
entered Muozinellan waters,

376
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,958
he beat them with
just two hundred ships.

377
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,333
[TIGRE] He won?!

378
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,875
[MILA] Overwhelmingly!

379
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,583
All of the survivors trembled
at the very thought of him,

380
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,958
and so, out of respect and fear,
dubbed him "Red Beard."

381
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,625
It's Barbarossa,
in the Sachstein language,

382
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,583
but when translated
back to Muozinellan,

383
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:22,083
this became shortened
to simply "Barbaros."

384
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,458
This is the enemy commander

385
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,333
we must do battle
with and defeat.

386
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,833
So listen closely...

387
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,625
because we will win
where others have lost.

388
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,291
[TIGRE] I see.
It just might work.

389
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,583
But you're right
to call it reckless.

390
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,125
[MILA] Losing your nerve?

391
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,375
[TIGRE exhales] Mm-mmm.

392
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:49,041
Tell me, why are you
sticking out your neck this far?

393
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,791
It's simple. Because I'm
confident you're capable of

394
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,791
repaying a loan this great.

395
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,416
[MILA] And I hope
the way you pull it all off

396
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,750
leaves me feeling very...
satisfied.

397
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,458
Good luck, Tigre.

398
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,958
[NARRATOR] Following their
scouting party's reconnaissance,

399
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:07,875
the main Muozinellan force
marches straight down

400
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,958
the Agnes royal road.

401
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,458
The forty thousand
man army is divided into

402
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,250
seven divisions,
which maintain a set distance

403
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,416
between each other
as they advance.

404
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
By doing so,
they have the flexibility

405
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,125
to handle ambushes
and flanking attacks.

406
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,625
This is an innovation
originally devised by

407
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,708
Red Beard Kureys.

408
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,416
[KUREYS]
Let me think about this...

409
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Whether they be an army of
Zhcted soldiers or Brunishmen,

410
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,958
how will they
reveal themselves?

411
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,166
They still haven't
appeared, have they?

412
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,708
[KUREYS ADVISOR 9B]
There is some news, my lord.

Good! I've been
waiting for this!

[KUREYS] Yes...

"is because a Brunish nobleman

[KUREYS] What?

Yes, sire.

442
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,375
As much as it pains
me to admit it,

443
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,708
the war maiden's
accusations are correct.

444
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,666
Muozinel has no legal right
under any treaty or agreement

445
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,833
to move into Brunish land.
For all intents and purposes,

446

I am clearly the aggressor at
the head of an invading army.

447

Ha! However morally correct
the Brunish perspective,

00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:52,541
the Zhcted still have no right
to point their fingers.

[MUOZINELLAN SOLDIER 9A]
Sire... There are two low hills

directly west of
the road in front of us.

behind the nearer of the two.

To the northwest,
we've also discovered

a commoner camp of
two thousand former slaves
