1
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,250
[KUREYS] How does the hill look?

2
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,791
[KUREYS ADVISOR B]
There are four banners...

3
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,000
I saw a Bayard, a Zirnitra...

4
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,750
a half-moon flag,
and a spear flag.

5
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:08,208
[KUREYS SCOUT A] The hill is
covered with barricades

6
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,833
and trenches.
There are rows of spears.

7
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,916
It looks like a small fortress.

8
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,208
[KUREYS SCOUT A]
When our troops get too close,

9
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,125
they're showered
with rocks and arrows.

10
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,833
[KUREYS] Have any
of them been injured?

11
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,041
[KUREYS SCOUT A]
No, fortunately.

12
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,708
For the most part, they missed.

13
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,750
[KUREYS] All right...
Good work...

14
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:30,791
What about that other small
hill? The one farther away?

15
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,708
[KUREYS ADVISOR B] It's
blanketed in snow.

16
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,041
Completely white.

17
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,666
If the enemy were there,
surely we'd see some sign.

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,958
[SOLDIER A] We're approaching
the freed slaves.

19
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,666
Move fast!
Recapture those wretches

20
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,625
and hold them as hostages.

21
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:47,166
Let's see how you respond
to that... Eh, war maiden?

22
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,875
[NARRATOR] The Ormea Campaign
is about to commence

23
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:25,125
with a multi-pronged attack
from the enemy army.

24
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:28,708
Besieging the hilltop stronghold
are the battle-hardened soldiers

25
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:35,750
of the First, Second,
Third, and Fourth Divisions.

26
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,041
The remaining Fifth
and Sixth Divisions,

27
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,666
along with the Seventh,
which is the main force,

28

chase the civilian refugees
fleeing up the road.

29
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:47,291
However, hiding on the hill that
was thought to be unoccupied...

30
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,666
Are the Silver Meteor Storm
and the Olmütz army,

31
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,416
who leap into action.

32
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
[COMMANDER A]
Come on! Fire! Fire!

33
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,208
[COMMANDER B]
They're closing in! But how?!

34
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,666
[MILA yells]

35
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,375
Do it now!

36
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,833
Okay!

37
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,750
Hey, not too shabby.

38
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,875
Here, catch!

39
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,291
Honestly... aren't you afraid?

40
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,583
If you think I should be,
then guard me.

41
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,750
Eh-heh!

42
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:37,541
[KUREYS] Hmm... So, they were
hiding on that unfortified hill?

43
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,166
Ludmila Laurie has
a renowned reputation

44
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,875
for defensive warfare...

45
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,500
And we just played right
into her hands, didn't we?

46
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:50,083
Our allies have launched their
attack! Now let's go join them!

47
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,500
[SOLDIERS cheer]

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,791
[SOLDIER L] The slaves who were
fleeing have turned around

49
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,875
and taken up arms!

50
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,166
They've what?

51
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,500
[KUREYS] Well then,
will the gods of war

52
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,375
be slaying the mischievous
dragons and horses?

53
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,833
Or are we the ones...

54
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,500
who will be trampled
by hoofs and claws?

55
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,208
[NARRATOR} The men that
Kureys believes to be slaves

56
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,791
are actually Silver Meteor
Storm and Olmütz soldiers

57
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,333
in disguise...
With Tigre's squadron,

58
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,583
they attack the enemy's
Fifth Division.

59
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,625
Meanwhile, the real refugees
are safely hidden

60
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,708
within the hilltop fortress.

61
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,541
But we've been through
so much already.

62
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,958
We're stuck here
eating rotten food...

63
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,958
and sleeping on
the ground outside.

64
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,083
What more do you want from us?!

65
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,000
I realize your hardships...
but please...

66
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,333
Right now we have to dig deep.

67
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,250
This is something I need you to
do...

68
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,416
It's going to help us save
more people just like you.

69
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,166
But, sir...

70
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,125
[MAN B] I'm with the
Count on this one.

71
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,583
[TIGRE gasps]

72
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,250
We can't fight them ourselves...

73
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,625
If we went head-to-head... then
they would crush us in no time.

74
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:14,416
However... if we go along
with Lord Tigre's plan,

75
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,083
we can survive, and even
better, get some revenge.

76
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,958
We'll protect you with
everything we have.

they've shown us!

[KUREYS ADVISOR A]
That can't be!

[KUREYS ADVISOR B] Impossible!

00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,791
Send a message to the Fourth
Division...

Have them let the First
through Third Divisions

besiege the hill.

87

The Fourth will
join us immediately

to serve as reinforcements.

[SOLDIER A] Yes, sire!

00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,166
We'll crowd them as much
as they crowd us...

91
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,333
And keep it up 'til
they're exhausted.

[NARRATOR] Mila and
Tigre's groups close in

93
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,708
on the Seventh Division...

94
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,125
As it retreats, the
Silver Meteor Storm

95
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:13,791
and Olmütz armies follow hard
to make sure they don't escape.

96
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,125
But then, the Sixth Division
suddenly changes direction

97
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,500
and chases after
Tigre's squadron.

98
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,958
Move our flying column
to intercept!

99
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,458
That should buy us enough
time to shoot Kureys.

100
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,625
[NARRATOR] The flying column
moves into position. However...

the Sixth Division
closes in on Tigre and Mila.

have even come close

attempting to box them in.

putting as much distance

as possible between
himself and Tigre's bow...

117

There, Kureys is
truly untouchable.

118

You know, she's
supposed to be of a rank

121
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,333
just below their king...

122
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,833
We can't subject her to
the shame of captivity.

123
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,416
We'll treat her like
an honored guest

124
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,583
and give her a warm
welcome. Very warm...

And under the behest

There's no way
I could ever forget you.

...I was deeply troubled, that
due to my position as a knight,

181

I couldn't help you...

182
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,208
But then I received a
letter from Sir Roland

singing your praises.

hasten to join you.

316
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,666
Here you go, love.

317
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,000
[GIRL] Thank you so much!

318
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,000
Titta... rest.

319
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,333
Go and see the young master.

320
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,583
I already dropped in on him...

321
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,375
It looked like he had
his hands pretty full

322
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,166
with so many visitors there...

323
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,625
So that's why I'm here,
doing whatever I can to help.

324
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,125
Nice of you.

325
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,708
It's nothing. Lord Tigre's
helped these people so much...

326
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,250
Just look at them.

327
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,791
It seems the young master is
becoming a great man, isn't he?

328
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,750
Yes!

329
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,291
[TITTA giggles]

330
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,791
[LIM] How can I make it up?

331
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,791
I feel bad that
I was gone so long.

332
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,458
Don't worry. There's nothing
you could've done.

333
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,375
Yes it's no time for regret.

334
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,625
More and more banners are
joining Tigre's cause.

335
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,166
And that's as crucial a
victory as the battle itself.

336
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,875
It was... Tigre and Roland...

337
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,625
The tenacity of the living
combined with

338
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,875
the endorsement of the dead
are what motivated these men

339
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,708
to lift their swords and rally.

340
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,166
All I did was help facilitate.

341
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,000
I must admit that
when I first met him,

342
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,541
I thought he was just a
helpless, happy-go-lucky kid.

343
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:56,833
But now, at this point...

344
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,208
At this point,
Tigre has assumed the role

345
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,833
of a third major power in Brune.

346
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,166
Makes me wonder...
what his next move will be?

347
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,083
[NOBLEMAN]
Now, if you'll excuse me...

348
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,583
Thanks for all your help.

349
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,500
Tigre, come back
to my camp with me.

350
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,166
I'll make you some more
of that delicious tea

351
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,833
you loved to relieve
your fatigue.

352
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,625
Just who do you think you are,
calling him "Tigre"?!

353
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,000
Tigre... we're so close now, you
should start calling me "Mila."

354
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,750
Uh... Mila?

355
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,583
[ELEN growls]

356
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh, what a pity.

357
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,083
I'm afraid Tigre has to have a
word with me right now.

358
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,208
Let's go!

359
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,000
Says the woman who wasn't by
his side when it mattered most.

360
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,958
What could you possibly have
to say to Lord Tigre now?

361
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,375
Don't act noble!

362
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,708
I know you waited for the
perfect moment to swoop in

363
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,291
and extort him for as
much as you could!

364
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey, hypocrite, it's not like
you're offering your services

365
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,541
for free, either!

366
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,875
The difference is, I've never
tried to jack up my prices,

367
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,000

[MILA sighs]

375
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,625
[TIGRE] Look... Thanks
for the invitation, Mila.

376
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,500
But if it's okay with you,

377
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,291
maybe I can take a
rain check for another time?

378
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,166
[TIGRE] Mmm, this is nice.

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,375
[ELEN] You think?

00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,583
[TIGRE] How's your friend?
Is she okay?

381
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:46,291
[ELEN] Oh, she's fine.
It's you I'm worried about.

382
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,750
Getting seduced so easily

383
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,958
and letting your eyes
wander like that...

384
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,583
Kidding, of course.

385
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:59,458
I guess Ludmila did stand up
to the Muozinellan army...

386
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,875
And she did it for you.

You've turned out to be
every bit the man

I led so many...
of your men... to death.

[ELEN] Look at me, Tigre.

00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,833
[ELEN] Now lie down.

00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,541
If you think back
on this campaign,

394
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,125
you don't regret any of the
fighting you've done, do you?

395
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,250
[TIGRE] No... I don't.

[ELEN] That's what matters.

Now pray to whichever
god you believe in

on behalf of all
those who fought...

courageously in service
