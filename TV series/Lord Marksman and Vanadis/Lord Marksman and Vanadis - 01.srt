Throw down your bow.

00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:46,583
You may call me
Eleonora Viltaria.

3
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:47,791
Your turn.

4
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:52,000
Lord Tigrevurmud Vorn.

5
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,625
[ELEN] Very well.

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
From this day forward, 
you are now my property.

7
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,541
[TIGRE] Bertrand!
Lord Mashas!

8
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,791
The battle.
It was terrible.

9
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:59,083
[BRUNE SOLDIERS yell]

10
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,208
So that's a War Maiden.

11
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,708
[TIGRE] From the sound of it,
I've got five shots.

[gasps]

13
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,541
[ZHCTED KNIGHT] The last
Brunish survivor's mine!

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,458
[ZHCTED KNIGHT yells]

15
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,708
Aw, rats, come on.

16
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,750
I could have used that horse
to ride out of here.

17
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,208
Seven knights.

18
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,666
[TIGRE] That hair.

19
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,875
The War Maiden.

20
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,041
If I kill her
right now myself,

21
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,208
perhaps they'll stop hunting
Brunish survivors.

22
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,666
All right!

23
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,833
[TIGRE] Range,
three hundred alsins.

24
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,125
Easy.

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,583
Guide my arrow, Eris,
Goddess of Wind.

26
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,541
[ELEN] Throw down your bow.

27
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,583
[BRUNE SOLDIERS chattering]

28
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,958
[NARRATOR]
War had broken out

29
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,875
between the Kingdoms
of Brune and Zhcted.

30
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:23,083
And the Dinant Plains that
lay between the two lands

31
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,166
would see the decisive battle.

32
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,583
So it was,
that the Brunish Army,

33
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,125
with an overwhelming advantage
in numbers, established camp.

34
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:35,166
There wasn't a man among them
who thought they could lose.

35
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,541
Of course.

36
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,250
[ZION ENTOURAGE laughs]

37
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:45,041
Well. I didn't know
you'd be here, Vorn.

38
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,500
My greetings from
one lord to another.

39
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,083
Lord Zion Thenardier.

40
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,666
I, too, have answered His
Majesty's call to defeat--

41
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,208
[ZION] Such a demure
way of talking back.

42
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:00,208
What good are you here
among men like us?

43
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,000
[ZION] The poor fool
is built like a feather

44
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,166
and covered in rags!

45
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,458
[ZION ENTOURAGE 1A]
Leather armor!

46
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,708
[ZION ENTOURAGE 1B]
Shouldn't a nobleman

47
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,208
at least dress the part?

48
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,208
And that bow. Heh, heh.

49
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,875
The weapon of a peasant!

50
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,000
[ZION yells]

51
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,250
[ZION ENTOURAGE 1A]
No, Lord Zion!

52
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,333
[ZION ENTOURAGE 1B]
Are you hurt?

53
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,416
What gives you the right
to bend my bow?

54
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,666
You're pathetic!

55
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,125
A bow and arrow
is a coward's weapon.

56
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,750
[ZION] Oh, Vorn.

57
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,250
Why don't you admit the
reason you use a bow

58
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,000
is because you're not strong
enough to wield a real weapon.

59
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,833
You're a boy, pretending
to be a soldier.

60
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,916
And having an old man
for an attendant

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,625
only makes you that
much more of a disgrace.

62
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,166
In battle, there's only
one way to defend Brune.

63
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,083
You should be training
with a man's weapon.

64
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,083
Maybe this can wait.

65
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,333
I hate to interrupt
this eloquent lecture,

66
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:54,166
but they're handing out the
evening's wine rations now.

67
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,958
And I assume your talking
has made you quite thirsty.

68
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,750
Go fill your goblet, please.

69
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,166
I appreciate the assist.
Thanks, Lord Mashas.

70
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,500
[MASHAS]
Happy to do so.

71
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,666
Guess I couldn't help
escalating things, but...

72
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,583
You saved me from a nasty fight.

73
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,250
[NOBLEMAN 1A] If you ask me,
I envy Duke Ganelon.

74
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,583
[NOBLEMAN 1B]
What? Why?

75
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,250
For using this war as
a pretense to raise taxes.

76
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,250
And for taking his
enemies' daughters.

77
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,958
That's true. Duke Thenardier's
just as crafty, making subjects

78
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:30,916
donate their liquor as
a "sacrifice to the gods."

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,083
And both are torching the homes
of anyone who holds out.

80
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,083
That's nothing, I've heard that
to set an example to others,

81
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,958
Duke Thenardier's forcing family
members to take up swords

82
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,083
and fight to the death.

83
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,666
How entertaining!

84
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,833
[NOBLEMEN laugh]

85
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,166
Not worth it.

86
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,083
[TIGRE] Are those stories
they're telling true?

87
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,958
The men in question
wouldn't deny it.

88
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,166
It's news to you
because you don't travel

89
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,125
through the middle of
the Kingdom very often.

90
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,500
And the King?

91
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,541
[MASHAS] His Majesty has
something in mind for them,

92
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,458
I'm sure.

93
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,041
Like a punishment?

94
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,541
And even if he can't,

95
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:13,875
I'm sure in time Prince Regnas
will possess the strength.

96
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,000
[groans]

97
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,583
Huh?

98
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,708
[groans]

00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,541
[TIGRE chokes]

100
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,250
You've been sleeping
long enough.

101
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,791
Is it late?

102
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,666
[LIM] It's almost noon.

103
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,875
That's a strange way
of waking people up.

104
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,416
[LIM] Well having
to wake a slave

105
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,000
by shoving a sword down his
throat is a first for me, too.

106
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,083
How can you lose a battle,
become a prisoner,

107
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,500
and still sleep without
a care in the world?

108
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,583
It's one of my
magic powers.

109
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,041
[TIGRE] So, this is
the Kingdom of Zhcted?

110
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,166
[LIM] Lady Eleonora
would like to see you.

111
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,625
[TITTA] What?!

112
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:57,833
No.

113
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,708
But how could Zhcted
capture him so easily?

114
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,583
We suffered a total
rout in a sneak attack.

115
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,291
Tigre couldn't flee in time,
but he fought well.

116
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,000
[TITTA]
But, I thought that

117
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,750
I heard our forces outnumbered
Zhcted five to one!

118
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,333
How could we lose
so decisively?

119
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,500
[MASHAS] You're right.

120
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,833
We had an army twenty-five
thousand strong

121
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,500
to only their five thousand.

122
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,833
It was a mighty force
His Majesty had assembled

123
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,500
in honor of the Prince's
debut campaign.

124
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,375
Lord Tigre was so ready.

125
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,708
He had one hundred brave banner
men following him into battle.

126
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,958
[BERTRAND] The battle
wasn't the only thing lost.

127
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,375
Of those hundred men, seven
are dead and thirty injured.

128
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,875
[TITTA gasps]

129
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,250
And most of those were trampled
by our own fleeing allies.

130
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,166
We received the following
demand from the enemy leader:

131
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,708
Unless we deliver a ransom
within fifty days,

132
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,500
Tigre will become Zhicted's
property forever.

133
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,041
How much do they want?

134
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,416
Even if it's exorbitant,

135
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,458
I'm sure we can get
the villagers to chip in!

136
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,166
[MASHAS] They demand three
times the yearly revenue

137
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,791
of the province of Alsace,

138
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,791
or something of
comparable value.

139
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,041
[gasps]

140
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,875
[TIGRE] Be reasonable.
That's way too high.

141
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,541
[ELEN] Too bad.

142
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,750
[TIGRE sighs]

143
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,541
The Kingdom of Brune
has fifty days to comply

144
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,583
with our ransom demand
after receiving it.

145
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,875
Time's a-wasting.

146
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,541
If the full amount
we've requested

147
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,791
is not delivered to me,
in accordance with the treaty.

148
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,666
You will officially
become my property,

149
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,458
for me to do with as I see fit.

Well, all right.

153
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,458
This is why you stuck your sword
in my mouth and brought me here.

154
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,416
So I could hear your crazy
greed with my own ears.

155
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,583
Now, now.

156
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,875
There's more to our
talking than ransom.

157
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,083
I have something special
only you can do for me.

00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,291
You better be taking
this seriously.

161
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,500
I am, don't worry.

162
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,625
Is this your first time
with a bow, sir?

163
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,791
[laughing]

164
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,666
Now that's cutting
with a knife, Ryurik.

165
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,000
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1D]
Of all the prisoners,

166
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,291
why would the War Maiden
bring back this weakling?

167
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,125
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1E]
Looks like he's gonna keep

embarrassing himself!

169
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,500
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1F]
Useless and a glutton...

170
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,375
This entire
demonstration is a farce.

171
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,250
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1G] His first
shot was way too short.

172
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,916
His second was way too long.

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,250
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1H]
That means on his third try,

174
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,708
he'll shoot himself
in the foot! Ha ha ha!

175
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:21,041
I've got a feel for
this bow's limits.

Here goes.

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,541
I want him skinned alive!

I mean no insult, but
can they take him alive?

182
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,333
Who do you think you are
telling me what to do here?!

183

[TIGRE] Fine,
then I'll hit his foot.

And he did it with
a bad bow, too!

[ASSASSIN groaning]

He hit a moving target from well
over three hundred alsins away.

[TIGRE]
Just so we're clear,

191
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,083
do you want me to keep shooting?

192
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,500
I think I've seen enough.

You're quite a talent,

[ELEN]
My apologies for yesterday.

195
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,041
Wait, for what?

196
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,833
The bow they gave you.

197
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,875
It was never my intention
for you to receive one

198
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,291
that shoddily constructed.

199
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,625
So. you weren't trying
to make me look bad,

200
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,541
it was shoddy Zhcted
craftsmanship.

201
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,041
[ELEN] No.

202
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,791
The three men who made the bow
did want to sabotage you.

00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,958
I'll have them beheaded.

204
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,875
Whoa, hold on!
It was a harmless prank.

205

No one got hurt!

206
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,833
That was more than a prank.

207
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,541
They wanted to humiliate you!

And bring dishonor to your
people and your family!

this scheme with their lives!

[ELEN] This one time.

213

So, what was the point

of having me show off my
skills in the first place?

215

[ZHCTED SOLDIERS fighting]

218

The War Maiden fell
for me at first sight!

219
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,375
That's right. You could
call it battlefield passion,

220
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,041
an affection that only
comes between close enemies.

221
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,458
You know how people love
gossiping about palace intrigue.

222
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,458
And they're not
wrong to do so.

223

I really am mad
for you, you know!

[TIGRE] For me?

225
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,833
Not for your looks
or personality!

226
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:05,500
I'm attracted to your skill
with the bow and arrow.

227
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,583
But anyway.

228
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,458
I guess some of my men
heard the gossip

229
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,666
and were feeling
a bit jealous of you.

Instead of finding a place
for you by my side,

00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,708
they'd rather I kill you!

be the easiest thing.

But that's just my opinion.

00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,791
[ELEN] The army ranks
are full of hot heads.

00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,666
I thought having you
show off your skills

237
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,791
would be the quickest way to
change their opinions of you.

238
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,708
Ultimately, it was effective.

239
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,833
And one more thing,
since I'm being honest.

240
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,250
Beyond your bow skills,
the reason I took you prisoner

241
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,208
at the Dinant Plains
was not for a ransom.

242

Mostly, it was because
I found you, entertaining.

Entertaining how?
In a battle?

Despite the win, that battle
was still nasty business.

00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,541
As well as being a
complete and total waste.

246

[ELEN] We numbered
just five thousand,

a brutal battle.

00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,125
the battle should have
gone on a day.

252

[TIGRE] You say that
like you're disappointed!

253
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,083
I prepared a number of
plans I was excited to try!

254
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,458
And yet, your side
collapsed from my first plan

255
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:32,916
right as the battle began!

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,625
Your first plan, huh?
Nighttime sneak attack.

257
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:39,333
Thanks to the reconnaissance
our scouts had carried out,

258
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,166
we surprised the
Brunish rearguard

259
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,291
and scattered the troops.

260
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,791
In that melee, the Brunish
Prince was killed.

261
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,791
[TIGRE]
You mean Prince Regnas?!

262
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,500
Were you two close friends?

263
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,833
[TIGRE]
Not at all.

264
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,541
I only met him
once in my whole life.

265
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,791
[ELEN] Do you hold
his death against me?

266
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,416
[TIGRE] It happened in battle.

267
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,416
I killed some of your men
myself, you know.

268
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, I'm sure.

269
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,541
Once news of his
death got around,

270
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,500
the Brunish army came
apart at the seams.

271
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,875
[ELEN] I didn't want them
to regroup for another day,

272
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,208
so I pursued, cutting
them down as they fled.

273
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:24,250
And so it was all my
great plans went unused.

274
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,625
But in that moment,
you flew onto the scene.

275
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,791
In spite of
your allegiances,

276
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:36,083
I didn't want to kill you.

277
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,500
Brune's army turned out
to be a paper tiger.

278
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,666
But you kept your courage
and stayed in the fight,

279
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,791
even tried to shoot me
down with your bow!

280
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,708
I've a weakness
for such mettle.

281
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,375
So I brought you to
Leitmeritz, in Zhcted.

282
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,458
Lim, are you holding
a grudge against him

283
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,708
for what happened
on the battlefield?

284
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,416
I promise, the battle had
nothing to do with it.

285
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,458
[TIGRE] Hm?

286
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,750
I'm not sure I believe that.

287
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,875
Remember that first
horse you shot down?

288
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,125
Lim was the rider.

289
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,041
Why don't we start over?

290
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,916
I am the War Maiden's
bodyguard, Limalisha.

291
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,291
Count Tigrevurmud Vorn,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

292
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,916
Uh. Hello.

293
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,791
You know, if I'm
being honest, your name,

294
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,791
it sounds like a mouthful
for a traditional Brunishman.

295
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,583
Is there a fun story behind it?

296
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,125
Well, it's the name of
one of my ancestors.

297
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,791
If it's too hard to say,
you can always call me "Tigre."

298
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:25,833
Tigre it is!

299
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,500
And feel free
to call me "Elen."

300
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,458
I also think
that we should--

301
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,250
[LIM]
Lady Eleonora!

302
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,666
Tigre, will you
serve under me?

303
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,708
I will treat you as a Count,
just as you were in Brune.

304
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,166
And valor you show in combat
will be honored like that

305
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,375
of any other pure born
Zhcted warrior.

306
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,625
Heh. Thanks, but no.

307
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,125
I'm honored you would ask.

308
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,250
And I'm pretty sure an offer
like this would never happen

309
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,583
if the roles were
reversed in Brune.

310
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,416
So why are you refusing
to take my hand?

311
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,875
[TIGRE] I already have a home
I need to get back to.

312
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,875
One I swore to protect.

313
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,833
Alsace.

314
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,583
[TIGRE] It's a Brunish province
I inherited from my father.

315
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,208
Oh, Lord Tigre.
Don't die on me.

316
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,125
[TIGRE chuckles]

317
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,041
[TIGRE] You must stop shaving
your head, Ryurik.

318
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,375
That shiny orb is going
to blind somebody!

319
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:31,250
Plus, the look's not doing your
handsome features any favors.

320
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,750
I'll say this for
the last time!

321
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,000
For trying to embarrass
you on the archery range,

322
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,250
the War Maiden made me sacrifice
my gorgeous hair as penance!

323
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,666
By all rights, my head
should be on the chopping block!

324
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,416
But Lord Tigrevurmud Vorn,
since I've been allowed to live,

325
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,041
thanks in part to you, I shall
continue to make this offering!

326
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,750
And I honestly admire
your bow skill.

327
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,000
it puts my own
abilities to shame.

328
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,291
You're a master, and I,
a foolish novice

329
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,500
who tried to humiliate you.

330
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,708
Okay...

331
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,208
So please, don't ask me
to cease my penance!

332
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,791
[TIGRE] You can stand up now!
I'm sorry I brought it up!

333
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,166
There they go again.

334
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,000
I've never seen a man
as polite as Master Ryurik.

335
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,541
Agreed. And Lord
Tigrevurmud's marksmanship

336
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,916
does deserve that praise.

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,291
He's very impressive!

338
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,916
And cute!

339
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,375
I eat this every day
and it's always great!

340
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,666
I sometimes forget
how foreign you are.

341
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,416
There's nothing special
about this food;

342
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,708
it's standard soldier fare.

343
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,250
And that's the best part!

344
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,458
Whenever I get back home,

345
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,958
it'll be easy enough
for Titta to make!

346
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,625
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1G] How does he
hit with three arrows at once?

347
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,708
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1H]
Maybe he's a magic archer!

348
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,375
[ZHCTED SOLDIER 1I]
Lord Tigre!

349
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,166
Please give us
another lesson soon!

350
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,000
Of course!

351
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,250
I'm finally fitting
in around here.

352
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,625
But a prisoner
is still a prisoner.

353
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,500
[TIGRE] Is that...?

354
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,083
A baby Dragon?
I've never seen one.

355
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:25,250
[ELEN] That's my pet.
His name is Lunie.

356
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,666
[ELEN] Hello.

357
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,208
Sorry! I didn't see anything!

358
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,458
I had found this place
when walking around before.

359
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,125
I didn't think anyone
else used it, so...

360
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,458
[ELEN] There's nothing
to be sorry about.

361
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,250
After all, you came here
to bathe, too, right?

362
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,833
Now turn around and
look me in the eyes.

363
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:02,791
So here in your country
it's custom for men and women

364
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,916
to take baths in
front of each other?

365
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,375
Actually, it's not.

366
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,250
I'm not saying I'm
not embarrassed.

367
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,208
But I'm... a war
maiden, aren't I?

368
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,083
If I'm caught off
guard--even naked--

369
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,833
I can't run away and cower
like a shy country girl.

370
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,375
Even if deep down, my brain's
telling me to do just that!

371
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,000
[ELEN chuckles]

372
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,250
I want you, Lord Tigre.

373
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,875
This place is...
just so different.

374
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,500
She says she wants me.

375
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,000
Well...

376
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,750
[knocking]

377
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,375
Huh?

378
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,041
The guards have seized an old
man with a Brunish accent.

379
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,041
[TIGRE] Bertrand!

380
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,208
[BERTRAND gasps]

381
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,791
Young Master!

382
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,000
[BERTRAND]
Thank goodness you're safe!

383
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,666
Thank goodness you're safe!

384
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,708
So you do know
this sad old man!

385
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,166
Yes, of course I do!

386
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,833
Bertrand's been my attendant
since I was just a kid!

387
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,708
[BERTRAND] My lord,
there's no time to reminisce.

388
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,583
Huh?

389
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,333
Thenardier has gathered a force

390
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:24,916
and is marching on your
province of Alsace!

391
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,416
They number three thousand men!

392
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,916
He's doing what?!

393
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,333
[RYURIK]
Get back here!

394
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:32,458
You can't leave!
You're our prisoner!

395
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:43,041
Good evening, Tigre.
Where do you think you're going?

396
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,291
Get out of my way.

397
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,291
[ELEN] You may as well
meet your end here.

398
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,666
[ELEN] Episode 2:
"The Return Home."

399
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,125
Watch it.
