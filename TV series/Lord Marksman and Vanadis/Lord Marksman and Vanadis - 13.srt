1
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,125
[BLACK BOW] Good for you, Tigre.

2
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:58,291
It seems you've finally mastered
the power of the Black Bow.

3
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:02,208
And you did it all by yourself.
Without anyone's help.

4
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,625
You shot clear through that
bedrock that entombed you.

5
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,916
Bertrand...

6
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,708
Bertrand.

7
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:50,708
[TIGRE] I...

8
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,166
[TITTA gasps]

9
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,041
Hate to intrude.

10
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,708
I know you're sad,
so I'll get to it.

11
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,333
What do you want to do now?

12
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,375
[TIGRE] Ask me in the morning.

13
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,875
I worry the longer you take.

14
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,833
The less thought you'll
actually put into your plan.

15
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,166
It'll be perfunctory.

16
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,583
Something you come up with
just to meet a deadline.

17
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,833
Listen, it's possible for
you to end this whole war,

18
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,083
right here, tonight.
Offer the right conditions

19
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,750
and perhaps we can
bargain with Thenardier.

20
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,375
Alsace will be secure.

21
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,416
What about your goals
in this war?

22
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,708
[ELEN] You should know
the answer to that by now.

23
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,208
I'll get what I want.

24
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,375
[TITTA whimpers]

25
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,250
Yes. That's right.

26
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:19,750
Whatever you decide
to do with Thenardier,

27
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,541
however we choose to act,
what matters to me is

28
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,000
fighting battles I can
take pride in. That is all.

29
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,750
That's what drives you
through all this? Your pride?

30
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,125
[ELEN] Correct.

31
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,958
It's the pride
I have as a warrior.

32
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,333
It's something
I always carry with me.

33
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,291
There was a time when
I was a mercenary.

34
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,541
I had no land to go home to.

35
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,833
So I wandered the earth,
from one battle to the next.

36
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,000
I assumed all my friends
would die eventually.

37
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,958
I had nothing else
to hold on to.

38
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,916
That's why it was so important
to keep my pride.

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,291
The one constant
that made me who I am.

40
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,500
Your pride.

41
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,750
[TIGRE] Well, you may have your
pride, I've still got my mettle!

42
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,916
It's what I inherited
from my father

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,625
and the long line of Vorns
before him. That's why I fight!

44
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,083
Mettle.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,750
[TIGRE] That is my constant.

46
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:25,000
Like your pride, mettle is
what makes me who I am.

47
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,125
[TITTA whimpers]

48
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:32,750
[TIGRE] Titta.

[TITTA gasps]

50
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,000
You're so strong.
I know I scared you.

51
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,458
I'm sorry.

52
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
[TITTA whimpers]

53
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,125
Oh, Lord Tigre!

54
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:57,166
[TITTA sobs]

55
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,083
Once this war's over for good,

56
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,000
we'll go back home to Alsace
and have a proper funeral.

57
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,041
[sobbing continues]

58
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:12,583
Okay?
We'll honor Bertrand right.

59
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,750
[TITTA] Yes... Okay...

60
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,833
Old Bertrand. He said
he used to worry

61
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,000
I loved Alsace so much
I'd ignore the greater world.

62
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,541
But in the very end he was
relieved that's not true.

63
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,333
Well on the subject
of the greater world,

64
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,083
I think it's time you
learned the other reason

65
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,500
I've been helping
you in your Brunish War.

66
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,791
Huh?

67
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,916
[ELEN] And it's not a
sentimental reason.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,041
It's practical. Political.

69
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,708
All right, I'm listening.

70
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,458
Why did Muozinel attack the
Agnes region of Brune

71
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:49,500
in the South? Why did they
try to conquer a port town?

72
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:54,541
So that... they could control
some routes of trade?

73
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,375
The bigger picture.
You see it now?

74
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,333
The ties that can bind us,
separate from any war.

75
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,708
Binding ties? Trade routes?

76
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,166
[TIGRE gasps]

77
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,916
The Vozh mountains.

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,875
If we could build a trade route
through the range

79
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,875
connecting Alsace
with Leitmeritz,

80
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,291
then Leitmeritz would be--

81
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,750
[ELEN] Mm-hmm.

82
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,250
There's much more to war
than fleeting conquests

83
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,750
of land and treasure.

84
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,500
By opening new roads, and
exchanging goods and culture,

85
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,250
it can grow your
land's wealth, inexorably.

86
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,500
And secure its prosperity.

87
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,041
But could Alsace?

88
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:49,625
It could change; it's true.
For the better or for the worse.

89
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,291
But that depends on how capable
the person governing it is.

90
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
And whether he takes
the broad view

91
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,583
of what's happening around him.

92
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,000
You're talking again
about the "big picture."

How long have you

This-This dandy of a Brunishman

00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:12,583
on his work, so he kept me
from doing my own!

Well, that's only because this
bald Zhcted subject

100

is so fidgety I can't
focus on my own.

I am relieved to find
you safe, Princess Regin.

[BADOUIN laughs]

When you were a boy,

you accompanied your father
on a visit to the palace.

114

It has been far too long since
we last met, Lord Tigrevurmud.

So, what brings you
here, Badouin?

116

At long last, King Faron
has regained his wits.

[MASHAS] What?

00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,958
[BADOUIN] Lord Tigrevurmud.

123
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,916
Would you be so kind as to
tell me your intentions?

124
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,791
Your plans for this war,
and for its aftermath.

125
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,791
I will beat Thenardier's army.
And kill the duke.

[BADOUIN] Then will you
try to conquer Brune?

No, I won't.

Once Alsace is secure,

I will return to Zhcted
as Eleonora's prisoner.

Hey! Hold on!

131

I don't think you need to use
terms like "prisoner" anymore.

That's a good point.
To be more respectful,

My lord, are you sure you want
to remain a ward of Zhcted

138

just to protect Alsace?

[TIGRE] I am.

But, look, there's more
to this deal

than just me going over there.

142

If it can lead to lasting peace
and security for Alsace,

I'll be okay with Zhcted
annexing my homeland,

What do you think we should do?

But knowing Duke Thenardier,

He'll try to block us from
entering the capital, so...

The final showdown.

Tigre's assumption is correct,

on the wilds of Mereville.

00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,208
of the left. And the center is--

161
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,583
No. It's not that.
I'm wondering if it's right

162
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:36,625
that I'm the commander
for this battle.

163
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,750
Lord Tigre would be much better.

164
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,791
Princess. This battle is to win
you entrance to the capital.

165
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,375
To secure your claim,
you must command.

166
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,833
Yes.

167
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,833
So far, it looks quite clear

168
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,500
that we have the
upper hand. However...

169
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,291
[MASHAS] The movements
of Thenardier's army

170
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,791
are clumsy today.

171
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,250
At first, I thought
it might be a trap;

172
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,041
most likely their field
commander's death

173
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:03,625
at the Holy Grotto is affecting
their performance and morale.

174
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,250
In that case. Duke Thenardier
should be leading

175
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,083
the charge himself out
there on the battlefield.

176
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,375
Well, clearly he's not! 

177
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,916
And the result of
that absence is obvious.

178
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,583
But what if he's--

179
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,875
You've come.

180
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,166
[SOLDIERS yell]

181
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,041
[SOLDIER grunts, yells]

182
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,291
Had I just marched
on the capital,

183
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,541
I might have won
this stupid war.

184
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,625
I could have barricaded
myself in the castle,

185
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:09,041
traded land for time,
refit my men.

186
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:13,000
But the window for that
strategy has closed.

187
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,500
Why did you do it?

188
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,916
What made you decide
to attack Alsace?

189
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,708
Because if I controlled Alsace,

190
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,416
I could prevent Zhcted
from interfering in Brune.

191
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,958
And that buffer would be assured
by turning Alsace

192
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,125
into a wasteland. Torching
the land. Killing its people.

193
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,875
That's why you did this?!

194
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,625
With good cause!

195
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,666
The fact is, you're the one who
invited in the Zhcted army.

196
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,041
And if you hadn't, that
miserable troll Ganelon

197
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,333
surely would have
done so later.

198
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,166
After all, he and Zhcted
have a long history together.

199
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,875
But then, so do I.

you've caused Alsace,
let alone Brune!

for killing my son Zion

The wind became his ally.

242

You're right. So it did.

that began for Tigre

In essence, it is a

Faron agrees, and makes
Princess Regin a signatory.

By her signing the treaty,
it's clear to Zhcted,

as well as any potential

[BADOUIN gasps]

320
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,541
[TIGRE] Thank you, Your Majesty!

321
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,458
[RYURIK] Congratulations,
Count Vorn!

322
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,541
[ELEN] Wow, first meteors
and now moonlight!

323
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,666
[GERARD] Yes, job
well done, Tigre!

324
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,041
Long live the Knight
of the Moonlight!

325
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,500
[MILA] C'mon,
show some excitement!

326
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,791
[TIGRE] It's bad form
in front of the King.

327
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,625
[NARRATOR] Several days later,
King Faron of Brune

328
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,333
quietly takes his last breath
and dies peacefully.

329
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,416
[TITTA giggles]

330
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,125
Hey! Stop! Lunie,
you'll make me drop it!

331
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,916
[RYURIK] Lady Titta!

332
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,541
Do you know where
Lord Tigre's run off to?

333
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,250
He's hunting.
It's spring, y'know!

334
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,583
[TITTA giggles]

335
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,583
[ELEN] How's the Vosyes
trade route coming?

336
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,583
[LIM] Brunish engineers
have recently arrived

337
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:13,250
and begun preparing. Once
the first thaw comes,

338
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:14,791
they'll start moving earth.

339
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,125
So it sounds like dear Regin
is keeping up her end

340
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,250
of the treaty. That's good.

341
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,625
My lady, recall that Alsace is
under the joint control

342
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,208
of both you and Regin.

343
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,791
Officially, this agreement was
not made between two countries,

344
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:28,666
but between a princess and a
province. So that means--

345
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,458
[ELEN] I get it.

346
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,375
If she weren't such
an honorable person

347
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,916
we might have had a problem.

348
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,625
[ELEN] We've all got
our eyes on you, now.

349
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,708
[ELEN] The question is,
where are your eyes looking?

350
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,458
[BADOUIN]
Knight of the Moonlight.

351
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,541
Some of the men
who receive that title

352
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,958
have gone onto become king.

353
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,500
Don't tell me he could--

354
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:12,791
[ELEN] I know one thing for
sure, Tigre: I'm so glad we met.

355
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,250
