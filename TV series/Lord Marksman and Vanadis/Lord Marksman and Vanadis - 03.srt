[LIM]
While fighting here in Alsace,

2
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,833
we struck down
three hundred knights.

3
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,083
Those who managed to
retreat and evade our pursuit

4
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,875
are probably regrouping with
the main Thenardier force

5
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,375
as we speak.

6
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,833
[ELEN] What about
their commander, Lord Zion?

7
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,666
[LIM] Unfortunately, he's one
of the men who escaped.

8
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,500
[ELEN]
Damn... Missed opportunity.

9
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,333
If we believe that his force
started at three thousand,

10
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:18,166
that means they're still
twenty-seven hundred strong.

11
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,041
The bare minimum
needed to protect this town

12
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,250
is one hundred...

13
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,000
That leaves us just
nine hundred for battle.

14
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,916
Bottom line they still
outnumber us three to one.

15

[ELEN] How far do you think
Zion will flee?

16
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:35,291
Probably to here,
in the Molsheim Plains.

17
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,708
The terrain will help
make their knights

18
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,041
more effective in combat.

19

[ELEN] Good. Then that's
where we shall meet them.

[NARRATOR] Lord Zion Thenardier
divided his remaining

40
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,291
twenty-seven hundred men
into three groups.

41

The first numbered
seven hundred.

42
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,458
These were light infantry,
armed with bows and spears.

43
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,625
The second group was comprised
of one thousand heavy knights,

44
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,458
in steel plate armor
and carrying lances.

45
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,833
The last thousand formed
the main battle force.

46
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,958
A traditional Brunish company
trained to fight and win

00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,750
They're ambushing the
second column's flank!

162
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,083
Haha!

163
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,291
Your Dinant Plains tricks
won't work this time!

164
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:04,083
Send four hundred men
from the flying column!

165
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,958
[LIM] Don't let up!

166
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,041
It's going just as we planned!

167
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,291
[NARRATOR] Dividing the
Zhcted army in two pays off.

168
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,750
Lim charges four hundred men
into the Thenardier flank.

169
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,083
In the melee,
a path clears for Elen

170
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,208
to face down the
land dragon, one-on-one.

171
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,833
I didn't expect
to fight a dragon,

172
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,458
so to mark the big day...

173
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,958
I'll show you
a very special move.

174
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,958
Elen, what...?

175
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,000
[roars]

176
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,625
Mow down, air and all!

177
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,375
Ley... Admos!

178
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,041
Now let's finish this battle.

179
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,708
Well, that was
something I didn't expect.

180
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,208
Of course you didn't.

181
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,750
I don't play all
of my cards at once.

182
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,083
It's quite forceful, so
I don't use it around people

183
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,791
if I can avoid it.

184
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,875
The Ley... Admos.

185
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,916
Lim, the enemy is moving forces
from its flying column.

186
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,291
Then that's our cue to
fall back, just as we planned.

187
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,166
Yes, ma'am!

188
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,791
[NARRATOR]
Zion sends four hundred men

189
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,000
to form a fast-moving
infantry brigade

190
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,500
known as a "flying column."

191
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,875
In response,
Lim denies them a fight,

192
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,916
and withdraws her
own force to the hills.

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,416
[THENARDIER SOLDIER 3L]
We have them on the run!

194
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,333
[THENARDIER CHIEF 3A]
Cut down those fools,

195
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,541
and the battle will be ours!

196
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:55,708
[LIM] Now!

197
00:13:55,791 --> 00:14:00,083
[SOLDIERS yelling]

198
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,541
You fall down
because you only look

199
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,583
at who you're fighting,
not where.

200
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,666
[LIM] Our foreign army wouldn't
have collected what we did

201
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,416
had Zion not treated his
fellow Brunishmen so poorly.

202
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,083
Lord Tigrevurmud Vorn

203
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,583
has a close connection with
the common folk of Alsace.

204
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,041
And there's one more
who trusts him...

205
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,000
It's almost time.

206
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,875
That's right.

207
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,666
It's time for an ambush.

208
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,541
[SOLDIERS yelling]

209
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,416
[THENARDIER SCOUT 3B] Enemy
forces are behind us!

210
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,916
A whole other army...
two thousand!

211
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Two thousand men?

212
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,291
I have barely six hundred
left in my main force!

213
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,416
We're cut off in the rear
and outnumbered.

214
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,083
There's still hope.
Send in the flying dragon!

215
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,583
Do what?

216
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:57,750
You idiot!

217
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,083
She made mincemeat
out of the land dragon!

218
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,375
Split it just like an apple!

219
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,083
I'm not going to watch her
do that to this one, too!

220
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:08,375
After all, it's me my father
will blame, not you!

221
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,916
Think, Zion Thenardier,
you can do this.

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,458
What is a
commander's first duty?

223
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,083
The bravest thing I
can do is to protect the...

224
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,791
That's it! Save myself!

225
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,541
Bring the second column around!

226
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,791
We retreat, now.

227
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,333
Lord Zion, Sir,
give us a chance

228
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:36,791
to fight them off.

229
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,583
If our knights on the front
line can hold their ground

230
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,458
long enough for us
to regroup and strike,

231
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,458
we could still--

232
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,125
[ZION] Shut up!

233
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,583
Oww! Oww! Oww!

234
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,166
Sir, not in front of the men.

235
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,833
Get the knights to
stand down, right away!

236
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,083
Do it!

237
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,041
[NARRATOR] What Zion
had not realized--

238
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,708
No, what he could not realize,

239
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,083
was that the enemy troops to his
rear were just one hundred men.

240
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,041
It was the horses that
numbered two thousand.

241
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,541
Lord Tigre used the
terrain and setting sun

242
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:10,000
to create the illusion
of reinforcements.

243
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,750
Did you say retreat?

244
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,000
We can still win this battle!

245
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,458
What the hell's
gotten into them?

246
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,125
Sir, there's a huge enemy force
approaching from behind!

247
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,166
This order comes down
from Lord Zion himself!

248
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,916
That idiot son
is an embarrassment!

249
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,416
[NARRATOR] Honor and duty
meant the knights

250
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,791
of the House of Thenardier
had no choice but to obey.

251
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,333
And with their sudden
pullback from the frontlines,

252
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,791
The momentum shifts
in Elen and Tigre's favor.

253
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:43,666
[THENARDIER SCOUT 3A]
They've broken through

254
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,333
the second knight column!

255
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,166
[THENARDIER SCOUT 3B]
The main force

256
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,666
is starting to buckle, too!

257
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,250
All our lines are collapsing!

258
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,583
Why didn't he send the dragon?

259
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,416
This is a bad dream!
It's the only explanation!

260
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,250
How else could that Vorn,

261
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,166
a stupid arrogant boy,
defeat me?

262
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,875
[horses approaching]

263
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,958
And now he's here!

264
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,375
You started this fight!
You don't get to run away!

265
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,291
Zion Thenardier!

266
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,958
[ZION] Run away?
Don't be ridiculous.

267
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,500
How could you
betray your country?

268
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,291
You led the Zhcted army right
into the Brunish heartland!

269
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,291
You really are descended
from nothing but

270
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,541
illiterate, cowardly huntsmen!

271
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,791
If you're blaming people,
start with yourself!

272
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,916
[ZION] How dare you!

273
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,666
You hurt your own
innocent countrymen,

274
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,958
burn their homes,

275
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,458
steal their property.

276
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,541
You're not a lord,
you're just a thief!

277
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,666
My own countrymen?

278
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,291
And what about those fools?

279
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,833
They're just like plants.

280
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,291
I can cut them down all I want
and they'll grow right back.

281
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,458
So why the hell do you care?

282
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,916
That bastard.

283
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You're not helping
your cause, Lord Zion.

284
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:55,458
But it doesn't matter.
You're unforgivable.

285
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,291
You marched your
army onto my land,

286
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,916
tormented my people!

287
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,458
Disrespect me?

288
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,458
You've got more
nerve than sense.

289
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,125
Vorn, I challenge you to a duel!

290
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,541
You wanted a fight, didn't you?

291
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,625
Don't try to run away.

292
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,500
He's gone insane.

293
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,166
[ELEN] Wait, Tigre!

294
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,166
You're not dueling him!

295
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,250
All right...

296
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,958
This battle is yours
and yours alone.

297
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,875
[ZION]
Where's your weapon, traitor?

298
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:38,708
I'm sure your new
friends in the Zhcted army

299
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,208
would be happy to
loan you a spear or a sword.

300
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,750
Here's the only weapon I need!

301
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,291
[ZION] Is this a joke to you?

302
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,791
You can't think you'll win a
duel with just a bow and arrow!

303
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,166
It's supposed to be one-on-one,
with swords, a long range--

304
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,333
[TIGRE] Let's put it to a test.

305
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,875
Serious?

306
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,583
A-ha! You see?
It's not for dueling!

307
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,125
[ZION] Keep on wasting
those arrows, dummy!

308
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,208
[ZION laughing]

309
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,666
You're boring me, Vorn!

310
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,083
It's impossible
to have a real duel

311
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,958
as long as you insist on
using that coward's weapon.

312
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,875
I'm ending this
charade and your life.

313
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,125
Your head is going on my lance!

314
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:22,166
Yah!

315
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,916
[ZION] You had no
honor in life, Vorn,

316
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,875
and you'll get none in death!

317
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,083
This can't be!
I hate you, bastard!

318
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,500
[ZION yelling in pain]

319
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,625
Young master...

320
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,416
To hit that same
spot on the shield,

321
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,791
only as a moving target...

322
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,125
Such a spectacle makes me
want him even more...

323
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:16,583
[groaning in pain]

324
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,250
[high-pitched wailing]

325
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,750
[THENARDIER SOLDIER 3M]
Save Lord Zion!

326
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,541
[SOLDIERS yelling]

327
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,000
[ELEN] Protect Lord Tigre!

328
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,125
[SOLDIERS yelling]

329
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,916
I wasn't sure
how that would go.

330
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,458
Well, neither was I.

331
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,166
You and your
precious Alsace

332
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,375
can enjoy the privilege of being
crushed under my father's boot!

333
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,125
I've got better things
to do than die fighting you!

334
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,958
[ZION laughs]

335
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,375
He's climbing
too high and fast

336
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,458
for my wind blades to reach.

337
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,333
[TIGRE] Are we just
going to stand here?

338
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,625
Watch him fly away?

339
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,083
[MYSTERIOUS FEMALE VOICE]
Shoot the dragon.

340
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,708
[MYSTERIOUS FEMALE VOICE]
I'll say it again...

341
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,166
[MYSTERIOUS FEMALE VOICE]
Shoot the dragon.

342
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,958
[TIGRE] Did you just talk?

343
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,125
Are you giving
Tigre's bow your strength?

344
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,458
[ZION yelling]

345
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:34,083
[ELEN] Tigrevurmud Vorn
has killed Zion Thenardier!

346
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,666
The battle is won!

347
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,333
[SOLDIERS cheering]

348
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,583
[NARRATOR]
With its commander's death,

349
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:41,083
the Thenardier Army
lost its will to fight,

350
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,333
and melted away
into the countryside.

351
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,416
And so it was,

352
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,375
that Alsace was
successfully defended.

353
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,750
[LIM] I very well couldn't turn
away a War Maiden now could I?

354
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,458
[LIM] Episode 4: "Michelia."

355
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:45,916
Please watch.
