1
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,833
Lady Eleonora,
are you feeling all right?

2
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,625
I'm fine...
Thanks to the first aid,

3
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,000
it's barely a scratch now...

4
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,833
And with Thenardier's
army retreating,

5
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,916
there shouldn't be any reason
to fight for a while...

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,666
so I can focus on healing.

7
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,791
But never mind me...

8
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,625
Lim, am I crazy or
have your breasts

9
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,875
gotten even bigger than before?

10
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,125
[LIM stammers]

11
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,958
Why would you say such a thing?

12
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,625
They're quite large.

13
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,291
Those really are tremendous.

14
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,458
You've gotta touch them
to get the full effect.

15
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,250
--[ELEN chuckles]
--[LIM] Lady Eleonora!

16
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,083
[ELEN] Come on, just let them
have a quick squeeze!

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,291

--[MILA sighs]

18
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,333
[ELEN]
Why, what's the harm in it?

19
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:17,958
[LIM grunts,
ELEN giggles]

20
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,666
[ELEN] Mmm...

21
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,458
Look at that cheese!

22
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,125
Not quite the same
as what we get in Zhcted.

23
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,125
[TITTA] In Brune,
there are so many different

24
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,833
varieties of cheeses...

25
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,125
...that it's widely believed
that each individual village

26
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,000
makes its own unique kind.

27
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:12,291
[TITTA giggles]

28
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,750
Hey, Tigre!

29
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,083
[LIM] Lady Eleonora,
where's Lord Tigrevurmud?

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,041
[TITTA] Looks like he passed out

31
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:23,875
before he could even
make it into bed.

32
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,291
I hope he didn't catch a cold.

33
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,000
I wish we could allow him to
sleep in a little bit longer...

34
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,125
but, sadly, that's
out of the question.

35
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,458
Yeah, too bad.

36
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,000
Now then, how do we wake him up?

37
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,208
It's gonna take more than
a kiss on the forehead.

38
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,708
[ALL] Hmm...

39
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,125
[REGIN gasps]

40
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,458
When we first met,

41
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,500
Lim roused him by shoving
a sword in his mouth.

42
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,291
But when I wanted to do it,
Titta got mad.

43
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,958
You could've impaled him!

44
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,708
And then how would he have
been able to eat his breakfast?

45
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,791
Wow, he's just not gonna
budge at all, is he?

46
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,958
All right then,
how 'bout we try this...

47
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,375
Lady...

48
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,458
[ELEN] Tigre once said that no
matter how deep a sleep

49
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,875
he was in, if he sensed an
animal about to attack,

50
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,333
he would wake up instantly.

51
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,958
Well, sure, that may
have been true back

52
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,291
during his hunting days...
But now, who knows...

53
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,291
What are you
planning to do to him?

54
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,208

Elen?

59
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,208
Uh, good morning, Tigre...

60
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,208
[TIGRE] You woke me
through bloodlust?

61
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,375
Yeah, I'm sorry... But don't
worry I'll never try that again.

62
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,916
Thanks, I would really
appreciate it if you didn't.

63
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,000
[ELEN] This is
quite a spread, huh?

64
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,541
It all looks pretty good.

65
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,833
[TIGRE] It does.

66
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,416
The nearby villages
sent us all kinds of food.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,458
[ELEN]
They're offering it up now

68
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,041
before it can be confiscated.

69
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
That's certainly
one way to curry favor.

70
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,875
And so you just
took it from them?

71
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,625
No, of course not...
We paid them for it...

72
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,166
Though, you know...

73
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,583
they may have sold this to us
at a fairly steep discount.

74
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,875
[LIM] Ryurik and Gerard were
the ones placed in charge

75
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,250
of negotiating.

76
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
That explains it.

77
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,958
So then... What do we do now?

78
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,041
Seize the opportunity to
completely destroy Thenardier?

79
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,291
We should head to Artesium.

80
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,250
[MILA] To do what?
Help the citizens there?

81
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,958
I don't think even we have
the goods necessary for that.

82
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,375
[TIGRE] No, we're not going
into the burned city.

83
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,250
[MILA] Hmm... What do you mean?

84
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,583
We go under the city
from outside it...

85
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,375
to establish
Princess Regin's identity.

86
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,833
Good idea... If we're
able to prove to people

87
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,958
that Princess Regin
is indeed royalty...

88
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,041
it'll solidify our cause
as the righteous one.

89
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,791
Then we can flip things
on Thenardier

90
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,458
and charge him with treason.

91
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,166
Princess, please tell us
how to find and navigate

92
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,791
the area that's
underneath Artesium.

93
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,208
[REGIN] Mm. Well, I've only
ever heard about it...

94
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,458
I've never actually
set foot there myself.

95
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:10,000
"Charles Saint-Groel"...
the Holy Grotto...

96
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,375
They say that's where Charles,
our nation's founding father,

97
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,916
received a divine sign that
determined he would be king...

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,375
The Holy Grotto is
where Brune was born.

99
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,500
From what I've been told
about the Holy Grotto,

100
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,541
there are three ways to get in.

101
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,958
One entrance is in the
central district of Artesium.

102
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,000
Another can be found in the
southeast corner of the capital,

103
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,708
in the Temple of Mossia,
Mother Goddess of the Land...

104
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,791
And the last one
is to the northeast,

105
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,666
in the public cemetery.

106
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,000
Looks like the one closest to
our current location

107
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:42,833
is likely...
the Temple of Mossia.

108
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,666
Well, then that's
where we're headed.

109
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,333
[TIGRE] Yes...

110
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,333
It sounds like you've got it
covered... I'm counting on you.

111
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,458
[GERARD] As you wish.

112
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,458
[RYURIK] We won't let you down.

113
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,666
[GERARD] What's your problem?

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,958
[RYURIK] Nothing, what's yours?!

115
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,333
[BERTRAND] Young Master...

116
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,666
Yes, what is it?

117
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,375
Would it be all right
if I tagged along

118
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,750
and escorted you to the temple?

119
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,291
Ah... Really? But the
battle just barely ended...

120
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,083
You must be so
exhausted after that.

121
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,583
[BERTRAND laughs]

122
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,750
I feel strong as an ox!
However...

123
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,500
I imagine, Young Master, that
once this war is over,

124
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,500
you'll return to Zhcted with
the war maiden. Correct?

125
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

126
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,916
I'm already so old... I think
you know, Young Master...

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,916
wherever you go
in Brune, or beyond.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
Even if you went to
the ends of the Earth,

129
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,541
I would follow you...

130
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:40,166
But my body can't keep
this up forever.

131
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,125
So, for however long
this war may last,

132
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:45,541
I'd like to remain by your
side as much as I possibly can.

133
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:49,250
Hm. Yes, all right...
But in return,

134
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,416
promise you'll flee
at the first sign of danger.

135
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,041
[BERTRAND laughs]

136
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,750
Oh, I can still run away
with the best of 'em!

137
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:56,791
Well...

138
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,250
...I should go get ready.

139
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,708
This is just great. Now you've
got a princess and an old man

140
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:04,958
to worry about...

141
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,791
Which, let's face it,
is all the more reason

142
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,083
for me to come, too.

143
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,416
Huh?!

144
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,208
My own fate depends on
the outcome of this quest

145
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,750
as much as yours does.

146
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,208
Can you think of any reason
why I shouldn't accompany you?

147
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,458
Please, stop and think
about your position!

148
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,291
Sheesh... This is hardly how
someone of higher standing

149
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,416
should act. You should be more
self-aware as a war maiden.

150
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,416
Say, Lim... you think there
are even five men here

151
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,875
who are as strong as me?

152
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,708
You know, right now, we're at an
extremely critical crossroads

153
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,875
with this. What happens
as a result of this mission

154
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,541
will determine whether
or not our cause

155
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:38,958
is seen as beyond reproach.

156
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,250
So I'm not going just for fun...
We can't risk failure.

157
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,708
[MILA growls]

158
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,833
[TIGRE]

[TIGRE] Bertrand!

320
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,208
Young Master...
Take care of Titta...

321
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,000
[TIGRE gasps]

322
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,541
So what are we going to do
when we arrive at Artesium?

323
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:32,208
Find the spot directly
above the Holy Grotto.

324
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,916
Oh, Tigre...

325
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,375
[crashing]

326
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:44,791
[REGIN] What is that?

327
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,125
[ELEN gasps]

328
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:47,583
[ELEN] Hurry!

329
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,250
[ELEN gasps]

330
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,291
Tigre!

331
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,625
Are you okay?!

332
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:25,833
Elen...

333
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,041
Good grief. You sure
know how to worry me.

334
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,125
[ELEN gasps]

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,875
Go get me some rope, now!

336
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,416
When Bertrand risked his life
and crossed over the border...

337
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,750
to deliver his
message to Tigre...

338
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,708
that set all of this in motion.

339
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,333
Listening to Bertrand
led Tigre to rise up.

340
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:21,541
Pardon me, Count Rodant...
If I may speak candidly now...

341
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,166
We need him to lead...

342
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,875
Will Tigre be ready to
command again by tonight?

343
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:27,333
[RYURIK grunts]

344
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,083
To be honest... I don't know.

345
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,416
[TIGRE] I know one
thing for sure.

346
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,125
I'm so glad we met.

347
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:44,416
[TIGRE] Episode 13,
"The Widening World."

348
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,875
Enjoy watching.
