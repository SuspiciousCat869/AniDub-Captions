1
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:47,041
Now gather before me...
O, shining surge!

2
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,541
Falvarna!

3
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,833
And what might this be?

4
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:11,291
Some sort of
unbreachable barrier, right?

5
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,416
I can only assume this wall
of light is an enchantment.

6
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,791
And what if
I tell you it is, sir?

7
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,583
[ROLAND] I'll be impressed.

8
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:23,083
That said, not even magic
can stop me and Durandal.

9
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,166
What? That knight's
a danger to us?

10
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,708
[ROLAND yells]

11
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:07,791
[SOFY gasps]

12
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,875
[ROLAND yells]

13
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,250
[grunting]

14
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,791
[ROLAND yells]

15
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,250
[grunting]

16
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,958
Well, I believe that
was long enough.

17
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,416
[ROLAND grunts]

18
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,500
Mirashem!

19
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,208
You were only fighting me
to buy time for your friends...

20
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,375
Hang in there!
It's not much farther, Tigre.

21
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,083
We're almost there.

22
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,708
[NAVARRE KNIGHT]
Captain Roland, sir!

23
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,750
[NAVARRE KNIGHT] Soldiers are
charging our rearguard.

24
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:41,416
It's an ambush.

25
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,583
Numbers?

26
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,625
[NAVARRE KNIGHT]
About three hundred, sir.

27
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,041
I am Mashas Rodant,
Count of Aude!

28
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:50,083
I pledge these swords
to noble Count Vorn!

29
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,416
Abandon all efforts...

30
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,458
We need to concentrate
on reforming our ranks.

31
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,916
[NAVARRE KNIGHT] Yes sir!

32
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,833
[ROLAND] You're telling me
I can't have an audience

33
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,125
with the King?

34
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,750
[GANELON]
I'm sorry, Sir Roland...

35
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,458
But His Majesty has fallen
very ill... Please understand.

36
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,125
[THENARDIER] This situation
is hard for us, too.

37
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,791
The best thing we can do
now is give the King

38
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,333
less to worry about... If you
would kill the traitor Vorn

39
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,833
and his army from Zhcted that
have expanded through Brune,

40
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,958
it would ease his mind greatly.

41
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,666
We would deal
with Vorn ourselves

42
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,208
but we have our hands full
with Sachstein and Ahsvarre,

43
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,291
who are threatening our borders.

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,791
His Majesty is counting on you
to strike down

45
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,250
that cursed defector!

46
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,708
They're far from trustworthy...

47
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,791
I must end this immediately
and return to the King's side.

48
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,291
[ELEN] Thank you, Lord Mashas.

49
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,291
Because of your reinforcements,
the enemy gave up their pursuit.

50
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:57,333
Never mind that...
How is Tigre holding up?

51
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,625
Not well...
His fever hasn't broken.

52
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:06,541
[TIGRE whimpers]

53
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,916
Hold on, Lord Tigre...

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,833
Pardon my abruptness,
Lord Mashas...

55
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,916
Can you tell us what
happened in the capital?

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,041
We're dying to know.

57
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,416
Despite my efforts,

58
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,125
I wasn't granted audience
with the King...

59
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,291
Finally, I grew tired
of the polite excuses

60
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,208
and barged my way
into the palace.

61
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,250
The Dukes Thenardier and
Ganelon have all but seized it

62
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,666
for themselves.
It was a terrible sight.

63
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,375
Fortunately, I have
an ally in the court.

64
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,500
If I do this for you
it can't be official...

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,666
I'm acting not as the
Brunish prime minister,

66
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,750
but as your friend.

67
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:39,666
Badouin... I know
it's a grave risk

68
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,416
taking me to his private
chambers, are you sure?

69
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,375
[BADOUIN] What you're about to
learn, you must guard carefully.

70
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,375
The people cannot know.

71
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:53,458
[clacking]

72
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:56,083
[MASHAS]
What on earth is that sound?

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,333
[BADOUIN] His Majesty is
playing with building blocks.

74
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,791
[MASHAS gasps]

75
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,750
Building blocks?

76
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,208
I pity the old king...

77
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,250
I wonder if it's grief
over losing his only son.

78
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:11,833
[MASHAS] According to Badouin,

79
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:15,458
only a handful of people know
about His Majesty's condition.

80
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,958
I assume the
Dukes know too,

81
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,666
since they're taking advantage
of it every way they can.

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,208
[MASHAS] Badouin holds the
country together by a thread,

83
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,666
so he has to be careful.

84
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,875
But he believes if
Tigre has justification

85
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,583
for bringing in
foreign soldiers,

86
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,375
the King could be
swayed eventually.

87
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,458
If we show Lord Tigre
had no ill will

88
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,833
he can gain the royal court's
forgiveness,

89
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,583
soon as the King
has recovered...

90
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,333
But of course there's no way we
could get that in writing now.

91
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,000
Without that royal decree
there's little hope

92
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,000
of convincing Roland to
call off his knights...

93
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,791
The Dukes have made him think
he's fighting for the King.

94
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:54,333
I still have questions... Like
how'd you come to meet Sofy?

95
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,916
Oh that's right.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,875
We haven't gotten to that part
of the story, have we, my lady?

97
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:58,916
[SOFY] No.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,375
But you should tell it,
Lord Mashas,

99
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,958
it'll sound better
coming from you...

100
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,333
As a lady... there are some
things I like to talk about

101
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,875
and some things
that I do not.

102
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,375
It happened after I'd left
Badouin and was on my way

103
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,708
out of Nice...

104
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,416
When right there,
in the streets of the capital,

105
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,583
I was surrounded by assassins.

106
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,250
Oh dear.

107
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,750
[LIM] Were they Duke
Thenardier's men? Or Ganelon's?

108
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,750
[MASHAS]
A good question, indeed.

109
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,041
But in any case, the one who
rescued me from my peril

110
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,916
was the beautiful and talented
Lady Sofya here.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,375
[AUGRE gasps,
SOFY giggles]

112
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,958
[BERTRAND] Lord Tigre is
fine rest assured.

113
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,708
He'll be back on his feet soon.

114
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,625
Who were those two men?

115
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,166
Just a couple of soldiers
worried about the young master,

116
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,666
they wanted to know
how he was doing.

117
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,333
Soldiers from Alsace?

118
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,500
No, they're part of Viscount
Augre's reinforcements...

119
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,625
Apparently there's quite a
bit of talk around camp

120
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,000
about how Sir Roland landed a
blow against the young master.

121
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,458
I see.

122
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:08,000
Why don't you get some air?

123
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,750
It would probably
do you some good...

124
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,666
And I'd like to have a few
minutes alone with Tigre.

125
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,958
[ELEN] Relax, I just need
to tell him something.

126
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,500
Very well, my lady.

127
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,375
Please. If anything happens,
just call out

128
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,166
and I'll come running.
I'll be right outside the tent.

129
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,416
You have my word.

130
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,875
Thanks.

131
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,541
[BERTRAND] Don't worry, Titta.

132
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,125
I'm sure the
young master favors you.

133
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:04,875
Tigre... I know
you're sleeping now,

134
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,166
so you probably
can't even hear me.

135
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,291
But just feel my heart,
beating against your hand.

136
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,333
I'll let that do
the talking for me.

137
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,083
[heart beats]

138
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,666
[ELEN] I want you to sense
my heart beating

139
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,041
and know you're still alive, and
surrounded by people who care...

140
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,083
I want you to know how I feel.

141
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:25,458
[heartbeats]

142
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,541
[ELEN] I'll take charge of your
soldiers as long as I need to.

143
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,291
I'll defend all those
who wish to fight...

144
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,416
I swear it...

145
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,416
After all...

146
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,250
You belong to me now.

147
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,041
[SOFY] The wind is
picking up, isn't it?

148
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,458
I wonder if it's going to rain.

149
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,208
[ELEN] It's looking that way.

150
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,291
Do you plan to use your
dragon art tomorrow?

151
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,708
Even though he's
just a mortal man?

152
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,708
Yes, I do.

153
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,041
[SOFY] Hmph.

154
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,791
I think I'll assist you
by doing the same.

155
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,875
Hold on, Sofy... You're
here as a diplomatic envoy...

156
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,625
You can't do that, can you?

157
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,833
You've made me so determined
I don't care about the rules...

158
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,458
To be honest, my interest in
Count Tigrevurmud Vorn

159
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,916
has been sparked quite deeply.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,208
Easy there, girl.

161
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,375
[SOFY giggles]

162
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,958
Don't make me
fight you... Tigre's mine.

163
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,083
[BOTH laugh]

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,625
[OLIVIER] No. Although his
territory's near the border,

165
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,208
it seems he had no association
with Zhcted until now.

166
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,666
It doesn't make sense.

167
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,416
A man doesn't develop that
sort of ambition overnight.

168
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,333
And there's something else...
We've received reports.

169
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:42,833
Duke Thenardier
has dispatched

170
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,958
a sizeable force to Alsace
while Count Vorn has been away.

171
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,291
And you're certain that
information's good?

172
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,708
I did hear it
from several sources.

173
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,500
[OLIVIER] What do we do, Roland?

174
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,166
We'll proceed as we planned.

175
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,958
[OLIVIER] You sure about that?

176
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:01,041
There's a Zhcted army
inside our borders.

177
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,208
For me, that's enough.

178
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,166
[TIGRE grunts softly]

179
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,625
[TIGRE gasps]

180
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:26,958
Titta...?

181
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,125
Oh, right...

182
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,250
Sir Roland... He cut me.

183
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:49,625
How can I fight Sir Roland?
How can I protect them?

184
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,000
[heartbeat,
TIGRE gasps]

185
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,833
[TITTA] Lord Tigre...

186
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,000
You're up...

187
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,625
[BERTRAND] Young master...

188
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,666
Are you sure you're all right?

189
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,541
Titta... I'm sorry.

190
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,416
You're sorry for what, Lord
Tigre?

191
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,083
Didn't I tell you
I'd stay at your side,

192
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,791
wherever you needed to go?

193
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,250
[TIGRE grunts]

194
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,750
[TIGRE] Tell me, Black Bow,
where are you taking me?

195
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,916
[heartbeat,
TIGRE gasps]

196
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,500
[NARRATOR] Leaving their wounded
soldiers on the other side

197
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:18,333
of the river, the Silver Meteor
Storm army crosses over,

198
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,750
and takes up a position
facing south during the night.

199
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,416
Facing them, the
Order of Navarre assumes a

200
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,125
Three-squad crescent formation. 

201
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,333
The first squad will chip away
at the enemy's advance guard,

202
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,541
while the second charges
their flank.

203
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,791
The third squad will
swing around wide

204
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,375
and hit the enemy
from the rear as they move

205
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,000
to pursue their attackers.

206
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,333
These maneuvers create multiple,
simultaneous attacks.

207
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,708
By repeating these strikes,
the enemy will be annihilated.

208
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,833
Such is the winning strategy
of Brune's prestigious,

209
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,833
royal order of knights.

210
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,791
Squad number one... Attack!

211
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,875
[NAVARRE SOLDIERS yell]

212
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,958
[TIGRE] What is this place?

213
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,750
[TITTA] I think it's a
temple of Tir na Va.

214
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,000
She's a powerful goddess
who rules over night,

215
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,458
darkness, and death.

216
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,541
Darkness and death...

217
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,250
Are you here, Tir na Va?

218
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,666
Are you the one who spoke
to me? Did you bring me here?

219
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,125
[BLACK BOW] You are not here
because I called you, mortal.

220
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,583
[TIGRE gasps]

221
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,375
You are here because your spirit
cries out to quell your enemy...

222
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,916
You brought yourself.

223
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:45,250
Power in battle is
what you seek, is it not?

224
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,166
[ROLAND growls]

225
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,375
[BLACK BOW]
You waste precious time.

226
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,458
While you are safe in this
temple, your allies fight,

227
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,250
and die.

228
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,083
I see... So you don't want it.

229
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,583
If I tell you what
you want to hear,

230
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,416
will it make a
difference to my friends?

231
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,000
[BLACK BOW] Hmph!
Have you changed your mind?

232
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,166
Alright... I will give you
greater power...

233
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,833
All that you need...
If you can convince me

234
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,083
you have the resolve
it takes to wield it.

235
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,083
Resolve?

236
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,791
I want you to shoot this girl.

237
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,083
[TIGRE] What?!

238
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,666
What will you do...
to achieve what you want?

239
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,916
If you can make the bow
bend to your conviction,

240
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,708
then I will give
you great power.

241
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,791
And what if I don't shoot Titta?

242
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,000
What happens to her?
Will you return her to me?

243
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,041
That is a
good question, mortal...

244
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,291
What will this
goddess do

245
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,125
when she sees what
you value the most?

246
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,791
All right, fine...
You want resolve? I'll show you.

247
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,500
Being divine,
I more or less know

248
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,000
what you're
planning to do...

249
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,833
But are you sure
that's a good idea?

[BLACK BOW]
If your skill as a marksman,

251
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,333
or your control
over the bow's power,

252
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,166
falters by even
a fraction,

253
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,333
this little girl
will be blown to pieces.

254
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,083
I already know that! So shut up!

[TIGRE] I'm shooting this arrow,
Titta, but I swear,

00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,166
on everything you mean to me,
I won't let you die!

[TITTA gasps]

[BLACK BOW] You willed the bow's
magic to destroy the arrow,

260
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,833
right before it pierced
the girl's heart.

261
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,416
You're woefully immature
in all other areas,

but when it comes to your
heart, you just barely pass.

when you make the power I've
bestowed upon you your own.

along the river, diverting
water onto the field of battle.

00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,458
If we time it correctly, then we
can trap their horsemen...

277
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,166
Then we'll bring archers
over the hill... And attack.

It's hard to believe, but it
actually seems to have worked.

Your powers are fearsome.

And your determination
impresses me even more.

But that's still
not enough to beat me!

A moment, if you please.

306
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,416
Tell me, Count Vorn...
Why did you invite the Zhcted

307
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,333
to step foot on Brunish soil?

308
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,333
Is it true you were only
defending your province

309
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,458
of Alsace? Do you
swear on your house?

I swear it...

311
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,791
Thenardier was coming
for my land...

312
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,458
So I made a deal to
protect my people.

313
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,583
Our objective now is
to make Thenardier pay

314
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,125
for his assault.

315
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,583
Once we beat him and receive
the compensation due to us...

316
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,083
We'll lay down our swords
and return to our land.

317
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,791
Why don't you fight with us?

318
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,500
And help rid your
country of that boil?

319
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,583
[ROLAND]
I cannot accept your offer.

320
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,500
We are His Majesty's
royal knights.

321
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,916
We do not turn a
blind eye to invaders,

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,875
no matter what they claim.

323
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,375
Now meet the full weight
of my sword.

324
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,041
Now he's using
both hands? Tigre...

325
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,375
[ELEN gasps]

326
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,833
Are you're bleeding again?!

327
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,041
There's no time...
to be wounded...

328
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,541
[TIGRE grunts]

329
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,666
Don't you even think of dying
on me! You're mine, remember?

330
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,125
I will defeat you, Sir Roland.

331
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,541
Try!

332
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,500
[TIGRE] To protect
my people, I must!

333
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,000
[ROLAND]
I am a Black Knight,

334
00:20:56,083 --> 00:21:00,291
the bearer of His Majesty's
sword! I am Roland!!

335
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,333
[ROLAND] Only an honorable man
would give his life

336
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:08,750
to protect his people. No-
Tigrevurmud Vorn is a traitor!

337
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,708
But, who induced him to
become one? Stop it!

338
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,833
It doesn't matter! I carry the
prized sword of the King!

339
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:20,416
He's entrusted me to protect
his realm! And I will!

340
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,166
I must protect!

341
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,500
[ROLAND snarls]

342
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,583
[yelling]

343
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:28,041
[ALL scream]

344
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:47,458
He's still standing...

345
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,125
Roland took that
arrow head-on,

346
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,166
and somehow he's
still on his feet!

347
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,083
[ROLAND] You've defeated me.

348
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:03,708
[ROLAND grunts]

349
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:07,625
[ROLAND] I can't...
raise my arms.

350
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:12,750
I couldn't shake my doubts.
And now, I cannot win.

351
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,416
[ROLAND] I surrender.

352
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,208
[ELEN] Tigre!

353
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,666
[NARRATOR] The Order of
Navarre has lost nearly half

354
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,583
of its royal and vaunted
knights in the fighting.

355
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:32,750
And with Sir Roland's surrender,
the battle draws to a close.

356
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,833
[NARRATOR]
Finally, with the realm's

357
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,291
greatest swordsman defeated,

358
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,041
The Silver Meteor Storm
hopes it can now

359
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,583
settle matters
with Thenardier.

360
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,041
[RYURIK] In my experience,
people will believe

361
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,333
what they want to believe.

362
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:41,541
So just make us want to!

363
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:45,208
Episode 8, "2,000 vs. 20,000."

364
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,666
Enjoy watching.
