[MILA] Eleonora!

00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:58,791
Certainly a direct approach,
just barging in here uninvited.

I've been looking for you.

[MILA] Is Limalisha all right?

5
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,500
[ELEN] Yes. I left her in charge
of the main contingent.

6
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:44,916
[MILA] I see...

7
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,750
So, have you come to stage
another graceless display?

8
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,166
Is that your plan?

9
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,333
No, actually, I came here
to thank you for earlier.

10
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,583
I do appreciate what
you did back there.

[ELEN] Though, since I'm here,

00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,458
I'd like to offer you
the gift of defeat.

I hope you'll accept it
with open arms!

I know you're used to always
looking down on people, Mila.

Got that right.

[MILA] Why'd you choose
to save me, Urs?

58
00:04:57,625 --> 00:05:00,083
Given your skilled
mastery of the bow,

59
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,083
you could have let
the Serrash kill me

60
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,958
and easily taken him out
afterwards, correct?

Consider it a "thank you."

[MILA] For what?

00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,500
That tea you gave me
was pretty good.

65
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:18,041
And I'm not just saying that
because you're a war maiden.

66
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,458
I've never known anyone
to brew it better.

[MILA sighs]

68
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,666
All right, Count Vorn.

69
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,041
Tea aside, just what is it
that you want from me?

70
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,958
[TIGRE] All I ask of you
is that you remain neutral.

71
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,250
[MILA] You don't want me
as an ally?

72
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,708
No, I do. Of course.

73
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,625
But I have nothing
to offer you in return...

74
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,041
You'd only stand to lose.

75
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,750
Well, what do you hope to
gain through all of this?

76
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,416
[TIGRE] Alsace alone is
already too much for me.

77
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,291
As long as it's peaceful
there, I'll be happy.

78
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,625
[MILA] Wow... you really
mean that, don't you?

79
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,791
[TIGRE] Of course.

Listen, Count Vorn...

82

Sincerity may be
important, but still,

83
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,541
it can't solve everything.

84
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,333
[MILA] However, for once,

85
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,875
I'm actually going to trust
my feelings on this.

86
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,333
Huh?

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,166
Let it be known that in
the current Brunish civil war,

88
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,833
I will not be providing Duke
Thenardier with any assistance!

[gasping]

90
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,166
[MILA] Will that do?

Yes, and thank you.

92
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,541
[NARRATOR] As promised,

93
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,333
Ludmila committed
to a position of neutrality.

94
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,958
She even pledged
reparations for all losses

95
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,625
resulting from their warfare.

[ELEN] That's all
well and good, Tigre...

[NARRATOR] And so,

00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,041
about her own land

99
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,125
and can concentrate fully
on the war with Thenardier.

[NARRATOR] However, as though
predicting this development,

103
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,708
Thenardier plotted
his next move.

104
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,375
Armed with a royal decree
from the king,

105
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,166
he sends a
secret weapon into battle.

I see you've yet
to learn your lesson

110
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,041
and have come to blemish

wielder of the

00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:34,000
Once he assumed command
of the Order of Navarre,

Brune's western border
grew impenetrable.

[OLIVIER] What do you
have there, Roland?

124
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,208
[ROLAND]
An order from His Majesty

125
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:47,958
to put down the insurgent.

126
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,583
[OLIVIER] The insurgent?
And who is that?

127
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:55,375
[ROLAND] The count of Alsace...
Tigrevurmud Vorn.

128
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,708
[NARRATOR] A month had
passed since the battle

with Olmütz concluded.

130
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,875
And Tigre, together
with a Zhcted force

131
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,750
of five thousand knights,
returned to Brunish territory.

132
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,541
If you hadn't managed to
get Olmütz to back down

133
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,875
like you did, then
the security of my land

134
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,916
would have been
beyond my control.

135

Sir Tigrevurmud, how can
I ever repay you for this?

136
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,625
There's no need.
We're allies, aren't we?

[ELEN giggles]

138
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,166
[AUGRE] What about my soldiers?

139
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,666
They may be rough, but what
they lack in refinement,

140
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,916
they make up for in number.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,541
Please, put them to good use.

142
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:32,416
I will, sir, thank you.

143
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,041
[NARRATOR]
Tigre began moving his army

144
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,041
to the west end of Territoire.

145
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,791
He was establishing a
base of operation

146
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,416
in the region closest
to Nemetacum,

147
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,583
which was under the control
of Duke Thenardier.

148
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,416
[ELEN] All right, Lim,
let's hear you say it.

149
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,458
The... Silver... Meteor...

00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,041
Do I have to do this?

The Silver Meteor Storm!

153
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,625
You see that?

154
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,416
The name just rolls
right off her tongue,

155
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,166
like it fills her with pride...

156
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,500
So why can't you get on board
with the official name

157
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,166
of our new army, Lim?!

158
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,125
'Cause a silly name like that
will do nothing to boost morale!

159
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,291
We can't call ourselves
that on the battlefield!

160
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,416
Well, the usual options
are taken.

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
"The Allied Army" or
"The Union Army"...

162
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,791
And we can't use our names

163
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,750
since no one can agree
whose would go first!

164
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,416
So we're The Silver
Meteor Storm!

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,583
And it's great! Right, Tigre?

166
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,541
[LIM] Are you seriously not
going to say something,

167
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,750
Lord Tigre?! This is your
army! Stand up for yourself!

168
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,291
[TIGRE] A little help, Titta?

169
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,125
What do you expect me
to do about it?

170
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,250
[RYURIK] Lord Tigre!

171
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,625
[ALL] Hmm?

172
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,166
I apologize for interrupting
this important meeting.

173
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,750
But sir, another
fight's broken out.

174
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,416
[TIGRE] Again?
What is it this time?

175
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,666
[RYURIK] The thing is,
I'm not entirely sure.

176
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,500
[TIGRE]
I'll be right back, okay?

177
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,000
[ELEN] Hmm, you should be
getting used to this by now.

178
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,500
So hurry up and get back here.

179
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,166
[TITTA] I'll warm up
your dinner again.

180
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,708
It's fine. Your food always
tastes good to me, Titta,

181
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,875
even when it gets cold.

182
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,125
It's calm enough
on the surface,

183
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,791
but throwing together this
many soldiers from all over

184
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,000
is bound to cause some friction.

185
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,875
It's been a while since
Lord Mashas left for Nice.

186
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,458
We haven't received
any word from him...

187
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,958
I hope he's been able to
deliver Lord Tigre's petition

188
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,375
to King Faron without incident.

189
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,000
I love Lord Mashas.

190
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,875
I pray nothing bad
has happened to him.

191
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,666
Hey, I wouldn't
have joined this army

192
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,000
if I knew I'd fight side-by-side
with you weasels!

193
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,125
Bastard!

194
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,458
[SILVER METEOR SOLDIER C]
Break it up!

195
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,708
[SILVER METEOR SOLDIER A]
You want some of this?!

196
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,041
Come and get it!

197
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:43,833
[SILVER METEOR SOLDIER B]
You're gonna be sorry

198
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,250
when I pound your face in!

199
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,583
[SILVER METEOR SOLDIER C]
Hey, I said knock it off!

200
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:48,666
--Huh?!
--Huh?

201
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,250
[TIGRE] That's enough!

202
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,625
[SILVER METEOR SOLDIERS gasp]

203
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,000
What's the reason
for all of this?

204
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,875
You mean they were fighting
over the shape of a cloud?

205
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:09,625
[AUGRE laughs]

206
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,791
Well, that's a new one!

207
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,875
Some from Zhcted,
some from Brune.

208
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,458
We're a pretty mixed-up
hodgepodge of an army.

209
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,458
There's bound to be bickering.

210
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,666
[RYURIK] I just hope next time

211
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,625
you'll shoot off another
one of those arrows!

212
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,541
Pshoo! Waah!

213
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,041
[RYURIK laughs]

214
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,750
[AUGRE] This is Saunier.

215
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,166
It's in the center of all
the villages in this region.

216
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,125
As a result, it's the heart
of both commerce and gossip

217
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,625
for everyone around.

218
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,458
[RYURIK] There seem to be
a lot of outsiders here, too.

219
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,791
Then hopefully we can glean

220
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,000
at least a little information
about the capital.

221
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,250
[VILLAGE CHIEF A]
It's because of you, Lord Augre,

222
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,625
that we're all here.
Food or water...

223
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,500
Anything that we villagers
can do to help your cause,

224
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,833
we gladly will.

225
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,500
[AUGRE] That's very kind of you.

226
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:00,416
Thank you so much.

227
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,875
And of course, we're going to
pay you for everything.

228
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,250
[RYURIK]
You finished much sooner

229
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,625
than I expected you would.

230
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,500
[AUGRE]
It all went very smoothly.

231
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,500
Although I wish we
could've gotten some news

232
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,666
about the capital, too.

233
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,958
I know.
That is a bit of a shame.

234
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,500
So what's next
on the schedule?

235
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,791
Well, me?

236
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,416
I think I'll be heading back
to my estate now.

237
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,666
Let me see you off.

238
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,500
Nonsense, young lord,
I simply won't hear it.

239
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,500
This village is a rare treat.

240
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,666
Enjoy it before you
have to leave.

241
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,750
See, look...

242
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,416
There are all
sorts of shops here

243
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,291
to amuse a youngster like you.

244
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,416
Hoo-hoo! Look at that!

245
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,208
[TIGRE] I'll tell you what.

246
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,291
If I'm going to relax
anywhere, it'll be here.

247
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,250
[leaves rustling]

248
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,708
[TIGRE] Hmm...?

249
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,083
[TIGRE] What the--?

250
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:13,541
[TIGRE grunts]

251
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,708
[horse whinnies]

252
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,083
Hey, aren't you...

253
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,000
You're Elen's pet.
It's Lunie, right?

254
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,166
Hey, wait a second!

255
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,375
There you are, Lunie!
Don't you fly away from me!

256
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,875
[TIGRE gasps]

257
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,333
[TIGRE yells]

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,375
[TIGRE grunts]

259
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,708
[TIGRE stammers]

260
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:54,625
Oh, my goodness...
I hope that I didn't hurt you.

261
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,166
Who are you?

262
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,583
[ELEN] Sofy!

263
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,083
You have any luck
finding Lunie yet?

264
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,500
[SOFY] Yes... I sure did.

265
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,416
Oh?

266
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,375
You see,
Lunie's right up there.

267
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,833
[SOFY] Very pleased to meet you,
Lord Tigrevurmud.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,625
[SOFY] I'm one of
the seven war maidens,

269
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,750
Sofya Obertas.

270
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,291
But please, feel free
to call me Sofy.

271
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,958
And you can
just call me Tigre.

272
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,666
I'm sorry about our
awkward encounter earlier.

273
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,291
Well, that was
my first time

274
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,833
ever being held by a gentleman,
which is why I was startled.

275
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,583
I was brought here
to this land

276
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,666
to deal with some
official business.

277
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,583
His Majesty grows impatient with
the increasingly inexcusable

278
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,416
conduct of Brune in this war.

279
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,666
So the king sent me here
to act as his diplomatic envoy.

280
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,791
So, Lady Sofya,

281
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,583
might I enquire what
response you received

282
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,916
from the royal palace in Brune?
Were they reasonable or not?

283
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,833
[SOFY] To be perfectly frank,

284
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,875
the reception was
less than ideal.

285
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,750
[LIM] Hm? Meaning what?

286
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,666
When I arrived at the palace,
I was informed the King of Brune

287
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,666
had unfortunately
fallen ill, so...

288
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,333
I was unable to meet with him.

289
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,291
All I could do was leave
word of our formal position.

290
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,958
And what might that be?

291
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,791
You made them aware that
I had merely been hired by Tigre

292
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,041
and that the kingdom of Zhcted
was in no way involved

293
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,291
with our effort?

294
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,625
[SOFY] That's right...

295
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,500
And the Brunish royal court
asked me to bring

296
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,916
a message to you, Elen,

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,458
so that you could
deliver it to Lord Tigre.

298
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,583
To me?

299
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,291
"We do hereby accuse Count Vorn
of the crime of treason,

300
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,791
and as such,
strip him of his title

301
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,166
and all rights and privileges

302
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,791
that come with being a count
and Brunish nobleman.

303
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,708
Temporarily, the
province of Alsace

304
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,041
will be considered under
His Majesty's control.

305
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,458
They will briefly
govern themselves

306
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,291
until this turmoil subsides,
at which time,

307
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,500
a magistrate will be dispatched
from the royal capital."

308
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,208
Accused of treason?!

309
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,375
I believe, Lord Tigre,
that in time,

310
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,625
a messenger will come to you
directly from the palace

311
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,458
with more information.

312
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:05,708
But until that day,

313
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,791
perhaps you should ask
Lord Mashas for details.

314
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,583
He'll be more helpful
to you than I.

315
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,083
[TIGRE] Lord Mashas?

316
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,916
What a small world.
How do you know Lord Mashas?

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,708
We met back in the
Brunish capital.

318
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,708
He told me he had to return
to his own territory first,

319
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,916
so I came here alone.

320
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,875
Thank goodness!
Lord Mashas is all right!

321
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,416
I was so worried.

322
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,708
They're calling me a traitor...?

323
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,208
[ELEN] Where do the other
war maidens stand?

324
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,833
Well, Mila's...
her usual self.

325
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,333
Indeed.

326
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,833
[SOFY] As for Elizaveta,

327
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,000
she maintains conventional ties
with both Duke Thenardier

328
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,958
and Duke Ganelon.

329
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:57,166
Valentina's principality
is far enough removed from Brune

330
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,875
that she shouldn't be
a concern for now.

331
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,833
And Olga's whereabouts
are unknown.

332
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:02,875
[ELEN] She's missing?

333
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:03,958
[SOFY] She went on a journey

334
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,000
with nothing but
her dragon gear.

335
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,833
[ELEN] And I imagine
Sasha is ill as usual.

336
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,375
[SOFY sighs]

337
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,458
[SOFY] For now,
I think it's safe to say

338
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,791
the other war maidens won't
intervene the way Mila did.

339
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,916
At the moment, I'm much more
concerned about

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,875
how Brunishmen
will react to Lord Tigre

341
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,625
now that he's been
branded a traitor.

342
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,958
[ELEN] Brunishmen?

343
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,125
[SOFY] Yes.

344
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,958
For instance,
I'm thinking of regiments

345
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,791
that serve directly under
Brune's king.

346
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:37,041
[AUGRE] It seems the Order of
Navarre is fast approaching us.

347
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,458
Roland, the order's captain,
is leading the march himself.

348
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,708
He bears the title of
"Black Knight".

349
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,875
They say he's the greatest
swordsman in all of Brune.

350
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,791
Oh right, Roland...
Even I've heard of him before.

351
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,125
Wow...

352
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,000
If Backwoods Tigre knows
about this knight,

353
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,875
he must really be something.

354
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,083
At thirteen,

355
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,083
Roland became a knight,
and ever since then,

356
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,791
he's been undefeated.

357
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,000
When he was assigned to
the Order of Navarre,

358
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,833
the king bestowed upon Roland
the sword Durandal,

359
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,416
a national treasure.

360
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,541
[TIGRE] But royal knights swear
their allegiance to His Majesty.

361
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,250
So he'll only take orders
from King Faron.

362
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:18,333
[AUGRE] Hm. I may as well send a
messenger and try to reach out.

363
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,250
[NARRATOR]
Despite this overture,

364
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,041
the Order of Navarre's will to
fight remained unwavering.

365
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,583
The messenger sent
by Viscount Augre,

366
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:29,958
as well as one sent by Tigre,
were both turned away.

367
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,916
Gentlemen, I was
under the impression

368
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
that the enemy was Duke
Thenardier or Duke Ganelon.

369
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,458
So why does a knightly order now
come at us with swords drawn?

370
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,041
And it doesn't
matter how closely

371
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,708
they're working
in concert with us.

372
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,458
There's simply no justification
for deferring to a foreign army

373
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,958
instead of fighting
with our fellow Brunishmen.

374
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,416
That's foolish.

375
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,291
You'd rather rely on
the Order of Navarre

376
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,541
than throw our lot in
with the Zhcted army?

377
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,166
You know the barbarity
of Thenardier!

378
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,208
And Ganelon's lawlessness!

379
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,291
These aren't issues
that sprang up yesterday!

380
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,250
Where have these knights been
all this time?!

381
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,166
They've done nothing
to stop this madness!

382
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,958
You're not wrong,

383
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,208
but that's because the
knights are sworn to operate

384
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,125
only under direct orders
from the king.

385
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,750
Well, we'll fight!

386
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,958
All of us will!
We'll stand up for ourselves!

387
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,500
I have to side with the
young lord on this...

388
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,416
That's what we're doing here.
What this is all about.

389
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,250
And if the knights will not aid
us, we will call for Zhcted.

390
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,666
Justice is due.

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,250
[NARRATOR] The Silver
Meteor Storm took position

392
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,458
in the center
of the Orange Plains.

393
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,416
Across from them,
the Order of Navarre

394
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,833
assumed a spear wall formation.

395
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,125
Exterminate all enemies
of the crown!

396
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,416
Follow behind my sword
and charge!

I've never encountered
a warrior like this!

Is it possible that a girl
such as her could...?

00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,875
My name is Roland,
captain of the Order of Navarre.

Listen, war maiden...
