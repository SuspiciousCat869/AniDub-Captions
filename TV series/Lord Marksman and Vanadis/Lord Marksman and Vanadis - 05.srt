Such was Thenardier's hope

161
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,125
How can that be?

162
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,208
As near as I can tell,
one of their duels was a draw...

163
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,000
But ever since,
both of them have claimed it

164
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,750
as one of their wins
against the other.

165
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,791
[TIGRE] You two just
don't get along, do you?

166
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,750
Olmütz and Leitmeritz
not getting along

167
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,666
might as well be
an ancient tradition.

168
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,333
How do you mean?

169
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,750
War maidens from
the House of Lourie,

170
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,333
like Mila's mother
and grandmother,

171
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,791
they're always hostile.

172
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:15,500
Mother and grandmother?
Are war maidens dynastic?

173
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,750
Not quite.

174
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,250
We're chosen by a
Dragon Gear weapon.

175
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,041
Well, I'll give you the rest
of the history lesson later.

176
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,583
In the present,
we've got a battle to win.

177
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,625
[LIM] It's like the
Olmütz Army was never even here!

178
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,208
I believe they've withdrawn
into the Tatra Mountains.

179
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,625
She tricked us!

180
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,291
Wait, you think this was a ploy?

181
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,791
That Ludmila was planning
this move from the beginning?

182
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,416
She wasn't trying to destroy us
during yesterday's battle.

183
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,333
She was just feeling us out!

184
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,708
[NARRATOR] High atop
the Tatra Mountains

185
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,541
is a citadel with
only one way in...

186
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:58,875
Any attacking force will
quickly find itself surrounded

187
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,375
by well-entrenched
defensive fortifications.

188
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,625
Looks like she
wants us to lay siege.

189
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,166
The way's frozen over.

190
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,250
She did it with her Lavias,
to deny us a good position.

191
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,791
It's more effective
than any moat.

192
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,625
I've heard my ancestors also
had considerable difficulty

193
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,000
with this place.

194
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,166
Oh, well.

195
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,916
I won't let that stop me!

196
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
[LEITMERITZ SOLDIERS yelling]

197
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,083
[NARRATOR] The Leitmeritz Army
surged forward to the Citadel,

198
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,666
but the Olmütz forces
gave no ground.

199
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,541
Elen's men had no choice
but to fall back.

200
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,500
Once more,
the day ended in stalemate.

201
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,333
[LIM] How many times
must I say this?!

202
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,666
It's a bad idea!

203
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,125
The way this
offensive is going,

204
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
the battle will never end!

205
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,750
And if her soldiers don't
kill my men, the cold will!

206
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,375
So I'll use Arifal's power
to fly behind their camp,

207
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,666
and wipe out
Ludmila's whole rotten army!

208
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,875
Lord Tigre, please try
to talk her out of this!

209
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,083
Her plan's too reckless!

210
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,458
Tigre!

211
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,791
Who's prisoner-of-war are you?

212
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,708
I'm yours, my Lady.

213
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,041
That's exactly right!

214
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,875
Which means you should
always trust my instincts,

215
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,708
obey my orders, and pray
for my safety in battle!

216
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,166
You understand?

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,375
[TIGRE] Listen...

218
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,958
I hold you in very high regard!

219
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,791
I know I've asked you a lot by
deciding to meet her in battle.

220
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,875
My people are in your debt.

221
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,416
So the last thing I'd want...

222
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,916
...is for you to go
on a suicide mission.

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,791
[ELEN] Oh, really?

224
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,708
That's right.

225
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,916
Are you sure, Tigre?

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,791
You really, truly care
that much about me?

227
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,791
Yes, I really do.

228
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,250
I'm your favorite?

229
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,458
What's that?

230
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,958
What were you just
thinking about?

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,041
My homeland.

232
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,125
[ELEN gasps]

233
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,416
[ELEN giggles]

234
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,750
[ELEN] Your heart really does
belong to that little province,

235
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,833
doesn't it? Well, that's okay.

236
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,458
Because after all, both you
and Alsace now belong to me.

237
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,000
If you want to get technical.

238
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,291
By the way, if you would
have answered my question

239
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
with the name
of another woman...

240
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,125
Well, let's just say that Arifal
here has also been known

241
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,750
to separate heads
from their bodies.

242
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,541
So mentioning Alsace
was the best way

243
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,875
to stay on my
good side. Smart man.

244
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,416
[LIM sighs]

245
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,708
[TIGRE] So are you still
going through with your plan?

246
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,125
Give me a better one,

247
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,125
and I'll follow it
without complaint.

248
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:26,291
I have an idea, but...

249
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,208
I'll need another favor.

250
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,291
[TIGRE] Three days in.

251
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,166
[LIM] Here you go.

252
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,625
[TIGRE] A bear skin?

253
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,666
Hey, I heard a story
once about a village

254
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,791
where the men wore animal
skins when they hunted.

255
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,416
Just give it a try.

256
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,041
It might even save your life

257
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,333
[TIGRE grunts]

258
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,208
[TIGRE] Hey! It's heavy...

259
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,333
[LIM] Hmm...

260
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,041
Looks good.

261
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,666
[TIGRE] Huh?

262
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,333
I didn't say anything.

263
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,666
Are you sure he'll be okay
wearing just that thing?

264
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,083
Oh, I'll be fine...
And I promise,

265
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,083
I will find another path
for us to that citadel.

266
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,875
[TIGRE] I still have water...

267
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,833
But I need to find food.

268
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,250
...What?

269
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,750
[MILA] I take it
that's your arrow?

270
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,750
Lady... Aren't you cold
dressed like that?

271
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,458
I'm well adapted to this
climate; I think I'll be fine.

272
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,000
You walked a long way to
get to this spot, didn't you?

273
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,791
How many paces away
did you shoot this animal?

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,416
There's no way you're
that good of a shot...

275
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,541
Don't lie to me, commoner.

276
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,916
[MILA gasps]

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm sorry, sir...

278
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,291
I guess I shouldn't have doubted
that you're skilled with a bow.

279
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,416
[TIGRE] She can
actually be quite nice.

280
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,083
[MILA] You can
take that off now.

281
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,791
We're inside where it's warm.

282
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,958
As long as you're
in my presence,

283
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,416
the biting cold and snow
shouldn't be a problem for you.

284
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
[TIGRE] According to
the laws of my village.

285
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm not to remove this suit

286
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,541
while on the hunt
in the mountains.

287
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,833
Well then,
that's too bad.

288
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:20,000
Tell me your name.

289
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,958
[TIGRE] It's Urs.

290
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,333
Are you a war maiden, my lady?

291
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,000
[MILA] Yes, I am...

292
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,666
And you don't seem that
surprised by it, either.

293
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,291
Well, I don't mind...

294
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,500
Thanks to your great skill
with the bow and arrow,

295
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,625
I'll look past
your blunt manners.

296
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,958
I have an idea...

297
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,250
You should come and serve
in my court, Urs...

298
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,500
Like I was getting at,
a man with your talent is rare.

299
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,250
You could make a good living.

300
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,166
I came to the Tatra Mountains
from a distant land.

301
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,666
I won't turn my back on my home
for any amount of riches.

302
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,125
I see... That's too bad.

303
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,583
[TIGRE] Besides, aren't you
worried I might be a spy?

304
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,916
[MILA] That's a weird thing
for you to bring up now...

305
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,541
You can relax...

306
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,541
I'd believe a great
bow hunter like yourself

307
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,916
could make it this far.

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,750
But a common soldier or spy
doesn't have a chance.

309
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,916
[MILA] I know!

310
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,000
[MILA] Go on. Try it!

311
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,750
[TIGRE] It's... good!

312
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,625
[MILA giggles]

313
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,125
Glad you like it!

314
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,583
Tea's the best, isn't it?

315
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,916
Warms the body and the soul.

316
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,500
[TIGRE] She's smiling?

317
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,833
I didn't know she was
capable of that!

318
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,583
[MILA] What's the matter, Urs?

319
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,875
Tell me.

320
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,250
[TIGRE] It's nothing.

321
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,041
Now tell me, why's a
war maiden out alone up here?

322
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,958
[MILA] Looking for fun.

323
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,083
It sounds... weird to say
that out loud.

324
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,708
[TIGRE] If there's
something you wanna say,

325
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,208
I'm a very good listener.

326
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,333
[TIGRE] Whatever you need
to get off your chest.

327
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,500
It's like the old fable
about the frustrated man

328
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,208
who yells into a tree hollow.

329
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,541
[MILA] You know, I never
expected to meet a bear up here,

330
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:24,000
let alone one as nice as you.

331
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,666
When I was chosen
to be a war maiden,

332
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,250
I thought I was ready
to shoulder all

333
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,000
of its responsibilities.

334
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,041
But... For the good
of my country,

335
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,125
that means being bound by
old ties to people I hate.

336
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,875
So in the name
of tradition,

337
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,666
I told myself I had to
bury my true feelings.

338
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,416
And I thought that I was right.

339
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,541
But now I'm not so sure.

340
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,500
[MILA] Goodbye
and safe hunting, Urs!

341
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,916
I won't forget you!

342
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,916
And if you're ever feel
like visiting me,

343
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,666
you're welcome any time
at the Palace in Olmütz!

344
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,875
[TIGRE] This isn't good...

345
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,541
Once the sun goes down...

346
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,666
[TIGRE] ...I won't be able to
follow her tracks anymore.

347
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,750
I've found it...

348
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,708
The alternate route
to the Citadel.

349
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:42,416
All right, men! Almost there!

350
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,875
Her guard detail
in the rear is light...

351
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,291
If we can just get in there,
even a hundred of us...

352
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,708
[ELEN] This is more
than I expected.

353
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,875
Maybe she grew cautious
after meeting a stranger

354
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:56,791
in a bear suit.

355
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,000
So what are we
supposed to do?

356
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:58,958
Turn back?

357
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,791
No. If we give up now,

358
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,333
we're just doing exactly
what the enemy wants.

359
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,125
We have to assume that
while we're up here,

360
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,666
Thenardier may be
closing in on Alsace.

361
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,416
I'm taking down
this citadel tonight!

362
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,708
Elen, wait!

363
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,583
Dragon, who brings victory,
be with us this night!

364
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,250
Ley... Ad Mos!

365
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,083
[ELEN gasps]

366
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,333
Elen!

367
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,583
[ELEN grunts]

368
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,291
Dammit, Tigre!

369
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,041
You just ruined my chance
to hit them again!

370
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,333
Come on!

371
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,333
They were about to
turn you into a pincushion!

372
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,583
[ELEN gasps]

373
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,083
There's no other way in!

374
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,375
Or have you forgotten that?!

375
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:19,750
It's no use. Now they
know we're here.

376
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,208
[ELEN] We have to keep trying!

377
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,125
There's no time!
Not for you, or for Alsace!

378
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,333
Let me think...

379
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,208
There's has to be a move left.

380
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,750
Think!

381
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,041
[TIGRE gasps]

382
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,875
[TIGRE] Arifal!

383
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,208
[ELEN] What?

384
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,166
[TIGRE] Please, Arifal...
Lend me your strength.

385
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,291
I know that Elen is the only
master to whom you answer...

386
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:43,416
There is no physical or
spiritual connection between us.

387
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,458
But just this once,
lend me your strength!

388
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,375
Two-timer...

389
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,541
All right, here we go.

390
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,458
Follow me!

391
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,875
[SOLDIERS yell]

392
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,750
Stay behind her, men!

393
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,083
Don't fall back!

394
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,208
[MILA] They've broken
through the rear gate?!

395
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,333
Dammit, Eleonora!

396
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,916
[ELEN yells]

397
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,708
[TIGRE yells]

398
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,875
[NARRATOR] The mighty citadel at
the top of the Tatra Mountains

399
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,375
has been breached.

400
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,958
The next round in the battle
between war maidens begins!

401
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,250
[ELEN] I need to use my
Dragon Art. But can I?

402
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,666
[ELEN] Episode 6,
"The Black Knight."

403
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,250
Watch carefully.
