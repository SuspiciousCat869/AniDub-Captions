1
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,250
[ZION]
You summoned me, Father?

2
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,416
There's something I'd
like you to handle for me,

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,375
if you're up to the task.

4
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,750
[THENARDIER] Take three
thousand of our troops

5
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,625
and march them towards Alsace.

6
00:00:58,708 --> 00:00:59,666
[ZION] Alsace?

7
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,291
The territory of
that miserable Vorn

8
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,250
who got himself taken prisoner?

9
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,208
Why would I--

10
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,541
[THENARDIER]
I have for you...

11
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:08,250
...a parting gift of sorts.

12
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,208
[roars]

13
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,875
[laughs]

14
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,333
[DREKAVAC] We're not quite done
breaking them in yet.

15
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:19,250
But if you take them
into battle today,

16
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,208
they will perform magnificently.

17
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,541
I get my own dragons?

18
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,166
[laughs]

19
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,916
How exciting!

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,833
You just watch me, Vorn...

21
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:32,750
I'm going to burn your precious
homeland down to the ground!

22
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,791
Good evening, Tigre.

23
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,125
Where do you think you're going?

24
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,875
Get out of my way.

25
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,291
So that's a Zhcted
war maiden?

26
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,750
Correct.
She is our mistress...

27
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,250
Wind Princess of
the Silver Flash,

28
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,708
also known as Danseuse
of the Sword...

29
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,458
Lady Eleonora Viltaria.

30
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,625
[ELEN] What?

31
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,791
Do you have a problem with
the way I'm dressed?

32
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,708
And after I put on some clothes
just so you could look at me

33
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,041
without blushing
like a schoolboy.

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,541
I have to get back to
Alsace. It's urgent!

35
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,250
[ELEN] Have you forgotten
your situation, milord?

36
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,833
[TIGRE] Thenardier's
attacking my homeland!

37
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,083
If I don't go now,
it'll be too late!

38
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,000
Please let me go!

39
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,291
Once I save them,
I'll come back. I promise!

40
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,750
[ELEN] And when you get to
Alsace, what will you do?

41
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,750
What'll I do?

42
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,666
I'll protect the province,
of course!

43
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,291
Yes, but how?

44
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,791
[TIGRE]
How...? Uh...

45
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,291
I know that you're
very good with a bow...

46
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,166
...but how much can
you do on your own?

47
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,416
Despite all your
skill and resolve,

48
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,125
you can't stop a force
of three thousand.

49
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,583
It's just a fool's errand.

50
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,250
I'm aware.

51
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,333
[ELEN] And yet you
still want to go?

52
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,708
Yes, I must!

53
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,833
Maybe there's
something I can do!

54
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,708
What can a reckless
and impulsive man

55
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,416
like you possibly do?

56
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,416
[TIGRE gasps]

57
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,041
[ELEN] As you know, the penalty
for running away is death.

58
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,250
If you're so eager to die,

59
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,083
you may as well
meet your end here.

60
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,041
Dying in Leitmeritz
would be no different

61
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,208
than dying in Alsace, after all.

62
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,208
So I can't leave?
You won't allow me to?

63
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,250
[sighs]

64
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:01,333
Do you even understand why
I'm so upset about this?

65
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,791
[ELEN] Why not use your wits?

66
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,416
At Dinant, you tried to turn
things to your advantage.

67
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,375
And though you failed, at least
you were clever about it.

68
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,375
But here in this instance,
you'd act on emotion,

69
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:15,375
without thought, even though
it means certain death.

70
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know what
else to tell you.

71
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,125
[gasps]

72
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,416
[TIGRE] Why hasn't she
just run me through?

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,291
She could have commanded
Ryurik and the others

74
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:34,083
to apprehend me...
But she hasn't.

75
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,500
Young Master...

76
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,208
[TIGRE] Perhaps Elen...

77
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,625
...is trying to offer me
an opportunity.

78
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,541
Then help me.

79
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,625
[TIGRE] Please...

80
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,250
Lend me your army.

81
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,208
[ELEN gasps]

82
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,833
[ALL gasp]

83
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,250
Is he crazy?
He's a hostage!

84
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,750
[ELEN chuckles]

85
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:27,958
[ELEN laughing]

86
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:35,041
[laughing continues]

87
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:36,500
You're too much.

88
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:40,458
That was so stupidly brazen,
it's actually refreshing.

89
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,500
[ELEN] You want me to
lend you an army?

90
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,125
Very well...

91
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,166
But of course it's
going to cost you.

92
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,333
The price?

93
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,500
All of Alsace.

94
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,458
If you save her, she's yours,

95
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:00,416
as long as you promise
to rule her fairly

96
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,708
and protect her people.

97
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,666
What, no haggling? Huh.

98
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,791
[ELEN]
It's settled!

99
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,041
Raise the Zirnitra banners!

100
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,791
On to battle!

101
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:17,291
[ZHCTED SOLDIERS yelling]

102
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,916
[LIM] I was taken aback.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,541
It took some nerve asking you
to supply him with troops.

104
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:36,041
Seems he's defied
both our expectations.

105
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,958
[ELEN] You predicted that
Tigre would challenge me

106
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,000
to an archery contest.

107
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,583
Meanwhile...

108
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,708
I thought that he'd ask me to
make him one of my attendants.

109
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,875
And considering he
hasn't made that request,

110
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,791
it would appear
you lost the wager.

111
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,375
I'm afraid you were wrong
about him, my Lady.

112
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,375
But of course, I was, as well.

113
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,916
Not sure it still counts as
a bet if neither of us is right.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,458
[knocking]

115
00:07:58,541 --> 00:07:59,875
He's here!

116
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,375
[ELEN] You're going into
battle dressed like that?

117
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,833
You do realize you're basically

118
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,541
the commander of
an army now, right?

119
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,625
Well, this is
all that I have.

120
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,375
[ELEN] Uh...

121
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,083
[LIM] Ugh, you are a mess.

122
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:19,208
Here, this'll have to do.
We're out of time.

123
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,375
But we can at least neaten
up your hair a little

124
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,041
so you don't look quite
so disheveled.

125
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,041
[TIGRE] Uh, thank you...

126
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,208
[ELEN chuckles]

127
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,625
Here, I wanna help!!

128
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,541
[TIGRE] Hey, is this
really necessary?

129
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,125
[ELEN] 
Don't fight it!

130
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,208
[TIGRE]

131
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,583
[ELEN]
Well, I guess that's it.

132
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,541
[ELEN]
Hmm? What's wrong?

133
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,166
I know you're
probably overwhelmed

134
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,416
with appreciation right now,
but you could say something...

135
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,375
Like, "How beautiful!"

136
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,875
I've wanted to say
that ever since

137
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,833
I first saw you.

138
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,041
Their army...
It's much larger!

139
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,875
Can we really beat them?

140
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,750
Yes, but they don't
know the land...

141
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:03,208
Nobody from their House
has been to Alsace in ages!

142
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,666
And that does matter...

143
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,875
Trust me!

144
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,041
I know the province like
the back of my hand!

145
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,083
We have that
going for us.

146
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,250
All right, then, let's win this!

147
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,333
That's it...

148
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,500
Slowly, so they can
get a good look.

149
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,666
Think long and hard about
whether you side with

150
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,375
the House of Thenardier
or the House of Ganelon...

151
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,625
All you citizens of Brune!

152
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,583
[ZION laughs maniacally]

153
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:39,833
[STEED] So that's the reason
you sent Lord Zion to Alsace...

154
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,916
Now that Prince Regnas
has been struck down,

155
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,166
it's left a power vacuum
with no successor

156
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,500
capable of ruling as king.

157
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,875
Soon, control of Brune
will be mine,

158
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,541
or it will all go to Ganelon.

159
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,541
The struggle between us
is only a matter of time.

160
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,958
[THENARDIER] Alsace...

161
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,583
It's a land of no
importance or value

162
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,541
and too far removed from
the center of things...

163
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,541
But Ganelon may try to take it,
and that's reason enough.

164
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,416
So now you'll
reduce it to ashes?

165
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,541
Still, sending three
thousand soldiers

166
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,666
to such a remote location...

167
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,166
Not to mention the dragons...

168
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,875
[THENARDIER] I'm sending a
message to the weaker provinces.

169
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,750
And besides,
I wanted the dragons

170
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,958
to become accustomed to Zion.

171
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,750
[ALSACE SOLDIER 2A] Head for
the mountains or the woods!

172
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,750
[TITTA]
Take refuge in the temple!

173
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:37,375
You'll be safe! No one
would dare attack you there!

174
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,583
I'll find a way to halt
Ganehlon's movement,

175
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,625
whatever it takes.

176
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,375
Bertrand, you should
go to Zhcted.

177
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,125
Fill Tigre in so he knows
what's going on here.

178
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,833
Just leave it to me.

179
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,125
I won't return without
the young master.

180
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,000
Titta, you go work
with the soldiers

181
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,291
to help evacuate
all the residents.

182
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,041
Send the strong to
the mountains or woods,

183
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,208
everyone else to the temple.

184
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,958
Not even Thenardier would dare

185
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,125
make an enemy of
the temple at this point.

186
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,958
Yes!

187
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,375
Go on, Titta...

188
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,583
Shouldn't you be leaving
the city, as well?

189
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,416
No, I'm staying here.

190
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,583
I want to be at Lord Tigre's
door to greet him...

191
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,916
when he returns home.

192
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,666
[TIGRE sighs]

193
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,250
[TIGRE] Every time I look
at that bow, I think,

194
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,791
"Something about it
just feels so ostentatious."

195
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,041
Lord Tigre,
don't think like that.

196
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,625
It's a precious family heirloom,
left to you by your ancestors.

197
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,250
Which is why I
pay my respects.

198
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,333
As I did today, and every day.

199
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,500
[gasps]

200
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:08,000
[TIGRE] It's been two years
now since Father died.

201
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,125
I'm still not much
of a feudal lord,

202
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,083
but at least I've got Bertrand
here, and you, Titta.

203
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,500
It's only because of you two

204
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,000
that we're getting by
as well as we are.

205
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,708
Whoa, What's come over
you all of a sudden today?

206
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh no!
Are you feeling all right?

207
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,291
I'm grateful.

208
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,166
No, stop!
Don't act so serious!

209
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,125
It makes me feel like something
bad's going to happen...

210
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,125
[TITTA sobbing]

211
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,833
[BERTRAND] The young master
will be here soon.

212
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,791
Though he's probably
catching hell from Titta

213
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,166
right now for sleeping in!

214
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,000
[ALSACE SOLDIERS laugh]

215
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,541
[TITTA] But why, sir?

216
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,250
I don't understand
why you have to go off

217
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,041
and fight in this silly war!

218
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,583
Because His Majesty
called us...

219
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,375
As a count in the
kingdom of Brune

220
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,833
and head of the House
of Vorn, I must.

221
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:56,875
Yes, but...

222
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,791
It's fine.
The army's huge...

223
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,333
I'm sure they'll just put us all
the way in the rearguard...

224
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,166
I'll come back, I swear.

225
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,916
[TITTA sniffs]

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,791
Lord Tigre...

227
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,833
You're coming back...

228
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,916
You're coming back to us,
aren't you? You promised.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,458
[THENARDIER SOLDIERS yelling]

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,541
[TITTA] Lord Tigre!

231
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,708
[ZION laughs]

232
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:54,916
[THENARDIER SOLDIERS yelling]

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,375
[VILLAGERS panicking]

234
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,625
[ZION sighs]

235
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,083
With a pathetic town as
flea-bitten as this one,

236
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,625
there's just not enough
thrill in destroying it.

237
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,875
Now, it might be another story
if we could use the dragons,

238
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,875
but I can't disobey my father.

239
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:16,500
The dragons are not yet
accustomed to all the smells

240
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,208
that are found in villages.

241
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,208
Be sure to keep them
outside the walls.

242
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,291
Are you mad?

243
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,875
Then why am I even
bringing them?

244
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,083
[THENARDIER]
Use your head.

245
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,250
You use the dragons
to scare them,

246
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,833
and not just in Alsace.

247
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,416
This is a warning
to all of Brune.

248
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,208
Go against Thenardier,

249
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,875
and you will be
forfeiting your future!

250
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,666
[ZION] What do you mean
there's nobody in the town?

251
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,250
[THENARDIER SOLDIER 2A]
It appears most of them fled

252
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,958
into the forest, while the rest
are holed up inside the temple.

253
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,416
What would you
like us to do, sir?

254
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,708
Temple's off limits...

255
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,250
If we attack this one,

256
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,833
we'll be inviting all of Brune's
temples to turn against us.

257
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,541
No, leave them be!

258
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,750
[ZION chuckles]

259
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,541
[ZION]
The Vorn home, eh?

260
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,375
No...
Lord Tigre...

261
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:27,625
Watch over me...
and give me... courage.

262
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,916
[TITTA gasps]

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,958
[ZION grunts]

264
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,458
Get out of here.

265
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:46,583
Ah... well, aren't you
a pretty little thing.

266
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,291
Please, just leave.

267
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,791
Huh?

268
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,333
I'm not sure
I heard you right...

269
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,666
Seems that Vorn imbecile

270
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,458
is terrible at training
his maids, too.

271
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,125
Now, go on, say it again.

272
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,666
Just leave.

273
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,916
What's that?

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,250
[gasps]

275
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,541
I said get the hell out of here!

276
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:12,333
This estate, and everything in
this town belong to Lord Tigre!

277
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,000
So don't you dare lay
a finger on any of it!

278
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,125
You heard me!

279
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,791
Now get out!
Get out of here now!

280
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,208
[ZION sighs]

281
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,375

[TITTA screams]

283
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,541
[ZION] What's wrong?

284
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,333
You should get up and run away

285
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,000
or next time I'll
cut off your legs.

286

[ZION laughs]

287
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,958
[ZION] Are we done playing
this game of cat and mouse?

288
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:11,125
Lord Tigre...

289
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,583
Heh! Now what do we have here?

290
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,333
Sounds like the little maid

291
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,625
is harboring secret
feelings for her master...

292
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,875
No, it's not like that!

293
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,333
Lord Tigre...

294
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,375
[ZION] Poor girl, I imagine
your precious Master Vorn

295
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,250
has failed to pay
his ransom, and,

296
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,958
as we speak, is likely
being sold into slavery.

297
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,000
Shall I do the
same with you?

298
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,833
If you're lucky,
perhaps you'll be reunited.

299
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,333
Two slaves together...
You can fulfill your fantasies!

300
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,708
[laughs evilly]

301
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:44,041
No, you're wrong!
Lord Tigre is coming back!

302
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,416
Now isn't that adorable.

303
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,833
[TITTA yells]

304
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,208
Yes, go ahead, scream
and moan all you like.

305
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,250
You can even call out
his name, I don't mind.

306
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,750
[TITTA] Lord Tigre...

307
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,666
[screams]

308
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,583
[TIGRE] Titta, jump!

309
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:41,750
Jump now!

310
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,208
[TITTA giggles]

311
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,000
[TIGRE] Titta!

312
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,291
[TIGRE] What the...?

313
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,708
[ELEN] You are quite reckless.

314
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,083
I don't mean to rub
it in or anything,

315
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,583
but if I weren't with you,
you'd be hurting pretty badly.

316
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,583
The wind...
So that's it.

317
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,500
Your power...

318
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:34,583
[ELEN] That's right.

319
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,541
This sword controls the wind,

320
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,083
and is only wielded
by war maidens.

321
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,666
This is Arifal.

322
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,333
Huh? Seems to have
taken a liking to you.

323
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,125
Ah... Zion...

324
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,625
[ELEN] Zion?

325
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,625
[TIGRE] The eldest son of
the House of Thenardier

326
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,250
and next in line to lead it.

327
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,500
[ELEN] Hmm, so he's
their commander.

328
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,416
Forward!

329
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,250
[ZHCTED SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

330
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,750
[TITTA] Lord Tigre!

331
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,791
Yes, Titta?

332
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,583
Lord Tigre!

333
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,958
[TIGRE] Hey, wait a second.

334
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,791
Why were you still here...?

335
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,083
In case...

336
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,541
In case anything were
to happen here...

337
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,166
I at least wanted to be
able to save this for you.

338
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,416
You fool!

339
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,125
You should've gone and
hidden with the rest!

340
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,125
[TITTA] But there was
no way I could do that!

341
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,333
Titta...

342
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,875
You left me here...

343
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,166
It's my duty to watch over
this place while you're away!

344
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,125
So I couldn't just abandon it!

345
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,875
Even though
I was scared...

346
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,958
So scared...

347
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,791
But through it all...
I believed in you.

348
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:40,333
Thank you.

349
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,875
You're making me jealous...

350
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,583
So she's more of your
type, then, is she?

351
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,875
Lord Tigre, who are
all of these people?

352
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,208
[ZHCTED SOLDIERS gasp]

353
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,166
[TITTA gasps]

354
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,208
Can you fight?

355
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,791
Of course...
Watch me.

356
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,500
Zirnitras!

357
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,750
[ELEN] Charge!

358
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,625
[ZHCTED SOLDIERS yell]

359
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,416
Tigre, come on!

360
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,791
Right!

361
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,333
My bow...

362
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,208
It just happened...

363
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,583
[TITTA] Lord Tigre...

364
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,708
Now is the time.

365
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:48,250
[URS] Use this bow only
when you truly require it.

366
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,708
I suppose
that's right now.

367
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,041
[ELEN] Don't let even one
soldier escape!

368
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,916
We'll make sure they get
what's coming to them!

369
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,916
Yes, Lord Urs.

370
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,125
the young master's
finally done it...

371
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,875
...picked up the black bow.

372
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:35,291
[NARRATOR] A black bow,
handed down through the ages,

373
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,916
has finally been taken up
by the young Tigre

374
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,833
as he goes off to battle.

375
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,583
The enemy numbers
three thousand,

376
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,708
his allies, a third of that.

377
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:47,208
Which side will fortune favor?

378
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,083
[TIGRE] Did you... just talk?

379
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:44,416
[TIGRE] Episode 3: "Return of
the Magic Marksman."

380
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,875
Enjoy watching.
