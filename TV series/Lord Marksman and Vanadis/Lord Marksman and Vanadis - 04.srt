00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,583
such a brat like you.

164
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,416
[SOFY] Elen...
at the very least,

165
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,333
I can say that you've
turned Ludmila against you

166
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,500
with this little stunt.

167
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,333
How so?

168
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,750
[SOFY] Mila...

169
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,916
...has a long and tangled past
with Duke Thenardier.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,750
What? Mila and
Thenardier, really?!

171
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,000
But that's absurd!

172
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,208
Yes, it's quite true
that she ordinarily

173
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,916
wouldn't much care for
a man like Duke Thenardier.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,250
In fact, it's safe
to say she hates him.

175
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,666
Then why?

176
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,916
[SOFY] She's connected
to the House of Thenardier.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,875
Those ties were formed
long before she was born...

178
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,625
You know a young maiden like her

179
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,458
would never let her personal
feelings stand in the way.

180
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,375
It's her duty.

181
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,208
Duke Thenardier
is not the only enemy

182
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,458
that you and Count Vorn
are up against.

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,708
Ludmila... Lourie...

184
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:47,125
[TITTA]
Lord Tigre! Lord Tigre!

185
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,875
Lord Tigre, it's time to get up!

186
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,750
[TITTA] Let's go!

187
00:10:54,541 --> 00:11:05,416
[TITTA laughing]

188
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:14,000
[URS]
Come, son... till the soil.

189
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,041
[TIGRE] My hands hurt!

190
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,541
[URS] Tigrevurmud...

191
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,083
[TIGRE] Uh?

192
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,833
We're here to respond
in case anything bad happens.

193
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,750
We serve so that
these people can live out

194
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,583
their lives in peace.

195
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,666
That's the purpose
of a feudal lord.

196
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,041
[TIGRE] Father...

197
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,208
[URS] Don't forget who you are.

198
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:53,333
[TIGRE]
Father! Father! Father!

199
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,291
Father!

200
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,250
Titta...

201
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,125
Did you sleep okay?

202
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,833
[TITTA yelps]

203
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,083
[TITTA] I'm so sorry!

204
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,500
I was waiting for the
right time to wake you,

205
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,000
and then I guess
I must have dozed off.

206
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,583
[TIGRE laughs]

207
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,041
It looks like we were
both exhausted, huh?

208
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,958
Sorry about that.

209
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,291
Oh, no!

210
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,458
If anyone should
be sorry, it's me!

211
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,833
Don't worry.

212
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,750
Thanks to you, I think
I've figured something out.

213
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,750
Come on.

214
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,208
Sure!

215
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,083
[TIGRE]
What a fine day for hunting.

216
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,125
Assuming nothing comes up.

217
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,208
I'll be by your side
wherever you go!

218
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,666
Just as you've come to my
aid in the past, Lord Tigre,

219
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,666
now it's my turn to repay the
favor and help you for a change!

220
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,250
Thanks, Titta.

221
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,583
And I'll try
to do my best, too.

222
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:12,083
No. I will do my best.

223
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,791
[TIGRE] That horse...

224
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,208
It's Lord Mashas!

225
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,916
So then he
must be here, right?

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,666
Yes.

227
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,875
[LIM growls]

228
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:30,291
[MASHAS growls]

229
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,625
[TIGRE] Uh...

230
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
Perhaps now, Tigre,

231
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,750
you could shed some light on
what exactly is going on here?

232
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,333
Of course, I understand.

233
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,500
Lady Limalisha.

234
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,666
I apologize for
greeting you and your men

235
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,708
with suspicion when you arrived.

236
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,583
No. I apologize.

237
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,708
You had every right
to act cautiously.

238
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,125
You saw foreign
soldiers approaching you.

239
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,166
Lord Mashas,
sorry to have alarmed you...

240
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,375
and so soon after you arrived.

241
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,916
[MASHAS]
Don't worry about it.

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,041
Nothing bad happened.

243
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,416
Moving on, Tigre...

244
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,875
Yes?

245
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,458
In terms of what comes next...

246
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:19,416
I'll fight Duke Thenardier
and defeat him.

247
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,333
[MASHAS] Mmm.

248
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,541
So, you're siding
with Duke Ganelon then?

249
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:31,875
No. I have no intention of
aligning with either of them.

250
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,416
And you came to
this decision after

251
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,041
thoroughly
considering all options?

252
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,541
It's simple.

253
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,791
My obligation
is to defend Alsace

254
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,875
and all the people
who call it home.

255
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,166
No. It's not just that.
I want to defend them.

256
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,916
I'm here to respond in case
anything bad happens.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,125
I'm a feudal lord.

258
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,458
[MASHAS chuckles]

259
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,083
[NARRATOR] Afterward,
Mashas would make his way

260
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,583
to Brune's capital
to petition the king

261
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,958
and endorse the
morality of Tigre's cause.

262
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,208
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Tigre
was going from land to land

263
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,666
in search of potential allies.

264
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,708
[AUGRE] Mashas informed me
of your situation--

265
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,708
at least the basics of it.

266
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,541
And to be perfectly
frank with you,

267
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,625
when I first heard the
request was coming from you,

268
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,083
I declined.

269
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,416
Though you may be in the right,

270
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,208
there was no way you could
defeat Duke Thenardier.

271
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,083
But Lord Augre, we--

272
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,291
"There was"?

273
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,625
[AUGRE] Tigre...

274
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,125
Or should I say Count Vorn.

275
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,958
Now you not only have Mashas,

276
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,875
but also the very distinguished
and powerful army of Zhcted

277
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,916
enlisted among your allies.

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,750
With them on your side,
you could stand against

279
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,541
either Duke Thenardier
or Duke Ganelon.

280
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,458
So will you join us?

281
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,041
[AUGRE] You're well on
your way toward becoming

282
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,625
a formidable power.

283
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,500
Right up there with
Thenardier and Ganelon.

284
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,833
[AUGRE] While they swear
allegiance to the royal family,

285
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,166
they refuse to stay in their
rightful place beneath them.

286
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,125
Other people have noticed, too.
I'm not the only one.

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,500
[TIGRE] The mansion of Kikimora?

288
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,291
[LIM] It's a villa,
just past the Vosyes Mountains.

289
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,833
[ELEN] Oh good, you made it!

290
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,666
Here, drink up!

291
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,083
[ELEN] I've got the king's
permission, for the time being.

292
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,916
However, there are
a couple of problem areas.

293
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,916
For starters, if I come
to obtain the land of Alsace,

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,125
then I'll be required to
offer all of it to my kingdom.

295
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,333
By offer it, you mean
they'll just seize it?

296
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,583
It's my homeland!

297
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,250
Mm.

298
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,875
Of course that would
only be if it becomes

299
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,166
her territory first.

300
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,500
[ELEN] Mhm.

301
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,708
This war is just now
getting started.

302
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,333
We still have plenty
of ways to change things up.

303
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,416
But there's another issue.

304
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,333
The king said this to me
right before I left...

305
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,791
"Be sure that you always put
the interests of Zhcted first,

306
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,750
and act prudently in
everything that you do."

307
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,041
What's wrong with that?

308
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,291
You really don't
get it, do you?

309
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,916
That order is specifically
troubling for us.

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,291
He emphasized that
we prioritize one thing...

311
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,958
...national interests.

312
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,375
[TIGRE gasps]

313
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,208
It paves the way for other
nobles who might have ties

314
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,916
to someone
like Duke Thenardier.

315
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,333
They could say
that a win for the duke

316
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,000
would be in Zhcted's interest.

317
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,666
That could give cover
for them taking part

318
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,458
in this current war as well.

319
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,666
You think someone
could interpret it that way?

320
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,541
That's the reason
he used those words,

321
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,666
to allow for
that interpretation.

322
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,375
You see, the king doesn't
care which side is victorious,

323
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:37,291
long as he stands to benefit
from the war either way.

324
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,166
Do you see now?

325
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,291
[knocking]

326
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,708
A caretaker?

327
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,291
I'll go check.

328
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,208
Despite all that,
it's highly unlikely

329
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,041
the lower aristocracy
will make the first move.

330
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,291
Because sitting firmly
at the top of our hierarchy

331
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:54,666
is the king, of course,

332
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,000
with the seven war
maidens right below him,

333
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,583
then the rest of the nobility.

334
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,458
Since those lords are
beneath us, none of them

335
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,708
has the power to challenge
a war maiden directly.

336
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,708
The problem is...

337
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,750
The other ones?
The war maidens?

338
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,833
Not all the other
war maidens are on our side,

339
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,875
but they're not enemies, either.

340
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,708
For now, there's just one
we need to worry about.

341
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,916
Who's that?

342
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,541
Oh, she is so annoying!

343
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,416
She's always harping on about
good manners or character.

344
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,708
And on top of all that,

345
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,458
she looks just like
a shriveled blueberry!

346
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,583
Hey, who are you
calling shriveled, jerk?!

347
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:30,666
[TIGRE gasps]

348
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,791
Lim! Why on earth
would you let this

349
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,208
walking windbag in here?

350
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,250
I couldn't very well turn away
a war maiden, now could I?

351
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,708
She's one?

352
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,208
[MILA] One of the esteemed
war maidens of Zhcted...

353
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,958
Mistress of the
Piercing Point of Smiting.

354
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,333
Ludmila Lourie.

355
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:51,666
Nice to meet you.
I'm Tigrevurmud Vorn.

356
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,625
Tigre, this little girl
is not a guest.

357
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,750
There's no reason for
titles and handshakes!

358
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,083
Uh?

359
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,416
Looks like I was right
to check in, just in case.

360
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,708
I came because
I needed to see you.

361
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:05,458
Yes, you,
Count Tigrevurmud Vorn.

362
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,875
But this isn't
the right place.

363
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,916
Let's talk somewhere else.

364
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,458
[MILA] Hey, why are
you two following us?

365
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,833
[ELEN] You said you wanted
to go somewhere else, right?

366
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,541
Well, we're on our way to
Rodnik now and Tigre's with us.

367
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,583
But you're free to tag along.

368
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,291
[MILA] Hmph!

369
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,750
So what did you
want to talk to me about?

370
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,708
Duke Thenardier
has many allies,

371
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,583
both inside and outside
of his kingdom.

372
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,166
And that includes myself.

373
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,541
[MILA] You don't stand
a chance against him.

374
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,125
[TIGRE] A trap?

375
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,500
[ELEN] We're boxed in.

376
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,416
[LIM] Looks like
we've got assassins.

377
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,791
[TIGRE] There.

378
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,208
[ELEN] Yes, if they
were mere bandits,

379
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,791
they would've shown
themselves by now.

380
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,416
So the question is,
which one of us are they after?

381
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,875
You don't mean...

382
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,125
No...

383
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,958
I was the one who
chose to take this road...

384
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,083
But Tigre would make a
prime target now for someone...

385
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,666
If he were to die here,

386
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,166
I'm sure that Thenardier and his
people would be dancing for joy.

387
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,708
And of course
it would mean driving me

388
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,291
out of Brune as well.

389
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,250
I find that scenario unpleasant
for several reasons.

390
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,041
[TIGRE gasps]

391
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,833
[TIGRE] Here they come!

392
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,958
[MILA] Serrash!

393
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,750
[LIM grunts]

394
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,208
[ELEN] Lim!

395
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,416
[TIGRE] With this kind of snake,
she can still live.

396
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,041
Once I suck out the poison,
she'll be okay.

397
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,083
Tigre!

398
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,541
[ELEN gasps]

399
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,125
Lavias!

400
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,916
Shero Zam Kafa...

401
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,791
Are you done
giving first aid?

402
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,000
For things to get
this out of hand,

403
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,750
and all because
of one royal subject...

404
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,208
Eleonora, you're a failure
as a war maiden.

405
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,166
[MILA] I'll go find a doctor.

406
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,791
[ELEN gasps]

407
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,666
[MILA] I'll meet you in Rodnik.

408
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
Wait, hold on!

409
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,541
[TIGRE] I thank you...
for everything.

410
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,041
It's okay.

411
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,458
[TIGRE] Please, Arifal,
lend me your strength.

412
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,583
[TIGRE] Episode 5: "The Storming
of the Tatra Mountains"

413
