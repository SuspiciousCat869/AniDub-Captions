1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Had you been awake
and done that to me,

2
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,875
I would have had you executed.

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,541
I better be going now,
but I'll see you again soon...

4
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,041
valiant hero.

5
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,625
[TITTA] Lord Tigre?
Is someone in there with you?

6
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:32,875
I'm coming in!

7
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,791
[NARRATOR] Thanks to the
intervention of Sir Emile

8
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,083
and his knights from
the Order of Pearsh,

9
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,583
Tigre and his army beat back
the Muozinel invasion.

10
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,166
Now, he and his men rest
in Fort Pearsh,

11
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,333
a four days march
from the Ormean Plains.

12
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,500
[MILA] We did fine on our own.

13
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,458
You could have just
stayed in Zhcted...

14
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,500
Or did you miss
your men that much?

15
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:29,291
I never knew you cared so much
about my feelings...

16
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,916
They're quite
capable without me.

17
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,375
Hmph.

18
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,041
You must be missing Olmütz
by now though, right?

19
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,833
[MILA] Oh, wow...

20
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:41,041
You really have grown up if it's
you who's concerned about me!

21
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,291
Eleonora...

22
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,375
But missing the battle
means your punctuality

23
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,875
still needs work.

24
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:51,125
[ELEN] You're right... I should
have been here and I wasn't.

25
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,541
[MILA gasps]

26
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,583
[ELEN] Thank you
for your help, Ludmila...

27
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,083
We won because of you.

28
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,791
But now that I'm back,
focused, and ready to fight,

29
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,875
your services are
no longer needed!

30
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,250
So say goodbye to Tigre
and hit the road to Olmütz!

31
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,166
I'm supposed to keep an eye on
you...

32
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,458
that order comes from
King Viktor himself.

33
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,708
Plus, Tigre's now in debt
to me for all my help.

34
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,166
Hmph!

35
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,791
[TIGRE] Something's off.

36
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,791
With your hand?

37
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,083
I'm sure he's just tired.

38
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,458
The more he wins,
the more duties he has

39
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,291
as Supreme Commander
of the Silver Meteor Army.

40
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,125
[LIM] Yes, of course.

41
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:42,000
So, is there a problem?
Why did I have to get up?

42
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,666
Right.. It's something
to do with His Highness,

43
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,208
Prince Regnas.

44
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,166
[TIGRE] Prince Regnas? But I
thought he was killed at Dinant.

45
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,125
[MASHAS] There are rumors
that someone in camp

46
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,708
greatly resembles
the late prince,

47
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,500
and I was curious if
you'd seen or heard

48
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,000
of this person yourself.

49
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,083
A Regnas look-alike?

50
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,208
[BERTRAND] Young master!
I'm sorry to interrupt,

51
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:00,833
may I come in?

52
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:02,416
Bertrand, come in.

53
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,708
There's a maiden here
named Regin

54
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,500
requesting an audience
with you, young master.

55
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,000
Right now?

56
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,208
[MASHAS gasps]

57
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,000
[TIGRE] I'm glad to see
you've gotten healthier.

58
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,541
[REGIN] Thank you.

59
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,750
But there's something I need
to speak to you about, Count.

60
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,875
[REGIN] Are they...?

61
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:30,125
Don't worry,
they're my counsel...go on...

62
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,416
As you wish, Tigre.

63
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,083
[REGIN inahles]

64
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,333
[REGIN] My real name,
well, the name I went by--

65
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,791
until very recently--was Regnas.

66
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:42,875
Wha--?

67
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:43,541
[LIM gasps]

68
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:44,750
[MASHAS gasps]

69
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,625
[REGIN] I'm sorry I didn't tell
you before,

70
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,041
but my full name is:
Regnas... Estelle...

71
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,041
Loire Bastien de Charles.

72
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,458
[BERTRAND] Oh my, and I
thought your name was long,

73
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,708
Count Tigrevurmud.

74
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,208
[MASHAS whimpers]

75
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,958
Hold on, lady!
Do you have any proof?!

76
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:02,458
[REGIN] Uhh...
My lord, Tigrevurmud...

77
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,791
About six years ago
at Vincennes...

78
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,666
do you remember when
you visited there?

79
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,750
Oh, yes, Vincennes!

80
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,916
[REGIN] I slipped away on my own
from the hunting festival...

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,500
And I bumped into you,
who had also run off.

82
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,208
[gasping]

83
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,250
Don't tell anyone, 'kay?

84
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:29,916
[REGIn] That was the
first time I'd eaten game

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,625
killed in front of me.
I still remember the taste...

86
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:35,416
Wow, it's so delicious!

87
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,416
You're him!

88
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,041
Uh... I mean, her...
I mean, Your Highness.

89
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,750
[MASHAS gasps]

90
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,041
[TITTA] Feeling better, sir?

91
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,333
I'm... just embarrassed.

92
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,333
Prince Regnas? Didn't your men
kill him on the Dinant Plains?

93
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:06,250
I guess not... I was told he was
dead, but it wasn't by my blade.

94
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,000
Don't be nervous.
If you're going to trust me

95
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,791
to keep you safe, you can
trust Elen to do the same.

96
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,416
After all, I trust her
with my own life.

97
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,541
[REGIN] In the confusion
of the Zhcted night raid,

98
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,500
I was attacked by an assassin...

99
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,416
Once you fall or
go missing in battle,

100
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,750
it's easy for people
to think you're dead.

101
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:32,583
Go back. Why were you posing as
a boy prince in the first place?

102
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:35,375
For my safety and
that of my mother...

103
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,083
In Brune, a queen who only
bears girls will find herself

104
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,375
scorned by the
King and court alike.

105
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,791
Also... the likelihood of a
princess ascending the throne

106
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:44,958
is quite low.

107
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,083
So you've posed as
a boy your whole life?

108
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,500
That's a pretty big commitment.

109
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,708
I can't even imagine...
I mean, I guess it worked fine

110
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,458
when you were young.
But what was your plan

111
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,791
if you grew big ol'
breasts like Lim here?

112
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,291
Tigre, what are we going to do?

113
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,333
Huh?

114
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,000
Frankly... she might
get in the way.

115
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,875
[ELEN] "Prince Regnas actually
survived the Dinant...

116
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,208
After Ganelon and Thenardier
tried to have him killed..."

117
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,291
Suppose we claim that.

118
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,708
But then when people find out
he's a she,

119
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,625
they'll go back to
not believing us.

120
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,541
[ELEN] Which plays into
our enemies' hands.

121
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:35,708
You're right.
We have to be careful...

122
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,666
Is there a way to
speak to King Faron?

123
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,583
I don't think so...

124
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,375
[REGIN gasps]

125
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,833
What's wrong?!

126
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,000
His mind is gone.

127
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,833
So, Princess, what made you
choose to reveal yourself to us?

128
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,750
Why are you so trusting in me?

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,458
[REGIN] Because...
your motives are pure.

130
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,958
Oh?

131
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,875
You were branded a traitor and
have enemies all around...

132
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,875
You had nothing to gain
by helping the people

133
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,666
of the Brunish southlands...

134
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,958
And yet, you fought desperately
on their behalf...

135
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,375
And what's more...

136
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,208
When I asked for a favor
in our previous camp...

137
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,500
You didn't take advantage.

138
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,583
Hold on a minute;
what favor was this?

139
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:34,250
I, uh... I asked
if he could help bathe me.

140
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,708
[TIGRE gasps]

141
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,416
[REGIN] There's a favor
I must ask of you.

142
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,250
Do you mind helping me...
wash myself?

143
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,458
I'm so sore...

144
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,916
[TIGRE] Uh...?

145
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:05,375
[ELEN] That's a pretty dangerous
game you played, Your Highness.

146
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,958
So if he had tried to take
advantage of you...

147
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,250
would you have just left camp

148
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,541
without ever telling
anyone who you are?

149
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,625
[REGIn] Maybe I should have
done things differently.

150
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,500
But that moment in the tent...

151
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:19,458
I couldn't think of a better
way to test your character.

152
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:24,291
I believe your story...
I do... But still...

153
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,250
We need proof that you're
the daughter of the king...

154
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:28,833
So we can convince
the rest of Brune.

155
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,666
I know! Letitia!

159
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,041
Underneath it is
the Holy Grotto,

160
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,958
which can be accessed
through a secret door

161
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,500
that only Royal Family
members can open.

162
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:49,333
Badouin, too. The Prime Minister
also knows about the Grotto.

163
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,541
Let's go... to Artesium.

164
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,958
Thank you for your patience
with this task, your grace.

165
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,250
[THENARDIER] Since you brought
me more than I expected,

166
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,000
it was worth the wait.

167
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:19,541
[roaring] 

168
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,208
[THENARDIER]
What are these chains?

169
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,666
[DREKAVAC] I had them specially
made for the occasion...

170
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,625
You'll be pleased
with the result...

171
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,708
They'll be able to tear apart
the war maidens,

172
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,541
limb-from-limb.

173
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,250
I like that.

174
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,750
Oh... Felix Thenardier...

175
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,375
you've acquired five
new dragons, have you?

176
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,625
That means the forces I've
assembled will be wiped out.

177
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,666
And then there's Tigrevurmud
Vorn to contend with...

178
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,541
Intriguing lad.

179
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,875
Things are moving so
rapidly now it's hard to know

180
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,958
what to make of it all. The
black bow has been located.

181
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,791
While Sir Roland, the wielder
of the sword, Durandal,

182
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,625
has been eliminated for good.

183
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,958
All told, I'd say the
progress is quite good.

184
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,875
The King is a non-threat.
Even if his addled mind

185
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,750
does emerge from its swamp,
the poison will remain.

186
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,041
It's time for me to get moving.

187
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:15,583
Though Vorn will soon come
to Artesium to try to prove

188
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Princess Regin's true identity.
Thenardier is also coming,

189
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,666
of course,
with his dragons,

190
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,666
to prevent that
very thing... Perfect.

191
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,833
I'll leave a parting gift in
Artesium for the winner

192
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,166
of the Vorn-Thenardier
struggle...

193
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,000
Maybe set up something
underground for them to find.

194
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,083
It'll be a fitting end for
whichever one is unlucky enough

195
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,750
to make it that far.

196

[THENARDIER]
Ganelon's army is no more.

202
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,375
[STEED] Yes, but now Vorn's army

203
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,916
appears headed toward his
capital of Artesium.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,500
There are rumors, your grace,
that Princess Regin

205
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,083
is with the Count as well.

206
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:10,541
Interesting... The cave shrine
is located under Artesium...

207
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,750
Dear, Regin. I will bury you
there with Count Vorn.

208
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,708
Wait, me? An emissary?

209
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:21,375
[VIKTOR] It's been six months
since Eleonora started this war.

210
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:25,041
If there's opportunity
to withdraw she should do so.

211
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,666
I'm ordering you to
deliver this message,

212
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,875
because you've gone to
Brune before on my orders.

213
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,583
Do you understand, Sofya?

214
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,541
Yes, my king... I humbly
accept this appointment.

215
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,375
[SOFY] The Zhcted
emissary to Brune...

216
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,833
His Majesty must believe that
the end of the war is near.

217
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,791
[VALENTINA] Well, well, well.
If it isn't sweet Sofya Obertas.

218
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,666
Valentina?

219
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,458
It's been a long time,
indeed... Sofya.

220
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,291
Yeah. You're right about that...
What brings you by?

221
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,250
[VALENTINA] Spending so much
time in my own land

222
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,041
has left me starved
for any information

223
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,958
about the wider world.

224
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:10,416
But having said all that,
I quickly tire of the pace

225
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,708
here in the capital
and royal palace.

226
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,250
[VALENTINA] So, I'm off.

227
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,750
[TOWNSFOLK screaming]

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,166
[REGIN] Burned to the ground?
What are you talking about?!

229
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,833
Ganelon set fire to his capital
before Thenardier could take it.

230
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,500
Now he's gone missing.

231
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,791
[MILA] Is this confirmed?

232
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,875
[LIM] Yes.

233
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,625
[ELEN] Then what's
Thenardier doing?

234
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:43,375
[LIM] Reports say that after
defeating Ganelon's army,

235
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,875
he's continuing slowly north.

236
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,166
Your Highness... none of this
news changes our plans.

237
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,958
We leave now.
We're going to Artesium.

238
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,083
To obtain the proof of
Princess Regin's identity,

239
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,208
the Silver Meteor Storm marches
toward Artesium,

240
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,958
and encounters Thenardier's army
on the Villecresnes Plains.

241
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,250
The Silver Meteor Storm
numbers twenty thousand,

242
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,666
while Thenardier's army consists
of twenty-four thousand.

243
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,583
[SOLDIERS yelling]

244
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,625
[NARRATOR] While the two
central divisions clash.

245
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,458
Elen and Mila work together
leading the Silver Meteor's

246
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,791
right flank against
Thenardier's left.

247
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,250
The War Maidens
break through,

248
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,625
and close in on
the five dragons.

[THENARDIER] The War Maidens
are stronger than we thought.

258
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,541
If those magic girls
finish off my dragons,

259

I want you to surround
and crush them at once!

we risk losing not just this
battle, but the whole war!

[ELEN] It's the chains
on the dragon...

00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,333
They must be enchanted
in some way

285
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,875
to counteract our
own dragon arts.

[LIM] Counteract?

287
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,500
[ELEN] It's like what
we saw with the Black Knight

288
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,625
Roland's sword, Durandal...

289
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,541
There must be a metal
or element out there

290
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,833
that helps to shield
against our magic.

291
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,833
Maybe we can't kill them
with one blow,

292
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,833
but that doesn't mean
magic won't work...

293
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,625
We'll just have to get a little
more creative, won't we?

294
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,291
You're right...

295
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,958
That's that.

296
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,208
Mila and I will find
a way to stop the dragons,

297
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,041
and you take care of
Thenardier's army.

298
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,291
Okay.

299
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,916
[MILA]
Don't be so worried, Tigre.

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,625
You've got two war maidens
working together.

301
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,000
We'll get 'em this time.

302
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,541
My lord. I think it's time
that we talk battle tactics.

303
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,125
[NARRATOR] Four hours later,
the armies face each other

on the battlefield once more.

305
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,666
[THENARDIER] You're saying
that's his central division?

306
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,250
What could Count Vorn
be thinking?

307
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,750
Surely he has access to better
weapons than that,

308
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,375
your grace...
I think this is a trick.

309
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,875
[THENARDIER]
So he wants a messy scrum.

310
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,500
Yes... By appearing weak,
they're hoping to draw us

311
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,958
into a close-range fight...

312
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,500
If they do that,
it would be impossible

313
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,125
to use our dragons
without killing our men.

314
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,583
[THENARDIER] Hmm...

315
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,208
We continue the attack
as planned.

316
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,625
[DRAGONS roaring]

317
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:48,666
[SOLDIERS yelling]

318
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,916
[TIGRE] Fall back, now!

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
[SOLDIERS shouting]

320
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,250
Let's go!

321
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:59,166
Run as fast as you can
to the rendezvous point!

322
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,541
Good luck. This is it.

323
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,000
We'll be fine!

324
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,625
You stay safe, too!

325
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,916
[DRAGONS roar]

326
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,500
Lord Mashas... Godspeed.

327
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,208
Now, Limalisha...
keep an eye on him;

328
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,500
make sure he doesn't
do anything rash.

329
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,916
As you wish, sir.

330
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,583
[BERTRAND]
Carry as many as you can!

331
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,958
The young master plans to block
out the sun with his arrows!

332
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,250
Yes, I know, I know.

333
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:48,541
[NARRATOR] After pretending to
flee, Tigre's central division

334
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,041
re-arms themselves,
splits in two,

335
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:53,333
and turns and attacks
Thenardier's flanks.

336
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,083
This leaves the War Maidens
alone in the center,

337
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,791
to confront the dragons,

338
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,000
Giving the battle lines
arrayed on the plain

339
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,625
a truly unique form.

340
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,375
Slings, fire at will!

341
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,333
[SOLDIERS yelling]

342
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,333
Now soldiers are throwing rocks?

343
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,375
Cowards--

344
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,125
[THENARDIER COMMANDER grunts]

345
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,583
[gasping]

346
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,250
[THENARDIER COMMANDERS grunting]

347
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,750
[SOLDIERS gasping, screaming]

348
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,458
Go! Kill them! Silvrash!

349
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,041
Silvrash!

350
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,916
--Silvrash! Silvrash! Silvrash!
--Silvrash! Silvrash! Silvrash!

351
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,500
[chanting continues]

352
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,625
[DRAGON A roars]

353
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,708
[DRAGON B roars]

354
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,166
[MILA yells]

355
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,041
Eleonora, now!

356
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,125
[MILA yells]

357
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,291
[DRAGON C roars]

358
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,916
[ELEN grunts]

359
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,125
I got him!

360
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,166
[DRAGON C roars]

361
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,625
[MILA] So strong!

362
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,416
[ELEN] Ludmila!

363
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,916
Winds take me high, so I may
fall with great strength...

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,208
Using that old tactic again?

365
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,041
It may be old, but it's our
best shot to kill this thing.

366
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,250
[DRAGONS B &amp; C roar]

367
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,708
Arifal!

368
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,583
Here goes! Shero Zam Kafa!

369
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,083
[roaring]

370
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,791
[ELEN yells]

371
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,458
Mow down air and all!

372
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,750
Now! Ley Admos!

373
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,166
[MILA] Had you wanted, you
could've killed me too,

374
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,458
right then and there.

375
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,958
Now's not the time
for your dark humor.

376
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,208
With the dragons dead,
I think we'll win this battle...

377
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,291
In fact, with Tigre out there,
I know that we will.

378
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,125
[MILA] You're right.

379
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,333
[ELEN] That set all
of this motion.

380
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,708
Listening to Bertrand
led Tigre to rise up.

381
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,375
Episode 12, "Saint-Groel."

382
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,041
Watch what happens next.
