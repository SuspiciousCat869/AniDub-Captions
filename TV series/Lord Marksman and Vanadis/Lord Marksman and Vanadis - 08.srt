1
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,666
Hey, watch it! Be careful
with our weapons!

2
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,125
I'm sorry, sir.

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,708
[GERARD] I'm going to
need your signature on this.

4
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,416
The Navarre knights will be
buried on the west side

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,083
[GERARD] with the
Silver Meteor Storm's fallen

6
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,833
interred on the east
side of the hill.

7
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,166
That sounds fine.

8
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,583
You can do whatever
you want with their effects.

9
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:02,791
[GERARD] Oh, thank you.

10
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,541
[OLIVIER] The armor is from
the Order of Navarre,

11
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,208
so it'll fetch a good price.

12
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,625
Yes. Don't worry,
I'll put it all to good use.

13
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,041
[GERARD] But you're sure
you won't fight alongside

14
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,416
the Silver Meteor Storm?

15
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,791
[OLIVIER] We can't leave
the western border

16
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,500
unguarded for too long.

17
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:20,500
It's time for us to return.

18
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,666
I wish the
Silver Meteor Storm luck.

19
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,250
[ROLAND]
I'll go to the capital.

20
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,833
I'll arrange an audience
for you with His Majesty.

21
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,958
You can't!

22
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:35,125
Lord Mashas almost
got himself killed!

23
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:37,791
[ROLAND grunts]

24
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,625
As a knight of Brune, I must
try to make things right.

25
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,583
[MASHAS grunts]

26
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,083
[MASHAS]
I admire your resolve.

27
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,916
Speaking of which,
what's keeping Elen?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,833
Not sure.

29
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:51,875
A messenger from Legnica
just showed up.

30
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,625
I see.

31
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,541
[ROLAND] I'll come back.

32
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,416
[ELEN] I have to return
to Zhcted for a bit.

33
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,708
[gasps]

34
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,250
[ELEN] There's a good
friend of mine,

35
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,333
a war maiden, in fact,
that I'm indebted to.

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,458
Alexandra Alshavin.

37
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:57,541
But I call her
Sasha for short.

38
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,375
[ELEN] Legnica,
which Sasha governs,

39
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,041
is facing attack
from another war maiden.

40
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,791
And I'm obligated
to come to her defense.

41
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,250
[TIGRE] Obligated?

42
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,208
We swore an oath
to protect each other,

43
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,375
so whenever
either of us is in danger,

44
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,833
[ELEN] the other one
will drop everything,

45
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,416
no matter what,
and come running.

46
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,875
Sasha suffers from
a serious illness.

47
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,916
[ELEN] When I visited her
this past summer,

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,375
she could barely even
walk on her own.

49
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,208
And yet, through it all,

50
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,041
her dragon gear
is always by her side.

51
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:34,250
[ELEN]
And so... And so... I...

52
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,250
[TIGRE] I get it.

53
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,708
[ELEN gasps]

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,291
And while you're away,

55
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,875
I'll do whatever I can
to help here.

56
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,458
[ELEN] Thank you.

57
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,750
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
just as he had promised,

58
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,291
Roland made his way to
Brune's royal capital of Nice.

59
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,458
[ROLAND] I am Roland
of the Order of Navarre.

60
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,916
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with His Majesty

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,041
It's imperative
that I see him right away.

62
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,583
[CHAMBERLAIN 8A]
Please wait in here.

63
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,875
[door shuts, locks]

64
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,458
[ROLAND grunts]

65
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,708
[GANELON] Ah, Roland.

66
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,333
Ganelon? What's this about?

67
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,625
[GANELON] You dare to
show your face in the capital

68
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,958
after failing to
vanquish the traitor?

69
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,166
Such disgrace is
to be roundly punished,

70
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,166
not rewarded by
an audience with the king.

71
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,958
[gasps]

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,375
[GANELON] Thousands of bees
with venom strong enough

73
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:32,083
to kill even a lion
are now filling the room.

74
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,625
You're trapped in
a prison of bees, Roland.

75
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,208
A hellish way to die.

76
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,708
Farewell to you, mightiest
knight in all the land.

77
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,416
[FARON] Roland.

78
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,666
You shall be a knight
among knights.

79
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,166
[ROLAND] Your Majesty.

80
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,458
We'll return soon.

81
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,833
Goodbye for now, Lord Tigre.

82
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,625
I'm sure we'll meet again.

83
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:11,125
Thanks for everything.
You take care.

84
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,500
Elen will back very soon.

85
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,666
It's nothing to worry about.

86
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,083
[clanging]

87
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,375
Sending a woman off
with a smile.

88
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,625
Ah, just one of the perks
of being a man.

89
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,958
[TIGRE chuckles softly]

90
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,000
Why'd you decide
to stay behind?

91
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,583
[RYURIK] Winters in Brune...

92
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,750
They're a lot milder than the
winters back home, Lord Tigre.

93
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,125
Though with my head exposed
to the elements now,

94
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,416
a good chill
may come about easier.

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,291
[TIGRE] Got it.

96
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:44,166
Lady Eleonora left a thousand
Zhcted soldiers behind.

97
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,875
I sincerely hope
our duty shall far exceed

98
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,750
your expectations, My Lord.

99
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,083
We're all quite fond of you.

100
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,666
[MASHAS] Roland is dead.

101
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,958
[gasps]

102
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,166
[MASHAS] Executed.

103
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,208
What the hell?
Did you even stop to think?

104
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,833
Sorry, what is this about?

105
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:03,625
Roland, of course!
Why did you kill him?

106
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,958
Oh.

107
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,083
[GANELON]
Yes, that's Roland for you.

108
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,041
He died standing on his feet.

109
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,708
Magnificent, even in death.

110
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,833
And what about
the western border?

111
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,541
Sachstein and Ahsvarre will
surely take advantage of this!

112
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:23,166
Well not much we can do about
him being dead now, is there?

113
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,000
[GANELON] The western defense
is secure for the time being.

114
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,875
A much more pressing concern
is our southern border.

115
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,708
The army of Muozinel is
rapidly closing in on us

116
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,916
both by land and by sea.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,750
So the question should be,
how safe is your territory?

118
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,541
[THENARDIER] Why, you...

119
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,041
[NARRATOR] The kingdom of
Muozinel is the only

120
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,791
neighboring nation with
a system of slavery in place.

121
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,416
They invade other lands
without provocation,

122
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,666
slaughtering and
plundering at will.

123
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,250
There is no reason
in their choice of targets

124
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,875
and the kingdom of Brune
has always been at a loss

125
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,833
for how to deal with them.

126
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:04,583
[grunts]

127
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,500
[screams]

128
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:10,916
[commotion]

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,791
[NARRATOR] The invading horde
is twenty thousand strong.

130
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,500
Thenardier's response is to
divide his forces in two.

131
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,583
Leading a contingent
of seven thousand,

132
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,750
he plans to concede
the southern province

133
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,541
of Agnes and its lands,

134
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,208
and lure the invading army
deeper into the country,

135
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,416
where he can defeat them
from a superior position.

136
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
[NARRATOR] His remaining
thirteen thousand are sent

137
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,333
to Nice, ostensibly to
protect the capital,

138
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,250
but also to contain
the actions of Ganelon,

139
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,958
who is marshaling troops
in the north.

140
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,541
[THENARDIER]
With Ganelon in check

141
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,041
and the slavers exhausting
themselves in the south,

142
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,708
let's see how the boy
from Alsace will react.

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,875
[TIGRE]
Twenty thousand invaders.

144
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,291
What can I do?

145
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:59,208
Stay here and
reinforce our defenses?

146
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,041
But then...

147
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,833
[ROLAND] I leave Durandal
in your charge.

148
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:08,791
Consider this my recognition
of your cause as a just one.

149
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,041
My cause is just.

150
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:16,333
[TITTA]
Lord Tigre, may I come in?

151
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,208
[TIGRE] Titta? What are you
doing here at this hour?

152
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,625
It's morning already.

153
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,583
I take it you never
went to bed last night?

154
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,625
Guess not.

155
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,916
It's delicious, as always.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,541
You're the commanding
officer here now, Lord Tigre.

157
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,875
That means you really
need to be getting more rest.

158
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,500
Well. Least my wounds healed.
Thanks to you, of course.

159

00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,666
Titta.

161
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,916
Yes?

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,041
I'm going off
on a smaller campaign.

163
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,083
You stay here
with Bertrand, okay?

164
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,541
Uh!

165
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:57,916
But you'll be...
coming back safe, right?

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,750
[TIGRE] I promise.

167
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,791
Do we have any hope
of winning this one?

168
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not sure.

169
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,333
Come on, if you can't
say there's at least

170
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,666
a chance of success,
then how am I supposed to

171
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,500
motivate the rank and file?

172
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,958
We're two thousand.
They're twenty.

173
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,875
If I said we had a shot
at winning, who'd believe me?

174
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,750
Well in my experience,
people will believe

175
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,166
what they want to believe.

176
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,458
So just make us want to.

177
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,291
Huh.

178
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,541
First off...

179
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,375
I'll take a
smaller group of men.

180
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,125
We'll head to Agnes.

181
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,875
They're being slaughtered.

182
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,000
If we don't protect them,
then who will?

183
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,250
Understood. But speaking
of protection,

184
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,875
shouldn't we strengthen
Territoire's defenses, too?

185
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,583
It's a matter of triage.

186
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,666
When twenty thousand
men attack,

187
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,375
would they be able to hold?

188
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,375
It might buy us some time.

189
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,000
At least until
the knights sent by

190
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,708
other noblemen can get there.

191
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,541
Might be enough
to dissuade the enemy

192
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,708
[AUGRE] from attacking
Territoire at all.

193
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,958
But the worst case
is also possible.

194
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,750
You mean no
reinforcements come, right?

195
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,458
I suppose we are
considered traitors

196
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,041
to the throne right now.

197
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,666
No one could fault them
if they chose to

198
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,250
stay out of it
and let us die.

199
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,000
As such, I need to ask
a favor of you both.

200
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,750
[NARRATOR] Turning from
a domestic conflict

201
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,333
between noblemen, Tigre leads
seventeen hundred men

202
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,500
toward the southeast border
to stop a foreign invasion

203
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,291
and prevent
a national crisis.

204
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,958
Lord Tigre. I beg.

205
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,333
[TITTA] Please be safe.

206
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,583
It's not enough
to just drive them away.

207
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,041
We must free those people.

208
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,083
[TIGRE]
Can I use this bow to do it?

209
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:54,791
No. I still haven't mastered
its mysterious power yet.

210
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,208
Shall we take aim?

211
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,000
[TIGRE] Not till tomorrow.
We're just here to scout.

212
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,958
Yes, of course.

213
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,458
So what do you think
of Viscount Augre's son?

214
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,666
If I may ask.

215
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,500
Oh, Gerard?
Good with numbers.

216
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,166
He's very precise.

217
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,875
[TIGRE] In fact, it's thanks
to him that I was able to

218
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,166
focus on fighting during
the battle against Roland.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,208
There's just something
about him I don't like.

220
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,833
It's as though he's
looking down on everyone.

221
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,000
Now, now,
let's try to play nice.

222
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,500
[TIGRE] What's that?

223
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,458
[gasps]

224
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,875
[GIRL] Uh!

225
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:57,291
You all right?

226
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,041
[TIGRE]
No need to be afraid.

227
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,708
I'm Tigrevurmud Vorn.
From Brune.

228
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:14,375
Tigre... vurmud.

229
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,416
[TIGRE] Hey, Ryurik!
Come give me a hand!

230
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:34,500
[GERARD] Each bowman is
allotted fifty-six arrows.

231
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,333
I made sure that twelve
stones were distributed

232
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,791
to each cavalryman
and that the foot soldiers

233
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,250
received five apiece.

234
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,083
However,
for a large-scale battle,

235
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,583
those won't last long.

236
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,916
We need more.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,875
And there's another problem.

238
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,750
Muozinel has captured and
enslaved many of our people.

239
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,833
If they use them
as human shields,

240
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,166
we won't be able to attack.

241
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,916
Understood.

242
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,083
The sun will be up soon.

243
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,750
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F] General,
enemy forces have arrived.

244
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,250
They appear to be
a Brunish army.

245
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,750
How many?

246
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,208
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F] Between
a hundred and two hundred.

247
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,958
All cavalrymen.
They're keeping their distance

248
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,250
while attacking our left flank
with stones and arrows.

249
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,041
Send three thousand
infantrymen to crush them.

250
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,625
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F]
But sir, isn't three thousand

251
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,916
a little excessive?

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,333
Surely five hundred
would be more than enough.

253
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,375
They're merely a decoy.
Hit their main formation.

254
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,958
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F]
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,541
If that's their decoy,

256
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,166
the main force
should be two thousand.

257

[NARRATOR] Under orders from
their supreme commander, Kasim,

[NARRATOR] Passing through
a narrow bottleneck,

262
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,083
they come to a dead end.

00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,250
There, the lead
Muozinellan soldiers

264
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,666
are stunned by what they see.

We can't stop that many

[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8H]
Sir, we can't!

00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,958
We'll be pinned against
our own rear guard!

273
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,708
I'd say our first battle
went surprisingly well.

00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,625
Gather up any weapons
we can still use!

[NARRATOR] Tigre devised
strategy after strategy,

concentrating his efforts
on tripping up the enemy army

277
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,250
and whittling away
at their numbers.

278

After repeated sneak-attacks,
the twenty thousand

were cut down
to nineteen thousand

280

and soon, eighteen thousand.

281

[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F]
Forward march!

293
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
[NARRATOR] That day,
the Muozinellan army

294
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,708
sent out an advance squad
of three thousand,

295
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,250
with the main unit
positioned behind.

296
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,625
Kasim had decided that
the enemy were few in number

297
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,208
and there was no way
that they could fight head-on.

298
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,250
However,
the Silver Meteor Storm

299
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,708
now stood before them
with six hundred soldiers.

300
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,375
Is that all? I thought they
might finally show themselves.

301
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,916
Where's their commander?

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,333
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F]
Perhaps it's that young man

in the center who's stepping
out to the forefront?

304
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:05,000
Never.
Brunishmen despise archery.

305
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,416
There's no way they'd make
a bowman their captain.

306
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,041
Is this another decoy?

00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,125
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8O]
It can't be!

318
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,000
Attack now!

319
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,291
Everybody charge!

320
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,958
[yelling]

321
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,166
Huh. They may have
caught us off guard,

322
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,958
but it looks like there are
only two thousand of them.

323
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,333
Their parlor tricks
won't be enough

324
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,291
to defeat our
advanced squad. Uh!

325
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,083
Much too eager.

326
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,000
He's over three hundred
alsins away.

327
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,375
It'll never--

328
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,333
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8F]
Lord Kasim!

329
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,083
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8P]
Lord Kasim's been shot!

330
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,583
[MUOZINEL SOLDIER 8Q]
How? From where!

331
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,958
Behold! Our leader,
Count Tigrevurmud Vorn,

332
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,791
has single-handedly
taken out their general!

333
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,375
[BRUNE SOLDIERS holler]

334
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,375
[MUOZINEL SOLDIERS yell]

335
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,625
All units follow them!

336
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,500
Hunt down and kill
every last one!

337
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,666
Well, that was a lot
closer than I imagined.

338
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,625
All thanks to
their recklessness.

339
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,083
That's why he put his
main force out in front of him.

340
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,458
I bet he never considered that,

341
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,250
despite their
contempt for bows.

342
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
Somewhere in the Brunish army,

343
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,750
there could possibly be
an archer with enough skill

344
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,458
to hit a target
three hundred alsins away.

345
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:39,750
[TIGRE chuckles]

346
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,833
[GERARD] They're fleeing
back to Muozinel.

347
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,916
Ryurik, can you
handle the pursuit?

348
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,458
[RYURIK] Yes, sir.

349
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:57,500
[murmurs]

350
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:00,875
[MAN 8B] Why didn't you
get here sooner?

351
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,916
Why? Tell me why
you didn't show yourselves

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,833
this morning when
I'm sure you could have!

353
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,500
You must've been nearby.

354
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,000
If you'd only come out then,

355
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,625
well then I wouldn't have
had to lose her!

356
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,583
But you didn't.

357
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,041
[GERARD gasps]

358
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,833
That's not our--

359
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,666
I'm sorry.

[MAN 8B gasps]

00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,833
[YOUNG GIRL 8B] Excuse me.

362
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,625
[YOUNG GIRL 8B] Thank you
so much for saving us.

363
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:43,875
And... also...

364
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:47,500
For avenging my father
who was killed this morning.

365
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:53,166
I'm sorry, but I... well...

366
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,750
I don't think what that man
said before was wrong.

367
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:01,833
But still... Even so, I wanted
to give you my sincere thanks.

[TIGRE] No, it is I
who should be thanking you.

[NARRATOR]
During this battle,

371
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,833
the Muozinellan army lost
over three thousand men.

372
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:26,375
Including casualties
from the day before,

373
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,541
the dead topped five thousand.

374
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:33,541
All told, a quarter of the army
had fallen in the land of Agnes.

375
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,000
[GERARD] After that battle,
we still have

376
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,208
fifteen hundred
and three men alive.

377
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,791
That includes four hundred
sixty-two wounded.

378
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,916
Some more gravely than others.

379
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,416
But considering our situation,
it's a miraculous outcome.

380
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,708
What about the
civilians we rescued?

381
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,666
We'll send them to Territoire
and hope defenses hold.

382
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,583
There's no other way.

383
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,916
[RYURIK] Lord Tigrevurmud.

384
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,583
A word?

385
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,541
Just an advance party?

386
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,000
[RYURIK]
The Muozinellans we captured

387
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,750
all said the same thing.

388
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,166
That they were only
the first wave.

389
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,333
[TIGRE] If those were scouts,
what about the main force?

390
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,583
Their number?

391
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,083
[RYURIK] Thirty thousand.

392
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,958
So many.

393
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:25,458
If they join the soldiers who
managed to get away from us,

394
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,750
then in a matter of
a few days,

395
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,083
forty thousand
will be at our door.

396
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,625
These non-stop battles...
they're wearing out the men.

397
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,208
And we still have to
move those civilians.

398
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,458
I thought I prepared
for the worst.

399
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,000
Even so, we're still not
half as far as we should be.

400
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,500
There's not much we can do
about falling behind.

401
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,791
[SILVER METEOR SOLDIER 8C]
Another Muozinellan unit

402
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,125
is heading this way.

403
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,583
There are three,
maybe four thousand soldiers.

404
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,416
I guess they want to
make their shot count.

405
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,708
Take over here.

406
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,250
Be careful!

407
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,208
[TIGRE] At least we've got
some good archers with us.

408
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,750
[gasps]

409
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,750
We can't even slow
them down... at this rate.

00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,333
[horse neighs]

411
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,375
[TIGRE]
They brought reinforcements?

412
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,666
No. I know those flags.

413
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,041

It's been too long.

417
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,916
Did you miss me,
Count Tigrevurmud Vorn?

418
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,958
[LIM] The best thing
I can do to protect my lady

419
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,625
is to win this battle
as quickly as possible.
