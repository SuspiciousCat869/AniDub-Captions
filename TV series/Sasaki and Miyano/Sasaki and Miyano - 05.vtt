[STUDENTS cheering]

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.019 position:50% align:center
Let's go, Miyano!

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.738 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Hey, Miyano. Way to go!

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.156 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.827 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Well done.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.328 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Kuresawa.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.708 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Thank you for this.
It's pretty hot today.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] I'm surprised
how fast you are

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.961 position:50% align:center
since you're more of
an "indoor" type.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.506 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I wish I was
indoors now. I'm so thirsty.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.343 position:50% align:center
You look dehydrated.
Want me to grab you something?

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
You can pay me back later.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
A sports drink'd be perfect.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.806 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] You got it.
You staying here?

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.059 position:50% align:center
No, I gotta wash my face.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.311 position:50% align:center
Okay then,
I'll find you in a bit.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.396 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sounds good, thanks a lot.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.951 position:50% align:center
Why not grow out your bangs?

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.287 position:50% align:center
You might look a little older
if they weren't so short.

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.206 position:50% align:center
Maybe even less feminine.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.041 position:50% align:center
You really think so?

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.213 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, I grew my bangs out,

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.590 position:50% align:center
and of course,
now they just get in the way.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.092 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That you, Mya?

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you know, it is.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.602 position:50% align:center
You hiding out here
to cool off, too?

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.478 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.522 position:50% align:center
It's crazy hot today.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:47.982 position:50% align:center
At least this spot's
got a nice breeze.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.693 position:50% align:center
So, your event over?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.611 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah. I just finished up.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.031 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Cool, then I guess
we can hang out for a bit.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.241 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You're skipping out?

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.660 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
No, no, no, it's just a break.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
So, what was your event?

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
The 1500-meter run.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.386 position:50% align:center
Yeah? You a strong
runner or something?

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I mean, not when
it comes to sprinting,

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.099 position:50% align:center
but I guess I'm pretty good
at long-distance.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.893 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow. That's impressive.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:51.022 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're
on the same team.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:52.816 position:50% align:center
The, uh, white team.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.735 position:50% align:center
I've never been
called "impressive."

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:56.736 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.617 position:50% align:center
So, which event did you
participate in today?

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
Basket toss--no surprise there.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.746 position:50% align:center
It's, like, required
for tall people.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.206 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:10.542 position:50% align:center
Normally, someone like Hirano
would have to play, too,

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.169 position:50% align:center
but he got in huge trouble
back when we were first-years.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.505 position:50% align:center
Now he's banned from
basket toss altogether.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
Banned from basket toss?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.676 position:50% align:center
What could Hirano
have possibly done?

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.720 position:50% align:center
Yanked his friends'
PE clothes off,

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.388 position:50% align:center
and then made 'em into pouches,

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.140 position:50% align:center
filled 'em with balls,
and tossed 'em.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:27.100 position:50% align:center
Hirano, what were you thinking?

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.769 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Anyway, the other
classes started copying him

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
and things got crazy.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.523 position:50% align:center
It wasn't basket toss anymore.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.442 position:50% align:center
Clothes were
scattered everywhere...

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:36.901 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thank goodness.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.988 position:50% align:center
Things don't seem to be weird
or different between us.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.198 position:50% align:center
"Thank goodness"?

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
So, I read that...

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.534 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why did I think that?

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.161 position:50% align:center
O-Oh? Really?

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
The story was cool.

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
I especially liked
the part where

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.540 position:50% align:center
they were kissing
through a mask.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.208 position:50% align:center
You know, it was kinda sweet.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
Something about that
moment just felt special.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.800 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I like talking to him
even more than I realized.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:03.011 position:50% align:center
That's, huh...

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:04.596 position:50% align:center
It's sorta hard to describe,

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
but even just reading
it alone, it felt...

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:08.975 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] When we met,
I never imagined we'd

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.020 position:50% align:center
sit around talking
about BL together.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.230 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
And I do like it,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.524 position:50% align:center
but whether that
"like" is love...

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.819 position:50% align:center
Oh, wait, is this what moe is?

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:23.073 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Yes!
That's exactly what it is.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.158 position:50% align:center
You're really starting
to get it now!

00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.202 position:50% align:center
I mean, it's a pretty
standard plotline...

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.870 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Now that I think about it,

00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:31.664 position:50% align:center
it seems possible
I misheard him on the train

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
or read too much into it.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
It's not like he's said
anything about liking me

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.672 position:50% align:center
or whatever
since then, so, maybe.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center
Huh, I feel less pressure now,
so that's gotta be a good thing.

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
So, you can see why it's
considered important canon!

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
I've always liked how
the "kisser" gets sick

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
despite the whole mask thing.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.268 position:50% align:center
So then they take turns
taking care of each other!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He couldn't be any cuter.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:58.108 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It's funny when the uke
tries to make soup and fails.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.193 position:50% align:center
Like, why are ukes
so bad at cooking?

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Actually, that could
just be a coincidence,

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.614 position:50% align:center
something that shows up in
the manga I tend to be into.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:07.534 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I really enjoy talking to him.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.536 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] ...seme can't cook,
but the authors...

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I enjoy being with him.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.915 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Aw, but that's
different, that's interesting!

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] When I like a
particular couple in a manga...

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] At the end of the year,
high school's over for me.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.216 position:50% align:center
But I don't want this to end.

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:26.011 position:50% align:center
I want it to go on forever.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.558 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, can I tell you something?

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.018 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
Thing is, Miyano? I like you.

00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:50.660 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:56.541 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What I said in the summer...

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
I'm not taking
that back, it's true.

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
--I, uh--
--[KURESAWA] Miyano?

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
Okay, um...

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.990 position:50% align:center
I, uh, well I, just, um...

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:37.874 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Does all this wavering
mean there's a real chance?

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:43.838 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It's cool. You don't
have to answer right away.

00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:46.841 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy if you gave it
some thought, actually.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.013 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I will! I swear!

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.811 position:50% align:center
Sweet.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.523 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Pretty sure
Kuresawa's looking for ya.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:05.193 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, yeah, right.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.028 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'll see ya later, Mya.

00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That was nerve wracking!

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.006 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, Sasaki.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.842 position:50% align:center
Can I ask you something
real quick before I head out?

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.177 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah, of course. What's up?

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:38.476 position:50% align:center
Can you try to explain
what you like about me so much?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.983 position:50% align:center
Uh-- Wh-What? I, uh...

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:47.986 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Your face.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Ah, okay.
I better get going now.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.368 position:50% align:center
Wait-- Mya, I--!

00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:56.953 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I messed that up!

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.247 position:50% align:center
Oh, there you are.
Are you okay?

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.874 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
U-Uh, yeah.

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:03.752 position:50% align:center
But wait. What were you, uh--

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:06.671 position:50% align:center
Let's talk later. It can wait.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.676 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Here you go.
You owe me 140 yen.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks a lot.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:16.598 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Hm? Guess it's time
for the cavalry battle.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:28.193 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh, Mya, your face
is really attractive...

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.572 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
...but that's not all.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.616 position:50% align:center
It's not just that.

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.495 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Your eyes...

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.165 position:50% align:center
The way you get so excited
when you talk to me.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:45.210 position:50% align:center
The way you look
right at me so intently

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
and remember what I say.

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.172 position:50% align:center
You're a good listener.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.716 position:50% align:center
And then that gift on White Day.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:59.057 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Just, man, Mya, what
you've done for me. Everything.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:04.270 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I like it all. And yet...

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Ugh, dammit.
I got caught off guard.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I really need to learn
how to express myself better.

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.536 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Earth to Sasaki!

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.456 position:50% align:center
Sasaki! Sasaki!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.502 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hm? That's an
interesting outfit.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:31.923 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO sighs] Yeah, I know,
I was put on cheer squad.

00:10:32.007 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
You ready?
The class relay is up next.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:35.927 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:10:37.554 --> 00:10:39.222 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
What's up with you?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.724 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mm...

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.684 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,
I passed by Miyano

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:44.227 position:50% align:center
on my way to get you.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.479 position:50% align:center
What about Mya, huh?

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.233 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what's wrong?

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:51.776 position:50% align:center
Feeling sick or something?

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.195 position:50% align:center
I can sub in for you.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.741 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] The other day,
I borrowed a manga from Miyano.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.327 position:50% align:center
It was about time slips and I
wish those were real right now.

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.539 position:50% align:center
No. If this is about
a BL manga, I'm totally out.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:07.876 position:50% align:center
I listen to Miyano drone on
enough about that, no offense.

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:13.381 position:50% align:center
BL, as in "Boys' Love."
Could it be BL?

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.301 position:50% align:center
I dunno. What do
you think, Hirano?

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.511 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
What are you talking about?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:21.348 position:50% align:center
If you can race,
then you need to hurry up.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:23.725 position:50% align:center
Everyone's waiting on you.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.560 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm comin'.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Man, I wish I were cooler.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.123 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It didn't bother me, at first.

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:49.834 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 5A]
That Miyano. Such a cute face!

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 5B] He almost makes
a better girl than a girl!

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.131 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] But then,
after people made comments

00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:57.467 position:50% align:center
like that over and over again...

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I got sick of it.

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:03.640 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It became a huge insecurity.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.527 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO coughs]

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That was a terrible dream.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.032 position:50% align:center
Must be 'cause I'm sick.

00:12:22.325 --> 00:12:23.785 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
My face.

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Is that what Sasaki
means whenever he calls me cute?

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.505 position:50% align:center
Is it my feminine features?

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I don't want to be a girl.

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
If it were up to me,
I would've chosen

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
to have a more masculine face.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.183 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] And I wish I were
a few inches taller.

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:49.686 position:50% align:center
Then I would be
a lot more confident.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
So that, with Sasaki...

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.607 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO coughs]

00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.365 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Wait, where am I
going with that?

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
He likes my face how?

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
Every time I try to
figure it out, I go in circles!

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I guess maybe...

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.130 position:50% align:center
...the first thing I need to do

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
is understand how
I feel about Sasaki.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:27.015 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Okay, now that we're
back from that long break,

00:13:27.098 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
the Discipline Committee's
going to begin

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:30.185 position:50% align:center
conducting regular
dress code checks

00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.896 position:50% align:center
every morning before
the exam period.

00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:35.940 position:50% align:center
Do any of you guys have
a question about that?

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:38.068 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I do. If a Committee
member is found to be

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
in violation of the dress code,
what happens?

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.448 position:50% align:center
What? Which member?

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Let's just say
that he's blond.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
You mean me?

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.622 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Fortunately,
you can get an exemption

00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
for dyed hair if you
handwrite an apology.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Is it an exemption
if you have to apologize?

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] It'd be super annoying
to dye it before every test.

00:13:58.713 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You dyed it back to black

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
for the closing
ceremony, though.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Yeah, but I was
also going to see family

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.886 position:50% align:center
during the break.

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:09.057 position:50% align:center
Don't want to wreck my hair.
Too much bleach.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.060 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] You know, I've been
curious for a while now.

00:14:12.143 --> 00:14:13.311 position:50% align:center
Why go with blond?

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:15.730 position:50% align:center
Do you have some special reason?

00:14:15.814 --> 00:14:17.232 position:50% align:center
Because it makes me look cool.

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh. Right.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:21.736 position:50% align:center
--[HANZAWA chuckles]
--Quit laughing, Chairman!

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
One time, I tried spray color
to turn it black for one day.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
But it made my hair
all stiff and gross.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
I couldn't get it
to sit right at all.

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
Basically, the only good way
is an actual dye job,

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.749 position:50% align:center
and that costs money every time.

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.460 position:50% align:center
You could always
leave it natural, y'know.

00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.421 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
No way.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:43.049 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Now that you explain
it, it sounds like a huge pain.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:46.553 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Did Sasaki tell you he
dyed his black as a first-year?

00:14:46.636 --> 00:14:47.429 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah.

00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:49.139 position:50% align:center
It was kind of a mess, though.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
When the color started fading,
he looked like a calico cat.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.894 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki as a cat.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
Wow. You don't say.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO chuckles]
Oh, when you get done,

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:01.860 position:50% align:center
can you help me
with these printouts?

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sure.

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:14.914 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
That's unusual.

00:15:18.585 --> 00:15:21.338 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] I'm gonna go hand in
the duty chart real quick.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:22.881 position:50% align:center
All right, thanks.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.845 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Must suck to
wear a mask in this heat.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.143 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh--

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:36.811 position:50% align:center
Shh.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sorry.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.859 position:50% align:center
The teacher sent me on
a mission to fetch you.

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
'Kay, one sec.

00:15:45.862 --> 00:15:46.821 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He's sleeping?

00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:48.948 position:50% align:center
Try not to wake him.

00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:50.742 position:50% align:center
He seems like he's
not feeling well.

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:51.785 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
A cold?

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:55.288 position:50% align:center
Probably. Look,
if you're not busy,

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.833 position:50% align:center
can you stay with him 'til I'm
done talking to the teacher?

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
Yeah, no prob.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:03.046 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] If he wakes up,
tell him to go home.

00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.589 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I will.

00:16:45.046 --> 00:16:49.884 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] If it's through a
mask, would it be okay if I...?

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.763 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] What did he call
this kind of thing?

00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.307 position:50% align:center
A standard plotline?

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.354 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Should I do it?

00:17:04.024 --> 00:17:07.068 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] No, that is not okay
in real life.

00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.307 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What's gotten into me?

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh?

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:44.689 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you were still asleep?

00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:47.609 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh? Sasaki!

00:17:47.692 --> 00:17:50.403 position:50% align:center
Heh. G'morning.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:57.202 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Uh, hey, good morning.

00:17:58.953 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Miyano. The term is almost over.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself.
Just go on home.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:08.129 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hm? Leave early?
Is that really okay?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:10.298 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Yeah, why not?

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] All right.
I'll see you guys later, then.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Bye.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
So, listen, did you make Miyano
uncomfortable somehow?

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.613 position:50% align:center
There's something off with him.
He's acting strange.

00:18:38.618 --> 00:18:40.412 position:50% align:center
I confessed to him.

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:43.998 position:50% align:center
What?

00:18:44.082 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
But I screwed it up.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.751 position:50% align:center
The words were all wrong.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:49.546 position:50% align:center
And now I feel like
he's avoiding me.

00:18:49.629 --> 00:18:51.214 position:50% align:center
Hang on, when you say
you confessed,

00:18:51.297 --> 00:18:52.966 position:50% align:center
do you mean you...?

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.261 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Should he be telling me this?

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:02.559 position:50% align:center
Wait. Don't tell me you
don't have Miyano's number.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:03.935 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, no, I s'pose I don't.

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me?
After all that manga borrowing?

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I dunno. It just
never came up, I guess.

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:11.860 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Hey.

00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:12.944 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:13.862 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
Quit making up excuses
and talk to him.

00:19:23.455 --> 00:19:25.123 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I will.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:26.291 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Good.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] You guys leaving, too?
I'll walk with you partway.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
All right.

00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:38.345 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It's Hirano.

00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:41.056 position:50% align:center
I must've left something
in the classroom.

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.474 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.100 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, Mya.

00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:49.189 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait, Sasaki?

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:58.448 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] My name. I never get
tired of hearing him say it.

00:20:02.577 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I forgot to tell you something

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
when you were here earlier,
so I borrowed Hirano's phone.

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:11.044 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
The truth is...

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.754 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yes?

00:20:12.837 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
Your face isn't the only thing
that I like about you.

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:19.177 position:50% align:center
Anyway, that's it.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.179 position:50% align:center
See you around, okay?

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:24.349 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
Go let Miyano
punch you right now,

00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.312 position:50% align:center
because that was awful.

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center
Or better yet,
you can let me punch you.

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:32.857 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Ah, no way!

00:20:32.941 --> 00:20:35.276 position:50% align:center
Your punch would hurt
a lot more than his would!

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.529 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh, wow.
All the BL in the world

00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.614 position:50% align:center
couldn't have prepared me
for that plot twist!

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.074 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Your ears are all red.

00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Leave me alone!
Go fawn over your girlfriend!

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.578 position:50% align:center
Wanna see a picture of her?

00:20:45.662 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, thanks.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.290 position:50% align:center
Once you get started, you'll
ramble about her for hours!

00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:50.542 position:50% align:center
Actually, I don't
think you've ever

00:20:50.625 --> 00:20:52.544 position:50% align:center
shown me your girlfriend.
Let me see!

00:20:52.627 --> 00:20:54.170 position:50% align:center
Okay. Bow before her.

00:20:54.254 --> 00:20:55.547 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? No.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey! She's beautiful!

00:20:58.008 --> 00:20:59.634 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Fall for her and you're dead.

00:20:59.718 --> 00:21:00.927 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
You're kind of intense

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:03.138 position:50% align:center
when it comes to
your other half.

00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:10.729 position:50% align:center
Miyano might be a pretty boy,

00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
but I think he's totally
masculine-looking

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:14.858 position:50% align:center
if you compare him
side-by-side with a girl!

00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.819 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Wow, that's a great
take, Tashiro. Thanks a lot.

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
You're welcome, buddy.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:24.242 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki likes me
for more than my face.

00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:28.997 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why does that
make me feel relieved?

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.957 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Check out Mr. Melodrama!

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:32.917 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] I'm surprised
you know what that is.

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:34.961 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
'Cause I'm smart, duh.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:36.671 position:50% align:center
Hey, why are you laughing?

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
Miyano thinks I'm smart!
Right, Miyano?

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Fine, you're super
smart. You're a genius.

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I don't get it.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.888 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Wait, are you messing with me?

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:46.431 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why?

00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:25.697 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
I told you not to touch him.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.492 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] And I have not,
for the most part.

00:23:29.576 --> 00:23:31.286 position:50% align:center
Is it serious?

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.538 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:36.416 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Actually, you know what?

00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:38.668 position:50% align:center
I can't have this
conversation with you.

00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:41.963 position:50% align:center
Talking about your crushes
is way too awkward!

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:44.174 position:50% align:center
Well, how do you think I feel?
