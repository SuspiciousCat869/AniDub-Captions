00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.972 position:50% align:center
That was fun.
I'm really glad we came.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.310 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.604 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I like him.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.065 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure what that means.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.901 position:50% align:center
I just know I always
feel at ease around him

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.820 position:50% align:center
and he makes me happy.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.824 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wow. My heart is racing.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
If I kissed him or something,

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
I have no guarantee that
things would work out.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.671 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
But still, I think--

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If these feelings
aren't love, then what is?

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:01.394 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki, I like him
so much it's hard to breathe.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.355 position:50% align:center
When he's around...

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:06.149 position:50% align:center
When you're around,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.277 position:50% align:center
these feelings just
suddenly come over me.

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:11.863 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:12.697 position:50% align:center
So, Mya, I was wondering...

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.741 position:50% align:center
Um, hey, Sasaki--

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:17.577 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, my bad.
What were you about to say?

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.788 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I-It's nothing, really.

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:27.087 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Was I seriously
about to say that?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.256 position:50% align:center
Out loud, with all
these people around?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.301 position:50% align:center
I have no clue
how to tell him what I feel.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.053 position:50% align:center
I'm not brave.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.349 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] When do I say it?
What do I say, for that matter?

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.600 position:50% align:center
You feel okay?

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:42.060 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I'm so lost.
I have no idea how to do this!

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.823 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Let's go and
grab a drink somewhere.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:21.826 position:50% align:center
We can talk about the film
and chill for a sec.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.244 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE]
You know me.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.914 position:50% align:center
I got up there and I just
couldn't make a decision.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.334 position:50% align:center
Hey, are you okay?
You don't look so good.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.336 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] I'm facing a truth
that's been hinted at

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.755 position:50% align:center
for a while but
previously unconfirmed.

00:03:33.838 --> 00:03:35.715 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] Oh yikes,
is it something bad?

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.050 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
No, not bad,

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.011 position:50% align:center
more like it's something
that can't be changed.

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:41.596 position:50% align:center
It's just got me thinking.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.307 position:50% align:center
Oh, did I ask for orange juice?

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.017 position:50% align:center
[KAEDE] I couldn't decide
which one I wanted,

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.811 position:50% align:center
so I just got 'em both.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:48.812 position:50% align:center
Split 'em with me?

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]
Of course.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.112 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] A classmate
I have no reason not to like

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.156 position:50% align:center
and an underclassman
I'm actually quite fond of.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.993 position:50% align:center
You might wanna
give up on grandkids.

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.454 position:50% align:center
'Cause it turns out I like guys.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.544 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Two guys together. Huh.

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.929 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Ever since
I realized I like him...

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mya. Good mornin'.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.894 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
He just gets cuter and cuter.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:33.481 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.651 position:50% align:center
Oh, you startled me,
would you like to sit?

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.903 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mm-mm. Nah, I'm fine.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.156 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hold on, what am I doing?

00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:43.992 position:50% align:center
Guys don't necessarily like
being thought of as cute.

00:04:44.075 --> 00:04:45.243 position:50% align:center
I should know.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:46.661 position:50% align:center
That's exactly the kind
of thing that made me

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:50.248 position:50% align:center
so uncomfortable to hear
back in middle school.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.125 position:50% align:center
Sasaki's so cool.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.294 position:50% align:center
He doesn't shy away
from being spontaneous

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:56.463 position:50% align:center
and I'm more of
the cautious type.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:57.672 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, here.

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.591 position:50% align:center
It was easy to read,
so I flew through it.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.259 position:50% align:center
Might make a novel
reader of me yet.

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, that was so quick.
Well, what'd you think?

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.555 position:50% align:center
If it weren't for
that night scene,

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.307 position:50% align:center
I would've forgotten it was BL.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.267 position:50% align:center
Kind of different from
what I'm used to lately.

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.978 position:50% align:center
Yeah, there was only
a little bit of that at the end.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:15.398 position:50% align:center
Yep. I was stoked to
see it in live action.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
I thought the story
was super believable.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center
Another BL all-nighter?
Why're you so sleepy eyed?

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
Uh, no. I'm fine, really.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.703 position:50% align:center
And, hey, I'm glad to hear
you enjoyed it so much.

00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:32.123 position:50% align:center
Well. Thanks for
lending it to me.

00:05:32.207 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Even though
all these people are here,

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:37.545 position:50% align:center
I feel like I might just
come out and say it.

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:44.052 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I want to, but I keep
missing my chance to tell him.

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
It's so hard to find
time alone together.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
We're in different
classes and grades,

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.684 position:50% align:center
and we're not on
the same committee.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
It's not like we're alone
on our commute every day.

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
But really, it's my fault
I stalled for so long

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:59.442 position:50% align:center
that I don't know how I'm
supposed to bring it up now!

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
I'll tell him
the next time I see him.

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.822 position:50% align:center
Whatcha doin' there, Kuresawa?

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:04.989 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Deciding how to categorize

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.033 position:50% align:center
whatever Miyano emotion this is.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.410 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Should I ask him to come out

00:06:08.493 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
behind the school with me

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.372 position:50% align:center
and say I want to
talk to him privately?

00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:14.457 position:50% align:center
Nah, that sounds kinda weird.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
Hey, that reminds me.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.919 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.381 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] About Sasaki and
the bakery I saw him working at.

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:22.716 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
Ooh, a bakery! Is it any good?

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:27.012 position:50% align:center
Well, I never
actually went to it,

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.556 position:50% align:center
I just pass it on the way
to see my girlfriend.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.724 position:50% align:center
I should check it out.

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:32.100 position:50% align:center
Let's all go!

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:34.227 position:50% align:center
You won't be seeing
my girlfriend.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.104 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Hey, I'm only
after the bread, yo!

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.605 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.027 position:50% align:center
All right, kiddos!

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.571 position:50% align:center
Christmas is almost upon us,
in all its glory.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
So, listen up!

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:46.781 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Huh?

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.242 position:50% align:center
Here's the deal!

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.535 position:50% align:center
I'm planning on
throwing our first

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.163 position:50% align:center
big holiday party
on Christmas day!

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.748 position:50% align:center
I've got a girlfriend, so pass.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.207 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA]
Oh, come on!

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center
You're so dedicated.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.502 position:50% align:center
All right then, fine.

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
Raise your hand
if you're not single,

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
and then feel free
to excuse yourselves.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.761 position:50% align:center
Oh! For real? So many of you!

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
Where are you meeting
all these girls?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.056 position:50% align:center
What are you doing that I'm not?

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.895 position:50% align:center
Huh? What are you looking at?

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.271 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA]
Hold it right there.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:19.898 position:50% align:center
What was that long
pause for then, huh?

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:20.940 position:50% align:center
You?

00:07:21.024 --> 00:07:22.025 position:50% align:center
I plan to have a girlfriend

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.110 position:50% align:center
by the time
Christmas rolls around.

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
Any couples that get together

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
just in time for Christmas
break up immediately,

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.616 position:50% align:center
so, yeah, you can
drop that idea.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.700 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.079 position:50% align:center
Even if it's only a
temporary thing, I don't care.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.164 position:50% align:center
I just don't want to be
alone on the day of.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:37.665 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA]
You won't be alone, though!

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.417 position:50% align:center
We'll all be together!

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.627 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAHAMA]
That's not the same.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.462 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If getting together
before Christmas

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
means you break up,

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:46.174 position:50% align:center
then this could be
the worst possible timing

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center
to tell him how I feel.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.760 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] I dunno,
but at least it's better than...

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I don't want to
risk messing it all up.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Miyano, raise your hand.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.891 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.687 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA] You're on the
list too, Miyano? Noted.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.607 position:50% align:center
Really, all of you?
Dammit, guys!

00:08:02.691 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center
So, care to explain?

00:08:04.234 --> 00:08:06.861 position:50% align:center
Just put it down in
your calendar regardless.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.530 position:50% align:center
You can still go if you want,

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.782 position:50% align:center
but this way all your
bases are covered.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:11.950 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I guess.

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA]
That's too many traitors!

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
Some of you are lying!

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.498 position:50% align:center
[gasps] That's cool, but...

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
Tashiro's face is
actually scaring me.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
Don't do this, man!
Don't you be like Kuresawa!

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.839 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Calm down, Tashiro,

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.258 position:50% align:center
he's just trying to
keep his options open.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.176 position:50% align:center
Otakus have a lot going on.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.137 position:50% align:center
Oh, dude, is that all this is?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.432 position:50% align:center
I totally assumed he was finally
dating Sasaki or something.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:39.310 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO coughing]

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
Jeez, Tashiro, you really
aren't fazed at all, are you?

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
By what?

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:44.816 position:50% align:center
Oh, forget about it.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
You're a good guy.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:48.611 position:50% align:center
Yeah, glad you finally noticed!

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.450 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Okay, so, since we won't

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
see each other
during winter break,

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:57.954 position:50% align:center
that means I'd have
to ask him out.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:01.541 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, Mya. Good morning?

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:03.460 position:50% align:center
Good enough so far.

00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.754 position:50% align:center
You're taking the early
train a lot lately.

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:07.422 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Entrance exams are coming up,

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.799 position:50% align:center
so there's always
prep in the morning

00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
and we have these
quizzes every day.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.137 position:50% align:center
You'd think the teachers
would be tired of it, too.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.805 position:50% align:center
It wouldn't hurt to just
let us play cards

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
and fool around for a day.

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:20.185 position:50% align:center
Must be tough to be
in charge of us hooligans.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.519 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't that hurt
your chances of

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:24.314 position:50% align:center
academic success
in the long run?

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.691 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] The school is holding
some special winter classes

00:09:26.775 --> 00:09:28.318 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely be going to,

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.278 position:50% align:center
but Hirano said
he won't be there.

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:31.363 position:50% align:center
He's going home.

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:33.656 position:50% align:center
Gonna take
a private course instead.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.493 position:50% align:center
Man, I wish I had
some of his ambition.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.828 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, I guess
I'm just grumbling.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.081 position:50% align:center
It's fine with me
if you need to grumble.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
So, when are the exams?

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:44.167 position:50% align:center
In January.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.461 position:50% align:center
So, have you decided
on a college yet?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:47.921 position:50% align:center
Oh no, not yet.

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.006 position:50% align:center
The teacher told me I should
do some more research

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.217 position:50% align:center
before I made
any kind of decision.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.386 position:50% align:center
Well, If you do get
into your target school,

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
you wanna celebrate?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.931 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sounds like fun,
but we can't just skip over you.

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.516 position:50% align:center
I guess you're right.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
So you'll celebrate with me?

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.018 position:50% align:center
That is, if I get in.

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.061 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.897 position:50% align:center
Now that'll
motivate us! [giggles]

00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:10.985 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
"Can I see you on Christmas?"

00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:14.489 position:50% align:center
I can't ask that of him.
It would interrupt his studying,

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:17.242 position:50% align:center
which he clearly needs
to concentrate on.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:22.247 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] He's been incredibly
kind and patient with me,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
so, I'm not going to be selfish

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.292 position:50% align:center
and take the focus
off his future right now.

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm behind you.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:31.381 position:50% align:center
Not that I can help you
all that much with your exams.

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:34.134 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Ha, well. Thanks a lot.

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:37.137 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Was it like this
for him or am I weird?

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.931 position:50% align:center
I guess he is
a year older than me.

00:10:40.015 --> 00:10:42.642 position:50% align:center
But it's surprisingly
complicated.

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:46.146 position:50% align:center
I don't know how
to explain this.

00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:47.814 position:50% align:center
So, Mya, I was wondering.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.691 position:50% align:center
Do you have any plans
on the 25th, yet?

00:10:49.774 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
What?

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.652 position:50% align:center
There's like this
really cool exhibit

00:10:52.736 --> 00:10:54.446 position:50% align:center
for the movie we just saw.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:56.031 position:50% align:center
They're displaying
art from the novel

00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
and behind the scenes stuff from
the film, that kind of thing.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.952 position:50% align:center
It looks awesome.
Where was it at?

00:11:01.036 --> 00:11:03.121 position:50% align:center
Somewhere close to the theater.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.998 position:50% align:center
If you're free that day,
do ya wanna go?

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
Sure, but... don't you need
to study for the exams?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.128 position:50% align:center
I gotta take a break sometime.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:11.921 position:50% align:center
It's just an exhibit.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.007 position:50% align:center
It'd be sweet if
you came with me.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
Then I'd love to go.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Found it.

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
Here, you check it out, too.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.517 position:50% align:center
Do we need reservations?

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:25.935 position:50% align:center
Don't think so.

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:28.438 position:50% align:center
Looks like we're good
if it's only for the exhibit.

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] That reminds me--the
band that did the theme song.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:33.777 position:50% align:center
I've got a CD of theirs at home.
Different songs on it.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.571 position:50% align:center
Huh? So you know their music?

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.823 position:50% align:center
I really liked that theme song.

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:40.283 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Well, do ya wanna borrow it?

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's a good thing
we're on the train.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.080 position:50% align:center
Nah. I'll bring it next time.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I can't wait, thanks.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.086 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If we were alone,
I don't think I could hold back.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.255 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Miyano!

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:56.216 position:50% align:center
Hey, Chairman!

00:11:56.299 --> 00:11:58.885 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I guess I should
say Hanzawa now.

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.512 position:50% align:center
It's been quite a while, huh?

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.890 position:50% align:center
I don't think we've spoken
since the cultural festival.

00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:06.184 position:50% align:center
Hey, I talked to the clerk.

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
He says to hang tight for
about ten more minutes.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.023 position:50% align:center
Brother. This is Miyano.

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.151 position:50% align:center
Hi, It's nice to meet you.

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.486 position:50% align:center
Our parents sent
the two of us out

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
to get more stuff for
our Christmas celebration.

00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:21.908 position:50% align:center
Thoughtless of them.
I have a ton of studying to do.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.576 position:50% align:center
Yeah right, you obviously
wanted to find

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.497 position:50% align:center
an excuse to sneak in more time
with your friends, baby bro.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.918 position:50% align:center
Did you forget we're
in public, Big Brother?

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:33.420 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:35.296 position:50% align:center
Baby.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.340 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
See? Now I'm branded.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:39.342 position:50% align:center
Miyano, your assignment
over the break

00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
is to forget
all about this. Easy A.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.390 position:50% align:center
Not a problem.
I'm forgetful by nature.

00:12:45.473 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] That supposed to be
reassuring? 'Cause it's not.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.978 position:50% align:center
Wait, are you...
Masato's boyfriend?

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
What?

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.522 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
He's not my boyfriend.

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:54.441 position:50% align:center
I swear you're unsocialized.

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.694 position:50% align:center
Don't blame me.
You just look so happy.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.821 position:50% align:center
Anyway, get this.
Back in middle school, Masato--

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.990 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Stop it!

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.366 position:50% align:center
Do you know how annoying it is

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
that you try to connect
everything back to romance?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.000 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
My bad.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.711 position:50% align:center
The clerk might be ready now.
I'll go check.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:17.589 position:50% align:center
Brilliant. So, uh...

00:13:17.672 --> 00:13:20.383 position:50% align:center
Well, that was incredibly
awkward. I'm sorry.

00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.468 position:50% align:center
He's totally obsessed with

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:23.928 position:50% align:center
shipping everyone
and everything.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:27.682 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I seem to remember you
talking about that a lot, too.

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:31.227 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] You know,
I actually ran into Sasaki

00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:33.688 position:50% align:center
and his older sister
when I was out one time.

00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:35.482 position:50% align:center
They seemed really close.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.151 position:50% align:center
I'm an only child,
so I don't have siblings.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.153 position:50% align:center
It's kinda fun to see.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize that you're
a baby brother, as well.

00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.703 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] What exactly
do you mean by that, Miyano?

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:51.373 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Stop! My head
is off-limits today.

00:13:54.376 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
You can't let just anybody

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:57.420 position:50% align:center
touch that head of yours.

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.254 position:50% align:center
I get it.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:13:59.756 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.341 position:50% align:center
If I recall correctly,

00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:04.260 position:50% align:center
your little head has always been
at the perfect patting height,

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.137 position:50% align:center
but you have
gotten taller lately.

00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:08.431 position:50% align:center
Last year you barely
came up to my waist.

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
You're being
completely ridiculous!

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.686 position:50% align:center
You five foot seven inches yet?

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:14.813 position:50% align:center
I'm still waiting
on a big growth spurt.

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.065 position:50% align:center
You could shoot up
before the end of high school.

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.692 position:50% align:center
You think that's possible?

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.944 position:50% align:center
Oh, I almost forgot
about the time.

00:14:21.027 --> 00:14:23.697 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I probably
need to head out.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.698 position:50% align:center
Good to see you.

00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
Same. Toodles!

00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
He left?

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:31.121 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
Um. Hey. I'm sorry 'bout that.

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.041 position:50% align:center
Which part?

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:36.459 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
I hadn't seen you that happy

00:14:36.543 --> 00:14:39.295 position:50% align:center
in a while, so I couldn't
resist teasing you a bit.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.672 position:50% align:center
Forgiven.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.633 position:50% align:center
But the guy you met
already has somebody special.

00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.635 position:50% align:center
Let's not drag him into it.

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:48.847 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll lay off then.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.432 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Is there anything else we need?

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
Just the chicken.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.396 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
So, let me get this straight,

00:14:56.479 --> 00:14:58.523 position:50% align:center
you don't have
any feelings for him?

00:14:58.606 --> 00:14:59.774 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
That's real thin ice.

00:14:59.858 --> 00:15:02.152 position:50% align:center
Okay, easy.

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:04.904 position:50% align:center
It's just, I know
you're close to people,

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
but you never seem to date them.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:09.743 position:50% align:center
Hard not to wonder
if it's because of us.

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:14.080 position:50% align:center
I can talk to Mom and Dad
if you think that'd help.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Am I to assume
you're operating under

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:19.586 position:50% align:center
the assumption I like men?

00:15:19.669 --> 00:15:21.004 position:50% align:center
Wait, you don't?

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Surprise! I'm very
attracted to the ladies.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:25.467 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
Then what's the deal?

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.385 position:50% align:center
You hang out with
plenty of girls,

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:28.970 position:50% align:center
but you don't wanna date them?

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:31.973 position:50% align:center
Right now, I'm more focused on
spending time with my friends.

00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:33.975 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
I had a phase like that, too.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.977 position:50% align:center
So, I can totally relate.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.438 position:50% align:center
That's cool. It makes sense.

00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:42.317 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] I should apologize
for being harsh.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.943 position:50% align:center
What?

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.570 position:50% align:center
You know I don't think
there's anything wrong

00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:47.614 position:50% align:center
with who you love, right?

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.535 position:50% align:center
I know, and I'm glad
you're my baby brother.

00:15:54.287 --> 00:15:55.497 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
Hey, Mom.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.374 position:50% align:center
Might wanna
give up on grandkids.

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
Because I like guys.

00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S YOUNGER SISTER gasps]

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
Wait, did you really
just do a "come out"

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:02.629 position:50% align:center
here at the dinner table?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S YOUNGER BROTHER]
Whoa. You're gay?

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
Me, too! Me, too! I think.

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.219 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
Nice, welcome to the club.

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
Well, then what about you?

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.972 position:50% align:center
Um, I like girls.

00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:14.933 position:50% align:center
So, I guess I'm
the odd brother out.

00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
Phew, that's good.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.311 position:50% align:center
Masato will give me
grandchildren,

00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center
so I don't have to worry.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.523 position:50% align:center
You can both go be happy.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
Yay! You win mom of the year!

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S MOM] Okay,
now finish eating your dinner!

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.863 position:50% align:center
[chattering]

00:16:28.947 --> 00:16:31.616 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Why did Mom
sound so relieved?

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.747 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
You don't need to worry, Mom.

00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:39.541 position:50% align:center
About any of us.

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.752 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
I was thrown off at first,

00:16:42.836 --> 00:16:45.672 position:50% align:center
but maybe I shouldn't have been.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:48.800 position:50% align:center
They've always looked
so excited to see each other.

00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.680 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] It makes me believe
my brothers will find happiness.

00:16:53.763 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA'S OLDER BROTHER]
I'll have to find someone

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
who passes your test then.
I like a challenge.

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Just like the two of them have.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Oh, Miyano, good morning!

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:26.671 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Morning!

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.131 position:50% align:center
Are you heading off somewhere?

00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:29.924 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Over to the seniors' wing.

00:17:30.008 --> 00:17:32.302 position:50% align:center
I heard they have an
important test or something.

00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.303 position:50% align:center
Didn't know that.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki, do you have a minute?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.061 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 11A]
Sasaki, the teacher wants you.

00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:44.230 position:50% align:center
I have the worst timing.
Sorry, I'll come back later.

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:45.398 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, um...

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Miyano.

--[MIYANO] Sasa--
--[STUDENT 11B] Sasaki!

Sorry, Mya,

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.168 position:50% align:center
--guess it'll have to wait.
--[MIYANO] Fine.

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:07.045 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Come on, let's go already.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I may never get him alone.

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:15.970 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mya, let's leave together today.

00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:18.431 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh? Okay.

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
Uh, also, I need to talk to you
about something important.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:25.355 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh? Uh.
Can it wait until after school?

00:18:25.438 --> 00:18:26.981 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Catch you then.

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.361 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's the new year,
which means we're

00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:33.405 position:50% align:center
past the Christmas
breakup window.

00:18:33.488 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
So, that's a giant relief.

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
Maybe today I should just
get off at Sasaki's station.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
Then I can take him aside
to an empty alley

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.705 position:50% align:center
and tell him how I feel.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
No, that's a really
cheesy idea.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:45.417 position:50% align:center
It feels like I ripped it
straight out of

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
the pages of a BL novel.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:49.587 position:50% align:center
I'll go home
immediately afterwards,

00:18:49.671 --> 00:18:52.590 position:50% align:center
so I don't end up distracting
him from his studies.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:19:00.765 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Today. I tell him.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.601 position:50% align:center
Ready for ya!

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:06.646 position:50% align:center
Great! Hey, thanks for
letting me borrow this CD.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.189 position:50% align:center
Already done with it?

00:19:08.273 --> 00:19:11.067 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I did have it for
the entire winter break, so.

00:19:11.151 --> 00:19:12.277 position:50% align:center
I'm honestly
pretty surprised that

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
this band decided to do
a BL theme song.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.657 position:50% align:center
Their other music is so
different and less "lovey."

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:20.577 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yeah. I didn't
expect that either.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.913 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I actually liked
a lot of the songs.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
My mom even knew one.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:27.208 position:50% align:center
That's so cool.

00:19:27.292 --> 00:19:30.253 position:50% align:center
I love introducing you to bands
that you haven't heard before.

00:19:30.337 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
Um. Right.

00:19:32.797 --> 00:19:35.175 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] He always says
exactly what he means.

00:19:35.258 --> 00:19:38.887 position:50% align:center
It's so attractive.
I want to be that way, too.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
That reminds me, I noticed,

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
you always move your bag
to the other shoulder.

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:49.731 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.441 position:50% align:center
Any reason?

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.280 position:50% align:center
Oh, I guess it's, well, um...

00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.866 position:50% align:center
'Cause, you know.

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:02.660 position:50% align:center
When we're walking,

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:05.372 position:50% align:center
I worry about my bag
bumping into you.

00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.503 position:50% align:center
So, that's why?

00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.505 position:50% align:center
You're so conscientious,
it's too cute.

00:20:13.588 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Could you please
forget I said that?

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.342 position:50% align:center
Do you do that for everyone?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:18.635 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Of course not!

00:20:18.718 --> 00:20:21.054 position:50% align:center
I don't usually walk
next to people, anyway.

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center
And you always walk
to the left of me,

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:25.975 position:50% align:center
so now it's a become an
unconscious habit, I guess.

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.227 position:50% align:center
[laughs] I never realized...

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
How long?

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
This whole time.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.367 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 11B]
There you are, Miyano!

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.910 position:50% align:center
The chairman was
looking for you.

00:20:43.993 --> 00:20:45.245 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:47.831 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, I mean the
new chairman, not Hanzawa.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center
We'll be waiting for you, okay?

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why today of all days?

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:58.717 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I never noticed...
how aware of me he is.

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:03.054 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Sasaki. I should go.

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.641 position:50% align:center
But would you mind waiting
by the entrance? Please...

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I like him so much.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.401 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I have all these feelings.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.903 position:50% align:center
I don't know
what to do with them.

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.327 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:30.165 position:50% align:center
Uh--I don't know
what to--um, I, uh...

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.714 position:50% align:center
I mean, uh. It's fine.

00:21:37.797 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:42.886 position:50% align:center
you don't have to
come to class now.

Can't. I'm broke right now.

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center

how about sushi?

put it that way.

00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:59.444 position:50% align:center

I'm still here at school,

00:21:59.527 --> 00:22:06.242 position:50% align:center
