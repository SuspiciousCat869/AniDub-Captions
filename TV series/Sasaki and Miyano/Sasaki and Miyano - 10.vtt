00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.430 position:50% align:center
Yeah, what do ya want?

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.348 position:50% align:center
You're really
committing to this.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:16.641 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] We gotta be
rough around the edges,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.727 position:50% align:center
to go with the delinquent
theme and all,

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.146 position:50% align:center
but don't worry, it's still
a pretty chill place.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.772 position:50% align:center
You're always
a little mean, though.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.524 position:50% align:center
Shut your trap, Sasaki.

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.360 position:50% align:center
Now get up and start
taking orders, already!

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.029 position:50% align:center
So, what can I get for you?

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
Oh, I'd just like
a coffee, please.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.033 position:50% align:center
Nothing to eat?

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.035 position:50% align:center
No, I have lunch
plans after this.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.954 position:50% align:center
Cool. Gimme a sec.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:40.623 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] This is an interesting
concept for a cafÃ©.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.002 position:50% align:center
Not a lot of delinquents in
the customer service sector.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.339 position:50% align:center
I wonder if the fortune-teller's
in character, too?

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.840 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Here's your coffee, punk.

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:53.303 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I appreciate I--
[gasps] Yikes!

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.137 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
I'm back.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
That was quick.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.432 position:50% align:center
What did you ask
the fortune-teller about?

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
Oh, I've kinda been torn between

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.479 position:50% align:center
the sexy pop idol
and the sexy manager.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:05.732 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure which one of them
would be a better purchase.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.735 position:50% align:center
He told me to pick the one
I felt a closer connection to,

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.403 position:50% align:center
and the pop idol is
closer to me in age,

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:12.447 position:50% align:center
so I think I'll
go with that one.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
I'm starting to think
you're a fudanshi, too.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.912 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] No. I'm just an
extremely dedicated boyfriend.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.963 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Good to see you, old friend.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.757 position:50% align:center
Do you like my getup?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.175 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it looks great.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
It doesn't exactly go with

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
the cafe's delinquent
theme, though.

00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.512 position:50% align:center
Well, I tried to do that,

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.431 position:50% align:center
but I was told it would
scare off the customers,

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.350 position:50% align:center
so I had to change.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.727 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I'd ask, but I'm
not sure I want to know.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.772 position:50% align:center
I always thought I had
such a friendly face.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.150 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] That mask is making him
look anything but friendly.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center
Now, Miyano.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:15.070 position:50% align:center
Tell me about a problem
you're struggling with,

00:03:15.153 --> 00:03:17.822 position:50% align:center
and I'll use the tarot
to help you solve it.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.283 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Is the crystal ball
just for looks?

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.701 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] We even
designed this custom deck

00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:23.161 position:50% align:center
to fit the delinquent theme!

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:24.954 position:50% align:center
No detail is too small!

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.374 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] They really
thought of everything!

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.418 position:50% align:center
Has anything been weighing
on your mind recently?

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.421 position:50% align:center
Like, for instance, how to
land a date with your crush?

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:34.964 position:50% align:center
Or where you should
go on said date

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.883 position:50% align:center
to confess your
undying devotion?

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:37.967 position:50% align:center
Perhaps you'd like to know

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.302 position:50% align:center
how your sweetheart
feels about you?

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:41.554 position:50% align:center
The more specific
you are, the better.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.057 position:50% align:center
Is it me, or do all those things
have to do with love?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
Such are the dilemmas
of our youth.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.436 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.771 position:50% align:center
Aw, don't be shy!

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:51.773 position:50% align:center
Pretend I'm a random
fortune teller on the street

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.900 position:50% align:center
and tell me your deepest,
darkest secrets.

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:55.568 position:50% align:center
You'll feel better!

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.445 position:50% align:center
Will I, though?

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.197 position:50% align:center
All right, here's my problem.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.573 position:50% align:center
Let's say you have
these feelings,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center
but you're kind of unsure
what they mean.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.829 position:50% align:center
How do you find confidence
in what you feel?

00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.789 position:50% align:center
Confidence, you say?

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:10.834 position:50% align:center
--Go on and shuffle the cards.
--Okay.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.836 position:50% align:center
Now shuffle the other way,
and while you do,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.881 position:50% align:center
I want you to concentrate on
your desire for confidence.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:20.468 position:50% align:center
Good. Now, pick up
whatever card calls out to you.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:21.928 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here goes.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.476 position:50% align:center
This card can be read
to mean persistence.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.645 position:50% align:center
Persistence, huh?

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.439 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Perhaps you've been
trying out some new things

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.150 position:50% align:center
lately in order to bolster
your confidence?

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.237 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Does that resonate with you?

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] The thing is,
I do lack confidence,

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.078 position:50% align:center
but I'm more afraid of
proceeding anyway

00:04:47.162 --> 00:04:49.664 position:50% align:center
and then finding out
I was wrong.

00:04:49.748 --> 00:04:53.126 position:50% align:center
[laughs] You're an
earnest person.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.711 position:50% align:center
Perhaps after I've graduated,

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.464 position:50% align:center
you'd be a good replacement as
Disciplinary Committee Chairman.

00:04:57.547 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
No thanks, I'll pass.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.009 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]
That was fast.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
It seems like you're able to

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.221 position:50% align:center
express your feelings
in other areas.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.683 position:50% align:center
So, if this is the thing
you're struggling with,

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
tthen there's
a chance it's because

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.436 position:50% align:center
you've begun to
look at the world

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.105 position:50% align:center
differently than
you ever have before.

00:05:15.774 --> 00:05:17.859 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] And to me,
that demonstrates just how

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.862 position:50% align:center
important this particular
issue is to you.

00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.991 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] So, I think
it's perfectly natural for

00:05:25.075 --> 00:05:27.494 position:50% align:center
your confidence
to be a bit shaken.

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.204 position:50% align:center
But the finish line is close.

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:32.248 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you can see it just
ahead of you, can't you?

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
So, don't give up.

00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.046 position:50% align:center
Keep on moving forward, okay?

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
I will!

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:43.009 position:50% align:center
That's it for now.
I hope it was helpful to you.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks a lot, Chairman.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.894 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
In terms of romance, it means...

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
...a love that slowly
blossoms over time.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.359 position:50% align:center
Ooh, poetic!

00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:04.197 position:50% align:center
I hope it all
works out for Miyano,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
but it's a two-way street.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:10.203 position:50% align:center
Now then, I probably need to
decide what I'm going to do.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Accept my
big brother's situation?

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.712 position:50% align:center
[sighs]

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.590 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
All right.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.218 position:50% align:center
--Thanks, that was awesome.
--See ya later, Hirano.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.137 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Yeah, beat it!

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.097 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
You said you had plans, right?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.473 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah.

00:06:30.557 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] 'Kay, see you
at the competition, then.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Sasaki. Your shift is over.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
Seems kind of early.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.565 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Just go and get changed.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
Right. I'm finishing up, Mya.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.902 position:50% align:center
Just a sec,
I'll be right with you.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.738 position:50% align:center
Sure. No prob.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.740 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] I thought
he had ten more minutes.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.366 position:50% align:center
Ten minutes is nothing.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.744 position:50% align:center
Back to your tent,
O Great Oracle.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.669 position:50% align:center
[KAGIURA]
Whoa, look at you, Hirano!

00:06:59.753 --> 00:07:01.921 position:50% align:center
The bad boy thing
really suits you!

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.214 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Hey, Kagi!

00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.342 position:50% align:center
Quit yelling across the hall
and get over here!

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.593 position:50% align:center
I'll treat you to a drink!

00:07:06.676 --> 00:07:07.844 position:50% align:center
[KAGIURA]
Thanks!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.019 position:50% align:center
--Apparently, Class 1-C is--
--I kinda want to check out--

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:19.647 position:50% align:center
Tell me yours first.

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.151 position:50% align:center
In Class 1-C, they're doing
a cotton candy tasting.

00:07:23.234 --> 00:07:24.903 position:50% align:center
1-B is hosting a game
where you have to

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.238 position:50% align:center
guess which treat is spiciest.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.824 position:50% align:center
You wanna do both
after your competition?

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.159 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sure!

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:32.869 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It's about time
for you to get ready, huh?

00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah, probably.

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:36.081 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Gotcha. Good luck out there!

00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:37.749 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks!

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:42.212 position:50% align:center
[MC 10A] Up next, we have the
lovely princess of Class 1-D!

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.254 position:50% align:center
Lady Sato!

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:44.714 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I was nervous about this,

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
but I think I managed
to be supportive. I'm glad.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
How's it going, Sasaki?

00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.597 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey there.

00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:54.432 position:50% align:center
You're watching from
a distance, huh?

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:55.558 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
So, I take it you're
not gonna compete?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.020 position:50% align:center
No need. [gasps]

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.690 position:50% align:center
Oh hey, check it out.
Miyano's up next.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
[gasps] He's wearing makeup?

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.959 position:50% align:center
Yup, Hanzawa's in it to win it.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.335 position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.171 position:50% align:center
I meant to ask you.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:28.383 position:50% align:center
How do you feel about Miyano
being in a drag competition?

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.301 position:50% align:center
Is it weird for you?

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] All right,
how much do you know?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.473 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Oh, he hasn't said
anything about anything to me.

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:37.642 position:50% align:center
I just got an
impression, is all.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:40.353 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Fair enough.
I can't blame you for that.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.647 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Not like I hid it.

00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.276 position:50% align:center
Truth is, I wasn't exactly
happy with the idea.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.905 position:50% align:center
But it's really nice to see him
having such a good time.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.243 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] After all,
that's how it started.

00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
[MC 10A] Please welcome,
from Class 2-B.

00:08:58.163 --> 00:08:59.080 position:50% align:center
Miss Yumi?

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:01.166 position:50% align:center
--[STUDENTS laugh]
--[MIYANO gasps]

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:02.334 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Yumi!

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
It's Yoshikazu.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.212 position:50% align:center
[MC 10A]
How did I get "Yumi"? Sorry!

00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:07.130 position:50% align:center
Some of you boys...

00:09:07.213 --> 00:09:10.383 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I love seeing him happy.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:13.261 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Anyway, um,
I'd like to thank Class 2-B

00:09:13.345 --> 00:09:14.429 position:50% align:center
for their support!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
Oh, tripped over his line there.

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.933 position:50% align:center
So, you guys told him
exactly what words to say?

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:22.103 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. We were all
fired up about winning.

00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
It made for a lot of
lunchtime arguments.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.775 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Mya's always
thinking of other people.

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
Even after I told him
how I felt, he was still kind.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
I mean, what about when I'm 50?

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
I might look
completely different,

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
you don't know
how you'll feel then!

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Wait. I just realized.

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.584 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
If he's worried about that,

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:48.505 position:50% align:center
he must be
considering me long term!

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:51.508 position:50% align:center
Huh? You okay, Sasaki?

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:53.551 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, yeah.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.763 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I dunno,
maybe he was just saying

00:09:56.846 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
whatever popped into his head,

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:02.143 position:50% align:center
but still, I want it to be true.

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:04.187 position:50% align:center
I wish I was grown up.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.734 position:50% align:center
I want to be a cool adult,
someone who has it together.

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
So, I don't bring us both down.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
[MC 10A] And with that,
the competition is over!

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
Give our contestants
a round of applause!

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.745 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sorry I lost, you guys.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
Well, first place knocked it out
of the park, so it seems fair.

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.835 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA] Maybe we should
go flashier next year.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:29.462 position:50% align:center
They won't stand a chance
against Tasuko's girlish charms.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:33.425 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] No way, man!
Tasuko is off-limits!

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:34.759 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:38.013 position:50% align:center
Hey. Good work out there, Mya.
You should've won.

00:10:38.096 --> 00:10:39.472 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Nah, it's okay.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.141 position:50% align:center
To be honest,
it's kinda nice to know

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:42.934 position:50% align:center
I wasn't the most
feminine-looking person

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
in the contest.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.271 position:50% align:center
That makes sense,
you have gotten a little taller.

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right!
I have grown!

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.983 position:50% align:center
A year ago you were
like, here-ish?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.110 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh, come on,
I wasn't that short.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:55.196 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]
I see you changed your hair.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.532 position:50% align:center
I think it looks good
like that, too.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:10:58.658 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.287 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:08.376 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Miyano, time to go change.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, I'll catch you later!

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.505 position:50% align:center
Yeah. See you around, Mya!

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:24.225 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He seemed
really self-conscious.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] The school
festival is almost over.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.441 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised it's
still so busy out there.

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, hey.

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.528 position:50% align:center
I take it they didn't need
your help for the finale?

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
Nah, we're done.
My class is free to go now.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:43.036 position:50% align:center
Besides, I'd much rather
hang out with you.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Listen, I--

00:11:56.091 --> 00:11:57.509 position:50% align:center
That surprised me.

00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
Guess it's time
for the grand finale.

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:00.845 position:50% align:center
I've never seen it before.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.430 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait, in three years?

00:12:02.514 --> 00:12:06.476 position:50% align:center
Yeah, up until now, I've always
left before the festival ended.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.062 position:50% align:center
But this year,
I had you with me,

00:12:09.145 --> 00:12:11.856 position:50% align:center
so I wanted to
enjoy every moment.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.278 position:50% align:center
Do you think it'd be okay if

00:12:17.362 --> 00:12:20.490 position:50% align:center
I took a little longer
to answer you?

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
I just think it would be wrong
to tell you right now.

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.872 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
If not tonight...

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.003 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
...how much longer?

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:34.421 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
My heart's beating so loud.

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:43.054 position:50% align:center
I want to touch him.
Is this okay?

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:48.268 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm so confused.

00:12:52.063 --> 00:12:53.606 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'll be waiting.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.869 position:50% align:center
I can wait.

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:09.539 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
He's being so open.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I like when he
lets his guard down with me.

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:19.883 position:50% align:center
Like before,
I wished I could hug him.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
And when he was sick,
I wanted to take care of him.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:30.685 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I know that whatever
I feel, it's really intense.

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.396 position:50% align:center
Do I like him
the way he likes me?

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.650 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm happy that he needs me.

00:13:37.734 --> 00:13:38.902 position:50% align:center
It's nice to have someone to

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:41.446 position:50% align:center
share my hobby with
and everything,

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.656 position:50% align:center
but I know it's more than that.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I can't say it yet.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
It could turn out badly.

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.501 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I can't just
try it out and see.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.337 position:50% align:center
What if I was
mistaken all along?

00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:03.802 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, once we lock up the
first floor, we're done, right?

00:14:03.885 --> 00:14:06.012 position:50% align:center
I think so.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:09.224 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It wouldn't be fair for
me to say it before I'm sure.

00:14:09.307 --> 00:14:11.726 position:50% align:center
I don't want to hurt him.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.146 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Let's hurry.
Otherwise, Hirano'll get mad.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.024 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
He's always finding ways to

00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.443 position:50% align:center
show me how much he cares.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:24.447 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Wow, this is a disaster.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:26.616 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It was the green room
for the stage show.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.368 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, right, that makes sense.

00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:30.537 position:50% align:center
They had a big group.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I want to say it.

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.832 position:50% align:center
I wonder if all
the rooms are this messy.

00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
Hopefully they'll
have it cleaned up

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.501 position:50% align:center
in time to pass the inspection.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I don't know
if the feelings I have

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:41.047 position:50% align:center
are the same as what
Sasaki feels for me.

00:14:42.674 --> 00:14:47.929 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] But either way, I want
to tell him that I like him.

00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.639 position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.317 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I'm glad I got
the limited first-run edition!

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.193 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:03.069 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Excuse me.

00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
Oh-- Hey, it's you!

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.741 position:50% align:center
Well, this is rare.

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
I hardly see you
outside of school.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.661 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know.

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:14.289 position:50% align:center
[SATOKO] Slow down, Shu!
Don't run off like that!

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.332 position:50% align:center
You always take off
without saying anything,

00:15:16.416 --> 00:15:17.834 position:50% align:center
it's so annoying!

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.337 position:50% align:center
Because you started
chatting with the cashier.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.297 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but only for
a few minutes.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.133 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It's never been
just a few minutes.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.218 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Who's she?

00:15:27.302 --> 00:15:29.346 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Hey, don't leave without me!

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:31.681 position:50% align:center
Thank you again for
your help, Ogasawara.

00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
Wait, there's a bag missing!
Oh, come on!

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] That's when you know
you bought too much.

00:15:36.436 --> 00:15:37.270 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
I'm so tired.

00:15:37.354 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
--[SASAKI] Hey, Mya.
--Huh?

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.565 position:50% align:center
Are you doing
anything right now?

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:41.983 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Not really, no.

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
Let's all get tea, then.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.446 position:50% align:center
You and Ogasawara can
head over there for now.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.949 position:50% align:center
I'll catch up with you guys
in a little bit, okay?

00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:53.328 position:50% align:center
Hanging out with Sasaki's
sister is exhausting.

00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.831 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh, so that's who that
girl was. I didn't realize.

00:15:56.915 --> 00:15:59.793 position:50% align:center
Yeah. She wanted to
pick out a few new outfits

00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:02.003 position:50% align:center
as a present for her boyfriend.

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:03.171 position:50% align:center
Which meant that Sasaki and I

00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:05.632 position:50% align:center
got roped into being
human mannequins.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.967 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Trying on clothes can be tough.

00:16:08.051 --> 00:16:11.137 position:50% align:center
Trust me. I learned that from
prepping for the contest.

00:16:11.221 --> 00:16:12.639 position:50% align:center
You did that drag thing?

00:16:12.722 --> 00:16:14.099 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah, it was a lot of work,

00:16:14.182 --> 00:16:15.975 position:50% align:center
but Chairman Hanzawa
helped me out with it.

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
What? So, he ditched his class
and helped yours instead?

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:22.482 position:50% align:center
Seriously, nobody had
a problem with that, at all?

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:23.566 position:50% align:center
I don't get that guy.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.819 position:50% align:center
Something about him
weirds me out.

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
Must be that creepy
smile of his.

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.323 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] The chairman
seems like a good guy to me.

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
I'm sure he's stressed out

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.702 position:50% align:center
since he has
so many commitments.

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:36.621 position:50% align:center
But I never hear him complain
or take it out on anyone.

00:16:36.705 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:16:38.248 --> 00:16:40.625 position:50% align:center
He's always super
friendly to everybody.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.127 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.587 position:50% align:center
You seem to have a lot of
respect for Chairman Hanzawa.

00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:46.673 position:50% align:center
So then, what do you
think about Hirano?

00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
I mean, since he's also
one of your upperclassmen.

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:53.847 position:50% align:center
What to say about Hirano?
Well, I think that he's kind.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.724 position:50% align:center
Not sure where you
get that idea.

00:16:55.807 --> 00:16:58.643 position:50% align:center
He's always scolding people
about their grades and stuff.

00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.771 position:50% align:center
I know, but it's kind of him
to help you study, isn't it?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:07.402 position:50% align:center
Besides... he's like
a treasure trove of BL tropes.

00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
Uh, what the hell
is that look about, man?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.657 position:50% align:center
Huh. You know,
it's kinda fun to hear

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.951 position:50% align:center
your perspective on
the people we both know.

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.662 position:50% align:center
Like, you and Sasaki spend
a lot of your time together.

00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:18.913 position:50% align:center
So, what do you think of him?

00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:22.751 position:50% align:center
Um, I dunno, he's older,
I look up to him.

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:27.380 position:50% align:center
Is that all you got?
Come on, just tell me the truth.

00:17:27.464 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I did, though.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.925 position:50% align:center
I mean, he's constantly
canceling plans with me

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.719 position:50% align:center
just so he can
walk home with you.

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:33.970 position:50% align:center
There's gotta be more to it.

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
You don't talk about him
like you do the others.

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Please let it go, all right?

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:40.226 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Hm?

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:43.396 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Damn, dude,
you're glaring at me, too?

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.690 position:50% align:center
You'd better not be
bothering him.

00:17:45.774 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
Is everything okay here, Miya?

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:48.443 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:50.528 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you heard him, just relax.

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:51.696 position:50% align:center
He and I were talking about how

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.948 position:50% align:center
he looks up to you
and stuff, that was it.

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.200 position:50% align:center
Is that so?

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.077 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Uh-huh.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Well, do you?

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
How'd I get myself into this?

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.832 position:50% align:center
It's nice to have you
as an upperclassman.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.209 position:50% align:center
Aw, thank you.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
Well, you snapped
out of that quick.

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and what of it?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
What do you think of Ogasawara?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.093 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?
You respect me, right?

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:14.552 position:50% align:center
Sure, I do!

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
It seems like you really care
about your relationship.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.473 position:50% align:center
I think that's awesome.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:19.849 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:23.353 position:50% align:center
Aw, congrats. At least somebody
respects you, buddy.

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:27.482 position:50% align:center
Whatever. Gah.
Lost track of time, damn.

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.192 position:50% align:center
All right, I gotta head out.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:31.111 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh yeah, you have
a life, I forgot. See ya.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.113 position:50% align:center
--Later.
--[MIYANO] What's he doing?

00:18:33.196 --> 00:18:35.115 position:50% align:center
He's gonna cook dinner
with his girlfriend.

00:18:35.198 --> 00:18:37.117 position:50% align:center
So, he's picking up
some stuff first.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.369 position:50% align:center
I guess their families approve.

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.746 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, it's serious.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.957 position:50% align:center
So, do you have anything else
planned for today?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.668 position:50% align:center
Yep, I was thinking
about catching a movie.

00:18:46.751 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, which flick you pick?

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.963 position:50% align:center
Well, uh...

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.256 position:50% align:center
It's BL, isn't it?

00:18:51.339 --> 00:18:54.509 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hey, don't just assume!
But, yes, it is.

00:18:54.592 --> 00:18:56.428 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
You mind if I see it with you?

00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.596 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:18:59.723 --> 00:19:02.684 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Um, you sure
you want to watch it?

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.020 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Of course.

00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:07.480 position:50% align:center
You know, this kinda
feels like a date.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.989 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Wow, the audience
is almost all girls.

00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
I know. I don't see too many
guys here together, either.

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:25.415 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR 10A] Honestly, I just
never thought you'd choose me.

00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:28.418 position:50% align:center
I mean, the way
you've always acted.

00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:32.797 position:50% align:center
[ACTOR 10A]
Anyway. I'm sorry.

00:19:32.881 --> 00:19:37.969 position:50% align:center
The truth is, I like you.
I have for a long time.

00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:41.181 position:50% align:center
And I know apologizing
doesn't magically make it okay,

00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:45.018 position:50% align:center
but I don't know
what else to do.

00:19:45.101 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
Besides say, I like you a lot

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:52.692 position:50% align:center
and I hope you can accept that.

00:19:54.986 --> 00:19:58.114 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] That was pretty good.
How'd you like it?

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:01.493 position:50% align:center
We just watched an absolute
cinematic masterpiece!

00:20:01.576 --> 00:20:04.704 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't change
one moment of it!

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
That was a flawless
3D adaptation!

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.416 position:50% align:center
Sometimes a book
doesn't translate

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.126 position:50% align:center
very well to a live-action film,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
so I was a little nervous
that it was going to fall flat.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.546 position:50% align:center
I thought it would feel awkward

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.882 position:50% align:center
to see actual people
in place of drawings.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.425 position:50% align:center
I'm sure the creator's
style must be

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.594 position:50% align:center
difficult to replicate
on camera.

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.846 position:50% align:center
But the movie got
so many good reviews.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
I decided that I'd have
to come and see it

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
to form my own opinion!

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.353 position:50% align:center
It was like a perfect love
letter to the source material!

00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:29.813 position:50% align:center
Every line of dialogue captured

00:20:29.896 --> 00:20:31.439 position:50% align:center
the feeling of
the original work!

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:33.566 position:50% align:center
All the actors embodied
the characters.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:34.859 position:50% align:center
There's a specific emotion that

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center
this story is
supposed to invoke,

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.405 position:50% align:center
and they totally nailed that!

00:20:40.115 --> 00:20:42.200 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Anyway, yeah, I liked it!

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:45.412 position:50% align:center
I liked it, too.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:48.081 position:50% align:center
I don't think I've
borrowed that manga.

00:20:48.164 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Actually, it's based on
a novel, you wanna read it?

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:54.796 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Uh, as long as I can
take a while to give it back.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:57.048 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, because of
entrance exams.

00:20:57.132 --> 00:20:58.550 position:50% align:center
Well, that's part of it,

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:01.052 position:50% align:center
but I'm not usually the kind of
person who reads novels,

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.471 position:50% align:center
I don't know if
I can get into it.

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
Was the movie super
different from the book?

00:21:05.515 --> 00:21:06.933 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm, let's see.

00:21:07.017 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
[PATRON 10A] Look over there.
You think they're dating?

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:10.228 position:50% align:center
[PATRON 10B] Oh, come on,
you're just saying that

00:21:10.311 --> 00:21:11.563 position:50% align:center
because of the movie.

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:12.647 position:50% align:center
[PATRON 10A]
No, really!

00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:15.066 position:50% align:center
Why else would
two guys go see that?

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.484 position:50% align:center
Does that bother you?

00:21:16.568 --> 00:21:18.028 position:50% align:center
It's fine.

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:21.072 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's not like they're
saying it in a hateful way.

00:21:22.866 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's that for?
I said I'm okay.

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:32.334 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles] That was fun.
I'm really glad we came.

00:21:36.254 --> 00:21:37.797 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:44.387 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I like him.
I'm not sure what that means.

00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
I just know I always
feel at ease around him

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:50.393 position:50% align:center
and he makes me happy.

00:21:50.477 --> 00:21:53.855 position:50% align:center
Wow. My heart is racing.

00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.651 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
If I kissed him or something,

00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
I have no guarantee that
things would work out.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.283 position:50% align:center
Still, I think...

00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:13.667 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If these feelings
aren't love, then what is?
