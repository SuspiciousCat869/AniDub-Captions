[yawns]

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:31.656 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, Mya.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.075 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, good morning, Sasaki.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.537 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Morning. You feeling better?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.457 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh. I went to bed early,
so that helped.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.043 position:50% align:center
Ah, okay. That's good.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:53.053 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO clears throat]
Hm. This train again.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.596 position:50% align:center
That's a surprise.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.223 position:50% align:center
Have you been
getting up earlier?

00:00:57.307 --> 00:01:01.978 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Mm-hm. I wanted
a chance to see you.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.106 position:50% align:center
Also, exams are
around the corner,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.859 position:50% align:center
so Hirano's got me
doing boot camp til then.

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.736 position:50% align:center
Hang in there, soldier.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.031 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, there was a BL anime
on TV last night.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.283 position:50% align:center
Might've been the one
that you lent to me.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.702 position:50% align:center
You mean you watched
BL anime at home?!

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.829 position:50% align:center
Yup. I just happened
to catch it on.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.332 position:50% align:center
And your family didn't
judge you or anything?!

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.001 position:50% align:center
No, I was the only one up.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.296 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize they
made anime outta BL.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.049 position:50% align:center
I wonder if they have
live-action series, too.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.845 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's cool.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
You don't have to
answer right away.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:40.642 position:50% align:center
I'd be happy if you gave it
some thought, actually.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.020 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I will! I swear!

00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.485 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Gotta tell you,
it was a new experience.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:52.904 position:50% align:center
You know, seeing
BL stuff animated.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.239 position:50% align:center
I know what you mean,

00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:57.283 position:50% align:center
some scenes can be a little
overwhelming to watch.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.619 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it caught me off-guard.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.996 position:50% align:center
Happens to me too sometimes.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.543 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki always listens to me,

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.670 position:50% align:center
no matter how much I talk.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.715 position:50% align:center
So, I wanted to give plenty of
thought to what he said, too.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.430 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It doesn't feel right
to say no because he's a guy.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:22.851 position:50% align:center
But I've only ever had
a crush on a girl before.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.689 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I look up to him
as an upperclassman.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:31.735 position:50% align:center
Outside of that,
it's hard to say.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.904 position:50% align:center
Hirano gave me all these
flashcards to study with,

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.657 position:50% align:center
but the price is I have to
score at least 80 percent.

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.367 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by price?

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
Did you make a deal
with a devil, or what?

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.212 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] How does it feel
to like somebody?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:32.981 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.234 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 6A] Make sure to
fill out your post-graduation

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.944 position:50% align:center
goal forms by Friday.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.113 position:50% align:center
[CLASSROOM]
Yes, sir.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:41.698 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, now that
I think about it,

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.409 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure Friday
is Sasaki's birthday.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:47.328 position:50% align:center
That's right, it is.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.205 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Are you gonna do anything?

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.832 position:50% align:center
Me? Why would I?

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:52.709 position:50% align:center
To show you appreciate him.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.627 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, um...

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.715 position:50% align:center
Are you thinking about getting
something for him, Kuresawa?

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.468 position:50% align:center
No way. I made a vow
that the only one

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.678 position:50% align:center
I'd ever buy gifts for
is my darling girlfriend.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
Really?! Listen,
I know she's pretty,

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.768 position:50% align:center
but she must get annoyed
with you being so obsessive.

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.102 position:50% align:center
Yeah, she hates it.

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Seriously?!
Then why don't you stop?!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.066 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Believe it or not,
this is me holding back.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.817 position:50% align:center
What's the difference?

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Well, there's plenty
of stuff I'm not doing.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
You know what?
Maybe a story will help.

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.658 position:50% align:center
Right-o! Bring it on, I'm ready.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.786 position:50% align:center
This is just another
excuse to talk about her,

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.496 position:50% align:center
you know that, right?

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
Hurry!

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.882 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Anyway,
when she and I first met,

00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.634 position:50% align:center
she was actually
in the hospital.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
What?

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.596 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
How should I handle this?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.806 position:50% align:center
Telling him "happy birthday"

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.725 position:50% align:center
would be fine if
we were just friends.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
But while he's waiting on me
to respond to what he said,

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
is it weird to give him a gift?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.944 position:50% align:center
I would like to show
I appreciate him

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center
and it's a special day,
I don't want to ignore it.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:10.245 position:50% align:center
Because of that, she couldn't
go on our class field trip.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.746 position:50% align:center
So, we paid her a visit

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.332 position:50% align:center
and our whole group
brought souvenirs for her.

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:17.377 position:50% align:center
For some reason, despite us both
being in the same class,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.337 position:50% align:center
we had never
spoken to each other.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.215 position:50% align:center
Her cute smile was
what stole my heart.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:24.384 position:50% align:center
I fell for her right then.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
I thought,
"my whole life is for her."

00:06:27.554 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
Uh, really? That got a little
soapy all of a sudden.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.062 position:50% align:center
Whoa, you somehow talked about

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
your girlfriend for
the entire lunch period!

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
I didn't even finish
all of my food!

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.735 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA chuckles]

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.862 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I tried to warn you.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:47.907 position:50% align:center
Looks like these are gonna
have to go to waste, then.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.868 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] How'd you do that
with your fingers?

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.494 position:50% align:center
Oh, those things.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:53.496 position:50% align:center
I've seen Sasaki
eating them before.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Oh, for real? Are they good?

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.250 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah, he says he likes them.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
Here, you can have one.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:01.171 position:50% align:center
It's a new flavor
that came out recently.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.423 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks. I'll give it a try.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.592 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] There's even
a savory one called Napolitan,

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
they had tons of 'em in stock.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:08.845 position:50% align:center
We should get
a whole bunch sometime

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.638 position:50% align:center
and sample 'em together.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.849 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] And who's gonna
pay for this taste-test?

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
All of us!

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:37.040 position:50% align:center
How's it going, Mya?

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:38.958 position:50% align:center
You know, the same as always.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:40.752 position:50% align:center
Are you ready to
pass your exams?

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:42.837 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I guess. I hope.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm more scared of
what Hirano'll do if I fail.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:48.176 position:50% align:center
What was your score again?

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.261 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah, I'd be scared, too.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:57.310 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hey, one sec,
I, um, have some candy here.

00:07:57.394 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
Huh? Candy?

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.444 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's a sweet flavor.

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:09.948 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised.
You don't like this stuff.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
I know, but today
is your birthday.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.788 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd like it,
so it's a present

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.208 position:50% align:center
for you to eat during
your study break, y'know?

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:23.003 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Happy birthday.

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:25.672 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Mya.

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:31.302 position:50% align:center
It was her cute smile
that stole my heart.

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center
Right then.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:40.061 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry! It's nothing,
just ignore me.

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:43.314 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why was I
thinking that he was cu--

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.316 position:50% align:center
Agh, I mean cool!

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
He's cool and
definitely not cute!

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.155 position:50% align:center
Ugh, stupid Kuresawa
must've gotten into my head!

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:52.866 position:50% align:center
[gasps] The exams.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
He opened it.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.079 position:50% align:center
I feel like I'm ready
for them now.

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:00.957 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Good to hear.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:23.188 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Well,
I totally bombed that!

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.398 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, how did you do?

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.277 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, to tell you the truth,

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.780 position:50% align:center
I think I actually did
make a deal with a devil.

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center
The answers came to me so easy.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
I did great in every subject!

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.244 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
What's wrong?

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
Did all that studying scramble
your brain or something?

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
My brain's just fine!

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:56.471 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It's so hot.

00:09:56.554 --> 00:10:00.016 position:50% align:center
Come to think of it, it was
this time last year, right?

00:10:02.477 --> 00:10:04.771 position:50% align:center
Sasaki! Hey, good morning!

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:06.523 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Mya.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.024 position:50% align:center
It's funny you'd
show up right now,

00:10:08.108 --> 00:10:10.527 position:50% align:center
I was thinking about
the first time you and I met.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah?

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:15.240 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] You know, back when
those guys went after Kuresawa?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:28.753 position:50% align:center
It's already been a year
since I met you. Wow.

00:10:29.713 --> 00:10:32.048 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] We were thinking
about the same thing.

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] You hold this,
I'll go and break it up.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:37.303 position:50% align:center
I sure was lucky
you came onto the scene

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:38.805 position:50% align:center
when you did, Sasaki.

00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.433 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]
Takes you back, huh?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.149 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I like you.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.278 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um. Yeah, it does.

00:10:54.112 --> 00:10:56.614 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I still need to
give him an answer.

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.673 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I don't know what to do.

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.717 position:50% align:center
Uh-oh, looks like
Miyano's dead.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.802 position:50% align:center
Guess you're worried
about exams, too, huh?

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:18.845 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
"Too"?

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.597 position:50% align:center
Are you nervous
about them, Tashiro?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.475 position:50% align:center
I'm getting decent grades
so far, so I'm actually not.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:24.809 position:50% align:center
Oh yikes, if it's just me,

00:11:24.893 --> 00:11:27.687 position:50% align:center
I'd better hit the books
while I still can!

00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:30.273 position:50% align:center
So, uh, what's with you?

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Lately, I just
can't enjoy my manga.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
I've got too much on my mind.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.740 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
That's serious.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.534 position:50% align:center
I can't imagine you
not enjoying manga.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:44.788 position:50% align:center
What have you been doing during
your study breaks and stuff?

00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.206 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Reading manga.

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50% align:center
I thought you said
you can't, though.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.211 position:50% align:center
I mean, I usually read
stuff that's set in school,

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
but I've switched to offices.

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:56.341 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Offices, huh?
The workplace genre's popular.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.259 position:50% align:center
Which ones are good?

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.595 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Do you have room left
in your brain for extra info?

00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:02.847 position:50% align:center
Crap! I'm slacking again!

00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.392 position:50% align:center
I'm in charge of buying
manga for my girlfriend,

00:12:05.475 --> 00:12:07.602 position:50% align:center
so I memorized
all the shelf labels.

00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.313 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Wait, are you
kidding? Why do that?

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
That's some serious dedication.

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:13.692 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
It's necessary.

00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
She's extremely
particular about her BL.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:20.532 position:50% align:center
Oh. What kind of requirements
does she look for?

00:12:20.615 --> 00:12:22.617 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
I believe her exact words were

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
"there must be
a sexy man present."

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.454 position:50% align:center
Sexy man.

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] She's also
been into pop idols lately.

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.417 position:50% align:center
Pop idols.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.419 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 6B]
All right, take your seats!

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:36.464 position:50% align:center
Nothing on your desk but a pen!

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:48.393 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:51.604 position:50% align:center
I heard you say something about
a "sexy man" before the exam.

00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:53.148 position:50% align:center
Talkin' about me?

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:56.026 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] No, I was talking
about me and my girlfriend.

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:58.194 position:50% align:center
Were you focused on that
and not your test?

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.154 position:50% align:center
That's not good.

00:12:59.237 --> 00:13:00.655 position:50% align:center
Wait, so you meant you?

00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:02.157 position:50% align:center
Conceited, much?!

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
Not sure if I qualify as "sexy."

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.995 position:50% align:center
That's what she's into, though.

00:13:07.078 --> 00:13:08.913 position:50% align:center
She always says if
a guy's attractive enough,

00:13:08.997 --> 00:13:11.207 position:50% align:center
then he can be a seme or an uke.

00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
I suppose that means my face
helped me to get the girl.

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
I better thank my parents.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.839 position:50% align:center
Come on. Have a
little modesty, man!

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.258 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, you sweet summer child.

00:13:20.342 --> 00:13:23.261 position:50% align:center
You know she's using you
as BL fodder, right?

00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:25.138 position:50% align:center
[sighs] It's not fair.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
Least I've got
my cool personality.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.435 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure,
your personality is great.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.979 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] You could've at least
said it with a little feeling!

00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:36.316 position:50% align:center
Not all of us can have
a cute face like Miyano.

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:38.193 position:50% align:center
But you can't skate
through relationships

00:13:38.276 --> 00:13:39.819 position:50% align:center
on good looks alone.

00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.279 position:50% align:center
Great job, Tashiro.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.323 position:50% align:center
You managed to find
a new and creative way

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:44.657 position:50% align:center
of hurting my feelings.

00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.369 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] What? No!
You're both amazing people!

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:49.829 position:50% align:center
I just meant that
looks aren't everything!

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:51.289 position:50% align:center
So, my girlfriend adores me

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
for my dashing good looks
and my winning personality.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
Thank you, Tashiro.

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:58.463 position:50% align:center
Talk about self-confidence,
Kuresawa!

00:13:58.546 --> 00:14:00.423 position:50% align:center
Wish I had some of that.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.682 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO sighs] I'm so glad the
exams'll be over with tomorrow!

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.143 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Not all of us can have
a cute face like Miyano.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
But you can't skate
through relationships

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:16.022 position:50% align:center
on good looks alone.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.943 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait. That reminds me.

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Your face

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.947 position:50% align:center
isn't the only thing
that I like about you.

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:27.909 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What?!

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:33.373 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, I--[gasps]

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Hey, how's it going, Sasaki?

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.505 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Not bad. Headed home?

00:14:40.588 --> 00:14:41.339 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Yup.

00:14:41.423 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
Hey, uh...

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:45.427 position:50% align:center
Oh, whoops. Height difference.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.762 position:50% align:center
Let's all destroy
those exams tomorrow.

00:14:47.846 --> 00:14:49.556 position:50% align:center
See ya then.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.475 position:50% align:center
Man, that guy is tall.

00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:55.228 position:50% align:center
Yeah, the world's different
for people over 5'11.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.813 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of jealous.

00:14:57.856 --> 00:15:01.026 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sometimes I
genuinely don't understand

00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:03.570 position:50% align:center
what's going on
in Sasaki's mind.

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:06.698 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
But I don't want to use that

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.325 position:50% align:center
as an excuse
to dodge this issue.

00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.896 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I touched him.

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.405 position:50% align:center
See ya!

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.285 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It started raining.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yo! Congrats on
finishing your exams.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.336 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, congrats
to you, too, Sasaki.

00:16:01.419 --> 00:16:03.505 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Thanks. You got your umbrella?

00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, I didn't bring it today,

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
but I don't mind waiting a bit
for the rain to stop.

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:10.136 position:50% align:center
Well, luckily I have mine.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.262 position:50% align:center
You wanna walk together?

00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.556 position:50% align:center
Oh. Um.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.518 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure, I guess there's
no reason I shouldn't.

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:18.228 position:50% align:center
Cool.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] He seems really
happy for some reason.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:31.324 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hello, hello?

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
Huh? What's up?

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:34.619 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
You were spacing out.

00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.955 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:38.998 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It's okay,
I was just telling you

00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:41.251 position:50% align:center
about how Hirano
has one test left,

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.545 position:50% align:center
since he's taking
an extra class.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.588 position:50% align:center
I guess the schedules
for seniors would be

00:16:45.672 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
pretty different with
all the electives

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.466 position:50% align:center
you guys have to fit in.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.385 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and apparently
he and Ogasawara

00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
have almost none of
the same classes.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:54.139 position:50% align:center
Which made it harder for

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.725 position:50% align:center
ol' blue streak
to get good grades.

00:16:56.808 --> 00:16:58.893 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Right, no one to help him study.

00:16:58.977 --> 00:17:01.604 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Nah, he ended up fine,
his girlfriend saved the day.

00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:04.190 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO chuckles] Good thing
those two are so close.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:05.608 position:50% align:center
He would've been
lost without her.

00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.318 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, completely.

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] He and I don't get
a lot of opportunities

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.532 position:50% align:center
to talk one-on-one like this.

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Looks like the rain stopped.

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
I guess we can
finally put away the--

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
I, um, I wanted to ask you...

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:31.593 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Do you happen to be into guys?

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:36.348 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I don't think so. Why?

00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, because you like me.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.520 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right. It's confusing.

00:17:42.604 --> 00:17:44.189 position:50% align:center
When you're around,

00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:47.525 position:50% align:center
these feelings just
suddenly come over me.

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure how to explain it.

00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.864 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, okay.

00:17:55.283 --> 00:17:57.577 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, um...

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.248 position:50% align:center
Ahh. So, you are
thinking about it. Thank you.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:05.502 position:50% align:center
Yeah! It's definitely
on my mind.

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:09.255 position:50% align:center
But I still don't know
how to think about it.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.928 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] At first, I told him
I wasn't looking for

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:19.391 position:50% align:center
that kind of experience and
that hasn't changed, but...

00:18:23.895 --> 00:18:25.647 position:50% align:center
Sasaki.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.233 position:50% align:center
When I say I like you,
it's more like,

00:18:28.316 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
I'm telling you that I
look up to you a lot.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:36.950 position:50% align:center
If I were more like you,
braver, and more assertive,

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.702 position:50% align:center
maybe I would've
stepped in that day

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
and Kuresawa wouldn't
have gotten hurt so badly.

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:45.083 position:50% align:center
I enjoy reading BL,
but that doesn't mean

00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.377 position:50% align:center
I want to date a guy
in real life.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.547 position:50% align:center
The only person I ever
fell for was a girl.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.215 position:50% align:center
I don't know whether
I'm even capable of

00:18:52.298 --> 00:18:54.843 position:50% align:center
having those kinds of
feelings for a guy.

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:56.302 position:50% align:center
I'm so confused.

00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:59.347 position:50% align:center
I can't even look at BL
in the same way anymore.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:03.018 position:50% align:center
And then, when you told me
that you liked my face,

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.854 position:50% align:center
I thought maybe it was
because I look feminine.

00:19:05.937 --> 00:19:07.605 position:50% align:center
And what if I hit
a major growth spurt

00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:10.483 position:50% align:center
and turn out taller
than you in the future?

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:13.361 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He's so cute right now,
but I can't laugh!

00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
I mean, you don't
know how you'll

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.822 position:50% align:center
feel about me when I'm 50,

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.158 position:50% align:center
I might look completely
different by then!

00:19:21.494 --> 00:19:24.998 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] No. That's not what I
want to say to him at all.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.753 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That's not the point!

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.135 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
If I'm being honest,

00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center
I like that Sasaki
tries to get to know me.

00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:44.559 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's not just
that I look up to him.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:48.355 position:50% align:center
In fact, there's probably
a lot more to it than that!

00:19:49.898 --> 00:19:51.274 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
And so--

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.445 position:50% align:center
If you don't mind waiting,

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:56.696 position:50% align:center
please give me
a little more time

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.698 position:50% align:center
to think about what you said!

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] And what I
told you a second ago,

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
about how I'm not sure if
I can think of you that way--

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:09.834 position:50% align:center
The only reason I
said that was because

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:12.587 position:50% align:center
I had never considered
the possibility before,

00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:15.590 position:50% align:center
and I may never
figure it out, but, uh--

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:16.591 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Good.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:21.888 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Good.

00:20:22.764 --> 00:20:25.016 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Man, he's killing me.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:29.771 position:50% align:center
Well, take your time, okay?

00:20:29.854 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
That makes me happy. Thanks.

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.609 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by thanks?

00:20:34.693 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
I still haven't
given you an answer!

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:39.155 position:50% align:center
--I don't--?
--Uh, I know.

00:20:39.239 --> 00:20:41.741 position:50% align:center
I'm just happy that you're
giving it plenty of thought.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:43.410 position:50% align:center
You could've said no.

00:20:44.953 --> 00:20:47.122 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm glad I feel this way.

00:20:48.331 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Knowing Mya
cares about me so much.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.294 position:50% align:center
It's really nice.

00:20:54.379 --> 00:20:58.091 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I don't know what his
answer will be, but either way.

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.343 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What's that big smile for?

00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:03.221 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Um, I dunno.

00:21:03.304 --> 00:21:04.597 position:50% align:center
Kinda strange, huh?

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.808 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's go.

00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:08.018 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Okay.

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.021 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm glad I like him.

00:21:13.148 --> 00:21:15.191 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:21:15.275 --> 00:21:16.276 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.532 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I am happy.
So ridiculously happy.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:24.409 position:50% align:center
Listen, Mya.

00:21:24.492 --> 00:21:25.869 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:21:25.952 --> 00:21:27.454 position:50% align:center
I understand that
you might end up

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.122 position:50% align:center
taller than me and who knows,

00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:32.459 position:50% align:center
maybe your face'll end up
different one day, too,

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:33.626 position:50% align:center
but to tell you the truth,

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.087 position:50% align:center
I think I'll still
feel the same way then.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
So, take as much time as you
need to think on what I said

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
and keep on lending me manga
in the meantime. 'Kay?

00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:47.599 position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:21:47.682 --> 00:21:51.227 position:50% align:center
'Til then, I'm fine with
just being your upperclassman.

00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:53.229 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Watch your step!

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.273 position:50% align:center
Oh, and, uh...

00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:57.567 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:00.779 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
I hope you don't mind
if I touch you once in a while.
