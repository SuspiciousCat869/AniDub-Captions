[OGASAWARA, SASAKI laughing]

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:24.190 position:50% align:center
Aw, look at you.
Goody two-shoes Hirano!

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.400 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Cut it out!

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:26.943 position:50% align:center
They'll be doing
a hair check today,

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.904 position:50% align:center
so both of you dye it
back to black right now!

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.282 position:50% align:center
Come on, Ogasawara!
What's wrong with you?

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.701 position:50% align:center
Nobody's hair is naturally blue!

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
Chill out, will ya,
it's no big deal.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:37.954 position:50% align:center
It's mostly black.

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
That's not good enough!

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
You must be crazy if you think

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.500 position:50% align:center
those blue highlights
are gonna fly!

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:43.960 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
I'll just cover it with my hand.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.587 position:50% align:center
Get real!

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I dunno,
the blue is kinda pushing it.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:48.757 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.008 position:50% align:center
If you don't think
they're going to

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.135 position:50% align:center
yell at you, too,
carrot head, think again.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.597 position:50% align:center
Do you plan on looking like that
during entrance exams, too?

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.974 position:50% align:center
Nah, we'll probably
flunk out by then.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:03.605 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Exams. Just one year
left 'til graduation.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:07.609 position:50% align:center
I can't believe I've known Mya
more than six months now.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:15.367 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I wonder,
how long can I hold back?

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.013 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Morning.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.223 position:50% align:center
G'morning.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.016 position:50% align:center
Guess you and I are
second-years now, huh?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.519 position:50% align:center
So which class
are you in? I got 2-B.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.605 position:50% align:center
Oh, so did I. That's cool. But--

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:48.441 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
What is it?

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.318 position:50% align:center
Nothing.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.654 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Guess he must not be here yet.

00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:55.240 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] By the way, I ran
into Sasaki over the break.

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:56.741 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.785 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
He was working at a bakery.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:02:00.120 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Really?

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.080 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I didn't stop
to talk to him, though.

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.582 position:50% align:center
I just happened to
walk by the place.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.542 position:50% align:center
Kinda surprising.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.627 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
He works at a bakery?

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I guess there's a lot
about him that I don't know.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.553 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Then again, I usually
dominate the conversation,

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.514 position:50% align:center
since we mostly only
talk about BL manga.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:23.018 position:50% align:center
He's a good listener,
and he seems popular.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.645 position:50% align:center
I bet lots of people
have crushes on him.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.900 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO coughs]

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.277 position:50% align:center
You sick?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Just choked a little.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.746 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I haven't seen him since then.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.376 position:50% align:center
And I have no idea how I'm
supposed to act when I do.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.236 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 3B]
Passengers, please exercise

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
caution when exiting the train,

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.782 position:50% align:center
as the ground may be slick
due to the weather.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
Morning, Mya. How's it going?

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.004 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
You're on the earlier train
today, that's a surprise.

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.967 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah. When it rains,

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
everybody wants to take
the later one, so here I am.

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] So, you prefer this
time because it's less busy?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh yeah, it's way better.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:09.976 position:50% align:center
[yawns]

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] And as an added bonus,
I get to see him.

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.485 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
This is the first we've seen of
each other this term, right?

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
I guess so.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:27.452 position:50% align:center
What did you do
while we were on break?

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:29.454 position:50% align:center
Uh, nothing much.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
That's cool.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:41.424 position:50% align:center
There's a seat. You should--

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
You have seniority.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center
That's true. But hey,

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.520 position:50% align:center
you're more than welcome to
sit on my lap, if you want.

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I can't tell if you're joking.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.357 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]
Well, you can at least let me

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.485 position:50% align:center
hold onto your bag
for you. Here.

00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:02.237 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sure, thank you.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.408 position:50% align:center
Oh wow, this thing is
way heavier than I thought.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:07.826 position:50% align:center
Whatcha got in here?

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.077 position:50% align:center
Just, uh, you know,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.704 position:50% align:center
my gym clothes,
and some random stuff.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
I bet there's manga.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:13.373 position:50% align:center
Whoa, hold on a minute!

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.458 position:50% align:center
You can't just
go through my bag!

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
Is this the same one I borrowed?

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:21.214 position:50% align:center
Oh, cool. It's a novel.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:23.258 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh...

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:28.179 position:50% align:center
It's a spin-off, but yeah, it is
from that series. So-- [gasps]

00:06:28.263 --> 00:06:30.515 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, stop!
Don't read that here!

00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
People can see you!

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.560 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:06:33.643 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You're always like this!

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:59.085 position:50% align:center
There was one interaction
that really stood out to me

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.754 position:50% align:center
where the seme was crying.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.630 position:50% align:center
He's usually strong
in front of the uke...

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:04.966 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Looks like it's stuck there.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
It's so cute. Should I leave it?

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.263 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] ...such a way of
subverting stereotypes.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:11.890 position:50% align:center
That's how it happened.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.016 position:50% align:center
Sounds pretty wild.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:14.267 position:50% align:center
I know!

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.273 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hey, Mya.
This was in your hair.

00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:22.400 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, thanks for getting it.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.264 position:50% align:center
So, I mentioned my podcast
and she just walked away!

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.275 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mya, there you are!

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:07.862 position:50% align:center
Oh, is this your
classroom? Cool.

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.322 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Is it though?

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:11.408 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Here's the manga
you lent me before break.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.660 position:50% align:center
I forgot to give it back
this morning.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.745 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Right, thanks.

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.539 position:50% align:center
Thanks again, it was good.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:18.873 position:50% align:center
Hey, you free to talk right now?

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, I wanted to ask you
a question about that one.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.464 position:50% align:center
Which one of the
main guys is the uke?

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:27.507 position:50% align:center
What?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.801 position:50% align:center
Hard to tell
without any love scenes.

00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:33.930 position:50% align:center
Why don't you tell me
which of them you think it is?

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:37.517 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hmm. I remember
you saying that you tend to

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.978 position:50% align:center
like ukes who have darker hair.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.688 position:50% align:center
So yeah, I'm gonna
assume it was him!

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
Hold on! Yes, I have a type,

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.151 position:50% align:center
but it's not like I only read
manga that match that!

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:48.570 position:50% align:center
Did I guess wrong?

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.072 position:50% align:center
I don't think there is
a right or wrong answer.

00:08:51.156 --> 00:08:53.533 position:50% align:center
I mean, the author
didn't specify.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.743 position:50% align:center
To tell you the truth,

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:57.078 position:50% align:center
I thought it was the
black-haired guy, too.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:08:58.705 position:50% align:center
But I didn't jump
to that conclusion

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
based on the color of his hair!

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
I just prefer the more
handsome ukes!

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:05.211 position:50% align:center
So, Hirano. Uke, right?

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.463 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Listen,
you don't have to latch onto

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
every little thing I say.

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
But Hirano's kind of
on the tall side,

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:12.969 position:50% align:center
so doesn't that mean
he's probably a seme?

00:09:13.053 --> 00:09:15.305 position:50% align:center
Actually, the seme
isn't always the tall one,

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.016 position:50% align:center
someone of Hirano's height
could easily be the uke.

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:19.642 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
Hey! Look out, Mya!

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.937 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 4E]
Oops, my bad!

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.451 position:50% align:center
Ah. That caught me off guard.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:39.079 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Sasaki. You okay?

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:44.417 position:50% align:center
Yeah. You fell against
that wall pretty fast.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.211 position:50% align:center
I hope you didn't
hurt your wrist.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.963 position:50% align:center
I'm fine. It really
wasn't all that...

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.053 position:50% align:center
...bad.

00:10:00.183 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
I like you.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:08.233 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That's good. Just be careful.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Right.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:14.781 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I can't wait 'til
the next book. I'll see ya then.

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:16.783 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:27.335 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why? Why did I
remember that just then?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
Yes, I can hold. Thank you.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:48.606 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I don't think I acted
any differently. Still.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.740 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Given the way he was acting,

00:10:56.823 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
it kind of seems like he
does like me in that way.

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.790 position:50% align:center
I'm attracted to girls,
not guys.

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:07.792 position:50% align:center
I mean, back in middle school...

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:12.464 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA] Hey, Miyano!
Y'know something?

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.050 position:50% align:center
You'd look so cute
in girls' clothes!

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.469 position:50% align:center
Forget it.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:20.805 position:50% align:center
Oh, come on, it would make a
beautiful picture, just try it!

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.016 position:50% align:center
But I don't want to!

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.272 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It's strange.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:32.025 position:50% align:center
I didn't take it that way
in the beginning.

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:36.738 position:50% align:center
But the look in his eyes,
the sound of his voice.

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.532 position:50% align:center
Suddenly,
it's completely obvious.

00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:50.919 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] So, when he said
we should "test that theory,"

00:11:51.002 --> 00:11:53.004 position:50% align:center
did he really mean
what I think he meant?

00:11:53.088 --> 00:11:55.256 position:50% align:center
At the time,
I figured it was a joke,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.300 position:50% align:center
but now I'm pretty
sure it wasn't.

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:59.260 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he meant it.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:07.102 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I do find
BL romantic, but still...

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] "I don't care if we're
the same gender, do you hear me?

00:12:12.357 --> 00:12:14.776 position:50% align:center
I fell in love with you
for who you are!

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.736 position:50% align:center
Don't be such a dummy!"

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.784 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Whoa, let's keep
this in perspective.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.160 position:50% align:center
Sasaki's a guy.

00:12:24.244 --> 00:12:25.328 position:50% align:center
I like him as a friend,

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:27.080 position:50% align:center
but I don't think
he's cute or anything!

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
Aww, you're chilly, huh?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.710 position:50% align:center
So that's why you were
all curled up? [chuckles]

00:12:31.793 --> 00:12:33.044 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait a minute.

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:35.630 position:50% align:center
I figured this out
before, right?

00:12:35.714 --> 00:12:39.259 position:50% align:center
I'm not attracted to him.
I just admire how cool he is!

00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.553 position:50% align:center
There's a big difference.

00:12:41.636 --> 00:12:42.637 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:12:42.721 --> 00:12:43.638 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, crap!

00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:44.639 position:50% align:center
He's taller than me,

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:46.307 position:50% align:center
which means I'm
probably the uke!

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:47.517 position:50% align:center
Nah, that's dumb.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.935 position:50% align:center
I don't have to be the uke.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:51.146 position:50% align:center
There's plenty of room for
short semes in this world!

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.939 position:50% align:center
I could be one of those.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:56.317 position:50% align:center
BL stories can always use more
of that character type anyway!

00:13:03.074 --> 00:13:04.617 position:50% align:center
Sasaki.

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:10.081 position:50% align:center
Miya... no.

00:13:10.165 --> 00:13:13.209 position:50% align:center
Stop it, me! It isn't like that!

00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:15.545 position:50% align:center
Why do I turn
everything into BL?

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.339 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me, Sasaki!

00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:21.676 position:50% align:center
[yells]

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Hirano.
Sasaki says he went home early.

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:35.065 position:50% align:center
Already? Why is that?
Is he skipping, or sick?

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.318 position:50% align:center
Dunno, all he texted was,
"It's too much. Going home."

00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:40.570 position:50% align:center
What's too much, I wonder?

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:57.545 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Being that close, it's too much.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:22.696 position:50% align:center
[sighs] I'll go and grab it.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
The wind's strong
this time of year.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.075 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Yeah, well,
at least the breeze is nice.

00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:29.452 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Tashiro. Don't set
that on top of the worksheets.

00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.705 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Yikes! That was a close one!

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:33.707 position:50% align:center
Warn a guy sooner
next time, would ya?

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.251 position:50% align:center
Last time I checked,
I wasn't your babysitter.

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.752 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Hm? Big bro?

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:39.838 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Nope, you're older than I am.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:46.177 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It must be around here.

00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.637 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Sweetie, look,
I already told you,

00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.806 position:50% align:center
it's not because you're
a fujoshi, all right?

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.434 position:50% align:center
I wa-- Hey! [sighs]

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.728 position:50% align:center
She hung up on me again.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.773 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
The fudanshi!

00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:02.318 position:50% align:center
I mean, yeah,
but my name's Miyano.

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:05.071 position:50% align:center
It's pretty weird seeing you,
why are you way over here?

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:06.948 position:50% align:center
Chasing a runaway worksheet.

00:15:07.032 --> 00:15:09.367 position:50% align:center
Huh? Oh, here it is.

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.001 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I thought he was
intimidating at first,

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
but he actually
seems pretty nice.

00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center
Anyway, were you talking to
your girlfriend just now?

00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:27.344 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sorry, never mind!

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
Hit a nerve there.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.805 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA sighs]
You heard, huh?

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:33.391 position:50% align:center
She and I are in the middle of
a big argument.

00:15:33.475 --> 00:15:35.101 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.354 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] We've been fighting
for two whole months.

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:38.938 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That's a long time.

00:15:39.022 --> 00:15:40.190 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Yeah, no kidding.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
I stopped by her house
the other day,

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:43.777 position:50% align:center
hoping we could work things out.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.237 position:50% align:center
But when I went inside,
I heard her on the phone.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.655 position:50% align:center
She was shouting stuff like,

00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
"Delinquent ukes are great!"

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.534 position:50% align:center
so I just left without a word.

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
Needless to say, the fight's
been going on ever since.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:57.874 position:50% align:center
It's awful, but I
don't know what to do.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.167 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I know what he means,

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.294 position:50% align:center
fujoshi can be
pretty passionate.

00:16:01.378 --> 00:16:03.421 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] By the way,
since you're a fudanshi.

00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.422 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:05.882 --> 00:16:07.926 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, yes?

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:10.512 position:50% align:center
Look, I've got a question
I want you to answer.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:11.846 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Uh...

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center
Tell me honestly,
do I seem like an uke to you?

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:15.517 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.560 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Not an "uke to you,"
that's not what I meant!

00:16:17.644 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I didn't say it was!

00:16:21.106 --> 00:16:22.357 position:50% align:center
Here's the problem.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.859 position:50% align:center
An uke is kinda wimpy, right?

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:26.111 position:50% align:center
So, I gotta be more manly

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
so she'll see me
as her boyfriend!

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.115 position:50% align:center
Except, if I don't know
what it is about me

00:16:30.198 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
that makes her think
I'm an "uke,"

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
then it won't do me any good
to try and change.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.287 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:16:36.371 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
I figured maybe
there's a way I can

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:40.291 position:50% align:center
avoid tripping her
"moe-dar" or whatever,

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:43.044 position:50% align:center
so I dug through every manga
she had and read them.

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
I can't unsee it.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.589 position:50% align:center
One book had a delinquent
and a slime?

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:47.841 position:50% align:center
And now I'm even more confused

00:16:47.924 --> 00:16:49.801 position:50% align:center
than I was when
this all started.

00:16:49.884 --> 00:16:52.929 position:50% align:center
I have no idea what that
crazy woman wants from me!

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:55.348 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It seemed like
a logical dilemma at first,

00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:57.809 position:50% align:center
but now I'm getting weirded out.

00:16:57.892 --> 00:17:00.770 position:50% align:center
Okay. Well, it's not
really my place

00:17:00.854 --> 00:17:03.815 position:50% align:center
to comment on the kind of
manga your girlfriend likes,

00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
but let's look at
the big picture here.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.193 position:50% align:center
She's going out with you,

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:10.071 position:50% align:center
so that obviously means
she enjoys being around you.

00:17:10.155 --> 00:17:12.073 position:50% align:center
Her liking BL
doesn't change that.

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.201 position:50% align:center
She can like you and
like BL at the same time.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:18.955 position:50% align:center
You might bear some similarities
to her favorite character type,

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
but I still think she likes you
as her boyfriend,

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:23.043 position:50% align:center
first and foremost.

00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's good to know.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Some people like to
mix those interests together,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.967 position:50% align:center
but I'd better not say that.

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:34.387 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Is that how you are, too?

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:35.430 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.765 position:50% align:center
I remember you
telling Sasaki once

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:39.934 position:50% align:center
that you didn't look at him
as material for BL.

00:17:40.018 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
Do you keep those
things separate

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.562 position:50% align:center
because he's your boyfriend?

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.981 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Whoa!
You've got it all wrong!

00:17:45.065 --> 00:17:47.108 position:50% align:center
We're not together!

00:17:47.192 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, man. I assumed
you both were into guys.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.321 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:53.198 --> 00:17:54.866 position:50% align:center
Well, no, I'm not.

00:17:59.245 --> 00:18:01.414 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Not that it matters either way.

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:03.166 position:50% align:center
It's none of my business.

00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:07.754 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] But hey,
I appreciate the advice.

00:18:08.713 --> 00:18:10.215 position:50% align:center
And if we don't break it off,

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
maybe I'll introduce you
to my girlfriend.

00:18:15.428 --> 00:18:17.764 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I meant to ask,
how tall are you?

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:18.932 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
I'm six feet even.

00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:19.933 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, really?

00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:21.393 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That sounds like Mya.

00:18:21.476 --> 00:18:22.727 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] ...I was barely
five-foot-seven.

00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:24.813 position:50% align:center
Bit of a late bloomer, I guess.

00:18:24.896 --> 00:18:26.481 position:50% align:center
But by second year
I was five-eleven,

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:28.775 position:50% align:center
so maybe you'll hit
a growth spurt, too.

00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.235 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You think so?

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.152 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
It might depend on...

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Who's he talking to?

00:18:33.613 --> 00:18:35.365 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] You're at
perfect head-pat height.

00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:37.826 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.500 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:18:53.717 --> 00:18:56.386 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's just Ogasawara.
What's up, man?

00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:58.471 position:50% align:center
Wh-Wh-What's up with you
is what I'd like to know!

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry if I startled you.

00:19:00.473 --> 00:19:01.641 position:50% align:center
That's okay.

00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] You scared
the crap out of me, man!

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]
My bad.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:07.397 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] My heart almost
burst out of my chest.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:10.900 position:50% align:center
I was asking him for some advice

00:19:10.984 --> 00:19:13.153 position:50% align:center
on what to do
about my girlfriend.

00:19:13.236 --> 00:19:16.406 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, I forgot.
Are you two still fighting?

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center
She asked me to
meet up with her today,

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.534 position:50% align:center
so I guess we'll find out.

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:22.037 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Mmm. Gotcha.
Good luck with that.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:25.165 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Miyano!

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.752 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I better head back now.

00:19:28.835 --> 00:19:32.714 position:50% align:center
Um. I hope everything works out
okay with your girlfriend.

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.258 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.011 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I'll catch ya
later then.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:40.138 position:50% align:center
Bye-bye!

00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:42.766 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
No subtlety at all.

00:19:42.849 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Well, I should get going myself.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:45.977 position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.538 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry, man, I just assumed
you were both into guys.

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:11.711 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Even though I like
BL manga, I'm actually not.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I mean--

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.636 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Back when
I was in middle school,

00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:23.682 position:50% align:center
I had a crush on a girl,
so I can't be.

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:32.482 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] And yet, somehow,
I get this tightness in my chest

00:20:32.565 --> 00:20:34.776 position:50% align:center
whenever I think about Sasaki.

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I never thought I did...

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
...but maybe, I do like guys.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:53.545 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I wonder if he does.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:01.094 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Suddenly, I'm kind of anxious.

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
Thanks for doing the trash.

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:09.561 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
No prob.

00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:20.363 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I couldn't control myself.

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:25.577 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It won't stop.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.413 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI groans]

00:21:28.496 --> 00:21:32.000 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't startle me
like that. What's wrong?

00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:34.461 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Eh, it's nothing.

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:36.713 position:50% align:center
So, what's the next subject?

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:38.214 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Math III.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.847 position:50% align:center
What to do now?

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:23.903 position:50% align:center
You're already fighting again?
What happened this time?

00:23:23.987 --> 00:23:25.822 position:50% align:center
I thought it was okay
after you realized

00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:28.867 position:50% align:center
that she doesn't see you
as a BL character.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.455 position:50% align:center
She ruined my favorite manga
by imagining it as BL!

00:23:34.873 --> 00:23:39.377 position:50% align:center
That sounds bad.
Do you mind if I leave now?

00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.629 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
I'll come, too.

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:44.507 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Some headcanons
should stay in your head.
