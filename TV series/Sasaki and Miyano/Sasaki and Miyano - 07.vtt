[TORIHARA]
The cultural festival will have

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.597 position:50% align:center
a cross-dressing competition.

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.017 position:50% align:center
We'll decide who represents
our class with a vote.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.477 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That sounds like a BL plot!

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.187 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Huh?

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.613 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hirano, I think
I might be in trouble!

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
Hello to you, too.

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:08.253 position:50% align:center
Hey, hey, hey!

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:09.754 position:50% align:center
What's going on in here?

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.758 position:50% align:center
Oh, Chairman. Miyano here
has agreed to rep the class

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.720 position:50% align:center
in the cross-dressing
competition.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.596 position:50% align:center
Listen, if you
don't wanna do it,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
just refuse with
the same energy you have

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:22.559 position:50% align:center
when you ask me
about my personal life.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:24.019 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That's sort of a separate issue,

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:25.520 position:50% align:center
so not the same thing.

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.856 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Oh yeah? How, exactly?

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.651 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Oh, my. So much drama!

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:34.154 position:50% align:center
All over a silly little pageant!

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.072 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.283 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] The Cultural Festival
Committee shook things up

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.076 position:50% align:center
when they wrested
permission to hold it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.121 position:50% align:center
despite objections from
the Student Council.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.041 position:50% align:center
Yes. Remembering
the look of shock

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.751 position:50% align:center
on the Student Council
President's face

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.753 position:50% align:center
is still hysterical.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.297 position:50% align:center
Well, you're easily
amused, aren't you?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.882 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Personally,
I don't know if I'd call that

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.134 position:50% align:center
a look of amusement exactly.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:59.346 position:50% align:center
Aren't you insecure about
looking like a girl, Miyano?

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.638 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Everyone said they'd help me,

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.432 position:50% align:center
and I'm willing
to be a team player,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.017 position:50% align:center
so if it's just this once.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.770 position:50% align:center
Oh? You've changed
your attitude.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.688 position:50% align:center
Find your fish in the sea?

00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:09.814 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What?!

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
Th-Th-Th-Th--
That's not it at all!

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.485 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Really.

00:03:14.903 --> 00:03:16.488 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why would a
boys' school do something

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.782 position:50% align:center
as blatantly BL-ish as a
cross-dressing competition?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.992 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA]
The votes are tallied.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
The class representative
is Miyano.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:26.581 position:50% align:center
That's ridiculous!

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center
I think a tall beefy guy would
have a much better chance!

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
Look man, you're the best shot
we have to win this.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
Seriously, they're mocking us!

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
The Class A guys are saying

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.094 position:50% align:center
our class is full of
"butterfaces"

00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.721 position:50% align:center
and that we're
a bunch of ugly losers!

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.306 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
So, it's personal?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.767 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA] Kuresawa can stand by
to sub in for you if that helps!

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.604 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'd be all right
with that. Whatcha think?

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:53.733 position:50% align:center
Come on, you don't have to
wear a super girly outfit.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.901 position:50% align:center
I'm begging you here!

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.444 position:50% align:center
He's desperate.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.613 position:50% align:center
Well, long as I can
change my mind.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.198 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll cover for you.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.950 position:50% align:center
My girlfriend
will think it's hot.

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:05.495 position:50% align:center
Hell to the yeah!
We're gonna destroy Class A!

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:08.373 position:50% align:center
You can back out any time,
I promise I'll step in for you.

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.000 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Yeah, dude, same goes for me!

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.460 position:50% align:center
Wow, cool. Thanks a lot.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.172 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I'm really not as
anxious about cross dressing

00:04:16.256 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center
or my face as I
normally would be.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Kuresawa and
Tashiro supporting me

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
might be a big part of it,
but there's something else.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.517 position:50% align:center
I understand that you
might end up taller than me.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.852 position:50% align:center
And who knows,
maybe your face'll

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.062 position:50% align:center
end up different one day, too.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.605 position:50% align:center
But truth be told--

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.110 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why in the world did I
just think of Sasaki again?

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:38.445 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:41.531 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] His hair is
totally untamed and wild.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.201 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] You don't seem as
upset as I thought you'd be.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.162 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Just standing
there would be okay,

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.872 position:50% align:center
I think I could handle that.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.291 position:50% align:center
I mean, I can do it, but--

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:53.460 position:50% align:center
You don't sound too sure there.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.338 position:50% align:center
At first they said my outfit
wouldn't need to be super girly,

00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
but then everything changed.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.007 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 7A]
Well, if we're doing this,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.759 position:50% align:center
let's do a sailor uniform!

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.010 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 7B]
I'm team blazer.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:03.636 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.015 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Everybody stop.
I only had one condition.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]
You can guess what kinds of DVDs

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
they have at home
from their suggestions.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.941 position:50% align:center
Oh? So those ideas
were from movies?

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Want me to
bring you some outfits to try?

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:23.948 position:50% align:center
[gasps] I never expected you
to have some for me to try.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.325 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Is that his thing?

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:27.869 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] My goodness,
what on earth is that tone for?

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:29.329 position:50% align:center
The clothes aren't mine.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.538 position:50% align:center
My older sister is something

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:32.832 position:50% align:center
of an anime
connoisseur, you see.

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.336 position:50% align:center
She has lots of outfits and
accessories for dressing up.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.590 position:50% align:center
Anime, plus special outfits,
equals cosplay!

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:41.925 position:50% align:center
Oh look, cards.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.843 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's kinda surprising
no one's claimed them.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
Yes, isn't it though?

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:50.350 position:50% align:center
Well. Let's have a little
contest. Loser has to lock up.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.688 position:50% align:center
Follow my lead, 'kay?
The game is Old Maid.

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:56.940 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO, MIYANO]
He just wants to goof off.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:06:01.444 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's already pretty late.

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.571 position:50% align:center
The Disciplinary
Committee's still here?

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.532 position:50% align:center
Wonder if Mya's around.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:09.619 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's Sasaki, hello there!

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:11.538 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, hey, what's up?

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.081 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Here's these.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
We're playing Old Maid,
but I have to leave.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.126 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
I forgot about a
ping-pong club meeting.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.505 position:50% align:center
In you go, I promise
I'll return the favor.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.840 position:50% align:center
That's cool, I gue--

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:24.634 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I gotta run.
Have fun and all that jazz!

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Are you kidding me?

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.016 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Why do you have
so many cards left in your hand?

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.810 position:50% align:center
Because the Chairman
made pairs every freaking time!

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.646 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Am I just really bad
at Old Maid or something?

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.356 position:50% align:center
Well, uh, fun fact,
I heard somewhere

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.358 position:50% align:center
that the first person
to draw the joker

00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.110 position:50% align:center
is the most likely to lose.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.361 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:45.822 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So. I'm guessing
Mya had it first.

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.451 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I lost!

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:52.203 position:50% align:center
I do believe I told you
to watch out for the joker.

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.957 position:50% align:center
This game is too psychological!
I thought you were bluffing!

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:59.127 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] All right, loser.
Don't forget to lock up.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
I'm outta here.

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.213 position:50% align:center
Okay. See you later.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:05.800 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki, you don't
have to stick around.

00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.886 position:50% align:center
Sorry for dragging you
into my job.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.637 position:50% align:center
It's all good.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Are you taking the key
back to the staff room?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:14.434 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Cool, I'll come with.

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:17.395 position:50% align:center
Do you need to see a teacher?

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:19.731 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
No. I don't need to see anyone.

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.694 position:50% align:center
I just wanna spend time
with the person I like.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:28.907 position:50% align:center
You--what now?

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.993 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Excuse me!

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:38.500 position:50% align:center
I brought back the Discipline
Committee's key! Hello?

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:44.255 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I told him
I would think about it.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.093 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
"You don't know if you like me?"

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.054 position:50% align:center
"Then. Did you hate that?"

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.731 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
BL. Ugh.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:06.319 position:50% align:center
Sasaki and I... Is it BL?

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:07.821 position:50% align:center
Should I...?

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:11.616 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.119 position:50% align:center
Ah! Stop this nonsense!

00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:16.079 position:50% align:center
Try to think of something else!

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.415 position:50% align:center
Don't turn it into BL!

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.878 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey there, Sasaki.

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.880 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, hi, Mya.

00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:27.799 position:50% align:center
Are you on your way home?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.467 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yup. Let's walk together.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.219 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sure.

00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh, right. Here.
I finished reading it.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.891 position:50% align:center
I like this author's work a lot.

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
The very first manga
you ever lent me

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:40.520 position:50% align:center
was by this same person,
wasn't it?

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
Uh, yes! I'm so glad.
I really like that author, too.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.903 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] You know,
since it was so good,

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:52.615 position:50% align:center
I tried to convince my sister
she had to read it.

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:54.284 position:50% align:center
But she was too busy
doing a report

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.994 position:50% align:center
or something like
that for college.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:58.121 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's a pretty big risk.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.123 position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
You have to take into account

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.586 position:50% align:center
people have strong feelings
about this kind of stuff.

00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:07.088 position:50% align:center
Some of them really hate it, so,

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:08.673 position:50% align:center
you just have to be
careful not to show it

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.717 position:50% align:center
to others without
warning them first.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.679 position:50% align:center
Ohh. Yeah, guess I was
pretty surprised at first.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.056 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm sorry!

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
But thanks to that,
I found some good manga to read,

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center
and I also met someone new
who I like talking to.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:22.812 position:50% align:center
So, I'm glad.

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:27.233 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why is Sasaki so...

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.694 position:50% align:center
You've got a point.

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
I mean, we wouldn't have these

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:33.114 position:50% align:center
kinds of conversations
if not for that.

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.575 position:50% align:center
And I like them, so, thanks.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:37.577 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sure. And thanks to you, too.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.038 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm? Why thank me?

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.082 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Because I feel like it.

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.876 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm gonna go buy a drink.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
You'll wait here for me?

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:47.462 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah.

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:51.883 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA]
Miyano?

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:55.136 position:50% align:center
Oh my god, it's totally you,
it's been so long!

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
Makimura?

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:57.806 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA giggles]

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you forgot
your old middle school classma--

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.101 position:50% align:center
Your stuff is falling out.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.395 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Paints?

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:05.563 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA]
Yeah. Thanks.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.067 position:50% align:center
So, you're still painting,
I guess, huh?

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.278 position:50% align:center
Sure am. I'm here getting
supplies for the art club.

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I'd almost forgotten,
she used to walk around

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
carrying canvases
back then, too.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.159 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA]
Wait, while I've got you,

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.453 position:50% align:center
Miyano, will you model for me?

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.038 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, that's sudden.

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:23.790 position:50% align:center
Makimura, who's the guy?

00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:25.166 position:50% align:center
That your boyfriend?

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.459 position:50% align:center
No, stop teasing.

00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
He's a middle school
classmate I just ran into.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.297 position:50% align:center
I'll meet you at the teacher's
car in just a second, okay?

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.173 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND 7A]
Gotcha.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:33.049 position:50% align:center
[FRIEND 7B]
C'mon. Let's go.

00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.175 position:50% align:center
Are you sure?

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.428 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Right now,
the only mission I have

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:38.722 position:50% align:center
is to recruit you
as my personal model!

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:40.098 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sorry, I've gotta pass.

00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
Aww. That's twice
in a row now, bummer.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.144 position:50% align:center
Twice in a row?

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:47.188 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Remember
in middle school?

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.024 position:50% align:center
I wanted you to model
in girl clothes.

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
But you shot me down then, too.

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.404 position:50% align:center
You'd look cute!

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:56.239 position:50% align:center
Forget it.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.199 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hold on,
that was what you meant?

00:10:58.283 --> 00:11:00.910 position:50% align:center
Huh? What was what I meant?

00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:03.246 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I always figured
that she wanted

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
to take photos of me
in girls' clothes

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.417 position:50% align:center
so she could make fun
of me or something.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA] Here's the thing.
When we were in middle school,

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
your features were
soft and elegant!

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:13.965 position:50% align:center
Dare I say androgynous?

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
Anyway, as soon as I noticed
that, I knew I had to paint you!

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.387 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I completely misread her.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.723 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What's up?

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.516 position:50% align:center
Trying to decide what kind of
outfits you'd look best in,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
since your frame's
a bit more masculine now.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
Your jawline and arms
give you away as a guy.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
I should pick something
that distracts from those.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.690 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I just said no.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:32.609 position:50% align:center
You've gotten a bit taller, too.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:33.860 position:50% align:center
If I remember correctly,

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.779 position:50% align:center
I was the tall one in
our middle school days.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:37.614 position:50% align:center
No way, I know I had you beat.

00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.115 position:50% align:center
Trust me, I wouldn't forget.

00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:40.408 position:50% align:center
It was by less than an inch.

00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.993 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA] That's nothing!
You might as well...

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's odd. This doesn't
feel awkward at all.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.375 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA]
Remember how Motoyama...

00:11:48.458 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It used to bother me
so much. Could it be...

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:55.006 position:50% align:center
I'll still feel the same.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.760 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] ...because of
what Sasaki told me?

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.179 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA]
And your hands, too! Look!

00:12:01.262 --> 00:12:03.098 position:50% align:center
Put your left hand
up against mine.

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:04.808 position:50% align:center
Okay, sure.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.730 position:50% align:center
The bone structure in
your hands is manly enough.

00:12:16.695 --> 00:12:18.071 position:50% align:center
Stop it.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.536 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Makimura!
I'll see you around!

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:27.914 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA]
Wow...

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.501 position:50% align:center
That expression was amazing!
I have to paint it!

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.548 position:50% align:center
Hey. Slow down.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.263 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry for
getting in the way.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:44.931 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:45.015 --> 00:12:48.768 position:50% align:center
You weren't in
the way. Trust me.

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
We were basically
finished talking.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:53.481 position:50% align:center
That's good.

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.486 position:50% align:center
So, I gotta know.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.197 position:50% align:center
You told me before
about a girl you like.

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:02.532 position:50% align:center
That was her, wasn't it?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.616 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
A girl that I used to like.

00:13:18.089 --> 00:13:22.302 position:50% align:center
But I don't feel that way about
her anymore, as it turns out.

00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:27.515 position:50% align:center
[sighs] Gotcha.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:34.689 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sorry for doing that.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:38.651 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I hope I didn't hurt
you when I pulled you away.

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.321 position:50% align:center
It's fine. That was no big deal.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:43.281 position:50% align:center
I mean, I am a guy, remember?

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.408 position:50% align:center
Takes more than that to hurt me.

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:49.871 position:50% align:center
It has nothing to do with
what your gender is.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
I don't want to be rough
with someone I like.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:06.763 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, Sasaki,

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:10.433 position:50% align:center
don't just say stuff
like that unexpectedly.

00:14:10.517 --> 00:14:12.352 position:50% align:center
I'm blushing.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:15.355 position:50% align:center
Miya--

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.399 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 7E] This is bad!
We missed the train!

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:20.235 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 7F] I was winded
from running up the steps!

00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:23.613 position:50% align:center
Let's hop to it.

00:14:23.697 --> 00:14:24.906 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:14:30.954 --> 00:14:32.288 position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:36.084 position:50% align:center
When I said that just now,

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:38.962 position:50% align:center
I wasn't trying to
pressure you to answer.

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:41.464 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.729 position:50% align:center
[MAKIMURA] The bone structure
in your hands is manly enough.

00:14:56.646 --> 00:14:59.482 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] So, my hands are
masculine at least.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.989 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wow, his are way bigger!

00:15:06.072 --> 00:15:07.365 position:50% align:center
Is there something wrong?

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:10.035 position:50% align:center
Huh? No way,
I've never been better!

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI'S MOM] You can go home
after you put that out,

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:16.041 position:50% align:center
and take some bread
with you, too.

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:19.336 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That girl I saw.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:22.213 position:50% align:center
Mya had a crush on her.

00:15:22.297 --> 00:15:25.216 position:50% align:center
I don't even remember her face.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.635 position:50% align:center
It's a wonderful
morning, isn't it?

00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:29.179 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Huh? I mean, yes.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
Yes. Sure is.

00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:35.352 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] But I think
she was smaller than him.

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:39.022 position:50% align:center
Then again, I guess that makes
sense for a girl and a guy.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
She and I were usually
in the same group then.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.402 position:50% align:center
So, we would always
sit together.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:46.112 position:50% align:center
She was really easy to talk to.

00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:47.489 position:50% align:center
Back in middle school,

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:49.491 position:50% align:center
I heard about my
feminine face all the time,

00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:50.992 position:50% align:center
especially from the girls.

00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:52.577 position:50% align:center
It wasn't malicious,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.207 position:50% align:center
but still, it just started to
get under my skin after a while.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.585 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] She was one of
the people who said it.

00:16:00.669 --> 00:16:03.254 position:50% align:center
I know now that
I misunderstood her.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
But after that,
it got more and more

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:07.759 position:50% align:center
difficult for me
to be around her.

00:16:07.842 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
So, that was that.

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:13.223 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I get it.

00:16:13.306 --> 00:16:15.558 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He told me about it freely,

00:16:15.642 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
so that probably means
he's over the whole thing.

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:21.773 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Still, though.

00:16:21.856 --> 00:16:24.359 position:50% align:center
Even if he doesn't
like her in that way,

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:28.113 position:50% align:center
she might have
feelings for him, right?

00:16:28.196 --> 00:16:30.490 position:50% align:center
Damn, this sucks.

00:16:30.573 --> 00:16:34.661 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're already in a new
school term and everything.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
Oh, good morning, Sasaki.
I didn't see you.

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:42.293 position:50% align:center
Hey, how's it going, Kuresawa?

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:43.920 position:50% align:center
It's kind of early, huh?

00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
What's going on, do you live
around this area or something?

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:48.258 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
No, not exactly.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
The hospital
my girlfriend's staying at

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.511 position:50% align:center
is pretty close to here,
that's all.

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:52.804 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh.

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:55.140 position:50% align:center
I went over there yesterday
to study with her.

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:58.476 position:50% align:center
But apparently, I left
my notebook in her room.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.603 position:50% align:center
I'm just going to
pick it up before school.

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.397 position:50% align:center
That makes sense.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.442 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Didn't know his
girlfriend was in the hospital.

00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:07.360 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] So, are you
working an early shift?

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:08.319 position:50% align:center
Wait, what?

00:17:08.403 --> 00:17:09.863 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I just assumed.

00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.449 position:50% align:center
I saw you working
at a bakery a while back.

00:17:12.532 --> 00:17:14.409 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure if
I should bother you.

00:17:14.492 --> 00:17:17.412 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right. My family owns the place.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
But I only help
if I wake up early.

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:22.083 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Wow, that's pretty cool.

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:24.836 position:50% align:center
I wonder if Miyano
knows about that.

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.463 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
So, do you get a lot of chances

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
to go visit your girlfriend?

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:30.216 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Yeah, whenever
I don't have club.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
I didn't go there
after that fight, either.

00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:34.721 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah.

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
I never got to thank you
for breaking it up that day.

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:39.225 position:50% align:center
I'm glad you were there.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:43.438 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It's fine.
Really, don't worry about it.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
Besides, I didn't
exactly break it up,

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:46.900 position:50% align:center
just got my butt kicked.

00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.779 position:50% align:center
Anyway. Can I use
the drink machine?

00:17:50.862 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Sure. Oh yeah,
now that you mention it,

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.242 position:50% align:center
what were you and those guys
fighting over to begin with?

00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.994 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Well, to be honest,

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.038 position:50% align:center
I should've been
minding my own business.

00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:03.458 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec. You were the one
who started the whole thing?

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:04.709 position:50% align:center
I got mad.

00:18:04.793 --> 00:18:07.128 position:50% align:center
They were badmouthing
each other's girlfriends

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:10.256 position:50% align:center
and I had just had
a serious argument with mine.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.510 position:50% align:center
I guess I felt guilty about that
and took it out on them.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:16.805 position:50% align:center
I said some things
that were uncalled for.

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:19.599 position:50% align:center
But it won't happen again,
I can assure you.

00:18:19.683 --> 00:18:22.811 position:50% align:center
My girlfriend got upset.
It was a disaster.

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.979 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's good
to stay out of fights.

00:18:25.063 --> 00:18:28.066 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] This guy lives and
breathes for his girlfriend!

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.526 position:50% align:center
Oh, and by the way,

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:31.236 position:50% align:center
do you want to come by
and meet her sometime

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
when you're not too busy?

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:36.116 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Nah, I'm good.

00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.034 position:50% align:center
I wouldn't want to
impose on you.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:41.246 position:50% align:center
We wouldn't mind it,
but all right.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.748 position:50% align:center
Maybe after she
gets released, okay?

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.750 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mm-hm!

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:48.420 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] It'd be like
her manga came to life.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Sheesh, I guess
I'm a little on edge.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.055 position:50% align:center
I usually go back to sleep
in the mornings.

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, Sasaki! How are you doing?

00:19:03.518 --> 00:19:06.479 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh, right.
I caught the early train.

00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:08.648 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Good morning, Mya.

00:19:08.732 --> 00:19:11.192 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I owe you one, Kuresawa.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:12.819 position:50% align:center
You're always
listening to your music

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:14.571 position:50% align:center
during the ride
to school, aren't you?

00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Take a listen.

00:19:16.823 --> 00:19:18.033 position:50% align:center
Got some new tunage.

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:20.702 position:50% align:center
I just added a few
more albums yesterday.

00:19:20.785 --> 00:19:22.328 position:50% align:center
Let's play guess-the-song!

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:24.372 position:50% align:center
Y'sure? I don't think
we listen to

00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.249 position:50% align:center
a lot of the same music, though.

00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:28.585 position:50% align:center
I probably won't be
good at this game.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.795 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I s'pose that's true.

00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:33.173 position:50% align:center
I'll try to pick out a song
you would recognize then,

00:19:33.256 --> 00:19:34.466 position:50% align:center
how about that?

00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:36.760 position:50% align:center
Wait. I do know this one!

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
Yep, it's the theme
from a romance drama.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.472 position:50% align:center
It's pretty recent.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.891 position:50% align:center
Oh, right. I remember now.

00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.393 position:50% align:center
Wasn't sure if I
should pick it up.

00:19:45.477 --> 00:19:48.104 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I kept imagining it as BL.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:50.732 position:50% align:center
If you like it,
I can let you borrow the CD.

00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:52.233 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
The mood is totally different
from the second track on.

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:56.237 position:50% align:center
I think you'd really like it.

00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, in that case,
I'd love to try it.

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.951 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'll bring it
with me tomorrow then.

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:04.954 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I guess lending people
CDs is pretty common.

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
I've never been one to do that.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:08.792 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Well, I do it all the time.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:11.544 position:50% align:center
Ogasawara likes a lot of
the same bands I do.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:13.922 position:50% align:center
Oh, here,
I pulled up the lyrics.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:15.298 position:50% align:center
Borrowing CDs is cool 'cause

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.759 position:50% align:center
you get to see the album art
and all the fixin's.

00:20:17.842 --> 00:20:20.345 position:50% align:center
Exactly! That's kind of
the same experience

00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:21.971 position:50% align:center
you get when you borrow manga.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.932 position:50% align:center
I like holding the
physical copy in my hand,

00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.433 position:50% align:center
it's a whole lot better!

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:26.559 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I like him.

00:20:26.643 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'm getting
a little off-topic.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.063 position:50% align:center
No, I know what you mean.

00:20:30.146 --> 00:20:32.273 position:50% align:center
It's nice to line 'em
all up in a row.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.025 position:50% align:center
Then you can sort
them by creator.

00:20:34.109 --> 00:20:35.026 position:50% align:center
I do that, too!

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.569 position:50% align:center
It's so satisfying.

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:39.698 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I never thought about
it, but I do like physical CDs.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:42.575 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, by the way.

00:20:42.659 --> 00:20:45.453 position:50% align:center
A few new manga volumes came out
while we were on summer break.

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.330 position:50% align:center
So, we should probably
make a plan, huh?

00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:48.581 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh yeah!

00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.209 position:50% align:center
The manga, that's right,
thanks for reminding me.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.712 position:50% align:center
There was something
I wanted to tell you about.

00:20:53.795 --> 00:20:55.255 position:50% align:center
You remember that
one book you lent me

00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:56.673 position:50% align:center
right before the break?

00:20:56.756 --> 00:20:59.843 position:50% align:center
I saw that the next volume
was out, so I bought it.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:02.595 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It ended on a cliffhanger

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:04.180 position:50% align:center
and I don't like waiting!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:05.640 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh?!

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:08.810 position:50% align:center
You coming?

00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
So, you bought BL manga?

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
And it's just sitting in your
room right now, as we speak?

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.530 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah?

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.907 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, you don't
already have a lot of

00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:24.993 position:50% align:center
manga volumes
at your place, do you?

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:27.162 position:50% align:center
Nah, I don't really
buy them much.

00:21:27.245 --> 00:21:31.041 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] But you especially
wanted this one.

00:21:31.124 --> 00:21:34.878 position:50% align:center
Right. I was excited
to find out what...

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.217 position:50% align:center
That makes me so happy.

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.807 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Well, I have to be
in the classroom early today,

00:21:47.891 --> 00:21:49.893 position:50% align:center
so, I'll see you later!

00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:53.813 position:50% align:center
Uh, sure thing. But listen!

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:56.232 position:50% align:center
Let me know what you think of it
when you're finished, okay?

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:58.693 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, yeah! Yeah, I promise!

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.030 position:50% align:center
Hey, there you are, Sasaki.

00:22:02.113 --> 00:22:03.531 position:50% align:center
Oh. There was
something I wanted to--

00:22:03.615 --> 00:22:05.450 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Tell me later.

00:22:05.533 --> 00:22:06.576 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Seriously? What gives?

00:22:06.659 --> 00:22:08.745 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I don't want to pressure him.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.708 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] But I almost
hugged him just now!
