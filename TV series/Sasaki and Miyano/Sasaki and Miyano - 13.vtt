00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Here, we got you these
for you on our field trip.

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:17.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, they're from Hokkaido?

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah. We picked them
out for you guys.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HIRANO]
Well, they're definitely round.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.150 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
Thanks, guys!

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good to have treats
during the transition phase.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:28.737 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh-huh.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.655 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm glad you like them.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center line:84%
[meows]

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA] This stuff is
bound to happen sometimes.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.675 position:50% align:center line:84%
The best you can do is keep a
record of it just to be safe.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.302 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, and we should talk
about the lost and found.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.305 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EZAKI] Sweet, the new
vice chairman's taking notes.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.099 position:50% align:center line:84%
That means I can just
kick back and zone out

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:22.767 position:50% align:center line:84%
without anybody yelling at me.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.395 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA] Chairman?
You should take notes, too.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.814 position:50% align:center line:84%
Whoa, are you reading my mind?

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA] I think we went over
everything important.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.032 position:50% align:center line:84%
Should have, but if anything
else comes up, just ask us.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.450 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh no, that's okay.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wouldn't want to get in
the way of your studying.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'll just ask a teacher instead.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, you're never in
the way, little guy.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.332 position:50% align:center line:84%
Give him some space, Chairman.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.044 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh wait, I can't call you that.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.128 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hanzawa.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.172 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
Hm?

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sorry, he's got
such a pattable head.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.593 position:50% align:center line:84%
His hair's already a mess.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EZAKI laughs]

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just start doing what I
always did and throw a fit.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:01.681 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOUHAI laughs]
Oh yeah, you did!

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:02.724 position:50% align:center line:84%
Watch it.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.517 position:50% align:center line:84%
I told you, my head's
off-limits.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center line:84%
All right, fine, you win.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
Still, though.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.481 position:50% align:center line:84%
If there's ever
anything you need,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center line:84%
then I hope you'll
reach out to one of us.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.401 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HIRANO]
So do I.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:14.778 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hanzawa starts to get restless

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.987 position:50% align:center line:84%
when he doesn't
have enough work,

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:18.156 position:50% align:center line:84%
so you would be
doing him a favor.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh-- You're right.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.497 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
I'm really not busy these days.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.999 position:50% align:center line:84%
Midterms and the festival
are behind us.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:29.376 position:50% align:center line:84%
No more field trips.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.002 position:50% align:center line:84%
And now I've been
replaced as chairman,

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:34.005 position:50% align:center line:84%
so the title's just a formality.

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:35.382 position:50% align:center line:84%
I feel lost.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.009 position:50% align:center line:84%
You'll have lots of
studying to fill your time.

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center line:84%
Just enjoy the change of pace.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:46.226 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's easier said
than done for me, Hirano.

00:03:47.852 --> 00:03:49.270 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CAT 9A meows]

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA gasps]
I got it!

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.486 position:50% align:center line:84%
How about we go
beautify the campus?

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.073 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's an awful idea.
We have a committee for that.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:01.199 position:50% align:center line:84%
[knocking]

00:04:01.282 --> 00:04:02.951 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hello? It's open--

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.620 position:50% align:center line:84%
Excuse me, but I
don't suppose anyone

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
turned in a lost
keychain recently?

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.625 position:50% align:center line:84%
I haven't seen one, have you?

00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:15.213 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nope. Not here.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:16.631 position:50% align:center line:84%
[STUDENT 13A]
I was about to ride home when

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
I noticed my
bike key was missing.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.261 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've looked all over
the school, and no luck!

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center line:84%
My girlfriend made that
keychain. I've gotta find it!

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center line:84%
'Kay, here's what you do.
Let's make him a lost item form.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Oh, right!

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's your name
and class number?

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURESAWA]
Haven't seen you in a while.

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not since the festival, right?

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:40.864 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yep.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:45.368 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] Between that and the
field trip, the second term's

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.370 position:50% align:center line:84%
been pretty packed, hasn't it?

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:48.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURESAWA]
Yeah.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center line:84%
Listen. There's
something that I've

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.549 position:50% align:center line:84%
been meaning to ask you about.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:00.925 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:04.929 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] We'll let you know
if it turns up.

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:06.639 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, this keychain.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's got a felt figurine
of a cow, huh?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.687 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Yeah, it seemed like
it was really important to him.

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:15.315 position:50% align:center line:84%
--Great!
--Huh?

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.484 position:50% align:center line:84%
This sounds like
the perfect job for us!

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:18.777 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALL]
Huh?

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.739 position:50% align:center line:84%
The First Lost Item
Detective Squad is on the case!

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.867 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HIRANO] Are you pitching
a cartoon for preschool kids?

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're never too old
to revel in the satisfaction

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
of helping someone
in need, Hirano.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.624 position:50% align:center line:84%
Besides, it's slow
around here right now,

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:34.501 position:50% align:center line:84%
so it's nice to have a project.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:35.919 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm not so sure though.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
It seems like you just
want to be busy.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:40.924 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
Nah, it's to help people!

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:42.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Right.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.890 position:50% align:center line:84%
You said you have
a question for me.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.809 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, what is it?

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:55.980 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you and Miyano
a thing? Like, dating?

00:05:58.108 --> 00:05:59.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
No...

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.529 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't you think you should be?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, I wasn't asking
you that because

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wanted to gossip
about it with my

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center line:84%
fujoshi girlfriend
or anything, all right?

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.829 position:50% align:center line:84%
This isn't about her, I promise.

00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:13.415 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Uh, okay?

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:16.751 position:50% align:center line:84%
I don't know much about BL,
whether it's manga or real life.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:20.338 position:50% align:center line:84%
I just think it'd be nice if you
guys were together, that's all.

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:23.508 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURESAWA] Then again,
the only people who should

00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:25.593 position:50% align:center line:84%
have a say in that
are you and Miyano,

00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:27.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I won't get in
the middle of it.

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:29.222 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're both good
friends of mine,

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:32.058 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I'll support you
no matter what you decide.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm here for you.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.315 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks a lot.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center line:84%
That was all I
wanted to tell you.

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
What's going on, you guys?

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.614 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Mya!

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.324 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everything okay over here?

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.828 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, of course! Kuresawa, um...

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.914 position:50% align:center line:84%
I heard Sasaki was really
good at math problems,

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:56.916 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I asked him for help.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.168 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Yeah, long division.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.047 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, I get it now.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.424 position:50% align:center line:84%
I always thought Kuresawa
had pretty good grades in math,

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.301 position:50% align:center line:84%
but I guess you must
be even better.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.969 position:50% align:center line:84%
Good for you, Sasaki.

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center line:84%
Uh...

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:11.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's the truth!

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:16.478 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] It seems like Mya
hasn't told him anything,

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
so I just let him assume
I hadn't confessed yet.

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:21.900 position:50% align:center line:84%
What should I do?

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:25.111 position:50% align:center line:84%
The last thing I want
is to lie to Mya.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.239 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Hold on there!

00:07:28.323 --> 00:07:31.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
Be careful.
You'll get the floor dirty.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.036 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURESAWA] That's what
you're worried about?

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.412 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI giggles]

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:37.123 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sorry, little guy, we don't have
kitten mittens here.

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.750 position:50% align:center line:84%
[meows]

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.669 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, are you about to
head out, Mya?

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.629 position:50% align:center line:84%
How 'bout you and I
walk home together?

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:44.089 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, sorry, I can't.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.132 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm busy looking
for a lost item.

00:07:46.216 --> 00:07:47.509 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really, what is it?

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:49.636 position:50% align:center line:84%
A homemade keychain
with a cow charm on it

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.845 position:50% align:center line:84%
that's made of felt.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:53.139 position:50% align:center line:84%
It should be attached
to a bike lock key.

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have you seen
anything like that?

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.559 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI, KURESAWA]
Mm-mm.

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] The committee's
searching together.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.105 position:50% align:center line:84%
We even formed
a special task force called

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:03.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
the First Lost Item
Detective Squad.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.026 position:50% align:center line:84%
All that work for a keychain?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.194 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yep!

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.988 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'd love to help you
look, Mya. Let's go!

00:08:09.072 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
Are you sure?

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, why not, I don't have
anything else going on.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
That's so nice of you, thanks!

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:16.913 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURESAWA] Sorry, but I can't.
Girlfriend stuff.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.666 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Ah, I figured.
No worries, see you tomorrow.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.670 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KURESAWA]
Mm-hm. Later, Sasaki. Have fun.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, you, too.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:32.595 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] So, this must be
where the hunt begins, right?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.055 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guess so.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.850 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let's take a look over there.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:39.894 position:50% align:center line:84%
This blue bike is his.
He had to leave it behind today,

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:42.188 position:50% align:center line:84%
since he doesn't have
the key to ride it home.

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:46.985 position:50% align:center line:84%
Still don't see it.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:49.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah, neither do I.

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center line:84%
I thought it would help to have

00:08:50.488 --> 00:08:52.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
a fresh set of eyes,
but no luck.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, right. This kinda reminds me
of that one manga

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.747 position:50% align:center line:84%
you and me read together
about the police academy.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center line:84%
Exactly, even if somebody else
already investigated,

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.251 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's always worth
examining yourself!

00:09:03.335 --> 00:09:05.086 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sometimes another perspective
is all you need

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center line:84%
to discover the final clue and
crack the whole case wide open!

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center line:84%
--Don't you think so?
--[SASAKI] Mm-hm.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] Want to take
another look, then, Holmes?

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Sure!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.475 position:50% align:center line:84%
Did you lose something?

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:21.353 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO gasps]
Oh, hey, you scared me.

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:25.565 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] Ogasawara.
Never sneak up on him again.

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:27.275 position:50% align:center line:84%
[OGASAWARA]
Another nasty look!

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.903 position:50% align:center line:84%
Easy. I'm okay, I swear.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.696 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HIRANO]
Did you find it, Miyano?

00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:33.948 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
No, not yet.

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:35.075 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's this?

00:09:35.158 --> 00:09:36.618 position:50% align:center line:84%
Have we got ourselves
two new recruits

00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:39.204 position:50% align:center line:84%
for the Detective Squad already?

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.622 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center line:84%
So, we're looking for a
cow-shaped keychain, huh? Ah!

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:47.712 position:50% align:center line:84%
Nope, it's just a leaf.

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center line:84%
If you thought that
looked like a cow,

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
you should get
your eyes checked.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.342 position:50% align:center line:84%
--That's my friend.

Hey! Be careful.

00:09:58.181 --> 00:09:59.432 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't crowd around
people's feet,

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.351 position:50% align:center line:84%
or you might get stepped on.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.107 position:50% align:center line:84%
Do you have catnip
on you or something?

[OGASAWARA]
What? No.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.028 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Amazing! Animals can
sense things about people,

00:10:12.112 --> 00:10:13.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
and they love Ogasawara.

00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.615 position:50% align:center line:84%
He is a good guy!

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyway, why's this so difficult?

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:20.704 position:50% align:center line:84%
If I had found something,
I would put it

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:24.165 position:50% align:center line:84%
somewhere noticeable
so the owner could see it.

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:25.875 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's true!

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:29.129 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, we've picked
the whole place apart.

00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center line:84%
Where else could you
accidentally leave a keychain?

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.883 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, it wasn't
in his classroom.

00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:35.635 position:50% align:center line:84%
Or his shoe locker.

00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:38.054 position:50% align:center line:84%
What if he lost it when
he changed for gym?

[MIYANO gasps]
Maybe it's in the valuables bag!

catch up later on.

refill my drink really quick.

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:21.236 position:50% align:center line:84%
Come on, Mya.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.655 position:50% align:center line:84%
We might as well head on back
to the committee room, right?

00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure, sounds good.

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:29.411 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Hirano. We'll be there
when you're ready.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks. All right, then.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.958 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's time for you to
get back to your practice.

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.293 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aww, not yet, okay?

00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:40.005 position:50% align:center line:84%
I want to spend
some more time with you.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:46.511 position:50% align:center line:84%
There. Some time passed.
You better get going.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
Fine, then, meanie.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:55.854 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
It's kind of funny.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:57.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sometimes it seems like
you can never find something

00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.525 position:50% align:center line:84%
until you stop looking for it.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.068 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Yeah.

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:04.487 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.365 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Hey, that's right.

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:10.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
This is the hallway where we
were alone during the festival.

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:18.752 position:50% align:center line:84%
[gasps]

00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Look, Mya.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:23.882 position:50% align:center line:84%
There's something
I need to clear up,

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.717 position:50% align:center line:84%
or else I'm gonna feel weird.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.719 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh? Okay.

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:32.182 position:50% align:center line:84%
I wasn't really helping
Kuresawa with his math.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:33.933 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Hm? What?

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.935 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sorry,
I'm a little confused.

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:39.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Why would he lie
about something like that?

00:15:39.272 --> 00:15:42.233 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because he was asking me
if you and I were together.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:43.818 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:15:43.902 --> 00:15:46.863 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] Yeah. Apparently,
he picked up on the fact

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center line:84%
that I like you a long time ago.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center line:84%
He wanted to know
what our situation was.

00:15:53.453 --> 00:15:55.538 position:50% align:center line:84%
I doubt you said
anything about it,

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center line:84%
so he must've figured it out.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.253 position:50% align:center line:84%
I hope it's not too awkward.
It's my fault.

00:16:02.337 --> 00:16:03.380 position:50% align:center line:84%
If he ever mentions it,
you can--

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:06.257 position:50% align:center line:84%
No! I don't mind!

00:16:09.928 --> 00:16:12.180 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyway, I thought I should
tell you what happened,

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
so we're on the same page.

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:16.059 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm sure Kuresawa meant well.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:19.646 position:50% align:center line:84%
He probably just hid it from you
so you wouldn't be embarrassed.

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:22.273 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, I kinda... am.

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.152 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] I wonder how much
Kuresawa knows

00:16:26.236 --> 00:16:29.572 position:50% align:center line:84%
about my relationship
with Sasaki.

00:16:29.656 --> 00:16:32.617 position:50% align:center line:84%
He and his girlfriend
are really invested!

00:16:34.536 --> 00:16:36.246 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASKI] So, talking about
us getting together

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:38.164 position:50% align:center line:84%
makes him blush.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:42.544 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Miyano!

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:49.592 position:50% align:center line:84%
Did I hurt you?

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.846 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh no, I'm fine.
It just startled me.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, the important thing
is you're okay. Sorry.

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:57.976 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
No need to apologize!

00:16:58.059 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center line:84%
Who knows, you may have saved
the cat from getting hurt, too.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.355 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah.

00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:03.732 position:50% align:center line:84%
Isn't that right, buddy?

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center line:84%
[CAT 13B purrs]

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, is it just me or have there
been a lot of cats around today?

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:12.240 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Hm? This one's
holding something, too.

00:17:12.323 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really? What is it?

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:18.580 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Wait, this is the key
to the student council room!

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.710 position:50% align:center line:84%
Welcome back.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:24.753 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Chairman?

00:17:24.836 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center line:84%
Ex-Chairman, remember?

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:28.715 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's going on here?

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
Something turned up. Look!

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
[ALL gasp]

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.598 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Wow, where'd you find it?

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.725 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was in the
student council room.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:40.560 position:50% align:center line:84%
They misplaced their key.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:41.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
And with the door open,

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:44.147 position:50% align:center line:84%
it's turned into a hangout
for stray cats.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.649 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, wait, is it this key?

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:47.901 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah.

00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.986 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh, where did you find that?

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.905 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
A cat was carrying it.

00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.909 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA laughs]

00:17:55.992 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
I'm lost. Is something funny?

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.206 position:50% align:center line:84%
That's just perfect.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
You've got to love when things
come full-circle like this.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
I suppose I'll
tell you all, then,

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center line:84%
but it doesn't leave this room.

00:18:10.632 --> 00:18:12.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA] Okay, so,
the student council president

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:15.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
has a soft spot for
the stray cats around here,

00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:18.181 position:50% align:center line:84%
so he sometimes leaves
food out for them.

00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.308 position:50% align:center line:84%
Because of that,
the cats keep showing up.

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:22.310 position:50% align:center line:84%
They know it's a good place
for a little snack.

00:18:22.394 --> 00:18:23.728 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh yeah, that's right!

00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:25.939 position:50% align:center line:84%
I've noticed the bowls
sitting out quite a few times.

00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:27.315 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh yeah, so have I.

00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:28.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EZAKI]
Mm-hm.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:30.193 position:50% align:center line:84%
Everyone has.

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.445 position:50% align:center line:84%
I always assumed the teachers
or some of the staff

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center line:84%
were the ones feeding them.

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA laughs]
Cat's out of the bag!

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:38.868 position:50% align:center line:84%
It sounded like something

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:41.663 position:50% align:center line:84%
the Animal Appreciation Club
would've been doing.

00:18:41.746 --> 00:18:43.540 position:50% align:center line:84%
I didn't realize
we had that club.

00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center line:84%
Oh yeah. A lot of people
haven't heard of them

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center line:84%
since they don't recruit.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.839 position:50% align:center line:84%
But they're in the school
handbook and everything.

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:53.091 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
They keep a fairly low profile.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.010 position:50% align:center line:84%
The student council
president founded the club

00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center line:84%
after he was caught
feeding the cats.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:59.806 position:50% align:center line:84%
It's just him and one other
member, as far as I know.

00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.142 position:50% align:center line:84%
Really? Sounds sketchy!

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center line:84%
Well, he did file
the proper paperwork.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.229 position:50% align:center line:84%
I mean, what's the harm?

00:19:06.312 --> 00:19:08.440 position:50% align:center line:84%
They aren't costing
the school any money.

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.692 position:50% align:center line:84%
Let me guess,
you're the other member?

00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center line:84%
Don't be silly!
I don't have the time for that.

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.991 position:50% align:center line:84%
Anyway, the student council's
key went missing yesterday.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.743 position:50% align:center line:84%
The president tried to
find it without letting

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.163 position:50% align:center line:84%
anyone else in
on their little secret.

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.457 position:50% align:center line:84%
The problem was,
he'd corralled a bunch of cats

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.835 position:50% align:center line:84%
into the council room and
with no key to lock the door,

00:19:28.918 --> 00:19:31.504 position:50% align:center line:84%
they were accidentally
let loose all over campus.

00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center line:84%
We caught a few
and returned them...

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:37.385 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
...but they just ran off again.

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:39.971 position:50% align:center line:84%
It was quite a situation.

00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center line:84%
Eventually, we did fix it.

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.350 position:50% align:center line:84%
Though I must admit,

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center line:84%
I enjoyed seeing
the president so flustered.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.480 position:50% align:center line:84%
How entertaining.

00:19:48.563 --> 00:19:51.024 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay, now you're
freaking me out.

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:52.317 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
After that, he decided

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.568 position:50% align:center line:84%
he's going to
petition the school

00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:55.320 position:50% align:center line:84%
to officially adopt the cats,

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center line:84%
so perhaps this whole mess
was a blessing in disguise.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wow, that's a great idea!
I'm on board!

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:02.786 position:50% align:center line:84%
[BOTH]
So am I!

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:06.039 position:50% align:center line:84%
Great, but what's
inside the box?

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA chuckles]
I'm glad you asked.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
The cats picked up a variety of
lost items around campus,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.463 position:50% align:center line:84%
so the student council
was generous enough

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center line:84%
to gather them all into
one convenient place

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:17.884 position:50% align:center line:84%
for us to categorize!

00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.887 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HIRANO] Why is that our job?
Make them do it!

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.514 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA]
Now, that wouldn't be fair.

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:26.518 position:50% align:center line:84%
As the disciplinary committee,
lost articles are our purview.

00:20:26.601 --> 00:20:29.104 position:50% align:center line:84%
We mustn't shirk
our responsibilities!

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.523 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EZAKI] Come on,
it's almost time to go home!

00:20:31.606 --> 00:20:33.149 position:50% align:center line:84%
Not to worry.

00:20:33.233 --> 00:20:36.069 position:50% align:center line:84%
If we don't finish today,
I'll come and help you tomorrow!

00:20:36.152 --> 00:20:39.239 position:50% align:center line:84%
[EZAKI]
Yes! That I can live with!

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:41.700 position:50% align:center line:84%
Looks like we're busy again.

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Right. I'll take care of
returning this key

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.038 position:50% align:center line:84%
to the student council.

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:49.416 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
I appreciate it, Hanzawa.

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center line:84%
And let's tell that guy
we have his keychain.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:52.711 position:50% align:center line:84%
Okay!

00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.045 position:50% align:center line:84%
[KOUHAI]
Want me to call him?

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.423 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure, we'll let you handle that.

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:59.676 position:50% align:center line:84%
I guess the Detective Squad
is retiring now, huh?

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:02.721 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA] Aw, that's a shame.
We just established it!

00:21:02.804 --> 00:21:05.056 position:50% align:center line:84%
Can't we keep it going
for a little longer?

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.435 position:50% align:center line:84%
Shouldn't you focus on entrance
exams, not finding keys?

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:11.813 position:50% align:center line:84%
[HANZAWA laughs]

00:21:11.896 --> 00:21:13.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
Huh?

00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:19.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
You're covered in cat hair.

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:22.115 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO] Oh wow, you're right.
It's all over you, too!

00:21:22.198 --> 00:21:23.950 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI]
Oh, come on! Blech!

00:21:24.034 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center line:84%
Wait right here,
I'll get some tape.

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.537 position:50% align:center line:84%
Blech.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center line:84%
Thanks for your help today.
You made a big difference.

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:37.255 position:50% align:center line:84%
We never would have
succeeded without you.

00:21:37.339 --> 00:21:39.799 position:50% align:center line:84%
Aw, shucks, I didn't do nothin'.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.761 position:50% align:center line:84%
Sure you did. You caught
all those cats, right?

00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:45.263 position:50% align:center line:84%
They just fell into
my lap, but okay.

00:21:45.347 --> 00:21:47.140 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO chuckles]

00:21:48.725 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] So, is the
disciplinary committee

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:52.479 position:50% align:center line:84%
always this full of drama?

00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:54.189 position:50% align:center line:84%
[MIYANO]
Pretty much, yeah.

00:21:54.272 --> 00:21:55.857 position:50% align:center line:84%
[SASAKI] I was picturing
something more,

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center line:84%
I dunno, business-like?

00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:00.195 position:50% align:center line:84%
But I guess if Hirano
can be in it with dyed hair,

00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:02.530 position:50% align:center line:84%
it can't be too strict, huh?

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.993 position:50% align:center line:84%
Hey, Mya?

00:22:07.077 --> 00:22:08.536 position:50% align:center line:84%
What's up?

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.664 position:50% align:center line:84%
How's the new committee job?
You like it?

00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:14.167 position:50% align:center line:84%
Yeah!
