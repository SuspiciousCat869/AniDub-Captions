[SASAKI]
You don't fight fair, Mya.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.752 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:10.523 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.365 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That startled me.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.619 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Whoops, I'm sorry.
Here, your wig came off.

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.621 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, right, thanks.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.208 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I didn't even notice.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.627 position:50% align:center
[rattling]

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.045 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Huh? The door's locked.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.130 position:50% align:center
Wonder why that is?
Kinda weird.

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.049 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, yeah.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.636 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Listen, what I said before,

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.847 position:50% align:center
I was half-joking,
so don't worry about it, okay?

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.558 position:50% align:center
So, does that mean
you don't want me to drop out?

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.796 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Oh, hey there, Sasaki.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.297 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, Kuresawa!

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
Dig the look, you gonna be
doing the dress-up thing, too?

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Yeah, but I'm the backup,

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.302 position:50% align:center
so it's mostly just for fun.

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:24.055 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Ah, gotcha. Later.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:30.854 position:50% align:center
Poor Tashiro. Still can't tell--

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
Hey, What's the matter,
are you okay?

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:33.982 position:50% align:center
Uh yeah, I'm fine.

00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:35.191 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Hm?

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.863 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What the heck just happened?

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] There ya go!
I solved that one no prob!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.970 position:50% align:center
I see. That probably
means it's easy.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.848 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why did he respond that way?

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.476 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Miyano, why don't you
give this puzzle a shot?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.311 position:50% align:center
It says the difficulty
level's normal.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:12.854 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll try.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:16.733 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What did he mean?

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.278 position:50% align:center
Would you do it for me?

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:23.573 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Was he serious or not?

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.200 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO groans]

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:26.743 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Is that one too tricky?

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.371 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, I can handle it.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.999 position:50% align:center
Love is when you want to
do things for somebody.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.877 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If I'm being
honest with myself,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.674 position:50% align:center
in that moment,
I really wanted to hug him.

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.637 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I feel like
my heart might explode.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.769 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Is this what it means
to like someone?

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:57.107 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If we both like
each other and we start dating,

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.067 position:50% align:center
eventually we're gonna kiss--!

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.403 position:50% align:center
Whoa, wait a minute!
What am I thinking?

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.779 position:50% align:center
This is moving
way too fast for me!

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.364 position:50% align:center
I mean, we haven't even
been on a date yet!

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.075 position:50% align:center
Why would I jump
straight to the kissing part?

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] There is something
seriously wrong with my brain!

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.666 position:50% align:center
Is it me,
or is Miyano weird today?

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.084 position:50% align:center
Like what's his deal?

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.839 position:50% align:center
Huh. He was off before, too.
I'll talk to him later.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:21.965 position:50% align:center
Off, like how?

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.967 position:50% align:center
Never mind.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.636 position:50% align:center
Hey, Miyano, you wanna come
to the bookstore with me?

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.263 position:50% align:center
I need to buy a gift
for my girlfriend.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.849 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure. I have
nothing else going on.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.102 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Now that I look back on it,

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.687 position:50% align:center
maybe it's better that
I couldn't tell him

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.355 position:50% align:center
that I liked him right then.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
I mean, I did want to hug him,

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.944 position:50% align:center
but I've never
kissed anyone before.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
What if it made me realize
that I was wrong

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:47.949 position:50% align:center
and I didn't feel
that way about him?

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
He'd get hurt, wouldn't he?

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
I would never want to
do that to him.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.329 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
You okay?

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, sorry!

00:06:59.044 --> 00:07:01.254 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
This is complicated.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.299 position:50% align:center
I should think it through
before I say anything.

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:08.887 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Speaking of complicated,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.015 position:50% align:center
that BL series looks
like a complete mess.

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
Can't even fit all the tropes
into that little cover blurb.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.354 position:50% align:center
It must be a fun one.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.108 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] On one hand,
I want to listen to Sasaki,

00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
but dropping out
doesn't seem right, either.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.655 position:50% align:center
I'll probably feel
guilty either way.

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:30.367 position:50% align:center
Have a toothache?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.410 position:50% align:center
No, I'm fine.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:35.288 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I can't keep
making him wait like this.

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.957 position:50% align:center
I can't ever seem to
give him an answer.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:41.628 position:50% align:center
Not about the contest or
the other thing he asked me.

00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:42.879 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
If it's not a toothache,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.047 position:50% align:center
then what's the problem?

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.840 position:50% align:center
You keep on touching your cheek.

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Kuresawa, if your
girlfriend suddenly told you

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.681 position:50% align:center
to drop something,
how do you think you'd react?

00:07:52.764 --> 00:07:54.307 position:50% align:center
You mean drop the BL?

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.267 position:50% align:center
I think she would prefer
if I gave it to her.

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
I'm not talking about the BL.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.146 position:50% align:center
Something else that
you're involved with,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.898 position:50% align:center
like a school event.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:03.274 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
I'd drop it!

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.528 position:50% align:center
Uh, that is, it would depend on
the reason, of course.

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.698 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Wow, you didn't
even hesitate at first.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:14.327 position:50% align:center
I figured you would say
you'd give it up no matter what.

00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:15.787 position:50% align:center
If my sacrificing
something would

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
help her in some way, then sure.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.292 position:50% align:center
If she wasn't serious
and I still dropped it,

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.545 position:50% align:center
that would just
make her feel bad.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.091 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Hey, does this one
have sexy men?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.676 position:50% align:center
That's a requirement for her.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.511 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Yep! The manager
and his love interest

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:32.679 position:50% align:center
get a featured subplot,

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.514 position:50% align:center
and I'd say they're
both pretty sexy.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:35.974 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Two for one!

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.694 position:50% align:center
That would just
make her feel bad.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
If I wanted you to
quit the contest?

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.199 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's not just
because I want to do

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.618 position:50% align:center
what makes him happy.

00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:59.456 position:50% align:center
Sasaki really values the things
that are important to me.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
This story wouldn't have been
the same if it wasn't a BL.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.879 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Otherwise, I think
I would've brushed it off

00:09:05.962 --> 00:09:09.174 position:50% align:center
when he asked me
to quit the contest.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.093 position:50% align:center
It's not only about
admiring him.

00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:14.846 position:50% align:center
It's about being
true to myself, too.

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:19.142 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
So...

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.355 position:50% align:center
[sneezes]

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
You got a cold?

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
Feels like it.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:26.816 position:50% align:center
Go to bed early then.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.568 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Mom. I'll do my best.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.779 position:50% align:center
You're no son of mine.

00:09:30.862 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
--[KAGIURA] Hirano!
--Gym time?

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:33.865 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, Sasaki.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.992 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Cool.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What's up, Mya?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:42.499 position:50% align:center
Can we talk?

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.335 position:50% align:center
There's something I want to
tell you if you've got a second.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.795 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.882 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Well, it has to do
with the drag competition.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.677 position:50% align:center
Uh, yeah?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.179 position:50% align:center
Um, I just...

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:00.975 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm going to compete. Sorry.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.268 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:07.023 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.945 position:50% align:center
It's not because I care about
winning or anything like that.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:15.407 position:50% align:center
Maybe your face'll be
way different one day.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.617 position:50% align:center
It really stuck with me

00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:20.120 position:50% align:center
when you said you liked me
for more than my face.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:21.538 position:50% align:center
There you are--

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.665 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Crap! I almost interrupted.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.376 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I mean, I used to
be so self-conscious

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.003 position:50% align:center
about the way I looked.

00:10:28.086 --> 00:10:29.921 position:50% align:center
I thought if I wore
girls' clothes,

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:32.007 position:50% align:center
it would make me
feel even worse,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
you know, because of
everything that's happened.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.386 position:50% align:center
But it's not like that.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.513 position:50% align:center
My classmates are
helping me out with it,

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
and even giving me lines to say.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
Oh! And Hanzawa's put so much

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.728 position:50% align:center
time and effort
into the outfit, too.

00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Besides, now that
I'm in high school,

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.857 position:50% align:center
I don't get teased nearly
as much as I used to.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.068 position:50% align:center
So don't worry.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:54.988 position:50% align:center
I'm not afraid of
doing this contest.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:58.324 position:50% align:center
I said I would do it
and I'm going to.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:01.995 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, what I said
made him feel better?

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:06.124 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right. Good luck, then.

00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:14.257 position:50% align:center
I appreciate you being
honest about how you feel.

00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:15.967 position:50% align:center
I'll root for you.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:20.555 position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:24.976 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, are you wearing
the outfit I saw?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.644 position:50% align:center
Or something more revealing?

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:28.897 position:50% align:center
Well, the event's got
a student theme,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.524 position:50% align:center
so I don't think we'll be
showing very much skin,

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.693 position:50% align:center
and the chairman seems
to like that one best.

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.863 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, that's why
Hanzawa was there.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.156 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Anyway, I'm off.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.033 position:50% align:center
'Kay. See ya.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.410 position:50% align:center
--[MIYANO] Oh.
--[SASAKI] Hm?

00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.787 position:50% align:center
I was wondering.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.373 position:50% align:center
Will you have some free time
during the festival?

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm not sure yet.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.669 position:50% align:center
I'm still waiting to
find out my schedule.

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
If you can, do you want
to meet up that day?

00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.547 position:50% align:center
Check out the events and stuff?

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:57.008 position:50% align:center
Whoa-- Whoa. Are you sure?

00:11:57.092 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah! Let me know, okay?

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
Huh.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.063 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What did you hear?

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.315 position:50% align:center
Just you two planning a date.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.193 position:50% align:center
We're not exactly a couple,
per se, but yeah.

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.028 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO gasps]

00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:18.738 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He must've given it
a lot of thought

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:20.949 position:50% align:center
after we talked yesterday.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.541 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] I thought you told him
how you felt before summer.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.042 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah, he hasn't answered.

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.920 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Still? Couldn't he
have just said no

00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:36.589 position:50% align:center
for right now to
make things easier?

00:12:36.673 --> 00:12:37.966 position:50% align:center
I can wait.

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.592 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:43.972 position:50% align:center
If there's a chance later on,
then it's worth it.

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:51.271 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] It's weird when you say
sappy stuff like that. Stop it.

00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
[groans]

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:05.368 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh, so that college
seminar thing today.

00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:06.286 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Yeah?

00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:07.704 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Is it cool if I skip it?

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:08.872 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
No!

00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:20.091 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI sneezing]

00:13:24.971 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
You should go see the nurse.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:27.182 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 9A]
Don't get us sick!

00:13:27.265 --> 00:13:28.433 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm not sick.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
I just studied
too much, that's all.

00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:33.563 position:50% align:center
Sounds more like a bad cold.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] If you have to
stay home during the festival,

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.609 position:50% align:center
then you're going to
miss out on your date.

00:13:37.692 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI gasps]

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.945 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] We're almost done
with test prep.

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:42.822 position:50% align:center
Just go home already.

00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.869 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Excuse me. I think
I need to see the nurse.

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.966 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That's for Mya's competition.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.469 position:50% align:center
I hope everything goes okay.

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Even if something happens,

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.435 position:50% align:center
I'm sure his classmates will
be around to help him out.

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
Hanzawa's pretty dependable.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.983 position:50% align:center
But the idea of Mya being
in front of a bunch of guys,

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:23.196 position:50% align:center
even without the girly clothes,
it would still bother me.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.990 position:50% align:center
Why did I say
I would root for him?

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.618 position:50% align:center
I'm making this so complicated.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:33.873 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh. The nurse
isn't here right now.

00:14:33.957 --> 00:14:35.083 position:50% align:center
What should I do?

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.252 position:50% align:center
Am I allowed to go in
and just sit there?

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mya.

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:43.675 position:50% align:center
Need the nurse?

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:50.056 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It probably won't be
too long of a wait,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.267 position:50% align:center
so why don't we head inside?

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:54.978 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Are you feeling sick?

00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.105 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah, I keep sneezing.

00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.734 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I wonder where
they keep the forms?

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:05.905 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hey, your hand is hurt!
What happened to you?

00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
It's fine!

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:10.076 position:50% align:center
I, uh, I'm not
very good at cooking.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.705 position:50% align:center
I sorta burned myself during
Home Ec. class earlier.

00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
Honestly, it doesn't
hurt much at all,

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.960 position:50% align:center
but the teacher said I should
go to the nurse anyway.

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.046 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay. That's good.

00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:24.424 position:50% align:center
I'll go ahead and
do the forms for you.

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:27.052 position:50% align:center
You have a seat on
the couch and relax for now.

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:28.011 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.305 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He's taking charge.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:38.271 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Ugh, my nose is
probably all red and itchy.

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.857 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hey, you don't
look so good, are you okay?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
I'll be--[sneezes]

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:45.362 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Aw, he has such a cute sneeze.

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.654 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here, take a tissue.

00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.198 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Thanks.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:51.659 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm so lame.

00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:54.579 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] What do you
think it is? A cold?

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.873 position:50% align:center
I dunno, I'm feeling
a little dizzy.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.751 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Let's take your
temperature. Are you nauseous?

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.712 position:50% align:center
No, I'm just kind of exhausted.

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:05.340 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Here. We'll see
if you have a fever.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
What's happening?
Are you in pain?

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:14.766 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He's so cute.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.726 position:50% align:center
Maybe you should lie down.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.895 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
You sure this is okay?

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.064 position:50% align:center
We're not goofing around
with the supplies or anything,

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.732 position:50% align:center
I'm sure they won't mind.

00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:23.858 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Okay.

00:16:23.942 --> 00:16:25.527 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Are you cold at all?

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.278 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm a bit chilly.

00:16:27.362 --> 00:16:28.905 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hold on a second, then.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.783 position:50% align:center
There must be a blanket
around here somewhere.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:35.245 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He's sure making
himself at home.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
I'm surprised he's so
comfortable doing this

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:40.083 position:50% align:center
even though he's not
on the Health Committee.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:43.586 position:50% align:center
Not to mention he's
younger than I am.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.963 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sorry.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.048 position:50% align:center
I couldn't find a thick blanket,

00:16:47.132 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
but I took this sheet
off the bed.

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.885 position:50% align:center
You think it'll be warm enough?

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:52.554 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
That was bold.

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
It's great. Thank you. [coughs]

00:16:55.724 --> 00:16:56.850 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Are you okay?

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.018 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah.

00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:00.979 position:50% align:center
You do have a fever.

00:17:01.062 --> 00:17:02.439 position:50% align:center
I'll go and find the nurse.

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
They should probably
send you home right away.

00:17:08.486 --> 00:17:09.529 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Don't worry about it.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.989 position:50% align:center
I can just leave.

00:17:11.072 --> 00:17:13.908 position:50% align:center
I feel well enough
to get home on my own.

00:17:13.992 --> 00:17:15.118 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Really?

00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.954 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yeah. I mean,
it's only one train.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.999 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I look so weak.

00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:24.586 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Well, can I
at least walk you home?

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.212 position:50% align:center
We take the same line.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:27.630 position:50% align:center
So, I can get off
at your station

00:17:27.714 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
and we'll walk to your house.

00:17:29.424 --> 00:17:31.217 position:50% align:center
My pass will cover it.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:34.262 position:50% align:center
But why?

00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:35.555 position:50% align:center
Why would you bother going to

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:38.433 position:50% align:center
all that trouble
just for my sake?

00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.393 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:40.477 --> 00:17:44.022 position:50% align:center
You don't feel well and
I want to take care of you.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.236 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.949 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Not fair.

00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:59.079 position:50% align:center
What is it? Did it get worse?

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:01.164 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Um, no.

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:03.958 position:50% align:center
Could you go look for
the nurse after all?

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:05.627 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sure. Be right back.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.254 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Great. Thanks, Mya.

00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:14.052 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I was kinda
giving him an opening

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:16.388 position:50% align:center
to say that he likes me,

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.641 position:50% align:center
but I wasn't expecting
that response.

00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:23.311 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I don't understand.

00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:26.523 position:50% align:center
Does he just see me
as his upperclassman?

00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:33.780 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Come on, Sasaki.
Don't get your hopes up.

00:18:36.616 --> 00:18:37.867 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm.

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:39.994 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What's going on?

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:41.788 position:50% align:center
Ogasawara just sent me
the full schedule

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.373 position:50% align:center
for the school festival.

00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
Looks like the first time
you and I are free

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.336 position:50% align:center
is after your costume
contest is over.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.088 position:50% align:center
Lunch is kinda short, too.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.257 position:50% align:center
My class is
planning to do a café

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.718 position:50% align:center
and the shifts are
pretty stacked up.

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.219 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sounds busy.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.014 position:50% align:center
Did you already make plans to
have lunch with somebody?

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.432 position:50% align:center
Not yet.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:04.102 position:50% align:center
If you want to, you and I
could eat lunch together.

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:10.859 position:50% align:center
Sure. I'll try and
get over my cold by then.

00:19:10.942 --> 00:19:12.652 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:13.486 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.946 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.740 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, the nurse. Hello.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:34.132 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
The cultural festival is go!

00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.594 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 9A] Our school's
festival begins now!

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.805 position:50% align:center
Have fun and support
your classmates!

00:19:40.889 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
All right, team!
Let's give it all we've got!

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.894 position:50% align:center
We need to demolish Class A,
fair and square!

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:47.270 position:50% align:center
[CLASS B]
Yeah!

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna check out
the other classes. Want food?

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
Class A's cheesy chicken!

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:53.651 position:50% align:center
[TORIHARA]
Hey, were you even listening?

00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.695 position:50% align:center
Don't be a traitor, Tashiro!

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.489 position:50% align:center
Why? Don't you want to try it?

00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:58.615 position:50% align:center
Of course, I do!

00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:01.201 position:50% align:center
It sounds like
the tastiest thing ever!

00:20:01.284 --> 00:20:03.661 position:50% align:center
But if we're giving
all this money to Class A,

00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:06.289 position:50% align:center
we'd better be getting more
than just chicken out of it!

00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:09.000 position:50% align:center
Does anybody have dirt
so we can blackmail them?

00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:11.211 position:50% align:center
So much for
"fair and square," guys.

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.088 position:50% align:center
I guess I'll buy
enough for everybody.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:14.464 position:50% align:center
Make sure to supersize mine!

00:20:14.547 --> 00:20:16.966 position:50% align:center
Pretty sure they don't do that.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.344 position:50% align:center
Registration is over there!

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.554 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Want me to get your
lunch from Class A, Miyano?

00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:23.473 position:50% align:center
Or would you like
something else?

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:26.184 position:50% align:center
No, I'm okay.
I already have plans for lunch.

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Okay then,
hang out with me 'til you leave.

00:20:28.728 --> 00:20:31.606 position:50% align:center
I'm taking some photos
for my girlfriend.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Not that your
selfies aren't great,

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:35.151 position:50% align:center
but you should let me
take them for you.

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:36.736 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Huh, thank you!

00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:41.825 position:50% align:center
Looks like it's almost
time to eat lunch.

00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.493 position:50% align:center
Where're you headed?

00:20:43.576 --> 00:20:45.078 position:50% align:center
Well, actually...

00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.126 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Whaddaya want--

00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:56.339 position:50% align:center
Wow... Sasaki. Do you mind
if I take a picture?

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.925 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sure. Come on in.

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:01.720 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Well, I definitely
didn't see that coming.

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.098 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Combining delinquents
with fortune-telling?

00:21:05.181 --> 00:21:07.350 position:50% align:center
That's actually really original.

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.686 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] We have a lot of
bad-boy types in our class,

00:21:09.769 --> 00:21:12.731 position:50% align:center
so we figured we might as well
take advantage of that.

00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.315 position:50% align:center
And where's the fortune-teller?

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.734 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right behind you.

00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:21.614 position:50% align:center
The chairman?

00:21:21.698 --> 00:21:24.659 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah,
I'm definitely doing this.

00:21:24.743 --> 00:21:25.994 position:50% align:center
What's up, Hanzawa?

00:21:26.077 --> 00:21:27.746 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Welcome, traveler!

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:29.080 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, Mya?

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
You, uh, showed up earlier
than I was expecting.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.627 position:50% align:center
My-- My shift's not gonna be
over for 30 more minutes.

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
I know, but I wanted to
check out the café.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
Do you mind if I sit here
until you finish up?

00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.927 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I mean, you can.
It's just, uh...

00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:44.012 position:50% align:center
Yeah?

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:45.638 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
When a customer comes in,

00:21:45.722 --> 00:21:49.351 position:50% align:center
we're always supposed to
be in character.

00:21:49.434 --> 00:21:52.145 position:50% align:center
I didn't think you'd show up
until I was done.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
I'm kind of embarrassed for you

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.940 position:50% align:center
to see me doing
the whole tough-guy thing.

00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
I think you look
really cool though.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:21:59.944 position:50% align:center
You mean it?

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:02.197 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Damn it, Sasaki!

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.907 position:50% align:center
Get off your ass right now!

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.658 position:50% align:center
We've got customers, punk!

00:22:05.742 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Whoa! Hirano!

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
He's really getting
into it, isn't he?

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:13.041 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs]
Art imitates life.
