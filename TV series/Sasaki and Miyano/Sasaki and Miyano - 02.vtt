00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:14.139 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sup!

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:15.932 position:50% align:center
Hirano, the teacher told me
to give this to you.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.142 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Thanks a lot.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.602 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh, hey, Mya.
Uh, wanna head out?

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.355 position:50% align:center
Since when did the two of you
start leaving together, anyway?

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.982 position:50% align:center
We do take the same train.

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.358 position:50% align:center
Ahh.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.611 position:50% align:center
I actually wanna stop by
the bookstore, so not today.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.071 position:50% align:center
I'd better get going.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.364 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
See you later.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.284 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, Mya, wait for me!

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.327 position:50% align:center
You kids have fun now!

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:37.871 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I was planning
on heading over there

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.122 position:50% align:center
on my own today, you know.

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
Are ya buyin' BL?

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.878 position:50% align:center
Don't just casually ask
that question! But I am.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.088 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't it be
more fun together?

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:50.884 position:50% align:center
I'd like to see you try
standing in front of

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
the BL shelf with another guy!

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
People will gossip about you
for the rest of your life!

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.139 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
You sure about that?

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.682 position:50% align:center
I guarantee it.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.977 position:50% align:center
Well, how about I stand at a
totally different shelf, then?

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.523 position:50% align:center
That could be okay.

00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:13.073 position:50% align:center
They have way more books
than I expected them to.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.542 position:50% align:center
You don't feel
nervous or anything?

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:26.002 position:50% align:center
It's just manga.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.129 position:50% align:center
"Just manga," right.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.590 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Normies so don't get it.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:17.405 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Just that for lunch?

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.824 position:50% align:center
Yeah. It's a flaming pollack roe
and mushroom loaf,

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:21.493 position:50% align:center
so nice and salty.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.536 position:50% align:center
Yo, Mya!

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.746 position:50% align:center
It's him.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.623 position:50% align:center
[SHIRAHAMA]
Miyano, Sasaki's here for you.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:28.958 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Manga?

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.377 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] So, he's really
into reading BL too, huh?

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.844 position:50% align:center
Alrighty, done with that one.

00:03:39.928 --> 00:03:42.305 position:50% align:center
I'll take the next volume,
thank you.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.556 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Awesome!

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What's wrong?

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.407 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I mean, I know you said
these manga were good, but--

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.700 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah?

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.327 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why do you like them so much?

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.870 position:50% align:center
If being a fudanshi
isn't for you,

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
then why even bother
to read them?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.708 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
I just don't see what
the appeal is for you,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.545 position:50% align:center
you know what I mean?

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.798 position:50% align:center
You're just not into this
stuff the same way I am.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.050 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:21.011 position:50% align:center
I'm getting to know
someone I like.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.182 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]
Okay, I've heard enough,

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.559 position:50% align:center
just get out of here
and go to class,

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
the bell's gonna ring soon.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, yeah. See ya later.

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What is he thinking?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
Between this and
him asking me out,

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:48.204 position:50% align:center
people will start to
get the wrong idea.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.543 position:50% align:center
Why's your face so red?

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
You're imagining things.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.756 position:50% align:center
It sounded like he used
the phrase "someone I like."

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.884 position:50% align:center
That was a joke, he's always
saying things like that.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.804 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What?

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.681 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's nothing at all.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.080 position:50% align:center
Hey, whatcha listenin' to?

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:33.333 position:50% align:center
[MAN 2A] Hey, we can't do
that here, are you crazy?!

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:34.584 position:50% align:center
[MAN 2A moans]

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.086 position:50% align:center
[MAN 2B]
Crazy for you.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.295 position:50% align:center
[MAN 2A]
Stop!

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.631 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.466 position:50% align:center
This isn't what you
think it is, I promise.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:44.177 position:50% align:center
It just ended up in my music
by accident, that's all!

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
I would never listen to
this kind of stuff!

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:49.349 position:50% align:center
I barely even heard
any of it, I swear!

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.188 position:50% align:center
What was the crazy thing
they were doing?

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, I can't take it!

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.736 position:50% align:center
Please just forget this
ever happened, okay?

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.615 position:50% align:center
Just tell me what
it was, it's okay.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.200 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
An audio drama.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.494 position:50% align:center
What's an audio drama?

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.205 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's just--
it's a type of CD you can buy,

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:14.749 position:50% align:center
and listen to stories told
solely through audio.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
Eh? So, what was the guy in
that story so freaked out about?

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.506 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Just please
get amnesia right now

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:23.591 position:50% align:center
and forget that
this ever happened.

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.180 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He's adorable
when he gets flustered.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Oh, hey, Miyano.
Whatcha doin' down there?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.059 position:50% align:center
Otaku fit?

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Leave me alone.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:35.645 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO, SHIRAHAMA laugh]

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] I wonder if
people think Miyano's a girl

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
when he blushes like that.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.233 position:50% align:center
Guess it's a pretty
easy mistake to make...

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Like I told you before,
you can't go around

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.990 position:50% align:center
talking about BL stuff
in public. It's embarrassing.

00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:52.037 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki, are you listening to me?

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
Hello?

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What're you doing?

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.128 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:03.048 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what is this?

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Miyano. Sorry I'm late.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
Hello, Sasaki.

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.137 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's up, dude?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.723 position:50% align:center
Well, you certainly
took your sweet time.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:15.143 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] My bad.
Nature called. What happened?

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.939 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Oh, Sasaki,
don't you have class?

00:07:20.023 --> 00:07:23.193 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yeah, I gotta go.
Be seein' ya.

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.488 position:50% align:center
So, what were
the two of you doing?

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.156 position:50% align:center
I wish I knew.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What was that all about?

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.467 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mya, you wanna play a game?

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.928 position:50% align:center
Can't right now.
Filling out my class journal.

00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Wha? Aw, come on,
give it a try.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.308 position:50% align:center
The chicken game is super
popular in my class right now.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:56.935 position:50% align:center
What's the chicken game?

00:07:57.018 --> 00:07:58.520 position:50% align:center
It's simple,
we share one of these,

00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
get closer and closer together,

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.314 position:50% align:center
and see who bails first.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
Must be something normies
play together, I guess.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.407 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] So, what put this idea
in your head, exactly?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.534 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Well, I thought it
might be more fun with you.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
Maybe it'll end with a lucky--

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:14.911 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Can you please
stop repeating the

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:17.205 position:50% align:center
BL nonsense already?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:18.456 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, fine.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.417 position:50% align:center
Wanna eat one of
these yourself, then?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.585 position:50% align:center
They're not sweet.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.796 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What if he really did buy these

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
to play chicken with me?

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:29.718 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess if
they really aren't sweet.

00:08:57.162 --> 00:09:00.582 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Um, honestly,
it feels pretty weird for me

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.375 position:50% align:center
to go all the way up
to your hand.

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.836 position:50% align:center
You think you could
let go of it now?

00:09:04.919 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.090 position:50% align:center
And, you can have
the rest of them.

00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.842 position:50% align:center
I'll catch up with ya later.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:13.428 position:50% align:center
Um, okay, I guess
I'll see you, then.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.322 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It is sweet.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Is he letting his guard down?

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.470 position:50% align:center
Seemed like it back there.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.228 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He usually gets mad.

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:10.443 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I don't know anymore!

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.449 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He's so cute.
It's getting harder to hide.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.327 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What do I do?

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
I'm worried the next time
I hug him,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.085 position:50% align:center
I'll hold on too tight,
and if that happens...

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:33.174 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He'll pull away from me.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, I'll have to be
careful not to touch him.

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:53.361 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Miyano, I got
the key. Ready to go home?

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.113 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.489 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Where did you get those?

00:10:56.573 --> 00:10:59.409 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki just
randomly gave them to me.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.494 position:50% align:center
Oh really? You hate
this kind of stuff.

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:03.038 position:50% align:center
Are you going to eat them?

00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.498 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I mean, they were
a gift, so I might as well.

00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
It's not like a little sugar
is gonna kill me.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.961 position:50% align:center
The other day when I
gave you some chocolates,

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:11.671 position:50% align:center
you just gave them away.

00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:13.006 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Because they were too sweet.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:14.841 position:50% align:center
So, he gets special treatment?

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:16.343 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What? Of course not!

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:18.053 position:50% align:center
If you say so.

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.638 position:50% align:center
You know, I think I'll
buy some for my girlfriend.

00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:23.975 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Special...

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.312 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Maybe.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.527 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Kuresawa, you still around?

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.321 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
I was on my way out.

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:37.655 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
I'm so sorry I'm late!

00:11:37.739 --> 00:11:39.616 position:50% align:center
Will you please
turn in my journal?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.700 position:50% align:center
Not forgiven.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.035 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Thank you, man!

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:44.120 position:50% align:center
Oh, Miyano, you're still here.

00:11:44.204 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm trying to
finish my journal,

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.958 position:50% align:center
and I'm also on duty this week.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.336 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] By the way, I've been
meaning to ask ya somethin'.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:54.047 position:50% align:center
That one upperclassman has been
visiting you a lot lately.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.507 position:50% align:center
Are you a couple?

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.093 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps] Why would you
ask a question like that?

00:11:58.176 --> 00:11:59.552 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Well, this is
an all-boys school,

00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:02.055 position:50% align:center
and he's not shy about
calling you cute.

00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:03.390 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
W-Well, we're not!

00:12:03.473 --> 00:12:05.141 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] He's not like,
pressuring you, right?

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:06.518 position:50% align:center
Absolutely not!

00:12:06.601 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
We have a completely normal
high-school friendship!

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.731 position:50% align:center
You call your manga
arrangement normal?

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.400 position:50% align:center
Stay out of this, Kuresawa.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.902 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO laughs]

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:19.364 position:50% align:center
Hey, as long as you're happy,
then there's no worries, dude.

00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:22.367 position:50% align:center
This isn't the first time you've
been worried about me though.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.869 position:50% align:center
I don't get it,
is Sasaki really that scary?

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.871 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] I mean,
he is an upperclassman

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.415 position:50% align:center
and gigantic, so...

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.959 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That is an excellent point.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:33.753 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
He's obviously a good guy.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:34.838 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:39.009 position:50% align:center
Don't you remember when I got
beat up before summer break?

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.094 position:50% align:center
Sasaki was the one
who stepped in.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
He defended me.

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.853 position:50% align:center
Huh? What do you want?!

00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:52.230 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm here to clean up.

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:54.941 position:50% align:center
Hey, you okay?
You should get outta here.

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
Um, thanks.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.364 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Hmm, still though.

00:13:01.448 --> 00:13:04.325 position:50% align:center
He must like Miyano if he's
"stepping in" this much.

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
I'd say so.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.871 position:50% align:center
What do you mean "you'd
say so"? I wouldn't!

00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:10.123 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Well, I got
club stuff to get back to.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] And I have to
turn in these notebooks.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:12.959 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Okay.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.294 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Later days!

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:23.178 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hmm. I guess only
one person left early today.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.642 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I'm sure they were just
messing around with me,

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:34.564 position:50% align:center
but I wonder if Sasaki is being
teased by his classmates, too.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:38.109 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Are they suddenly
treating him differently

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:40.987 position:50% align:center
because I'm lending him
my BL manga?

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.949 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
If they are, what do I d--

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, Mya!

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.579 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, you scared me,
why are you here?

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.122 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
My bad. Sorry.

00:13:51.206 --> 00:13:54.125 position:50% align:center
I just dropped by 'cause
I heard you were still here.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.255 position:50% align:center
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but do you get hit on a lot?

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:00.965 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why would you
want to know that?

00:14:01.049 --> 00:14:03.093 position:50% align:center
And why is everybody
at this school so into

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:06.221 position:50% align:center
gossiping about relationships
all of a sudden?

00:14:06.304 --> 00:14:07.180 position:50% align:center
But no, I don't.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:08.556 position:50% align:center
Frankly, it'd be weird if I did

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.475 position:50% align:center
have a lot of options
at this school.

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.937 position:50% align:center
It's kinda small, so most
people here are unavailable.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.939 position:50% align:center
So, Hirano is?

00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:17.816 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Taken. And the uke of the pair.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:20.777 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He's an uke? Interesting.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.445 position:50% align:center
Tell me more.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:24.781 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] He's with his roommate.
That first-year.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:28.118 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI gasps]
Bold assumptions, fudanshi.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.912 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] They're kind of
a bad example though.

00:14:30.995 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
It's way more common
for students here

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
to find a girlfriend off campus.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.334 position:50% align:center
I mean, we're an
all-boys' school,

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:38.086 position:50% align:center
but there's
a coed school nearby,

00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
so thankfully we can meet
all kinds of people there.

00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:41.589 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
"Thankfully"?

00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:42.757 position:50% align:center
I thought you specifically
chose this school

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:44.259 position:50% align:center
because it was
an all-boys' school.

00:14:44.342 --> 00:14:45.468 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Just what exactly do you think

00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
being a fudanshi is all about?

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.597 position:50% align:center
One of the manga you gave me
said that fudanshi

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.017 position:50% align:center
will do whatever it takes
to get their BL fix.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.393 position:50% align:center
Wait, really?!

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:56.104 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Miyano, you fool!

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.732 position:50% align:center
Well, that's not why
I came here, okay?

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:01.735 position:50% align:center
I didn't even get into BL
until after I started here.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.655 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
And it was unintentional.

00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:08.241 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Unintentional?

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.786 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. How did you
first start reading BL?

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.374 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Well, you know,
mistakes happen all the time.

00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:20.378 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.937 position:50% align:center
A reference book.

00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.356 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Huh.

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:41.691 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I needed
a reference book for exams

00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.694 position:50% align:center
and I wanted manga for
my study breaks, so, um,

00:15:44.778 --> 00:15:46.946 position:50% align:center
I started browsing and
one caught my attention

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.740 position:50% align:center
because it had a character
I already knew

00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:51.076 position:50% align:center
drawn really well on the cover.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:54.079 position:50% align:center
The title had the word
"anthology" in it,

00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:57.290 position:50% align:center
so I figured it was an official
spinoff of the original manga,

00:15:57.374 --> 00:15:59.000 position:50% align:center
or something like that.

00:15:59.084 --> 00:16:01.961 position:50% align:center
Authors do that kind of thing
all the time, you know.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:24.025 position:50% align:center
That's that.

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.569 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh, so you're telling me
it was a coincidence.

00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:29.447 position:50% align:center
Well, it was partially my fault
for being careless,

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.366 position:50% align:center
but I swear it was
on a normal shelf.

00:16:31.449 --> 00:16:33.576 position:50% align:center
I had no idea
what I was getting into.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:37.414 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I notice he
conveniently left out the part

00:16:37.497 --> 00:16:39.874 position:50% align:center
where he went back
to buy more of it.

00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:41.960 position:50% align:center
He's so damn cute.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.965 position:50% align:center
You listening to me?

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.927 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mm-hm!

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
Oh, Mya, I just remembered.

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:55.598 position:50% align:center
I saw an ad in a convenience
store for BL-looking manga.

00:16:55.682 --> 00:16:56.975 position:50% align:center
Do you know about it?

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, what was the title?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.854 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, let's see now.

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.006 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hirano, you still here?

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.258 position:50% align:center
--What's going on?
--Oh. It's Sasaki. Hey.

00:17:30.342 --> 00:17:32.052 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mya, I was
hoping I'd see you,

00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.553 position:50% align:center
are you heading home right now?

00:17:33.636 --> 00:17:34.763 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yes.

00:17:34.846 --> 00:17:37.265 position:50% align:center
Did you need to see me
or not? I'm leaving.

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.683 position:50% align:center
Actually, yeah, hold on.

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
This is for you.
It's from our teacher.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:44.856 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Thanks. You sure are
on gopher duty a lot lately.

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:45.774 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]

00:17:45.857 --> 00:17:47.275 position:50% align:center
More post-grad materials?

00:17:47.359 --> 00:17:49.361 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Oh. Yeah,
when you're a second year,

00:17:49.444 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
you'll find out there's
a ton of pressure

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
to squeeze in all kinds of stuff
like school visits. Get ready.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:58.328 position:50% align:center
Oh... I've barely even
started at this school.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:02.040 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO chuckles]
It's been almost a year though.

00:18:02.123 --> 00:18:04.042 position:50% align:center
Time really flew by.

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:06.670 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] All right.
I'll go hand in the key,

00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
so you can head home.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.047 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you're ready to leave.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.590 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, you're outta
here, too, right?

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:11.424 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mm-hm.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.509 position:50% align:center
Oh, great.

00:18:12.592 --> 00:18:14.302 position:50% align:center
Thanks for taking
care of that. Bye.

00:18:14.386 --> 00:18:16.054 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
See ya.

00:18:16.137 --> 00:18:18.348 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Actually, I left
the manga I borrowed from you

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.809 position:50% align:center
in my classroom.
It totally slipped my mind.

00:18:20.892 --> 00:18:22.227 position:50% align:center
Can we go grab it really quick?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.770 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]
You did what?!

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:24.688 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
No biggie.

00:18:24.771 --> 00:18:26.356 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Maybe not to you!

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.358 position:50% align:center
What if your teacher sees it?

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
We've gotta go
get it back right now!

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:33.822 position:50% align:center
Come on, hurry!
Before anyone finds it!

00:18:33.905 --> 00:18:35.198 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Okay, okay!

00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Those two have
gotten pretty close lately.

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:48.586 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
I guess maybe it's a good thing.

00:18:51.172 --> 00:18:54.467 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Thank goodness it was
still in the bag. We got lucky.

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah, of course it was.

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:58.096 position:50% align:center
You always put them in those
bags when you lend them to me.

00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.056 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's a tenet of
the fudanshi lifestyle.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.100 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]
Sounds serious.

00:19:02.183 --> 00:19:03.435 position:50% align:center
Very.

00:19:04.894 --> 00:19:06.813 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mya, wait up!

00:19:06.896 --> 00:19:10.525 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki, careful,
there's no need to pull so--

00:19:10.608 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
What's up with you, anyway?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.029 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Check it out. Here.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:16.698 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.078 position:50% align:center
Valentine's at
a boys' school, huh.

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:24.456 position:50% align:center
My curiosity's piqued.

00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:28.084 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
When you think about it,

00:19:28.168 --> 00:19:30.045 position:50% align:center
it's a perfect set-up
for BL manga.

00:19:30.128 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:36.509 position:50% align:center
Did I get it right?

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:40.096 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.223 position:50% align:center
You totally did,
but how'd you know?

00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:44.934 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Eh, lucky guess.
Whatcha say?

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
Should you and me buy these
for each other, huh?

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:48.813 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I don't think so.

00:19:48.897 --> 00:19:50.440 position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:35.503 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 2A]
All passengers...

00:21:35.587 --> 00:21:37.339 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Just out of curiosity,

00:21:37.422 --> 00:21:39.007 position:50% align:center
how many people
gave you chocolate?

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.176 position:50% align:center
Thirty-six different people.

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:42.260 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Huh--

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.970 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Our class made it a big event.

00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:46.598 position:50% align:center
We have a classmate who
loves to organize things

00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:48.016 position:50% align:center
and he pitched the idea
that we should all

00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:49.809 position:50% align:center
participate this year.

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:53.897 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
But then it got kinda weird.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.191 position:50% align:center
A lot of people brought
money-shaped chocolates,

00:21:56.274 --> 00:21:58.068 position:50% align:center
which led to
a discussion of money,

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:00.904 position:50% align:center
and then the teacher
got suspicious, so...

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:22.842 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, welcome home!

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:24.886 position:50% align:center
I could use a hand if you
wanna wash up real quick

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:27.055 position:50% align:center
and help me out with the gyoza.

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:33.228 position:50% align:center
[SATOKO]
What's with him?

00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:34.813 position:50% align:center
No clue.

00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:36.523 position:50% align:center
[SATOKO]
So rude.

00:23:16.938 --> 00:23:19.524 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Of course, I should've
thought about a class event.

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.151 position:50% align:center
That's on me.

00:23:24.654 --> 00:23:27.323 position:50% align:center
Thirty-six people.

00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:38.001 position:50% align:center
Who the hell
went first, I wonder.
