00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.100 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A] You think
you can just pick a fight

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.518 position:50% align:center
and then walk away?

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.145 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] I'm not
trying to fight with you.

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:23.148 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B] Sorry, it's too
late for the innocent routine!

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.733 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Is this really happening?

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
I usually only see people get
bullied like this in manga!

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
But it's kind of
cliche nowadays,

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:31.531 position:50% align:center
even for Boys' Love stories!

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:32.866 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
What's up, Miyano?

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.576 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Hirano! I'm behind
the south building

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.870 position:50% align:center
and there's a student
getting beat up by three guys!

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:38.204 position:50% align:center
I don't know what I should do!

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.330 position:50% align:center
[thud]

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I have to stop this!

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
You hold this.
I'll go and break it up.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.094 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh? Who's he?

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:54.804 position:50% align:center
But--

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:55.889 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Here.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.852 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A]
Huh? What do you want?

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:02.687 position:50% align:center
I'm here to clean up.

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.147 position:50% align:center
Hey, you okay?

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.231 position:50% align:center
You should get out of here.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Um, thanks.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.485 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B]
Are you kidding me with this?

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.656 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I admired my
upperclassman in secret

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
as I watched him
march into the fray.

00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:24.959 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Miyano! Good morning!

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:27.629 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Sasaki.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.925 position:50% align:center
Look at you, Mya,
you're as cute as ever today.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.134 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Will you cut it out?

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.303 position:50% align:center
For the hundredth time:
don't call me cute.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:37.806 position:50% align:center
You know I'm self-conscious
about how feminine my face is.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Fine, then you're
an inner-cutie!

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.268 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Not really the
adjustment I was hoping for.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.816 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
How did we end up like this?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.998 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Recently,
Sasaki's been overdoing it

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:06.418 position:50% align:center
with the physical contact.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.878 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mya! What's up?

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.797 position:50% align:center
You want me to
put you in slash art?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.008 position:50% align:center
'Cause I'll do it
if you don't cut it out!

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.051 position:50% align:center
Go right ahead,
it doesn't bother me!

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.803 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, it would bother me!

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:20.015 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
By the way, what's slash art?

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:22.142 position:50% align:center
It's probably better
if you stay in the dark.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.519 position:50% align:center
And please don't ask your
friends about it, either.

00:02:24.602 --> 00:02:26.312 position:50% align:center
Wait, is slash art
related to "moe"?

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.481 position:50% align:center
Or that "seme" or
"uke" stuff, maybe?

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.774 position:50% align:center
I can never keep track.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.943 position:50% align:center
No! Those words are
way more embarrassing

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:34.029 position:50% align:center
coming from a non-otaku's mouth!

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.989 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, you like manga, right?

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.699 position:50% align:center
Got any good recs?

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.075 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here we go.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.870 position:50% align:center
Normies always end up
asking for recommendations.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
I dunno, what kind of manga
are you usually into, Sasaki?

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.210 position:50% align:center
Well, I guess recently
I was kind of digging

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.589 position:50% align:center
this cool shoujo series
that my sister was reading.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.258 position:50% align:center
But I want to try
something you like.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.807 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Okay, but this
is all I have on me!

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.977 position:50% align:center
Oh, you don't mind if
I borrow it? Thanks a ton!

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.062 position:50% align:center
But you have to promise me that

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.813 position:50% align:center
you'll only look at it
in your room!

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.774 position:50% align:center
And whatever you do, you can't
take it out of the bag

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.025 position:50% align:center
unless you're alone!

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:13.985 position:50% align:center
Basically, treat it like
it's a toxic substance!

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.820 position:50% align:center
Also, I don't want you
to assume anything about me

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.280 position:50% align:center
just because I like
reading this stuff.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.448 position:50% align:center
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong...

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.450 position:50% align:center
Right. I get it.

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.995 position:50% align:center
[meows]

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.582 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Good morning, Mya.

00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.462 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, Sasaki, how's it going?

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.839 position:50% align:center
That manga from
yesterday. I read it.

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:36.966 position:50% align:center
Yeah? And what did
you think of it?

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.426 position:50% align:center
I liked that one part
at the end where

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.220 position:50% align:center
the two guys were
in the hotel together--

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:42.013 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:44.140 position:50% align:center
Look, rule number one!

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.350 position:50% align:center
No matter what, you should never

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.768 position:50% align:center
discuss that kind
of subject matter

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
in front of random people
at school, do you hear me?

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.605 position:50% align:center
It's way too awkward!

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.691 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh, sure thing, sorry.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Well, now that
it's just you and me.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
I can't exactly say
I have any experience

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.615 position:50% align:center
reading that kind of manga.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.160 position:50% align:center
So yeah, it caught me off guard
at first, but I really liked it!

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:11.960 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] At first, I assumed it
was a typical detective story.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.878 position:50% align:center
But then the romance between
the two guys started

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
and it was really good!

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.008 position:50% align:center
I liked how in
spite of everything

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.551 position:50% align:center
the main character
was dealing with,

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
he pushed through
and made it work.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.179 position:50% align:center
And then by the end,

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.348 position:50% align:center
he ended up way stronger
because of it.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.436 position:50% align:center
It was a great story.
I loved it.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.606 position:50% align:center
Right? It's so good, isn't it?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.025 position:50% align:center
What did you think of the uke?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.443 position:50% align:center
That's what they call
the more submissive character

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.028 position:50% align:center
in the BL pairing, in case
you didn't know that term.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.446 position:50% align:center
Uh, okay.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.197 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] The uke is
usually small and cute

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.574 position:50% align:center
and kind of a crybaby,

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:43.700 position:50% align:center
but sometimes,
he turns out to be

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.910 position:50% align:center
the more masculine
half of the couple!

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.790 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh, right, got it.

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:54.252 position:50% align:center
So, the part at the end.
I liked that a lot, too.

00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.712 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, yeah, same here!

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.547 position:50% align:center
Actually, if I had to pick
a favorite moment

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.716 position:50% align:center
of the whole manga,
that would be the one!

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.885 position:50% align:center
I think it's a really nice way
to express how happy

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:04.346 position:50% align:center
the characters are in
that moment, don't you?

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:07.182 position:50% align:center
Yeah, definitely.

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
I wasn't sure what you would
say about it, since it's BL,

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:11.770 position:50% align:center
but I'm so happy to hear...

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Damn it.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.815 position:50% align:center
The author's
one of my favorites.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.109 position:50% align:center
She writes about couples who are
so different from each other

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:20.320 position:50% align:center
and shows them being
so happy together!

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.697 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He's so cute.

00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:26.201 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, uh... Mya?

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
What's up?

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.954 position:50% align:center
Lend me another one.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.039 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.211 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Delivery for Mya!

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.712 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait, what?

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:39.547 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Lately, he's been
stopping by to see me so much

00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
that it's starting to
feel a bit excessive.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.593 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I want you to
have these cookies

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.595 position:50% align:center
that I made in cooking class.

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:46.721 position:50% align:center
Thanks for the manga.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.973 position:50% align:center
Oh. Thanks, that's nice.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:51.810 position:50% align:center
They're not super-sweet though.
I hope you don't mind.

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.771 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Actually, I'm not into
sweets anyway, so it's perfect.

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, great! Later, then.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.405 position:50% align:center
What was that?
Didn't know the two of you had

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
a "homemade cookies"
level relationship.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.908 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It's not like that!

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
Isn't he a delinquent
or something, though?

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.870 position:50% align:center
You sure he's not bad news?

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:15.208 position:50% align:center
Seriously, it's okay.
He's actually a really nice guy.

00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.545 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Mm... If you say so.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
Miyano?

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.801 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hi, Hirano!

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:26.469 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Listen,
I noticed Sasaki's been

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:28.888 position:50% align:center
visiting your classroom
a lot recently.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
Is everything okay?

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's great! I mean, awful.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.727 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty down in the dumps,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.020 position:50% align:center
could you tell me
about your love life

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.312 position:50% align:center
to make me feel better?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:38.148 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Yeah, no.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.108 position:50% align:center
Read through this
committee paperwork.

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:41.484 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You got it.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.403 position:50% align:center
But hey, don't think
you can fool me.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.447 position:50% align:center
I saw you chatting up
that basketball player

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.823 position:50% align:center
from Class 1-A, you know.

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.491 position:50% align:center
The one with
the really nice smile?

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.909 position:50% align:center
You sure you can't
give me any details

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
about your relationship--

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.537 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.583 position:50% align:center
I'm sorry about that, Hirano.
I got a little carried away.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.959 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Yeah, I'll say.

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.253 position:50% align:center
He's my dorm roommate,
nothing more, got it?

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.839 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I see, living together
in close quarters, huh?

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.799 position:50% align:center
Now that's a juicy premise!

00:07:04.883 --> 00:07:06.843 position:50% align:center
Back to the subject at hand.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.261 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who told Sasaki

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.597 position:50% align:center
which class you're
part of in the first place,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.725 position:50% align:center
so I'd feel bad if
he was harassing you,

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
you know, since you're
my underclassman and all.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.313 position:50% align:center
Uh, right.

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
Hey, there you are, Mya!

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.191 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:22.984 position:50% align:center
I'll get rid of him.

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:25.445 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, thanks, I guess?

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
I told you, don't wander into

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
other grades' classrooms
for no reason!

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:32.619 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Haha! Joke's on you,
I have a reason, so there!

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.120 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Just don't be late to class!

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.872 position:50% align:center
Yeah, thanks, Mom.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.207 position:50% align:center
So did you need something?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.793 position:50% align:center
Yup. I'm here to return
the manga from yesterday.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:43.171 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]
Okay, let's talk somewhere else!

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Something wrong?

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.218 position:50% align:center
It's just... I'm a fudanshi,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
so I try to stay
under the radar, that's all.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:51.388 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
And since upperclassmen
like you attract attention,

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.392 position:50% align:center
I'd rather we talk here.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.477 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.479 position:50% align:center
So, the manga,
how'd you like it?

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
I thought it was awesome!

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.732 position:50% align:center
Guess I like comedies.

00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
Good to know.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.276 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Whatcha doin'?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.529 position:50% align:center
I'm writing down
all of your preferences.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:09.864 position:50% align:center
Gotta make sure I
remember them for next time.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're thorough.

00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:14.285 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
So cute.

00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:20.041 position:50% align:center
By the way, Mya.

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:21.960 position:50% align:center
You really don't
eat sweet stuff?

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.837 position:50% align:center
No, it makes my stomach upset.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.213 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
But, like, how bad?

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.882 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What, you want the details?

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.426 position:50% align:center
Like, with one piece
of shortcake,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.969 position:50% align:center
I would get nauseous.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:32.012 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
How 'bout candy?

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.472 position:50% align:center
The wasabi-flavored
stuff is fine.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.933 position:50% align:center
Ah, spicy instead
of sweet, huh?

00:08:37.017 --> 00:08:39.602 position:50% align:center
Sounds totally gross to me,
not gonna lie.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
It's got a unique flavor.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.064 position:50% align:center
Don't knock it
'til you try it, c'mon.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.400 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] As much as I want to
take your recommendation,

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.527 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna have to pass.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:54.034 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, candy's out.
How do you feel about soda?

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.119 position:50% align:center
I can tolerate it pretty well.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.580 position:50% align:center
For some reason, it doesn't
bother me the way candy does.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:08:59.789 position:50% align:center
My guess is that it's probably

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:01.708 position:50% align:center
got something to do
with the bubbles.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What's that kid doing?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:12.385 position:50% align:center
They look kinda small and cute,
but I think it's a guy?

00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.387 position:50% align:center
They're wearing pants.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.433 position:50% align:center
A fight? Whoa,
you're not cut out for that!

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:20.769 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey.

00:09:27.359 --> 00:09:29.819 position:50% align:center
Oh man, that hurt.

00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:33.365 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Sasaki!
Where'd the bullies go?

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.241 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:09:35.325 --> 00:09:36.826 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He must've left.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.871 position:50% align:center
That's too bad--wait,
what's the matter with me?

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
Jeez, dude.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.541 position:50% align:center
Listen!

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.251 position:50% align:center
What did you just ask?

00:09:45.335 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
Where are the guys fighting?

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.422 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, they're gone now.

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.092 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Did you get
a look at their faces?

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:53.760 position:50% align:center
I think they were first-years.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.011 position:50% align:center
Looked pretty young.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:09:57.389 position:50% align:center
That's the only thing
I picked up on, though.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.891 position:50% align:center
All right, come to the
Discipline Committee room.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:01.768 position:50% align:center
I have some questions.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.353 position:50% align:center
--Wait.
--Huh?

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:04.813 position:50% align:center
Where's that guy?

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:07.315 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] What do you mean,
the kid who reported it?

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
His name's Miyano.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:12.195 position:50% align:center
He went to the nurse's office
with the guy they beat up.

00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:18.410 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Oh, okay. Wish I could
have talked to him for a sec.

00:10:18.493 --> 00:10:20.912 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Also, he wants me
to give you a message.

00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:21.996 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] He says thanks
for helping him out.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.086 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I see.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.009 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Miyano. His name's Miyano.

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.344 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um...

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.432 position:50% align:center
You okay? You got kinda quiet.

00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:42.517 position:50% align:center
Sorry. What was
the question again?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.019 position:50% align:center
I was zoned out.

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:46.062 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Maybe you're not okay.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:10.337 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Mya.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.839 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey there,
what a surprise.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
So, how's it going?

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.136 position:50% align:center
Not bad. I didn't realize
the train would be

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.804 position:50% align:center
so empty at this hour.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.056 position:50% align:center
This is pretty typical,

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:23.183 position:50% align:center
what time do you
usually get on board?

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:26.478 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Mm... I take
the third one after this.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.355 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Wouldn't that be
too late, though?

00:11:28.438 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's fine.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.066 position:50% align:center
If the teacher's late,
then I'm safe.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.859 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
So, almost never?

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.110 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mm-hm.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.822 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] By the way, Sasaki,
thank you for the cookies.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:39.491 position:50% align:center
They were really good.

00:11:39.574 --> 00:11:41.951 position:50% align:center
Oh, you liked them?
Glad to hear.

00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I had no idea
that you were such a good cook.

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.289 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, I'm terrible at cooking.

00:11:46.373 --> 00:11:48.708 position:50% align:center
It's a lot different
than baking.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.461 position:50% align:center
My mother's usually
the one who cooks for us.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.587 position:50% align:center
Your mother, huh?

00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.339 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:57.092 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh, that was nothing.
You were saying?

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
Anyway, my big sister
helps in the kitchen, too.

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.013 position:50% align:center
So, I mostly just set the table.

00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:03.473 position:50% align:center
It's better that way.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.601 position:50% align:center
Well, I do bake desserts
from time to time.

00:12:06.685 --> 00:12:10.105 position:50% align:center
Huh? You mean you bake
outside of cooking class?

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:12.273 position:50% align:center
Nothing like fresh
from the oven!

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.236 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Well, looks like
this is our stop.

00:12:16.319 --> 00:12:19.030 position:50% align:center
Oh. Okay. That was fast.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.533 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Something wrong?

00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:24.577 position:50% align:center
I'm just surprised.
Usually it seems slower.

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:27.330 position:50% align:center
Probably felt quicker because
we were so busy chatting.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:30.208 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe that's it.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:32.961 position:50% align:center
[rumbling]

00:12:33.044 --> 00:12:34.629 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Wow, is that thunder?

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.674 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] The weather forecast
today said to expect some rain.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.511 position:50% align:center
Rain, huh?

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.932 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI groans]
There's so much to copy.

00:12:46.016 --> 00:12:49.269 position:50% align:center
The longer you sit there and
whine, the longer it'll take.

00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.187 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Let's go back
to summer vacation.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.648 position:50% align:center
Oh, do you have a time machine?

00:12:53.732 --> 00:12:55.608 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hirano, are you in here?

00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.943 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Hey, Miyano.

00:12:57.861 --> 00:13:00.947 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's that guy from before.

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.450 position:50% align:center
I tried to call, but you
weren't answering your phone.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:05.452 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Sorry, left it at home.

00:13:05.535 --> 00:13:08.663 position:50% align:center
Well, I wanted to tell you
the chairman left you a message.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
The meeting's canceled.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Got it.

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.335 position:50% align:center
And you should probably
look over these, too.

00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.420 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
He is a guy.

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.048 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Hey, knock it off already,

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
why are you staring him down?

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:22.635 position:50% align:center
Sorry. Sasaki here
isn't a bad guy.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.137 position:50% align:center
He's just kind of an idiot.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.057 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Uh, okay.
Wait a sec, I know you--

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:30.935 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yeah! His shoulders
are too solid to be a girl's.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.520 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I wanted to
thank you for stepping into

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
that fight, the other...

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:36.232 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.568 position:50% align:center
If you lay a finger on
my underclassman again,

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.820 position:50% align:center
you're going to suffer for it!

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.740 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh...

00:13:43.823 --> 00:13:45.992 position:50% align:center
Now get back to
your copying already!

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:49.245 position:50% align:center
All right. Well, see ya
around then, Miyano.

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:51.456 position:50% align:center
Um, sure.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.166 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That was weird.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.585 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
So, what's all this?

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, right.

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.381 position:50% align:center
A bunch of materials
for the next meeting.

00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.508 position:50% align:center
The chairman told me to
ask you to look them over.

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.468 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
All right, I'll do that.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.552 position:50% align:center
Too bad you were the unlucky one

00:14:04.636 --> 00:14:06.304 position:50% align:center
to get bogged down
with all this.

00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:07.681 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah, I know.

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.183 position:50% align:center
I guess that means
you owe me one.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.979 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] They seem to be pretty
close, even though he's a guy.

00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:18.274 position:50% align:center
How does he have
such a cute face, though?

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:26.157 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I feel kind of anxious.

00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.369 position:50% align:center
Oh, great. Have you even
started working yet?

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hirano, how did I get
myself into this mess, anyway?

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
Well, you never took a single
note and today's the due date.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:40.338 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I didn't mean that.

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:51.391 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's coming down.

00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.352 position:50% align:center
I thought the forecast
said it'd be sunny?

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.604 position:50% align:center
Guess I'll wait a bit.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What's up, Sasaki?

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.402 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Mya.

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:07.615 position:50% align:center
Mya, huh?
Um, everything okay?

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:10.410 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah. I'm just stuck for now.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
It's raining really hard and
I didn't bring an umbrella.

00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:18.084 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
So, um, do you take the train?

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
Yeah, usually.

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:23.214 position:50% align:center
Oh, I take the train, too.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:27.510 position:50% align:center
Um, do you want me to
share my umbrella with you?

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:33.767 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Thanks, that would be great.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.019 position:50% align:center
How about I hold it
for us, though?

00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:37.979 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It's fine, I can hold it.

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:41.066 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Aw, come on,
it's the least I can do.

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Okay.

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.702 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Wake up! Hey! Sasaki!

00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.749 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Uh. Sorry, early start today.

00:15:57.832 --> 00:16:01.419 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS laugh]

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.552 position:50% align:center
Good morning, Mya, what's up?

00:16:09.636 --> 00:16:11.888 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Wait a sec,
did you just make it to school?

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.473 position:50% align:center
See you there, okay?

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:15.266 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Uh, yeah, right behind you!

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.769 position:50% align:center
I overslept, but as long as
I make it to second period,

00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
I'm in the clear.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.147 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
How's that work?

00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:23.274 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I didn't miss the vocab test.

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:24.776 position:50% align:center
Extra sweet, huh?

00:16:24.859 --> 00:16:26.236 position:50% align:center
You sure do enjoy those

00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:28.822 position:50% align:center
off-the-wall drink
flavors, don't you?

00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:30.448 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you wanna try a sip?

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.950 position:50% align:center
Just kidding.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.118 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sure, couldn't hurt.

00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.413 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Uh, help yourself, then.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.417 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm surprised.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.252 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll like it.

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:45.880 position:50% align:center
Too sweet!

00:16:45.964 --> 00:16:48.675 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs] Yeah, all that
sugar's not for everyone.

00:16:48.758 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:16:50.135 --> 00:16:52.637 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] There's the bell.
I have to head back now.

00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.806 position:50% align:center
Right. See ya.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.266 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Have a good one.

00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:01.563 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Well, that's that.

00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
Do you guys think so?

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.357 position:50% align:center
Yeah, probably.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.817 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Thanks for the dango!

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.194 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Just take one skewer.

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:10.155 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Are you in here, Sasaki?

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.323 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey there, Mya. What's up?

00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:15.618 position:50% align:center
Nothing much. You know the manga
we talked about before?

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
Well, I have to meet with
a teacher later today,

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:20.582 position:50% align:center
which means I won't be in class,
so I brought it for you now.

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:22.667 position:50% align:center
Oh, awesome. Thank you.

00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:25.295 position:50% align:center
It's not the kind of book you
should wave around like that!

00:17:25.378 --> 00:17:28.548 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way. We've got
some dango if you're hungry.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:30.008 position:50% align:center
You mean I do.

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.135 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No thanks, too sweet.

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.722 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which, my friends
gave me these candies earlier.

00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.349 position:50% align:center
Do you guys maybe
want to try a few?

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.850 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Are you sure?

00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.936 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Yeah, like I said,
I'm not a fan of this stuff.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.605 position:50% align:center
You can have as many
of them as you want.

00:17:43.688 --> 00:17:45.231 position:50% align:center
Sure, thanks.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.567 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Whoa, what's wrong?

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:51.279 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh no! It says here
they contain liquor!

00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:52.989 position:50% align:center
Was the flavor
too intense or something?

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.699 position:50% align:center
No. I'm fine. Swear!

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:57.118 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO, MIYANO] Looks like
you're anything but fine!

00:17:57.202 --> 00:17:58.620 position:50% align:center
I should have
checked them first.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:17:59.913 position:50% align:center
This is all my fault!

00:17:59.996 --> 00:18:01.956 position:50% align:center
Spit it out and
go rinse your mouth.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.626 position:50% align:center
Come on. Hello?

00:18:04.709 --> 00:18:05.752 position:50% align:center
That face.

00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.671 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I already swallowed part of it.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.339 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why would you do that?

00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.717 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Well, you offered,
and I didn't want to be rude.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:16.513 position:50% align:center
Ugh, it's sweet and sour and
strong and bitter all at once.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.390 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Will you just
spit out what's left, please?

00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:20.684 position:50% align:center
We'd rather you
do that than barf.

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:25.689 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Feeling better?

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.649 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah, for the most part.

00:18:27.732 --> 00:18:29.067 position:50% align:center
So, where'd Mya go?

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.320 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, Sasaki! For you.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.155 position:50% align:center
Thought you could use it.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.040 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] I'm surprised you could
eat those chocolates.

00:18:44.124 --> 00:18:46.793 position:50% align:center
Yup. In fact, I kinda like them.

00:18:48.253 --> 00:18:52.424 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Nice and cold.
Reminds me of that other time.

00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:55.885 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS grunting]

00:18:55.969 --> 00:18:57.387 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A]
Come on, guys.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.764 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1B]
Don't get in our way again.

00:18:59.848 --> 00:19:01.099 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 1A]
That was the lamest thing...

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:04.811 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Are they talking
about that one fight?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
They're still not over that?

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.066 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.485 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Crap, lunch is over.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Agh, damn it.
This really hurts!

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.910 position:50% align:center
They kicked me
with all their strength.

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:24.039 position:50% align:center
Must've had a lot of
anger to work out.

00:19:24.122 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
I can't go back
to class after that.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:30.003 position:50% align:center
But I don't feel like
walking home either.

00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:32.964 position:50% align:center
Everything is
too much right now.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki!

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI gasps]

00:19:43.516 --> 00:19:46.728 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?
Are you feeling okay?

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.148 position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.150 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh. Hey, Mya.

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
Uh. Hello. Are you good?

00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:59.157 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Just a little
pain in my stomach.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.202 position:50% align:center
Listen, don't tell, 'kay?

00:20:02.285 --> 00:20:05.914 position:50% align:center
Especially Hirano. He'd get mad.

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:07.832 position:50% align:center
Okay, I won't.

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:15.507 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
There goes the final bell.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.219 position:50% align:center
His hair...
It looks really soft.

00:20:23.431 --> 00:20:26.101 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Why did I think that?

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.352 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki!

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.605 position:50% align:center
Here. I brought you this.

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:32.774 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] You went
all the way to the nurse?

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
No need. Luckily,
a friend of mine in class

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:36.528 position:50% align:center
happened to have it on him.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:40.657 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
They're small and delicate,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.243 position:50% align:center
but these are a guy's hands.

00:20:44.619 --> 00:20:45.787 position:50% align:center
Thanks a lot.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.080 position:50% align:center
No prob.

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.957 position:50% align:center
But still, go to the nurse
at some point, okay?

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.292 position:50% align:center
I can go with you if
you want some company.

00:20:51.376 --> 00:20:54.379 position:50% align:center
All right, I will. Just later.

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:58.049 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He's really kind
and so earnest, too.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:21:00.176 position:50% align:center
What about class? You're late.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.179 position:50% align:center
I'm heading back soon,
but you still need help?

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:09.269 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs]

00:21:09.352 --> 00:21:10.854 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I'm pretty sure
it's the first time

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.273 position:50% align:center
I've ever felt this way.

00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:15.025 position:50% align:center
Ahh, that's funny.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
You really are cute,
you know that?

00:21:17.068 --> 00:21:18.319 position:50% align:center
You wanna go out sometime?

00:21:18.403 --> 00:21:20.572 position:50% align:center
Uh. What? No.

00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center

Not a chance.
