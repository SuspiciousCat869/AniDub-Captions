00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:12.887 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Don't twist my words!

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:14.973 position:50% align:center
I meant, I need space
for today, yeah? Today.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.226 position:50% align:center
--Whoa.
--Guess somebody's arguing.

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
What's the matter?

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:22.439 position:50% align:center
Hirano.

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.607 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Why haven't
you guys gone home yet?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
Apparently, he's in a fight
with his girlfriend again.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.237 position:50% align:center
Fudanshi! Just the guy I need!

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.280 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.865 position:50% align:center
Since you're fluent in fujoshi!

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:33.366 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm what?

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.163 position:50% align:center
Uh, hi. Fudanshi speaking.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.000 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA] What do you think
about delinquent ukes?

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:43.376 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.961 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA] The type who thinks
he's too cool for school

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:47.714 position:50% align:center
and puts on a big macho act
when the seme's around.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.049 position:50% align:center
But as soon as they're
alone together,

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.633 position:50% align:center
he's taken completely off-guard

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.927 position:50% align:center
by the stronger and
more assertive seme,

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:54.971 position:50% align:center
and though his words
are shy and reluctant,

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
his body knows
exactly what it wants.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.517 position:50% align:center
The next day, the seme acts
all cool and unbothered,

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.769 position:50% align:center
showing that he's
got the upper hand

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:02.270 position:50% align:center
in their relationship again,

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.773 position:50% align:center
but he's hopelessly bound
to the object of his affection.

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:08.026 position:50% align:center
That's what makes for a
compelling delinquent uke!

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.362 position:50% align:center
So do you like that?

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.988 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I like that.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.114 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mya...

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.157 position:50% align:center
Listen here, punk,
you'd better not be

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.116 position:50% align:center
flirting with my girlfriend!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.284 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, of course I wasn't!

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:17.285 position:50% align:center
She was just explaining

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.120 position:50% align:center
delinquent ukes
to me, that's all!

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
Let me listen in, too.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.877 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Is it me,
or have they gotten super close?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.422 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why do you think
I'd have the answer to that?

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.466 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Sasaki's enjoying this.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.468 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA] I mean, of course
I like delinquent ukes.

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.678 position:50% align:center
Like who wouldn't?

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.680 position:50% align:center
But it wasn't 'til
I started dating Jiro...

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.555 position:50% align:center
Jiro?

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.265 position:50% align:center
Ogasawara's first name.

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:41.059 position:50% align:center
Aha.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:43.061 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA] Him being a delinquent
is just a coincidence.

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.145 position:50% align:center
That's it, end of story!

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.356 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI, MIYANO]
She never stops talking.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.650 position:50% align:center
Hey, put it on speaker
so I can hear, too.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.194 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA]
...obsessing over that stuff.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.779 position:50% align:center
Jiro is such an idiot!

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.155 position:50% align:center
What did you say?

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.199 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA]
Seriously! Why did you suddenly

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.368 position:50% align:center
ask for space out of nowhere?

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.744 position:50% align:center
I think you know.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.912 position:50% align:center
Because of that manga
that you were

00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:02.580 position:50% align:center
hiding in your photo albums!

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:05.166 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA gasps]
Why would you open it?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.752 position:50% align:center
I hid it in there so you
wouldn't get your feelings hurt!

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:09.421 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] But that just
made me suspicious!

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.006 position:50% align:center
I mean, the main characters
were a delinquent...

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.508 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why doesn't he
take it off speaker?

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.678 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] This is pretty typical
for those two, actually.

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.388 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
They sure are passionate.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.390 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
It's because they're so close.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.517 position:50% align:center
Happens every
couple weeks or so.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.227 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, when the storm clears.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.896 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Oh, it's still coming down.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.148 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA]
And when your lover's tentacles

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.691 position:50% align:center
are feverishly embracing you,

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:30.942 position:50% align:center
who needs words anyway?

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.527 position:50% align:center
Whoa. You're on speaker!

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.904 position:50% align:center
You really think it's okay
to yell stuff like that?

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.532 position:50% align:center
Hang on. Back me
up here, fudanshi.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.200 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a bit too much.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:42.162 position:50% align:center
Even he thinks so!
Have some manners, why don't ya?

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.123 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA] Oh my god.
You are the worst, Jiro.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:46.958 position:50% align:center
Why does your
timing always suck?

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.294 position:50% align:center
Having this discussion over
the phone is getting us nowhere.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
Stay put. I'm coming to

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.922 position:50% align:center
set the record straight
once and for all!

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.549 position:50% align:center
Like, right now?

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.634 position:50% align:center
Oh and look at that.
She hung up on me.

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.094 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
She's coming here?

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:01.598 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Yeah. She goes to
the co-ed school nearby.

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.643 position:50% align:center
Then it should only be
about ten minutes. What is it?

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:06.478 position:50% align:center
Uh, nothing, sorry.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:08.104 position:50% align:center
I gotta get going. See ya!

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:09.689 position:50% align:center
Hey, no running.

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna let her control
your life after you're married?

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.986 position:50% align:center
Oh, you guys are
getting married?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.030 position:50% align:center
If I don't see myself
marrying her,

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:18.615 position:50% align:center
then why would I date her?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.158 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:23.286 position:50% align:center
I bet your girlfriend really
likes that about you, Ogasawara.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
I can't tell if you guys
are messing with me!

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA gasps]
Eimi!

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.213 position:50% align:center
[YOKODA]
Hmph!

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:36.675 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Look, I'm sorry.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.178 position:50% align:center
Hashtag life goals.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.555 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
I'm headed this way. See ya.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:43.932 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Goodbye, Hirano.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.892 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Bye-bye.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.144 position:50% align:center
Whatcha say, Mya,
you want to hit the bookstore?

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.354 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.316 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
You know something?

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.611 position:50% align:center
When you and I walk down
the street together like this,

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
we look like a couple.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.410 position:50% align:center
Huh? Really? Why is that?

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.828 position:50% align:center
I mean, I would say
we just look like

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:06.579 position:50% align:center
classmates hanging out
after school.

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.456 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.635 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Does it make you self-conscious?

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:30.603 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Honestly?
I'm still deciding, so kind of.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.153 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Right.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:21.089 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Miyano. I brought you
an outfit for the competition!

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
But I have plenty of options.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:25.385 position:50% align:center
Sweet.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:26.970 position:50% align:center
Is it?

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.597 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] So, what's your class
doing for the festival?

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.475 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] An escape room.
You have to solve a mystery.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:34.310 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Well, doesn't that sound fun?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.271 position:50% align:center
Maybe I'll come
and check it out.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:38.606 position:50% align:center
--[MIYANO] You should!
--[TORIHARA] Miyano!

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.026 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sorry, guess that they
need me. I'll be right back.

00:06:41.109 --> 00:06:42.444 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:50.910 position:50% align:center
You'll have an outfit
ready to go, too,

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:52.495 position:50% align:center
in case we need a backup, right?

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.414 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:57.000 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Here you go, guys!
I went ahead and grabbed

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
as much cardboard
as I could find. So, uh.

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:04.591 position:50% align:center
Don't just drop it, Tashiro!

00:07:04.674 --> 00:07:07.677 position:50% align:center
Whoa. Hi there,
what's your name?

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:13.433 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Um, Tasuko Kuresawa.

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.269 position:50% align:center
Oh man, it's Kuresawa!

00:07:16.353 --> 00:07:19.439 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 8B] Dude, I can't
believe you fell for that!

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.233 position:50% align:center
Kuresawa, I got more
black curtains!

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:23.068 position:50% align:center
What's his problem?

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.194 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Nothing, okay?

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:26.029 position:50% align:center
Tashiro saw my outfit
for the festival

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:27.530 position:50% align:center
and fell for me instantly.

00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.074 position:50% align:center
But sadly, our love
wasn't meant to be.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Can you at least
not tell the world about it?

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.747 position:50% align:center
Listen, I try not to
turn my friends into BL,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.832 position:50% align:center
but you gotta stop giving me
all this free material.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:39.167 position:50% align:center
It's not me, it's him!

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.461 position:50% align:center
I just got caught
in the crossfire!

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:45.215 position:50% align:center
Hello? Can we do your fitting
after school tomorrow instead?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.884 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sure, that's fine.
Thanks for all your help.

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:50.053 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
My pleasure. Toodle-oo!

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] All right,
enough pouting, Tashiro.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.311 position:50% align:center
Everyone else has moved past it.

00:07:58.395 --> 00:07:59.854 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Please let me
hide from my shame, Kuresawa!

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:01.856 position:50% align:center
It's time to face the world.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.859 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO chuckles] So, did your
dress fit you pretty well?

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Hanzawa's sister is tall.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.990 position:50% align:center
She wears about the same size
as he does, apparently.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:14.828 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Then she's
gotta be over 5'7!

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.413 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
So, there's hope.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
Maybe in a year I'll
grow to be that tall, too!

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
Uh... Why're you
on your tiptoes?

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:26.423 position:50% align:center
If I had it my way,
I would grow to at least 5'9.

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.843 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] You probably will,
right? Aren't you like 5'7?

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.387 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Not sure. Wanna measure?

00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.189 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO yawns]

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.693 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I accidentally stayed
up all night reading something.

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
But how could I not?

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.446 position:50% align:center
They ended it by saying,

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.322 position:50% align:center
"His fingertips were
so cold because

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.408 position:50% align:center
he'd been nervous
the whole time."

00:08:53.491 --> 00:08:56.411 position:50% align:center
So, obviously I was gonna
reread it immediately.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.538 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO yawns]

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.892 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Why did I catch myself
thinking about Sasaki just then?

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:21.895 position:50% align:center
Oops, I'd better get to class!

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:22.854 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
Wow, your bangs are so cute!

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.651 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Please forget you ever
saw me like this, okay?!

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.028 position:50% align:center
I'll see you there, okay?

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:33.031 position:50% align:center
Cool. You've got bags
under your eyes today.

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:34.532 position:50% align:center
Did something happen?

00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:38.912 position:50% align:center
Not really. It just went on
too long, is all.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.789 position:50% align:center
What did?

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.874 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, I finished reading a novel

00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.918 position:50% align:center
on my phone yesterday.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
And then I started
re-reading it.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:50.840 position:50% align:center
I only meant to look back
at a few pages, but--

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:53.343 position:50% align:center
Ah, you stayed up
all night, didn't you?

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:55.303 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's not my fault
morning came so soon!

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:56.388 position:50% align:center
And your hair was a mess,

00:09:56.471 --> 00:09:58.515 position:50% align:center
so you threw a lil pin
in your bangs?

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.809 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's easier to read
if they're off my face.

00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:03.812 position:50% align:center
Aw, you're really cute
with your forehead showing.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.647 position:50% align:center
Not why I did it, but thanks.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.565 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hey, can I kiss you on the head?

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.694 position:50% align:center
Wait! What did you just ask me?

00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:13.655 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs]
Don't worry, I was just kidding.

00:10:13.738 --> 00:10:16.491 position:50% align:center
What if somebody walked by?
How scandalous!

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.368 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, that woke me up.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.414 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] But, if there
was no one around...

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.792 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Okay, I'll stop
messing with you now.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:27.210 position:50% align:center
Do you mind taking out
the clip though?

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.795 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.714 position:50% align:center
Seeing your hair in a different
style is throwing me for a loop.

00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:33.091 position:50% align:center
I don't know why,
but it just seems off.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
Okay, then. I'll take it down.

00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.599 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I hope there's not a crease.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.154 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
His hands. They're cold.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.781 position:50% align:center
Ah. There you are, Miya.

00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:10:58.158 --> 00:10:59.868 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, time for class.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.454 position:50% align:center
Sorry for keeping you here
so long. See you later!

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.205 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Right, see ya.

00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.515 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey.

00:11:31.816 --> 00:11:35.570 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
That kind of reminded me...

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:43.661 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] So many times,
when he touched me...

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.956 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
His fingertips...

00:11:49.584 --> 00:11:50.710 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
They were always cold.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:53.880 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:55.715 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Crap! I'm late!

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:03.223 position:50% align:center
Hello, Miyano! Special delivery!

00:12:03.306 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
Hi, Chairman.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I hope it was okay for me

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.603 position:50% align:center
to take you away
from your own class.

00:12:08.687 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
Well. Hirano said
it's all right.

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:12.607 position:50% align:center
As long as I go back over there

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.025 position:50% align:center
after we get done
with our fitting,

00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
there shouldn't be any problem.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.779 position:50% align:center
Now come closer, Miyano!

00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:18.613 position:50% align:center
Let's get you changed!

00:12:18.697 --> 00:12:20.156 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You're helping?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
There!

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:25.745 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, how is it?

00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:27.288 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Mm-hm!

00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:29.124 position:50% align:center
It's girly enough?

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.835 position:50% align:center
Well, it is made for women,
so I'd imagine so!

00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:33.795 position:50% align:center
No makeup yet,

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:36.339 position:50% align:center
but once it's all together,
it'll be perfect.

00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
Lift both your arms up for me.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.176 position:50% align:center
Oh, okay.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.429 position:50% align:center
Kuresawa's shoulders
are broader,

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:45.223 position:50% align:center
but you've got a wider frame
than I was expecting.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:48.059 position:50% align:center
I'll adjust the length
and get you a pair of boots.

00:12:48.143 --> 00:12:49.436 position:50% align:center
I can forgo the chest padding

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.188 position:50% align:center
for some extra frills
at the top too.

00:12:52.272 --> 00:12:54.733 position:50% align:center
You're putting a lot of
thought into this, huh?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.651 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Oh! Almost forgot
to show my sister

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
the finished ensemble!

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:58.945 position:50% align:center
Let me take a quick photo.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.113 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.115 position:50% align:center
Here's a fan so you can
conceal your face.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.367 position:50% align:center
If that's more
comfortable for you.

00:13:05.577 --> 00:13:06.703 position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.789 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I appreciate your help,

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:11.708 position:50% align:center
so don't take this
the wrong way,

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.586 position:50% align:center
but you're really enthusiastic
about the contest, huh?

00:13:14.669 --> 00:13:18.840 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] I am. It's my last
school festival, after all.

00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
I want to enjoy stuff
like this to the fullest

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.719 position:50% align:center
while I have a chance.

00:13:22.802 --> 00:13:26.014 position:50% align:center
Third years only have
six months until we graduate.

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.226 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Oh, so he's a third year!

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.394 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:38.401 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, Chairman.

00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:42.405 position:50% align:center
What do you think it means to
have feelings for somebody?

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.324 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Well, it's tricky.

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:47.410 position:50% align:center
I have to imagine it's different
from person to person.

00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.788 position:50% align:center
Ooh! Face the window!

00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:52.665 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
For starters,

00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.543 position:50% align:center
it means wanting to do
things for someone.

00:13:57.212 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
to spend time with them.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.302 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
The desire to hold their hand.

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
The desire to be by their side.

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.392 position:50% align:center
[KAGIURA]
Hirano!

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.310 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Wanting to kiss them.

00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:14.062 position:50% align:center
Wanting to hold them.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.317 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Wanting them all to yourself.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.737 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
All to myself.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:25.824 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] But I think
the main sign of love is--

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 8F]
Hey, Hanzawa!

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.077 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Be right there.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.663 position:50% align:center
Sorry, Miyano.
I'll be back in a sec.

00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:32.831 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Gotcha.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.383 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What's that mean?

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:45.885 position:50% align:center
Wanting to do things for him?

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.971 position:50% align:center
Like for his birthday?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.598 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I don't know.

00:14:50.682 --> 00:14:54.227 position:50% align:center
That was more of a thank-you
gift for looking out for me.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I never thought about it,

00:14:57.105 --> 00:15:01.651 position:50% align:center
but what sorts of things
would I like to do for Sasaki?

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:02.986 position:50% align:center
Hang on!

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:06.823 position:50% align:center
Why would I assume I want to
do anything for him?

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.910 position:50% align:center
Is it... because I think of him
as someone I'm pursuing,

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:13.955 position:50% align:center
as in, romantically
or something?

00:15:14.039 --> 00:15:15.874 position:50% align:center
I'm so confused!

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:19.836 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA laughs]

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:23.506 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Sorry to laugh,
but your hair. It's a mess!

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Well, it can be
kind of unruly sometimes.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.802 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
And what was your reason

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:29.471 position:50% align:center
for letting it grow out again?

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.764 position:50% align:center
Hiding your face or something?

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.474 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No. That doesn't bother me

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.017 position:50% align:center
as much as it used to.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.353 position:50% align:center
I rarely get teased
about it now.

00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.689 position:50% align:center
And besides, Sa--

00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:46.196 position:50% align:center
[gasps] S...Somehow,
I managed to

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:48.573 position:50% align:center
let that insecurity go,
eventually!

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Anyway, back to
what I was telling you earlier.

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:57.832 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah?

00:15:57.916 --> 00:16:01.503 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] I'd say,
if you can't get the thought

00:16:01.586 --> 00:16:02.879 position:50% align:center
of someone out of your mind,

00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.048 position:50% align:center
it probably means
you're in love.

00:16:05.131 --> 00:16:08.009 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Is that really what love is?

00:16:08.093 --> 00:16:11.763 position:50% align:center
I thought about Sasaki
pretty much all day today.

00:16:11.846 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.016 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Now, how about we go
show the class your new look?

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.768 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh? Wait, not yet!

00:16:16.851 --> 00:16:19.229 position:50% align:center
Just give me five more minutes!
I'm still not ready!

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:20.355 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
If you cut your hair,

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.440 position:50% align:center
it'd be easier to
fit under a wig.

00:16:22.524 --> 00:16:24.275 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'd rather not.

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:28.154 position:50% align:center
And besides, Sa--

00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:32.909 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
"Sa." So that's it. Huh.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.248 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I brought the printouts
of the answer sheets.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:39.290 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Oh, perfect.

00:16:39.374 --> 00:16:40.250 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Thanks, man.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.751 position:50% align:center
Want me to help cut them?

00:16:41.835 --> 00:16:42.919 position:50% align:center
Nah, we're okay,

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.629 position:50% align:center
you just focus on
your competition prep.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:47.007 position:50% align:center
I can work until
the chairman gets here.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.174 position:50% align:center
You mean, like, right now?

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.009 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
Hide!

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:50.218 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:52.012 position:50% align:center
I brought you a few options.

00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:53.430 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wow, I have déjà vu.

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.931 position:50% align:center
Hey, Chairman.

00:16:55.015 --> 00:16:57.350 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] So, which one is
prettier, short hair or long?

00:16:57.434 --> 00:16:58.768 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Oh, definitely short.

00:16:58.852 --> 00:17:00.645 position:50% align:center
I mean, his actual hair
is short already,

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:01.855 position:50% align:center
so we know it would suit him.

00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:02.939 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Ah, good point.

00:17:03.023 --> 00:17:04.149 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Guess they're not gonna factor

00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:07.736 position:50% align:center
my opinion into this at all,
but that's fine.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.945 position:50% align:center
You did look like a girl,

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.613 position:50% align:center
but it wasn't convincing
enough to get me to

00:17:10.697 --> 00:17:12.741 position:50% align:center
react the way I did to
Kuresawa's clothes.

00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.284 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Not sure if
I'm glad to hear that.

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:16.786 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Okay.
Time for the final touches!

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.330 position:50% align:center
Let's head somewhere
a bit more private.

00:17:20.457 --> 00:17:21.374 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
How do I look?

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:23.084 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
By Jove, I've done it!

00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:25.378 position:50% align:center
I told you I was
the man for the job.

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:26.546 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Better take pics.

00:17:26.629 --> 00:17:28.381 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
For your girlfriend?

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.508 position:50% align:center
Do you really want her to
see you dressed like a girl?

00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:33.011 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Trust me, she'll love it.

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:35.013 position:50% align:center
Now it just needs a filter.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:37.932 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Who is she?

00:17:38.892 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] You seem to be really
comfortable in cosplay, huh?

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:44.564 position:50% align:center
Have you worn costumes and stuff
for your girlfriend before?

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:46.399 position:50% align:center
Actually no, I haven't.

00:17:46.483 --> 00:17:49.069 position:50% align:center
But if she asked me to,
I would consider it.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:51.029 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Of course he would.

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:52.364 position:50% align:center
Why wouldn't I, right?

00:17:52.447 --> 00:17:53.490 position:50% align:center
When she's in the hospital,

00:17:53.573 --> 00:17:56.576 position:50% align:center
things can get
lonely and boring.

00:17:56.659 --> 00:17:59.537 position:50% align:center
I want to do
whatever I can for her.

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:01.539 position:50% align:center
That's really nice.

00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:04.668 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] You sure care
about her, don't you, Kuresawa?

00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.669 position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:06.795 position:50% align:center
[phone chimes]

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA chuckles]

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.175 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] I bet she'd
like one of him, too.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.551 position:50% align:center
Hey, Miyano--

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:18.765 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] On second thought,
I'd be mad if a guy

00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:22.185 position:50% align:center
took pictures of my girlfriend,
so I'd better not.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:23.520 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:18:23.603 --> 00:18:27.273 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Never mind.
I'm gonna go show my class.

00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:31.986 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Good idea. Did you
cut your hair, Miyano?

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.072 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Yeah, I was
already planning to.

00:18:34.155 --> 00:18:36.574 position:50% align:center
Besides, it'll be easier to
fit under the wig this way.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
That's true.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:40.203 position:50% align:center
You've got such long and
luscious locks, after all!

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.872 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hey, watch it!

00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
Why are you always
messing with me?

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:51.506 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Hello? Be right there.

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:53.842 position:50% align:center
Hirano needs me
for a few minutes.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:56.011 position:50% align:center
We'll do your makeup
when I get back, okay?

00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.971 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sure, sounds good!

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.101 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
The chairman seems really busy.

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:06.021 position:50% align:center
He must have a lot
on his plate lately.

00:19:06.104 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
And yet he still finds time to

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:10.567 position:50% align:center
help me and Kuresawa
with our outfits.

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Guess I just missed him.

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:20.994 position:50% align:center
Wonder what he was
doing in there.

00:19:29.002 --> 00:19:31.129 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Is that you, Mya?

00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:33.798 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki! What a surprise!

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:36.718 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I--I just came by
to talk to Hanzawa.

00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:38.720 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Uh, I think Hirano asked him to

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:40.180 position:50% align:center
do something real quick.

00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Now what?

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:44.059 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh. That makes sense.

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hirano asked me
to come get him,

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
but I guess he ended up
calling him over.

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:54.194 position:50% align:center
So, uh, Mya?

00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:59.199 position:50% align:center
Are you dressed up for
that competition thing?

00:19:59.282 --> 00:20:01.785 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, I guess the secret's out.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.038 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] My classmates
asked me to do it.

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:08.458 position:50% align:center
They said I didn't have to
go super girly with it, so--

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.962 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Up until Sasaki walked in,

00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:16.174 position:50% align:center
I didn't really care
if people saw me like this.

00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:19.094 position:50% align:center
Why do I suddenly
feel so embarrassed?

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.848 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, since Hanzawa's not here,

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.141 position:50% align:center
you should probably
be getting back to your--

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:26.685 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
You just let your classmates

00:20:26.768 --> 00:20:28.645 position:50% align:center
pressure you like that?

00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:38.738 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Wait, no. I-I didn't...

00:20:41.199 --> 00:20:45.912 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Sorry. That came out
really harsh for some reason.

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:49.249 position:50% align:center
Um, just forget it, okay?

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:51.668 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I can't forget that.

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
His tone was so rough.

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.257 position:50% align:center
I wasn't prepared
for that at all.

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:03.263 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I didn't think he was
being a jerk or anything.

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.432 position:50% align:center
It just surprised me.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.852 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It sounded more like
the way he speaks

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:11.479 position:50% align:center
around Hirano and Ogasawara.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:15.817 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hold on.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.529 position:50% align:center
He's that worried about
how he talks to me?

00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:22.782 position:50% align:center
That's kind of unexpected.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Why?

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:31.708 position:50% align:center
Uh, what were you saying?

00:21:34.836 --> 00:21:37.005 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It's because he likes me!

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Miyano.

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:45.305 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah?

00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.558 position:50% align:center
I need to ask you something
and it's gonna be selfish.

00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:53.063 position:50% align:center
If I wanted you to
drop out of that contest,

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:54.481 position:50% align:center
would you do it?

00:22:01.529 --> 00:22:02.280 position:50% align:center
Sorry, that was--

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.656 position:50% align:center
I mean!

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:06.618 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What should I do?

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.328 position:50% align:center
The chairman and
his friends put so much work

00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.623 position:50% align:center
into helping me prepare
for the competition.

00:22:11.706 --> 00:22:13.625 position:50% align:center
We all agreed
I was gonna do it,

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:18.797 position:50% align:center
so it feels kinda wrong
to back out now. Um...

00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:22.008 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I have to.

00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:23.176 position:50% align:center
I'm sure there's no harm in

00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:25.595 position:50% align:center
at least talking to
everybody about it.

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:30.141 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'll go see Kuresawa.

00:22:43.905 --> 00:22:45.782 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You all right, Sasaki?

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.578 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
It's killing me.

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:52.122 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um...

00:22:52.205 --> 00:22:53.873 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He could've just said
it was out of the question,

00:22:53.957 --> 00:22:55.083 position:50% align:center
but he thought about it.

00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:58.294 position:50% align:center
I like him. Control yourself.
I really do!

00:22:58.378 --> 00:22:59.421 position:50% align:center
Sasaki? You're super quiet.

00:22:59.504 --> 00:23:01.089 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I want to take care of him.

00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:02.298 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Is there something wrong?

00:23:02.382 --> 00:23:03.883 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hold him!

00:23:17.355 --> 00:23:18.898 position:50% align:center
[BOTH]
I like him!

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.542 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I realized it just now.

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.921 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I finally know how I feel!
