00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.554 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sorry. I'll just head home.

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:15.890 position:50% align:center
What? Sasaki, wait--

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.102 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 11B]
You ready, Miyano?

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.312 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Hey,
just gimme a minute.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.064 position:50% align:center
Please wait for me!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
[EZAKI] Weird to think
about how the seniors are

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.909 position:50% align:center
gonna be gone at
the end of the year.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:36.745 position:50% align:center
This'll have to wait!

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.331 position:50% align:center
Well, okay, then.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.168 position:50% align:center
Looks like the new Vice Chairman
just ditched out on us.

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
You don't normally see Miyano

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.629 position:50% align:center
running around
the halls like that.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.091 position:50% align:center
Heh. Not the greatest look
for this committee.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.109 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, wait!

00:02:31.192 --> 00:02:36.573 position:50% align:center
He's not here. He left?
Maybe he's out front.

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.665 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I think I may have
messed that up.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:51.379 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Don't leave.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:00.430 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You misunderstood me. I wasn't--

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:08.188 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I--I would have been
fine with him kissing me.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.482 position:50% align:center
More than fine.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:11.399 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Hello, hello!

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:15.028 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]
Oh, hi, Hanzawa.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:16.529 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hirano.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
Um, have you seen Sasaki
around here, by any chance?

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:21.117 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
No, have you?

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:22.410 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Nope.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.539 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh?

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.209 position:50% align:center
Is that necessary?

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:32.629 position:50% align:center
Looks like he must've taken off.
Only his jacket's here.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.172 position:50% align:center
Maybe try his phone?

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.550 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, um, I don't actually
have his phone number, so...

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding me,
you still don't have it?

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm an idiot.

00:03:47.977 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]
It's fine, just breathe.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.190 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm trying.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
You and Sasaki are
dating now, aren't you?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.612 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.031 position:50% align:center
Um. Well, no.
I wouldn't really say that.

00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:01.908 position:50% align:center
You could have fooled me.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.869 position:50% align:center
Sasaki and I aren't dating.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:06.955 position:50% align:center
Well, not exactly, but--

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.749 position:50% align:center
But you do like him.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.293 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yes.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.758 position:50% align:center
It can be tough having
that kind of relationship.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.802 position:50% align:center
Some people don't understand it.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
Speaking from experience?

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:27.267 position:50% align:center
Not me personally,
but it runs in the family.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.563 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] It was the guys
in my family's case,

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.939 position:50% align:center
and I've probably always felt

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.108 position:50% align:center
a little protective
of both of them,

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:36.818 position:50% align:center
so it was nerve-wracking
when I would see them

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:39.738 position:50% align:center
arguing or fighting
with their partners.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
Somehow, I can't see
you and Sasaki

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.535 position:50% align:center
fighting the way
they did, though.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.288 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
People will ask questions they'd

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
never think to ask a guy
and a girl who were going out.

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
It's like they just can't
help themselves, you know?

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.005 position:50% align:center
Even if it's irrelevant
to the discussion.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.050 position:50% align:center
I'm rambling.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
Point is, you might have to
deal with that sort of thing.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:04.846 position:50% align:center
It worries me a bit.

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:06.222 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:05:08.683 --> 00:05:10.769 position:50% align:center
Even if someone
does say something,

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.063 position:50% align:center
I believe that Sasaki
and I can handle it.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.482 position:50% align:center
I feel safe with him around.

00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:22.072 position:50% align:center
Which is why there's no way
I'd do anything to hurt him or

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
make him worry about me
if I can help it--

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.241 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.369 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Fine, you can
laugh at me if you want.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:30.622 position:50% align:center
No, no, no, sorry.
Your lovey-dovey talk is sweet.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:32.082 position:50% align:center
Hold on, lovey-dovey talk?

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:34.459 position:50% align:center
Stop it. That's not
what I was doing at all!

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.252 position:50% align:center
What's got you so worked up?

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.879 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
Oh, did he answer?

00:05:37.962 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Nope, no dice.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.174 position:50% align:center
So maybe he's on the train then?

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.343 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
That or helping out his family.

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:44.844 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:47.514 position:50% align:center
Apparently his family
runs a bakery.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.099 position:50% align:center
A bakery?

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.227 position:50% align:center
[gasps] Sorry, guys.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.105 position:50% align:center
I've got an idea,
so I'll have to see you later.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.356 position:50% align:center
Thank you both so much!

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.649 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:07.242 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
I wonder if it'll work out.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.577 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's me, you forgot
some stuff at school,

00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.121 position:50% align:center
so you better get back here.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.498 position:50% align:center
--Is that him?
--No. I left a message.

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.625 position:50% align:center
I didn't realize
he'd left anything.

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.921 position:50% align:center
I lied. I'm trying to
get him to run into Miyano.

00:06:20.005 --> 00:06:24.134 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles] No guarantee
they won't miss each other.

00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:25.760 position:50% align:center
Well, if they do and
he comes here anyway,

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.846 position:50% align:center
then at least I can smack him.

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:30.140 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA chuckles]
I think the library has

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.808 position:50% align:center
some old practice exams.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:32.934 position:50% align:center
Wanna see who scores higher

00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:34.978 position:50% align:center
while we wait to see
if they score?

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:36.479 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Sure.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I can't believe
I tried to kiss him.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:05.008 position:50% align:center
We're not even dating yet.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:08.303 position:50% align:center
It's not cool at all
to do that on impulse.

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.264 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I remember which
station he gets off at.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.517 position:50% align:center
We rode together a ton when
he was prepping for exams.

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I was too forceful.

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.819 position:50% align:center
I'm not proud of that.

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.821 position:50% align:center
Miyano may be a guy, too,

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:30.033 position:50% align:center
but I'm bigger and
stronger than he is.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.334 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What do you think it means

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:42.337 position:50% align:center
to have feelings for somebody?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.546 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA]
For starters,

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.383 position:50% align:center
it means wanting to do
things for someone.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.010 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] ...and I want
to take care of you.

00:07:49.094 --> 00:07:53.765 position:50% align:center
There are so many things
I still want to do for him.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I told him
I'd wait until he's ready,

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.772 position:50% align:center
but my restraint keeps slipping.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
I should probably
distance myself from him,

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:05.777 position:50% align:center
but that would be even harder.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.153 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.824 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I better apologize
to him tomorrow.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.504 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki.

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:08:28.842 --> 00:08:30.927 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] That's the right
station for the bakery.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.263 position:50% align:center
He said it's his house, too.

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.556 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks.

00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:38.226 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki's so sweet.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.771 position:50% align:center
I can tell he cares about me
and the things I like.

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.566 position:50% align:center
I want to try something
you like next.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.485 position:50% align:center
It was a great story,
I loved it.

00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.363 position:50% align:center
This story wouldn't have been
the same if it wasn't a BL.

00:08:50.447 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
I saw that the next
volume was out,

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:54.409 position:50% align:center
so I bought it myself.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:58.455 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
And I know... for sure now...

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
...I really do want...
to kiss him, too.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.052 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki's house
should be this w--

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Is that you, Mya?

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:15.096 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:22.437 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki. It looks like
you're headed somewhere.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.607 position:50% align:center
But, um, do you think
we can talk first?

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.567 position:50% align:center
I guess I forgot
some stuff at school,

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.778 position:50% align:center
so I was just on my way back.

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.446 position:50% align:center
But why are you here?

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
Because I needed to see you.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:40.497 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Okay, then,
let's find a place to talk.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:00.558 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] In the beginning,
it was just admiration.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.916 position:50% align:center
So, Sasaki, I want--

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.334 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hold on.

00:10:30.672 --> 00:10:32.632 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Mya, please, let me just say

00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:36.094 position:50% align:center
how sorry I am for earlier.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:40.223 position:50% align:center
I know we're not going out,
and I was too pushy.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.226 position:50% align:center
I meant to wait for your
answer out of respect.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.604 position:50% align:center
I'm so sorry.

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.321 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, I like you.

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.664 position:50% align:center
Again, please.

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:07.917 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] "Again"? Is he
talking about my confession?

00:11:15.842 --> 00:11:19.262 position:50% align:center
I said, I really
like you, Sasaki!

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:31.566 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait. Is everything okay?

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.735 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Sorry. N-No, I-I-I mean,

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:36.237 position:50% align:center
y-you can think about it
some more. No rush.

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.239 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
But I don't need any more time.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:39.741 position:50% align:center
I've had plenty.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:43.161 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, right. I guess you have.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.916 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I feel like time with
you always flies by, so--

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:51.795 position:50% align:center
Sasaki, I really like
spending time with you, too.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:56.716 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Are you sure about what
you're saying right now, Mya?

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.844 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm absolutely sure.

00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.972 position:50% align:center
I was just caught off guard
earlier, that's all.

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.058 position:50% align:center
My hand accidentally
bumped into you.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.395 position:50% align:center
So, um. I wasn't telling you no.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.272 position:50% align:center
It's fine, just breathe.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.067 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Take a deep breath.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:19.114 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] The things that,
um, happened that day,

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:21.491 position:50% align:center
and the time we spent
talking on the train.

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
I really liked it all so much.

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:29.082 position:50% align:center
Also, you were so
supportive at the festival.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.750 position:50% align:center
It made me really happy.

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:32.544 position:50% align:center
And after the movie,
you were so nice to me,

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.212 position:50% align:center
just like you always are.

00:12:34.295 --> 00:12:37.924 position:50% align:center
I can't tell you
how relieved I was.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:40.051 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It seems like
words aren't enough

00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.762 position:50% align:center
to explain how
I really feel to him.

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] But I can't
expect him to read my mind!

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:51.438 position:50% align:center
So, when I say I like
being around you,

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.982 position:50% align:center
it isn't just because
I admire you. Really.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:59.612 position:50% align:center
Uh, I mean I do, of course,
but I also think you're cute.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.282 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Wait, hold on.

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.577 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Let me try that again.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.289 position:50% align:center
What I'm getting at
is that I think you're cool.

00:13:09.372 --> 00:13:11.499 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Did I say that all wrong?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.210 position:50% align:center
After we started hanging out,

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.503 position:50% align:center
I saw you being brave,

00:13:15.587 --> 00:13:17.714 position:50% align:center
and wished I were
more like that.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.466 position:50% align:center
And you showed me
how wonderful it is

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.510 position:50% align:center
to have someone take
interest in what I like.

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:26.056 position:50% align:center
Someone who will ask questions
without any trace of judgment.

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
I enjoy finding out more about
the things you like, too,

00:13:29.476 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
and talking with you never
fails to put me at ease.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
But there's way more than that.

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:37.108 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sometimes I just want to

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.654 position:50% align:center
wrap my arms around you so bad.

00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:44.616 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
This is frustrating.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.912 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It makes me happy
to see you smile or laugh.

00:13:48.995 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
And I want to be able to
touch you and everything.

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:58.546 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Does he understand me?

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.592 position:50% align:center
This means you and I
feel the same way

00:14:02.676 --> 00:14:05.387 position:50% align:center
about each other, doesn't it?

00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.268 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] How can I
get this across to him?

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.689 position:50% align:center
You like me.

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:21.027 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Are you nervous?
Your hand is so cold.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.746 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's not just mine.
Your hand is cold, too.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Yeah.

00:14:37.335 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Is it okay if I hug you?

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.131 position:50% align:center
Oh, by all means.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:44.926 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]
I'm sorry. But "by all means."

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.803 position:50% align:center
That's too freaking cute, Mya.

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, I think you're cute, too!

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:54.102 position:50% align:center
What am I supposed to
do with you?

00:15:17.542 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Does this mean we can kiss, too?

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.469 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yes, Sasaki.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.679 position:50% align:center
If it's you, then I want to.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.567 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:16:32.617 --> 00:16:35.328 position:50% align:center
You sure you're
alright with this?

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:37.956 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Very.

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:42.085 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] I'm so sorry.

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
Your heartbeat's
like super loud.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.798 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, don't listen to it then!

00:16:46.881 --> 00:16:50.051 position:50% align:center
It's just, I've never done
anything like this before.

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
I know.

00:16:56.266 --> 00:16:59.477 position:50% align:center
Trust me. Mine's pounding, too.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.021 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.316 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
It is.

00:17:10.238 --> 00:17:12.157 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI groans]

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.909 position:50% align:center
I'm not ready to graduate.

00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:18.121 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] You have to,
don't let me stop you!

00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:20.915 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] It keeps coming closer
and I'm kinda freaked.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.335 position:50% align:center
I mean, school's almost over.

00:17:23.418 --> 00:17:26.338 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, at school,
the stuff you left.

00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:29.341 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right,
Hirano's probably waiting.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.802 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Eh, it doesn't matter.

00:17:32.886 --> 00:17:34.679 position:50% align:center
He probably lied
about that anyway.

00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.181 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh, come on,
Hirano wouldn't just

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.682 position:50% align:center
lie to you like that.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
I mean, I don't think
he would, anyway.

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.478 position:50% align:center
You think we should call him?

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:43.646 position:50% align:center
Um, I guess so.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.565 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Here, Mya. You do the talking.

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Huh?

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.861 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Does he mean like this?

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.654 position:50% align:center
Hey, Hirano?

00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Huh? Miyano?

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.741 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, yeah.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:57.535 position:50% align:center
Sasaki can't exactly
come to the phone right now.

00:17:57.619 --> 00:17:58.912 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:02.457 position:50% align:center
Oh, well, I was wrong
about him leaving his stuff.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
Tell him for me. Bye.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.753 position:50% align:center
Time to go.

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:11.132 position:50% align:center
[HANZAWA] Hmph. It looks like
this round was a draw.

00:18:11.216 --> 00:18:12.634 position:50% align:center
So, what'd he say?

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
Guess he was mistaken
about your stuff.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:17.097 position:50% align:center
Of course he was.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.973 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Was that his plan
to get Sasaki and me

00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:20.016 position:50% align:center
to run into each other?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.060 position:50% align:center
Saying he forgot something?

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:24.270 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:26.606 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
I like you and I want you
to be my boyfriend!

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:34.197 position:50% align:center
Why so formal all of a sudden?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.491 position:50% align:center
Because of this BL manga
I read before.

00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:38.493 position:50% align:center
Volume two ended with them
saying they liked each other,

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.036 position:50% align:center
which was great,
but then in volume three,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.454 position:50% align:center
they still weren't
even dating yet.

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:42.997 position:50% align:center
That procrastination
stressed me out,

00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:44.541 position:50% align:center
and I don't wanna waste time.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI chuckles]

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.503 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki, stop laughing at me.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:52.465 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Sorry, sorry.
I just can't handle it.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.883 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs]

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:56.094 position:50% align:center
What exactly can't you handle?

00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:59.723 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'll stop. So, Mya.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:02.308 position:50% align:center
Do you wanna go out with me?

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.185 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.895 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Ahh, that's funny.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.731 position:50% align:center
You really are cute,
you know that?

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:09.733 position:50% align:center
You wanna go out sometime?

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:14.529 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.203 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here we go. It's our turn now.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.081 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, I forgot.

00:19:25.165 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
We really should
exchange numbers.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.586 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's a good call.
I almost forgot again, too.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.297 position:50% align:center
I just had Hirano contact you
if anything happened.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.923 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Well, we can't
always bother him.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:37.344 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs]
Okay, so my number's 080--

00:19:37.427 --> 00:19:39.429 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hold on, give me a second.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.893 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
This is our story.

00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.020 position:50% align:center
And it's only just beginning.

00:21:24.075 --> 00:21:25.368 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:28.246 position:50% align:center
[FUJIMI]
What's up?

00:21:28.329 --> 00:21:30.123 position:50% align:center
Tell you later, okay?

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.584 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Good morning.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
Congratulations.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.003 position:50% align:center
Can I tell my girlfriend?

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:36.629 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Um, I don't think so.

00:21:36.713 --> 00:21:39.132 position:50% align:center
Didn't hear a "no" in there.

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:40.592 position:50% align:center
What are we congratulating?

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:42.635 position:50% align:center
[ALL]
Hm?

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
Bathroom break.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:46.139 position:50% align:center
What? I don't have to go!

00:21:46.222 --> 00:21:47.640 position:50% align:center
Just come with me.

00:21:47.724 --> 00:21:49.309 position:50% align:center
Wait, me, too?

00:21:49.392 --> 00:21:51.186 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
I'm totally wiped.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.731 position:50% align:center
Stop picking up these odd jobs.
We're not here for manual labor.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.775 position:50% align:center
It's basically
a chance to stretch.

00:21:56.858 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
Don't want your
joints getting stiff.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
You should move more.

00:21:59.694 --> 00:22:01.029 position:50% align:center
For real?

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:06.743 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hirano.

00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:07.786 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:09.245 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
We're dating now.

00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:10.747 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.123 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO]
This isn't the bathroom.

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:13.875 position:50% align:center
Very perceptive of you.

00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.835 position:50% align:center
Tashiro, do you
remember what you said

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.671 position:50% align:center
about Miyano and
Sasaki being together

00:22:17.754 --> 00:22:19.255 position:50% align:center
back before Christmas?

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:21.883 position:50% align:center
Yeah. But I was
totally off track with that.

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:24.386 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have to
tell people sooner or later.

00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:25.637 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I mean, I guess,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.640 position:50% align:center
but I don't know if
I was quite ready yet.

00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:30.850 position:50% align:center
So, yeah, it's true.

00:22:30.934 --> 00:22:32.936 position:50% align:center
Sasaki and I are
officially a couple.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:35.939 position:50% align:center
Huh? Wait, really?
So, I was right?

00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:37.524 position:50% align:center
For once, yes.

00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:41.152 position:50% align:center
Oh. Well, good for you guys.

00:22:41.236 --> 00:22:42.362 position:50% align:center
Thanks?

00:22:42.445 --> 00:22:45.115 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Dammit.
Look, I'm not great at this.

00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:47.659 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
And water is wet.

00:22:47.742 --> 00:22:50.787 position:50% align:center
By the way, would the two of you
exchange numbers already?

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.996 position:50% align:center
Oh, we did. Yesterday.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.915 position:50% align:center
I can't believe how long
it took for you two

00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:55.041 position:50% align:center
to get up the nerve!

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:57.293 position:50% align:center
Yeah, seriously.

00:22:57.377 --> 00:22:59.671 position:50% align:center
But it's wonderful
that it all worked out.

00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:00.922 position:50% align:center
Eavesdrop, much?

00:23:01.006 --> 00:23:02.674 position:50% align:center
I overheard.

00:23:02.757 --> 00:23:04.426 position:50% align:center
Wait, what's so wonderful?

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.970 position:50% align:center
Oh. We'll fill you in later.

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:08.054 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Huh?

00:23:09.097 --> 00:23:12.642 position:50% align:center
Oh, crap! I can't be late
to class one more time!

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:14.894 position:50% align:center
Tashiro, there's no
running in the halls.

00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:17.105 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] That's our
Disciplinary Vice Chairman.

00:23:17.188 --> 00:23:19.357 position:50% align:center
It's you! Hey, Mya, what's up?

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:22.652 position:50% align:center
Oh, hey, it's good to see you!

00:23:22.736 --> 00:23:24.863 position:50% align:center
So, um, having
a good morning so far?

00:23:24.946 --> 00:23:25.947 position:50% align:center
Yeah, it's great.

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:27.782 position:50% align:center
You better hit
the books hard, huh?

00:23:27.866 --> 00:23:28.867 position:50% align:center
I will.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.410 position:50% align:center
Exams aren't far off.

00:23:30.493 --> 00:23:31.828 position:50% align:center
Good luck studying.

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:33.371 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you'll do great.

00:23:33.455 --> 00:23:34.789 position:50% align:center
Thanks!
