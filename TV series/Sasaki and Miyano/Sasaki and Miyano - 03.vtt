[MIYANO]
Oh, Sasaki. Good morning!

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.230 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mya, how's it going?

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:24.274 position:50% align:center
Aren't you here
kind of early today?

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:27.068 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Too early, but Hirano
summoned me, so...

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Summoned you?

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:30.447 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Well, exams are
almost here, you know?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
And my grades aren't
exactly in the best shape,

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.411 position:50% align:center
so he graciously agreed
to help me study.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
Sadly, he's got to
make dorm curfew,

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.165 position:50% align:center
so we meet up early.

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:41.624 position:50% align:center
I see.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:43.001 position:50% align:center
[phone buzzes]

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.340 position:50% align:center
Mya, are you free right now?

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:54.220 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Hirano's running late.
You wanna join me for cocoa?

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.098 position:50% align:center
I haven't told you what I think
about the latest manga.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:30.734 position:50% align:center
[coughs]

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.485 position:50% align:center
Hey, you doing okay there?

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.945 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:36.656 position:50% align:center
You're what some people call
"cat-tongued," aren't you?

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.908 position:50% align:center
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:42.370 position:50% align:center
But I guess hot stuff
is hard for me to handle.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:44.748 position:50% align:center
Wait a sec,
what's that goofy grin for?

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:47.334 position:50% align:center
Um, please just ignore me!

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.419 position:50% align:center
Why're you asking, anyway?

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:50.670 position:50% align:center
No reason, honestly.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.422 position:50% align:center
I saw something on
television that said

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.923 position:50% align:center
people who are
cat-tongued tend to be

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.759 position:50% align:center
a little clumsy with
their tongues, that's all.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.427 position:50% align:center
Oh yeah?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.095 position:50% align:center
When I heard about it
for the first time,

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.805 position:50% align:center
I thought,
"I can't help but wonder

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.016 position:50% align:center
if they're clumsy
at kissing, too."

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.019 position:50% align:center
In a BL story,
a cat-tongued person

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
being taught how to kiss
would be a great hook.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.647 position:50% align:center
I don't think anyone's
thought of it yet!

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.524 position:50% align:center
The moe potential in
a situation like that

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.068 position:50% align:center
would be off the charts,

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.944 position:50% align:center
so I thought maybe you could
shed some light on it for me!

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:17.113 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Huh. I guess
I'll never understand

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:20.033 position:50% align:center
the inner workings
of the fudanshi mind.

00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:23.703 position:50% align:center
Well, then, since we're here,

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
maybe we oughtta
test that theory.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.665 position:50% align:center
What theory?

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.251 position:50% align:center
Let's find out
whether I'm clumsy.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.215 position:50% align:center
I didn't mean it like that!

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.676 position:50% align:center
I'm not looking for
a real-life BL experience!

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI laughs]

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.681 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Anyway, I've got
another manga here for you.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:45.308 position:50% align:center
Another one already?
How many manga do you have?

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.310 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I mean, it's not that many!

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.396 position:50% align:center
I feel like I've borrowed tons.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.565 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's not like we're
doing this on a daily basis.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.526 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I guess not.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.695 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here, just take it.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:57.946 position:50% align:center
This one is the
first installment

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.280 position:50% align:center
of a series, actually.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:00.657 position:50% align:center
There've been over ten books.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.866 position:50% align:center
Just start with the first few

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.702 position:50% align:center
and find out if you
like it or not, okay?

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.412 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.914 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Does he have
a whole library or what?

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.333 position:50% align:center
I must've borrowed at least 30.

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:13.420 position:50% align:center
Well, I should probably
get going now.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.088 position:50% align:center
But I appreciate the hot cocoa!

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:17.257 position:50% align:center
No problem. Bye.

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:25.306 position:50% align:center
I'm not looking for
a real-life BL experience!

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
If I could touch him...

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:40.196 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] That wasn't what
I meant. It really wasn't.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.699 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
But if someone had looked at it

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.868 position:50% align:center
from an outside perspective...

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.705 position:50% align:center
Hey, so, do you think that
if someone's cat-tongued,

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:51.124 position:50% align:center
then they're not
a good kisser, or?

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.669 position:50% align:center
What do you say you and I
test that theory now?

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.213 position:50% align:center
That's not what I was
trying to say!

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:03.261 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Accidental flirting.
It's a classic BL setup! Oh god!

00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:07.515 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Listen, about this
worksheet. What's wrong?

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.685 position:50% align:center
Sorry, I don't know how
to react to this situation.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:13.271 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
You look like someone died.

00:05:13.355 --> 00:05:15.523 position:50% align:center
Never mind, I'll figure it out.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.820 position:50% align:center
Ohh, that's funny.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.781 position:50% align:center
You really are cute,
you know that?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:23.990 position:50% align:center
You wanna go out sometime?

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.992 position:50% align:center
Uh. What? No.

00:05:27.202 --> 00:05:29.788 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I could never tell for sure.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.041 position:50% align:center
Was he joking? Or serious?

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.126 position:50% align:center
Kind of out there for a joke.

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:37.337 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.422 position:50% align:center
I'm getting to know
someone I like.

00:05:41.424 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I wonder what he meant

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.053 position:50% align:center
when he said
all that stuff to me.

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:48.431 position:50% align:center
[bell chimes]

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
--Oops.
--What's up?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.977 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I forgot to give
Sasaki one of the volumes.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.480 position:50% align:center
Oh, you guys are still
doing that manga thing?

00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Mm-hmm.

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.983 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] You might be able to
catch him before he leaves.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:01.236 position:50% align:center
Yeah, do you mind if I
go check real quick?

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.278 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
No problem.

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.613 position:50% align:center
I'll wait for you
by the entrance.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.323 position:50% align:center
'Kay, thanks a lot.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.244 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well, he has volume one.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:12.831 position:50% align:center
With exams, he might be
too busy to read volume two.

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.834 position:50% align:center
It can probably wait
'til next time.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.043 position:50% align:center
Then again,

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
I'd really like him to
read both together.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.299 position:50% align:center
This series gets especially good
in the second installment!

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.302 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
Perfect! He's still here!

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasaki?

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:31.433 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
So, you've been reading BL?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.269 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What?

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.187 position:50% align:center
I didn't know you were
into that kinda thing.

00:06:36.271 --> 00:06:37.480 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh no.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:38.982 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] You'd be surprised
how many good ones

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.109 position:50% align:center
there are once
you give it a try.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:42.527 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What should I do?

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.320 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Is it weird to read
about two guys in love?

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:47.657 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] He's being
misunderstood. Because of me!

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:51.369 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yeah, I get that it's
kind of a niche thing, but uh,

00:06:51.453 --> 00:06:54.581 position:50% align:center
this story wouldn't have been
the same if it wasn't a BL.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:56.124 position:50% align:center
I like it the way it is, man.

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:57.917 position:50% align:center
I don't see a problem.

00:07:03.006 --> 00:07:03.757 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
I just don't understand

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.550 position:50% align:center
what all the hype is about.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.052 position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I don't
understand why you're

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.429 position:50% align:center
so desperate to
have me explain it.

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:11.765 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] To tell you
the truth, it's my girlfriend.

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:13.391 position:50% align:center
She's a fujoshi!

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.393 position:50% align:center
I found a BL manga
under her pillow!

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.311 position:50% align:center
Can you believe that?

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.646 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Ah, I get it now.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.657 position:50% align:center
Did you not catch him in time?
Why are you so out of breath?

00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:31.910 position:50% align:center
No, I caught him.
He was still in the classroom,

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
but, it's just, I decided it
would be a better idea

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:37.082 position:50% align:center
to wait and do it
next week instead.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.835 position:50% align:center
I almost gave it to him,
but then, he, uh...

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.087 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Hmm?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
Well, when I noticed how cool

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:47.008 position:50% align:center
and collected he was,
I just left!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.846 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Ow!

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.890 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] You're right,
Sasaki's a cool guy.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.226 position:50% align:center
Now put on your shoes.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.646 position:50% align:center
Yeah. That's what it is,
right? He is cool!

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:00.730 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Hm?

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.152 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I think Sasaki is cool.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:08.279 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I have since we first met.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
[TEACHER 3A] The "future plans"
form is due Monday.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:19.207 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3A groans]

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.543 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Hey, do you need to buy lunch?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:24.212 position:50% align:center
Nah, I bought something
on the way here.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.548 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Cool. I'll be right back then.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:27.716 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm cold. What to do?

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.809 position:50% align:center
I still haven't given him
the second volume.

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.186 position:50% align:center
I don't see a problem, man.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.981 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It didn't seem
like it bothered him,

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:45.942 position:50% align:center
but what'll happen if someone
confronts him again?

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:49.154 position:50% align:center
I can't exactly say
I have any experience

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:50.822 position:50% align:center
reading that kind of manga.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.741 position:50% align:center
So yeah, it caught me
off guard at first,

00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:55.076 position:50% align:center
but I really liked it!

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.786 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Still.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:57.829 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Where's Miyano?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:58.872 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3B]
Over there.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.623 position:50% align:center
He's the one
hunched over his desk.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:02.751 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Sasaki.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.419 position:50% align:center
What's up, are you
taking a nap?

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, I was just kinda chilly.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.089 position:50% align:center
Aww, you're chilly, huh?

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:11.593 position:50% align:center
So that's why you were
all curled up? [chuckles]

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:13.219 position:50% align:center
Anyway, here you go.

00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.847 position:50% align:center
Thanks for lending me this.
It was a good one.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.600 position:50% align:center
Really? I'm glad.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.643 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Yeah. It kept me
guessing the whole time.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:22.062 position:50% align:center
Especially the seme,

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.148 position:50% align:center
he was so different from
what I expected. And then--

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.692 position:50% align:center
Anyone home?

00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:37.160 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Let's test that theory.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.371 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What's wrong?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
It's just...

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.001 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I can't speak.

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
I'll put this away.

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:50.965 position:50% align:center
Uh, right.

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:59.015 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] I was thinking,
we should leave together today

00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
so we can stop by the bookstore.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.186 position:50% align:center
Huh? Why would we do that?

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.354 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Doesn't that one series have

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.481 position:50% align:center
a new volume
coming out tomorrow?

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.401 position:50% align:center
If we're lucky, they might have
it on the shelf a day early.

00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:11.903 position:50% align:center
Ah. You've got me figured out.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:14.864 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] If you have something
you need to do, I understand.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.493 position:50% align:center
No, I don't have
anything. I can go.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.079 position:50% align:center
All right then. Let's do it.

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.374 position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
In the meantime,

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
did you bring me
the rest of that manga?

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.503 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO gasps]

00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:30.130 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
There's more than one, right?

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
I'm pretty sure you said
something about

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.259 position:50% align:center
how I need to read
the first few of them.

00:10:35.343 --> 00:10:37.178 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Well...

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:38.263 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Hm?

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.390 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Here, check it out.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.766 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Thank you.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
I'll let you know when
I'm finished. See ya.

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.949 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I really should stop.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:10:59.993 position:50% align:center
Just start with
the first few and

00:11:00.076 --> 00:11:02.328 position:50% align:center
find out if you
like it or not, okay?

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.375 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Miyano, I'm back.

00:11:07.459 --> 00:11:09.878 position:50% align:center
Aw, rise and shine,
little roly-poly.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If you call me
a roly-poly again,

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:13.923 position:50% align:center
I'll tell your girlfriend
all of the BL characters

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:15.091 position:50% align:center
I ship you with.

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.177 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Please don't, she'd love that.

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:24.768 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I'm hot.

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.613 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
A month can fly by so fast.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.490 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
How's your morning, Miyano?

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:42.494 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Not bad. Wait a sec.
What's all that stuff?

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:45.914 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] White Day gifts to
give my girlfriend after school.

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Oh, for a second
I thought you brought

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.668 position:50% align:center
presents for the whole class.

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.419 position:50% align:center
The class already did
a chocolate exchange

00:11:51.503 --> 00:11:52.879 position:50% align:center
for Valentine's Day.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.631 position:50% align:center
Only the people who
forgot the first time

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:56.091 position:50% align:center
would bring something today.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
Right, 'cause that
would be weird.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.513 position:50% align:center
Oh? Did you bring stuff?

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
No way, of course I didn't!

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] At least, I didn't
bring gifts for my classmates.

00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.735 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I've almost
gotten through it all.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:19.781 position:50% align:center
I made the bulk of my progress
while I was studying for exams.

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:24.035 position:50% align:center
But Sasaki's chocolates
are really weighing on me.

00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:27.122 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] I should probably
give him something in return,

00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.581 position:50% align:center
shouldn't I?

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:31.292 position:50% align:center
I mean, it was
supposed to be an exchange

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.378 position:50% align:center
and the class isn't
planning to do return gifts,

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.130 position:50% align:center
so I'm on my own.

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Technically,
I have repaid him in manga.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.888 position:50% align:center
I guess I don't need to
worry about it. But--

00:12:47.017 --> 00:12:48.143 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
No, no, no!

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:51.396 position:50% align:center
I can't go looking to BL
for the answer!

00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:56.735 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
I'm heading out. See ya.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:58.611 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Okay. Later.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:00.780 position:50% align:center
I suppose I'll just head home.

00:13:07.579 --> 00:13:09.330 position:50% align:center
Oh, all right!

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:13.543 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hirano!

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.879 position:50% align:center
Huh? What is it?

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.089 position:50% align:center
I was just wondering,
is Sasaki around,

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.424 position:50% align:center
or did he go home?

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:22.844 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's right inside, actually.
Let me go get him.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.639 position:50% align:center
Thanks, I appreciate it.

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.016 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Sasaki!

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:29.392 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What?

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:32.437 position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.521 position:50% align:center
It's you!

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.774 position:50% align:center
What's going on,
do you need something?

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:38.360 position:50% align:center
Uh, kind of.

00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.613 position:50% align:center
[STUDENTS chattering]

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT 3C] Not so loud,
or the teachers will complain!

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:47.202 position:50% align:center
We're having a snack party
since we're all done with exams.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.787 position:50% align:center
Pardon the noise.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.705 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
A snack party.

00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:54.042 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] So, what brings you
over here to my classroom?

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:57.504 position:50% align:center
I haven't finished the latest
manga you let me borrow yet.

00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:59.422 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh no. Take your time.

00:13:59.506 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
This is about
something else. Um, here.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:14.688 position:50% align:center
I figured I should give you
a present for White Day.

00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:19.526 position:50% align:center
Uh--

00:14:19.609 --> 00:14:20.610 position:50% align:center
Well, to be honest,

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:21.861 position:50% align:center
it's more of a general
thank-you gift,

00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:23.488 position:50% align:center
like for being so kind
to me and everything.

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:25.156 position:50% align:center
I mean, you were the
only person outside my class

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.741 position:50% align:center
who gave me chocolates,

00:14:26.825 --> 00:14:28.284 position:50% align:center
so I thought it made sense to
return the favor on White Day,

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.494 position:50% align:center
since that's usually
when people try to

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.955 position:50% align:center
repay each other
for Valentine's Day!

00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.332 position:50% align:center
Anyway, I hope you like it.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.171 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
You good?

00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:49.097 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Thank you.
Who else did you, um...?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.015 position:50% align:center
Give gifts?

00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
Nobody else. It was just you.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.435 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh, okay.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.979 position:50% align:center
Um... Uh... H-Hold on
a second, would you?

00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:57.772 position:50% align:center
Uh, I'll give you
something, too!

00:14:57.856 --> 00:14:59.357 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Uh, I don't need--

00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Nope! Just wait there,
don't leave, I'll be right back!

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:03.945 position:50% align:center
I win.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.363 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Damn, Hirano!

00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.865 position:50% align:center
[door opens]

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:10.785 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI groaning]

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:13.288 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Hey. What's with you?

00:15:21.004 --> 00:15:21.838 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
What should I do?

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.007 position:50% align:center
M-My heart won't stop beating!

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.676 position:50% align:center
Well, you'd be dead
otherwise, so--

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.553 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
But it's racing.

00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:31.473 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Are you that out of shape?

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
No.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:38.063 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Grab a snack, any snack!

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:41.191 position:50% align:center
We picked up pretty much
everything for the party.

00:15:41.274 --> 00:15:43.651 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thanks. I'll take this.

00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.864 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 3A] That concludes
the closing ceremony.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:50.325 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] We should all go to
a theme park during the break!

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:51.993 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
I'm gonna go with my girlfriend.

00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
[TASHIRO] Come on, there's more
to life besides your girlfriend!

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:57.499 position:50% align:center
You can go with her
a different day!

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.460 position:50% align:center
Hey, Mya!

00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.379 position:50% align:center
You see someone?

00:16:02.462 --> 00:16:03.755 position:50% align:center
Um, yeah.

00:16:03.838 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
It's Sasaki, right?

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
'Kay.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.429 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Enough dawdling.

00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:15.100 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA] Oh yeah, he should
be graduating next year.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
I forgot. Sasaki's older.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
So, he's gonna
graduate before I do.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.070 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
We only have one more year.

00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
Miyano.

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.580 position:50% align:center
Your hair! It's-- It's black!

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.249 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna have
a fudanshi moment,

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.750 position:50% align:center
leave me out of it.

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.669 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
It's good to see you, Hirano.

00:16:42.752 --> 00:16:44.087 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.923 position:50% align:center
Why did you make such a
dramatic change all of a sudden?

00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:49.426 position:50% align:center
Wait, that was him
I saw earlier?

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.844 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
What was?

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.513 position:50% align:center
You have to dye it back
for the closing ceremony.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:55.765 position:50% align:center
Y'know, photos and all.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:58.351 position:50% align:center
Sasaki's receiving
his lecture as we speak.

00:16:58.435 --> 00:16:59.978 position:50% align:center
Anyway, the next time
we see each other,

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.272 position:50% align:center
I'll be back to blond. Huh?

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:04.315 position:50% align:center
The black hair's
nice on you, too!

00:17:04.399 --> 00:17:07.819 position:50% align:center
It makes you look fresh
and innocent, like an uke!

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.821 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Stop taking pictures or else.

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.406 position:50% align:center
I'll bet that color
takes a lot of work,

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.074 position:50% align:center
do you bleach it yourself?

00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:14.826 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I've done it
several times,

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:16.828 position:50% align:center
so my hair is pretty damaged.

00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.788 position:50% align:center
Wanna feel it?

00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:21.249 position:50% align:center
Wow, the texture is
surprisingly fine.

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO]
Is it?

00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:26.129 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Did you let your
roommate touch it, too?

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:27.505 position:50% align:center
Yeah, he was the one
who let me know

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.591 position:50% align:center
how damaged it was
to begin with.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Thank you for that.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.469 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:17:32.552 --> 00:17:35.221 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Sorry for the wait,
Hirano. You ready?

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
Oh. Hey, what are
you guys up to?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.768 position:50% align:center
You know,
just discussing hair damage.

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.644 position:50% align:center
Yours isn't that
bad though, is it?

00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:42.937 position:50% align:center
By the way, Sasaki,

00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
have you ever gone without
coloring your hair?

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:47.650 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I kept it black
when I was a first year.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
I wonder what you
looked like back then.

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.614 position:50% align:center
Do you want me to dye it?

00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:54.115 position:50% align:center
If you're that
nonchalant about it,

00:17:54.199 --> 00:17:56.826 position:50% align:center
then why didn't you bother
coloring it for the ceremony?

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.828 position:50% align:center
Hey, what's everybody
talking about?

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] Ogasawara.
You finally showed up.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:05.377 position:50% align:center
Got lectured, but I only
have highlights in my hair!

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.213 position:50% align:center
That's Ogasawara,
he's my classmate.

00:18:08.296 --> 00:18:12.384 position:50% align:center
Hey, this is Mya and Kure--
er, I mean Miyano and Kuresawa.

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:15.428 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
Miyano? You're that fudanshi!

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:17.472 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Sasaki!
How does he know about me?

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.517 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] He saw me putting
the manga into my bag.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.976 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Oh, great!

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
Tch. I always thought it was
only chicks who liked BL,

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:27.607 position:50% align:center
but now I'm surrounded
by guys who like it, too?

00:18:28.483 --> 00:18:31.653 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] Was he the one I heard
talking to Sasaki before?

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.615 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA] Is it weird to read
about two guys in love?

00:18:37.575 --> 00:18:39.119 position:50% align:center
Is something wrong?

00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Now, now,
no need to get heated, buddy.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
I'm not heated, okay?

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.542 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI] Sorry your girl's got
a thing for bad-boy ukes.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:46.376 position:50% align:center
Watch it!

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
Ah, Miyano's back.

00:18:48.086 --> 00:18:50.380 position:50% align:center
Look, I flipped through
the manga that she was hiding

00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:53.466 position:50% align:center
and it had this big muscular
dude dominating a delinquent.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
Sounds very adult.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.803 position:50% align:center
But like, that's what
a fujoshi is, right?

00:18:56.886 --> 00:19:00.015 position:50% align:center
They like to read stories about
guys who like other guys.

00:19:01.766 --> 00:19:03.059 position:50% align:center
[OGASAWARA]
I really care about this girl,

00:19:03.143 --> 00:19:05.103 position:50% align:center
but I can't help asking myself.

00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:07.856 position:50% align:center
Has she wanted me to get
with a dude this whole time?

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:11.026 position:50% align:center
I don't know, man, I just
don't think I have it in me!

00:19:11.109 --> 00:19:12.861 position:50% align:center
Obviously, he needs
his friends right now,

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:14.487 position:50% align:center
so we're gonna
have a get-together.

00:19:14.571 --> 00:19:15.655 position:50% align:center
Do you want to join us?

00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:16.865 position:50% align:center
Normally I would,

00:19:16.948 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
but my girlfriend and I
have stuff planned.

00:19:18.783 --> 00:19:20.869 position:50% align:center
Read the room, Kuresawa.

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:23.580 position:50% align:center
What were you thinking of
doing later today, Mya?

00:19:23.663 --> 00:19:24.789 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Bookstore run.

00:19:24.873 --> 00:19:27.417 position:50% align:center
Sounds nice.
Maybe I should tag along.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.377 position:50% align:center
Hey, everyone's bailing on me!

00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
Yeah, sorry to jet, buddy boy,
but the way I see it,

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.715 position:50% align:center
you'll barely even notice
if I'm not there,

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:36.801 position:50% align:center
and Mya and I have a lot of
manga to talk about, so, yeah.

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:39.095 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
a fudanshi now, too.

00:19:39.179 --> 00:19:40.263 position:50% align:center
Nah, not really.

00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:41.389 position:50% align:center
Be careful then.

00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:43.016 position:50% align:center
He could be using you
for BL material,

00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.060 position:50% align:center
like my girlfriend probably is!

00:19:45.143 --> 00:19:46.519 position:50% align:center
Wait, do you do that?

00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.438 position:50% align:center
Uh. Now that you mention it,
it's never occurred to me

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:50.315 position:50% align:center
to paint you as a BL stereotype.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:53.735 position:50% align:center
[HIRANO] That's news to me!
Why does he get to be spared?

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.029 position:50% align:center
[KURESAWA]
Later.

00:19:56.112 --> 00:19:57.447 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
See ya.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.449 position:50% align:center
I hope they've got
some new stuff.

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:00.742 position:50% align:center
Me, too.

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:06.748 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] It's surprising.
For whatever reason,

00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:10.794 position:50% align:center
I can't seem to get a clear
seme or uke vibe from Sasaki.

00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:14.381 position:50% align:center
I wonder why that is.

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:18.885 position:50% align:center
[CLERK 3A]
Thanks, have a good day.

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:22.597 position:50% align:center
Okay, I'm all done. Huh?

00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:24.474 position:50% align:center
[PATRON 3A] Ooh, there's a
new volume! Want to buy it?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:25.725 position:50% align:center
Is there something wrong?

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:27.686 position:50% align:center
[PATRON 3B]
Sweet! I'll grab a copy.

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.437 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI]
Oh. Not at all.

00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:31.481 position:50% align:center
I was just thinking about
how nice this is.

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.024 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Hm?

00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:35.735 position:50% align:center
Anyway, let's go. Find anything?

00:20:35.819 --> 00:20:37.278 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Yeah, I did!

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:39.989 position:50% align:center
The latest book, and something
else from an author I like.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.044 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER 3B]
The doors will open to the left.

00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:59.300 position:50% align:center
[SASAKI gasps]
Hey, Mya? I'm next.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.816 position:50% align:center
[inaudible]

00:21:18.111 --> 00:21:19.863 position:50% align:center
Oh. You're up.

00:21:20.864 --> 00:21:22.824 position:50% align:center
Okay, this is where I get off.

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.325 position:50% align:center
Careful not to miss your stop.

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:26.161 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
Right. I won't.

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.538 position:50% align:center
I guess we'll see
each other next term.

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:49.976 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO] If Sasaki only sees me
as his underclassman,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
then why did he
say that, so quietly,

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:58.860 position:50% align:center
thinking I was asleep
on the train?

00:22:03.323 --> 00:22:04.866 position:50% align:center
I like you.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.582 position:50% align:center
[MIYANO]
What should I do?
