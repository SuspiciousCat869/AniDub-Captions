1
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,166
[TENCHI]
I'm home.

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,916
[SASAMI] There you are,
big bro Tenchi!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Welcome back to...

4
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,875
What happened
to you out there?

5
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,333
You're a mess!

6
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,333
[TENCHI chuckling]

7
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:31,916
[sighs]
Thought I was gonna die!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,541
From teaching a class?

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,500
There was some
weird stuff after class.

10
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,250
[SASAMI] Sounds like being
a student teacher is dangerous.

11
00:00:38,333 --> 00:00:40,708
[TENCHI] You have no idea,
but it's just two more weeks.

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,083
I'll be here to cheer you on!

13
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,250
[AYEKA] Sasami, Master
Tenchi just got in

14
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:47,041
and he's probably tired, so
don't bug him with a lot of--

15
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:48,208
Oh, my goodness!

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,083
Did someone steal your pants?!

17
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,791
[AYEKA]
Are you sure you're all right?

18
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,375
Ask me tomorrow.

19
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,625
Apart from that, I'm sorry
I had to leave you two

20
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,166
with all the unpacking.

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,625
But you both did a great job.

22
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,166
--[AYEKA] Thanks.
--[SASAMI] Yeah!

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,458
We're here to support you.

24
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,958
We wanna help you
accomplish your mission

25
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,666
in any way that we can.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,208
[TENCHI] I hope today was
the exception, not the rule.

27
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,000
[SASAMI] Tenchi, if they're
gonna attack you every time

28
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,916
show up at school, maybe we
should be there to help.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,291
[TENCHI] I appreciate
the offer, I really do.

30
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,500
But I don't think they
allow student teachers

31
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,291
to bring in their
own bodyguards.

32
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,541
[AYEKA]
If you're that determined,

33
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,625
I guess all we can do
is keep offering support

34
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,083
from the sidelines.

35
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,083
Is she right?

36
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,625
Things have to get better.

37
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, after today, I can't
imagine them getting any worse.

38
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,291
I almost forgot to tell you,

39
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,666
a package arrived
today from Washu!

40
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,708
Her note said it's stuff you'll
need for your student teaching!

41
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,750
So what did she send?

42
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's see!

43
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,500
[ALL]
Huh?

44
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,500
[TENCHI]
A helmet?

45
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,166
Why would a student teacher
need a helmet?

46
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,250
Huh...

47
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,125
Body armor? She must think
I'm teaching delinquents!

48
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,083
[chuckles]

49
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,833
[SASAMI]
Look at this, Tenchi!

50
00:01:58,916 --> 00:01:59,875
[TENCHI]
A shield?

51
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,333
There's no way I'll need that--

52
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,041
she must have thrown
it in by mistake!

53
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,666
[AYEKA]
Look at these charms!

54
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,583
[TENCHI] Does she think
I'm in the middle of a war?

55
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,000
A student teacher has
no need for all this stuff!

56
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,583
I think she's lost it!

57
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,916
Her school must
have been really tough!

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,250
[TENCHI]
"Here lies Tenchi Masaki."

59
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,125
Somebody jumped the gun
on your obituary!

60
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,125
Maybe a hot bath will
bring you back to life!

61
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:26,208
That sounds pretty good to me!

62
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,166
At least I'll be a clean corpse!

63
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,250
[TENCHI] This situation
may be more complicated

64
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,541
than I thought.

65
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,250
No, no, no,
I can't think that way!

66
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,541
It must be nerves because the
first day was such a disaster.

67
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,458
A bath should perk me back up.

68
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,291
I had no idea this job

69
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,541
was going to be such
a challenge to pull off.

70
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,833
Now where's that shower head?

71
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,583
[RYOKO]
Here.

72
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,625
[TENCHI]
Oh, thanks.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,291
--[TENCHI] Huh?
--[RYOKO chuckles]

74
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you doing
in here, Ryoko?!

75
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,125
[RYOKO]
Don't be so shy.

76
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,750
I was lonely while
you were gone today.

77
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,333
Let me do something nice.
I'll wash your back for you!

78
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,541
Forget it!

79
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,916
[RYOKO]
Quit playing coy!

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,375
Wait a minute,
you're all beat up!

81
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,458
Who did this to you?

82
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,291
No way am I gonna
let this slide!

83
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,583
Someone's gonna pay for
those cuts and scratches!

84
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,916
If you get mixed up in this
on top of everything else,

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,208
it'll just get worse!

86
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,208
And don't you come
snooping around the school!

87
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,916
Aww! You're no fun!

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,041
[AYEKA] Master Tenchi,
what's all the commo--[gasps]

89
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,916
I should've known!
Get out, Ryoko!

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,583
Oh, shut it, you fussbudget!

91
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:24,000
It's not a big deal!

92
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,250
Not true! As a matter
of fact, it's a very big deal!

93
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:27,583
What is happening?

94
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:30,458
Ryoko, were you hiding
in here, spying on Tenchi?

95
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,208
I think someone's
really jealous.

96
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,958
I see you haven't
changed a bit!

97
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,916
Now please, ladies,
let's be nice.

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
[overlapping chatter]

99
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,125
[TENCHI]
Get out of here, everybody!

100
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,208
Give me some peace and quiet!
