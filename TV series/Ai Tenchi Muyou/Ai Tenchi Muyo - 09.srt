00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,708
[TENCHI]
Is someone else in here?

4
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,083
I thought I heard a scream.

5
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,291
Huh! Some fools
must have slipped in.

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,666
Now they're probably lost.

7
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,291
Really? Is that possible?

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,458
It wouldn't actually
surprise me.

9
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,875
This warehouse is huge.

10
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,083
Equipment from every
Culture and Sports festival

11
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,333
in the school's history
is stored here.

12
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,625
The place is filled with
booby traps, locked doors,

13
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,208
and dead-ends.

14
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,666
You can't get through it without
this Student Council guide book.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,125
Any mis-step you make
in here is guaranteed

16
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,833
to become a one-way
ticket to the afterlife.

17
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:00,625
[HACHIKO]
Hurry!

18
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,208
[TENCHI yelling]

19
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,375
Are we gonna turn into
blue-haired old ladies,

20
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,083
stuck in this crazy
warehouse forever?

21
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,708
Speak for yourself. My Navigator
App will show us the way

22
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,250
when my phone is charged.

23
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,791
Feel free to help me
do that, by the way!

24
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,166
[KINOJO] Electrical work
isn't really my cup of tea.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,041
What are you reading, Kinojo?

26
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,333
[KINOJO]
This.

27
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,041
Where did you find such a thing?

28
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,750
That manga is older than we are!

29
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:26,875
[HACHIKO]
We're here.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,250
From sleep eternal,
rouse thyself.

31
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,791
The hour of festival
has arrived.

32
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:38,291
Unseal the lock of
ancient wisdom's wealth.

33
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,000
O Guardian, open thy eyes!

34
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,750
[TENCHI] Did you need that
incantation just to show me

35
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,208
the key?

36
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,500
It makes the whole experience

37
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,416
a little more mystical,
you know?

38
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,208
It was Mistress Momo's idea.

39
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,208
[TENCHI]
Why doesn't that surprise me...

40
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,291
[AOI grunting]

41
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,958
How bad do you need
Book 9, 'cause it's stuck!

42
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,000
[screams]
A spider!

43
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,416
Now that it's quiet again,
I can keep reading.

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,416
I thought it was
gonna eat me alive!

45
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,958
I hope that one missing
book doesn't mess us up.

46
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:14,583
[KINOJO] I just wish we
knew exactly what it is

47
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:15,625
we're looking for.

48
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,583
[crash]

49
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,666
[KINOJO, FUKA, AOI]
Huh?

50
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,875
[FUKA, AOI screaming]

51
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,458
Quick, run!

00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,625
[KINOJO grunts]

53
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,625
[KINOJO yells]

54
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,666
That stuff's very important.
Don't drop it.

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,541
Got it.

56
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,125
[FUKA, AOI screaming]

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,166
--[TENCHI] Huh?
--[HACHIKO] Hm?

58
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,583
Mr. Masaki!

59
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,041
Run for it!

60
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,416
Ya see what happens
without a guide book?

61
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,833
Hey, Hachiko!

62
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,583
We've got a big problem!

63
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,833
No kidding.

64
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,583
[TENCHI]
Come on!

65
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,208
Why is this thing even in here?!

66
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,958
It's an iron ball that used
to be part of Sports Day!

67
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,583
[TENCHI]
Really? For what event?

68
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,375
Never mind, it's not important!

69
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,708
[HACHIKO]
Oh...!

70
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,166
[HACHIKO]
Hey! What are you--?

71
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,708
[TENCHI]
Ow, ow, ow!

72
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,833
Are you hurt?

73
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,791
[HACHIKO]
No. I'm all right.

74
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,125
[KINOJO grunting]

75
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,250

[KINOJO grunts]

78
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,166
I think she'll be okay.

79
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,333
Damn it!

80
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,458
What?

81
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,833
When we ran, I dropped
the guide book!

82
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,500
[TENCHI]
No!
