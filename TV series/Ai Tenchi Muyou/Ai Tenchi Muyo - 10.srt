00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,791
[KINOJO]
Momo. Why are you crying?

[YOUNG MOMO crying]

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh, it's because
I broke the tree, isn't it?

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,416
I'm sorry I scared you.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Go away! All you do
is upset her!

6
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,750
[KINOJO]
Be quiet!

7
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,958
I told you!
Just leave her alone!

8
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:29,958
[KINOJO]
Shut up!

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,875
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

10
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,416
Shut up!

11
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,208
[TENCHI gasps]

[TENCHI yells]

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,958
What did you people do to me?

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,333
[HACHIKO]
Hmph.

15
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,875
Oh, really. As if you
were worth doing things to.

16
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,416
[KINOJO]
What did you say?

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,041
You ought to be
thanking Mr. Masaki.

18
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,583
He risked getting doubly
lost to go off and retrieve

19
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,958
your metal bat while
you were passed out.

20
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,458
That was unnecessary.

21
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,833
You ungrateful little--

22
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,416
Hey, it's okay, Hachiko.
No big deal.

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,833
Now how do we get out of here?

24
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,666
Well, I've basically
absorbed the contents

25
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,791
of the guide book.

26
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:10,250
So as long as
I have my bearings,

27
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,375
I should be able to
get us close to the exit.

28
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,375
[TENCHI grunts]

29
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,916
If you're confident,
let's do it!

30
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,291
You ready?

31
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,041
[KINOJO groans]

32
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,708
If you're going
to be a burden to us,

33
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,958
we'll leave you here.

34
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,375
[TENCHI] Do we know if the other
two girls from the Science Club

35
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,708
are all right?

36
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:35,666
Haven't seen them,
and if they rot here,

37
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,958
at least they won't
cause any more trouble.

38
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,000
[KINOJO]
Hmph.

39
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,958
[HACHIKO]
Oh.

40
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,916
Did you want to use this
opportunity to settle

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,041
our personal score?

42
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,916
Sure, why not?

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
[TENCHI]
Both of you, cut it out!

44
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,458
We have no idea what's
waiting for us up ahead.

45
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:53,291
If we want to get
out of here safely,

46
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,083
we all have to work together!

47
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,708
Have I made myself clear?

48
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:00,166
I'll let you off the hook
as a gesture of respect

49
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,541
to Mr. Masaki.

50
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,208
[HACHIKO] The exit ought to be
on the other side of this mess.

51
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:13,625
--[KINOJO] Stand back.
--[HACHIKO] Hm?

52
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,375
[KINOJO]
Fuka told me this once.

53
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,750
If you're stuck in a maze
and you're trying to get out,

54
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,750
you have two choices.

55
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,750
Play by the rules or punch your
way right through the walls!

56
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,916
Hold on!

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,583
There's important
material in those boxes!

58
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,166
[KINOJO] You may think
it's important now,

59
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,875
but in a minute,
it's gonna be trash!

60
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,000
[TENCHI, HACHIKO grunt]

61
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:37,875
[KINOJO]
Hmph!

62
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,291
[KINOJO]
Huh?

63
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,333
[gasps]

64
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,208
Where the heck did she go?

65
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,791
I think that was Goriki!

66
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,291
He has a name?

67
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,625
[HACHIKO] He's a robot who
helps out with school events.

68
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,625
I heard he got sealed away
when he became uncontrollable.

69
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,125
[TENCHI]
Uncontrollable?

70
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,583
[HACHIKO] I have a feeling
that because of Kinojo's attack,

71
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,875
he now perceives
us all as enemies!

72
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,916
I'll stay here and
take care of him.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,875
While I do that, you two
get moving and find the exit!

74
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,000
Without you?

75
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,208
Go while you can!

76
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,541
[HACHIKO gasps]

My sword!

80
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,958
[HACHIKO]
I've been defeated!

81
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,125
[crying]

82
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,875
[TENCHI] Hachiko?
What's happened to you?

83
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,583
Pull yourself together!
We have to get outta here!
