1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,916
[MOMO] Don't you think
we're overreacting?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,750
Not under the circumstances!

3
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,416
This is a dire emergency!

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,625
Mr. Tenchi's been kidnapped
by the Science Club.

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,166
Who knows what danger he's in?

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,875
Kinojo's long, thick, black club

7
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,958
could be dangerously
close to him right now.

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,416
Only two people in the world
would be worried about that--

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,000
you and Ms. Kurihara.

10
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,208
It appears that the three
accompanying Mr. Tenchi

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,833
have been taken captive as well.

12
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,333
[FUEYAMA]
What?!

13
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:39,250
We have to form a rescue party!
Little Sasami's in danger!

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,291
[MOMO whimpering]

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,458
[MIHOSHI] It's actually
an interesting story.

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:48,000
I've been sent here on a
kind of infiltration mission.

17
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,250
Really?

18
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,166
I'm trying to prove that
there are criminals here

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,833
who have been illegally
manipulating space and time.

20
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,291
[GROUP]
Huh?

21
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,333
Are you saying you have
the proof that such a thing

22
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,458
really exists?

23
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,166
Oh, please don't be silly!

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,250
You'd never find something
like that on a planet

25
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,666
as backward as this!

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,291
Then why are you
wasting your time?

27
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,125
Well, since I'm
down here anyway,

28
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,583
I thought that
searching for treasure

29
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,666
sounded like it
could be a lot of fun.

30
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,000
I happened to come
across Fuka and the others

31
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,458
and I decided I'd help them out

32
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,625
with their exploration
down here.

33
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:17,666
But...

34
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,416
This has to stay
just between us,

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,666
okay, you guys?

36
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,958
If anyone finds out,

37
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,833
then my infiltration
will be blown,

38
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,750
and we don't want
that to happen, do we?

39
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,458
So, this treasure
you're pursuing...

40
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,625
Does it really exist?

41
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:29,833
[FUKA]
Yes, it does.

42
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,500
And if you're interested,
we'll show you the proof

43
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,666
we've found.

44
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,583
I'm all set.

45
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,875
I am, as well.

46
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,250
[FUEYAMA]
Madam President.

47
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,916
Allow me to explain our plan.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,833
[FUKA]
Here's the proof.

49
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,291
[TENCHI gasps]

50
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,708
[TENCHI] I dropped that
after I tracked down Momo!

51
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,666
We found it one day
when we were excavating.

52
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,625
It was in a layer of earth
that happens to be

53
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,791
a little over 1,300 years old!

54
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,500
And that makes it...

55
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,708
...an out of place artifact!

56
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,750
[FUKA] I said out of place
artifact, not implant!

57
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:04,416
So what exactly is
an out of place artifact?

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,416
It's an item found
within a time period

59
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,541
when it should've been
technologically impossible

60
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:09,625
to have been built!

61
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,041
You certainly wouldn't
expect to find

62
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,625
a 1,300-year-old
smartphone, would you?

63
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,208
That, my friends,

64
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,291
is incontrovertible proof that
there's something down there.

65
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:18,458
Oh, and by the way,

66
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,041
it was found by someone
that you know. Me!

67
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,583
[FUKA] Even after a
millennium underground,

68
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,041
its data is intact.

69
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,416
[AOI] Today, we discovered
the password that unlocks it.

70
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,083
[FUKA] The password is
"carrots are delicious."

71
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,625
Silly, huh?

72
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,208
[TENCHI] Oh, no, the
wallpaper on that phone

73
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,458
is a dead giveaway!

74
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,500
Finally!

75
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,541
[TENCHI gasps]

76
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,583
[FUKA]
Activate!

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,041
[AYEKA]
Oh, my!

78
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,875
[MIHOSHI]
How cute! Isn't that sweet?

79
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,833
Mr. Masaki, it appears
for over 1,300 years...

80
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,083
...you've been a cradle-robber!

81
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,125
Pervert.

82
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,166
Tenchi, how did
this picture get--?

83
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,500
You backstabber!
How could you?

84
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,833
It's not what you think!

85
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,500
That's just a picture
from the time we all went

86
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,958
to the beach together.

87
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,583
That was so much fun!

88
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,416
Where's all the rest
of your friends, then?

89
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,416
Come on, guys,
can't you see that Washu's

90
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,958
been messing with
my phone's settings?

91
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,416
--[crash]
--[ALL gasp]

92
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,541
[RYOKO]
What was that?

93
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,791
[AOI]
It's the Student Council!

94
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,875
So they've finally
resorted to force.

95
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,875
[GORIKI roars]

96
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,833
He's sure gotten a lot
stronger since Sports Day!

97
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,208
Tori!

98
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,708
His security systems
have been reinforced.

99
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,083
I can't hack in!

100
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,000
[HACHIKO]
Then that means

101
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,083
we'll just have to
"hack" in ourselves!

102
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,791
[SARYU]
Give us back Mr. Tenchi

103
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,416
[SARYU, FUEYAMA]
and Sasami, right now!

104
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,666
