[WASHU]
Come, on you guys!

2
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:21,166
When are you gonna
find the treasure already?

3
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,541
Sorry, we're doing
the best we can.

4
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,333
But we don't have
enough money or workers

5
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,666
to do it very quickly.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,958
[FUKA]
Even the students who joined

7
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,791
thinking it sounded
interesting got bored

8
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,166
and quit really quickly.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:32,583
[AOI]
We didn't have any money,

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,083
and they didn't like
getting paid in snacks.

11
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,666
[MIHOSHI]
Here, treasure treasure!

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,125
Where could you be hiding?

13
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,541
[WASHU]
That's not good enough!

14
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,041
I expect better from you!

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,291
[GROUP gasps]

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,041
[WASHU] I even gave you
a top-of-the-line robot

17
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,625
to help you with this project.

18
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,958
It's like giving
chopsticks to a pig!

19
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,583
If you don't get results soon,

20
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,333
I'm gonna have
him self-destruct!

21
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,625
Don't say that!

22
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,333
Goriki's our friend!
That's mean, even for you!

23
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,250
Oh, don't worry, Goriki,

24
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:03,125
we won't let anything
happen to you, I promise!

25
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,416
[WASHU] Then you'd better
find me what I need, and fast!

26
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,166
We're running out of time!

27
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,416
--[AOI] All right.
--[FUKA] Yes, ma'am.

28
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:11,916
She's right, we're outta time.

29
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:20,833
So why do you have
to keep on working

30
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,291
when you get home, Tenchi?

31
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,458
I have to complete this job,

32
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,166
and there's no other
time to get it done.

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,583
Can't you finish it
when you get back

34
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,291
to the school?

35
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,583
I wish I could.

36
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,208
Is everything all right?

37
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,916
All good, thank you.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,583
[KURIHARA] If there's
anything you don't understand,

39
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,458
I can teach you
one on one, privately.

40
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,375
I won't leave anything out,
even if it takes all night.

41
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:43,500
[TENCHI]
Thanks, if I need your help,

42
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,333
I'll certainly let you know.

43
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,916
[KURIHARA chuckles]

44
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:51,416
[laughs] Look, that's funny,
you're misspelling everything.

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,750
[TENCHI]
Huh?!

46
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,625
There's one here and here,
and a couple more here.

47
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,166
If you turn it in
looking like this,

48
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,666
you're gonna be in big trouble.

49
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,125
[TENCHI groans]

50
00:01:59,208 --> 00:01:59,833
[SASAMI]
Aww.

00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,166
[pounding on door]

[TENCHI]
Kinojo?

53
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,875
We need your help
searching for the treasure.

54
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,583
[SASAMI]
Here you go.

55
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,250
Give me one good
reason why Tenchi

56
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,791
should drop everything
to help you out

57
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,250
with your little treasure hunt.

58
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:17,916
Yeah, Ryoko's right.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,208
Your shenanigans always
end up being trouble,

60
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,791
and a lot of unnecessary
work for Tenchi.

61
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,916
I know that Mr. Tenchi
and the rest of you

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,125
are more than
just ordinary people.

63
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,041
We need your special
powers to help us.

64
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,166
[GROUP]
Uh... huh?

65
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,416
I'm begging you.

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,500
[door opens, closes]

67
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:44,291
I'm coming, Mr. Tenchi!

68
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,125
Huh? What're you here for?

69
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,250
The same thing as you.

70
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,583
[KURIHARA growls]
Be quiet, you brats!

71
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,875
Mr. Masaki's in the field
with the Science Club today.

72
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:53,791
What?!

73
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,541
For what purpose?

74
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:56,791
I don't know!

75
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,666
He took off with
those little bitches

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,166
when today was the day I was
gonna start training him!

77
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,166
[SASAMI]
Wow!

78
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,166
[RYOKO]
Would you look at this place?

79
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,666
[AYEKA] It's way bigger
than I expected.

[MIHOSHI grunts]

81
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,500
Ask her if you want
some more details.

82
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,416
She's knows a lot more
about it than I do.

83
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,666
[MIHOSHI grunting]

84
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,625
Uh, excuse me?

[MIHOSHI]
Yes? [chuckles]

[AYEKA]

[RYOKO] The Galaxy Police
sent her to this planet?

Well, hello, everybody!

What a nice surprise!
