1
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,750
[MOMO, KINOJO gasp]

2
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:17,041
Intruder alert's been activated!

3
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:18,208
What's happening?

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:19,833
[WASHU]
What are you waiting for?

5
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,125
Now's your chance!

6
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,250
Get moving!
Hurry up and find it!

7
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,833
Wait, I know that voice.

8
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,375
Yeah, there's
no doubt who it is.

9
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,083
You're absolutely right.
It's Washu.

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:31,000
What the hell
is going on here?

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,708
[WASHU]
I already told you!

12
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,958
You have the key to
the treasure's location!

13
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,291
Do not keep me waiting!

14
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,125
Oh, we've been
given a mission!

15
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,958
[TENCHI]
Miss Momo, may I?

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,041
Of course.

17
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,041
[TENCHI]
It's very close.

18
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,291
In fact, it's buried
right below us!

19
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:49,416
So all we have to do
is a little digging, then?

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,291
--[FUEYAMA] Sasami!
--[SASAMI yells]

21
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,708
I was so worried
about my little Sasami.

22
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,125
Are you okay?

23
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,541
That weirdo Tenchi didn't
do anything awful to you,

24
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,583
did he?
You poor little thing!

25
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,208
[HACHIKO yelling]

26
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,708
Playtime is over!

27
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,416
[RYOKO]
Ha!

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,916
Crap!

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,583
Victory is mine!

30
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,083
I forgot I lost my sword!

31
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,083
This is not turning out
to be the great day

32
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,416
I thought it would be!

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,875
I can't be a hero
without my weapon!

34
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,125
[KINOJO] The treasure's
just below us, right?

35
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,333
[MIHOSHI]
Dig, dig, it's right below.

36
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:32,125
We'll find it soon, that I know!

37
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:34,125
So, what did you find there?

38
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,500
Wait, that's a...

39
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,791
...Sword of Jurai!

40
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,125
[MIHOSHI]
Oh, my!

41
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,000
[WASHU]
We finally found it!

42
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,541
The final key!

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,375
Hold up! Be careful!

44
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:50,458
[MOMO, KINOJO]
Huh?

45
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:55,250
[ALL gasp]

46
00:01:58,958 --> 00:01:59,958
[AOI]
It's so pretty!

47
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,333
[ALL yell]

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,416
The Jurai ship
has started to activate.

49
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,500
It's been buried
here this whole time!

50
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,208
[SASAMI]
What? Really?

51
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,750
[TENCHI] It was Momo,
Kinojo, and the sword.

52
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,541
Apparently, they were the keys
that Washu was looking for!

53
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:22,333
[ALL scream]

54
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,125
[KINOJO yells]

55
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,250
[yells]

56
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,375
[MOMO]
Kinojo!

57
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,041
Please try and find
it in your heart

58
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,666
to forgive me, Ayeka!

59
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,333
I guess, as long as
you've learned your lesson.

60
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,416
An earthquake?

61
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,541
[RYOKO]
Ayeka!

62
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,125
This is totally messed up!

63
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,583
[AYEKA] What do we do about
Tenchi and the others?

64
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,083
You get these two out of here!

65
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,666
I'll go find everyone and
get them all to safety.

66
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,833
Right. I'm on it.

67
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,458
[KINOJO]
Just... a little bit further.

68
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,041
[MOMO grunting]

69
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,208
[TENCHI]
Kinojo!

70
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,041
Hurry and grab my hand!

71
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,125
I'm not gonna leave
without that sword!

72
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,708
I've almost got it!

73
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,666
It's the only way I can
get my real self back.

74
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,208
[MOMO]
You don't need to!

75
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,416
Don't you see?

76
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,875
I like you just the way
you are right now!

77
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,958
I don't think I can hold on!

78
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,291
Hurry up, please!

79
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,000
Kinojo, come on!

80
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,208
Take your time, I'm good!

81
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,916
[KINOJO]
Almost have it...

82
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,125
[gasps] Oh, no!
