1
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,333
[RYOKO chuckles]
Guess who?

2
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,833
Would it be you, Ryoko?

3
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,500
[RYOKO] You walked right
past me without even

4
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,416
saying a word!

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,875
That's not very nice, Tenchi.

6
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,791
[TENCHI] You were sleeping.
I was trying to be quiet.

7
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,041
[RYOKO] I was just waiting
for you with my eyes closed.

8
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,375
What are you doing?
Let go of him, Ryoko,

9
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,875
you're being a big nuisance!

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,666
[RYOKO] You're the one
who's a big nuisance.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,958
[AYEKA]
Excuse me?

12
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,208
[MIHOSHI]
A-ha!

13
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,458
Wait a minute.
Did I find something or not?

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,541
Hmm...

15
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,291
What is it, Mihoshi?

16
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,083
What are you doing over there?

17
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,583
Treasure hunting!

18
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:03,000
Now that I know the secret
technique, I'm really into it.

19
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,791
[TENCHI] Aren't those
divining rods, though?

20
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah!

21
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,916
They seem to be reacting
to something nearby,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,875
but I can't quite find it.

23
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,458
I wonder if it's buried
somewhere under the building.

24
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,708
Or hidden.

25
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,833
It's probably just an
old bone some dog left.

26
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:19,708
Lunchtime!

27
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,750
Come and get it while it's hot!

28
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,166
Well, finally!

29
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,125
You were taking so long,
I thought that lunch might not

30
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,625
be ready until dinner.

31
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,416
Yay! What's on the menu?

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,958
I hope something yummy!

33
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,208
[RYOKO]
I don't care how it tastes.

34
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,666
[AYEKA] I guess we'll
just have to find out.

35
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,875
--[SASAMI] It's a secret!
--[MIHOSHI] I love secrets!

36
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:37,500
[RYOKO]
You love everything.

37
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,541
[MOMO] I'll see you again
someday, Mr. Tenchi.
