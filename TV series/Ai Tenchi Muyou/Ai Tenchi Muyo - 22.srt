1
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:15,875
Oh, boy, this is amazing!

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,500
There's plenty more,
Master Tenchi.

3
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:18,541
Enough for seconds.

4
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,375
So please dig in, help yourself.

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,833
Thanks, I will, Ayeka.

6
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,416
Wow, that just
made my toes wiggle!

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,375
Guess being a student
teacher doesn't give you

8
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,666
much time to eat.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,625
Yeah, but at least
I won't get fat!

10
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,875
So who's winning
the sports contest?

11
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,583
[TENCHI] Well, both teams
are running neck and neck

12
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,875
at the moment.

13
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,666
The White Team has
Hachiko as their top scorer

14
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,375
and Kinojo's coming on
strong for the Red Team.

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,750
Bat girl loves to
show off her strength!

16
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,750
[RYOKO, KINOJO grunting]

17
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,250
All right, time for me
to get back to refereeing.

18
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,458
Keep up the good work,
big bro, Tenchi!

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,083
Thanks! We're about
to begin the finals.

20
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,250
Afterwards I'll be soaking
in a hot tub!

21
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,625
Master Tenchi,
no one seems to know.

22
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,291
What's the final competition?

23
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,666
Well, it's a little different.
Hard to describe.

24
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,916
You'll have to see for yourself.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,250
[AYEKA]
Hm?

26
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,166
[TENCHI] In this corner,
White Team sumo wrestler,

27
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,166
the one and only...

28
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,250
...Momo the Magnificent!

29
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,541
[TENCHI] In the other corner,
for the Red Team,

30
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,375
the brawny Beni Kinojo!

31
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,583
Sumo wrestling?

32
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,125
They aren't fat enough!

33
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,208
How come they're facing off
with their bottoms touching?!

34
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,500
Doesn't that position
seem kind of odd to you?

35
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,416
Not really, not if your butt
is your biggest "asset."

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,833
Ryoko, that's so crude!

37
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,291
Don't you think they
should turn around?

38
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,458
Why are you so upset?

39
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,166
You're not a bottom-feeder,
are you?

40
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,250
What? I take offense at that!

41
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,125
Do you think my rear-end
is competitive, Mr. Masaki?

42
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,375
[TENCHI laughs]

43
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,041
Ready! Bottoms up!

44
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,125
Begin!

45
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,125
[RYOKO] Hey, quit ogling
the merchandise!

46
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,416
Ah! I'm doing my job,
that's all!

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,958
Yeah, a guy's dream job.

48
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,916
What boy wouldn't
volunteer for this?

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,625
Mr. Masaki is an ass man.

50
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,666
I've entered the data.

51
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,875
[TENCHI]
That's wrong!

52
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,416
All I want is to get
this thing behind me!

53
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,791
Wait, I didn't mean that--!

54
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:56,875
Hey, whose idea was it

55
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,166
for this sumo butt
stand-off, anyway?

56
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,666
Sorry, I can't take credit.

57
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,291
It was Kawanagare's idea
that Sports Day should end

58
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,250
with a keister contest.

59
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,333
Huh?

60
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,500
You're pretty good at this.

61
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,833
So are you, Beni.

62
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,666
Did you think you'd have
a better chance at winning

63
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,458
if I couldn't use my hands?

64
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,958
Winning or losing
wasn't really on my mind.

65
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,291
[KINOJO]
Huh?

66
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:18,000
I just wanted to have
some quality time with you

67
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,458
so we could talk about stuff.

68
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,791
Talk about what?

69
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,541
[MOMO] To find out how you
were doing and feeling,

70
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:24,833
girl talk, you know,
stuff like that.

71
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,625
If we looked at each
other face to face,

72
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,708
you would just focus
on beating me to a pulp,

73
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,208
so I thought this was the
best way to have a chit-chat!

74
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,708
Is that like prat-chatter?

75
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,541
[KINOJO]
You know you're kinda weird?

76
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:37,791
[MOMO]
Yup!

77
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,541
But at least I don't try
to cause pain to anyone

78
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,958
with my words.

79
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,166
[KINOJO] My cheeks are chafed!
That's pain, isn't it?

80
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,625
[MOMO]
Hmm. Right!

81
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,500
Momo, what do you want from me?

82
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,250
I want you to be
my friend, Beni.

83
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,458
Is that so hard?

84
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,541
Yes, it is!

85
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,125
[BOTH yelp]

86
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,250
[TENCHI]
Look out!

87
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,541
[TENCHI]
Are you both okay?

88
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:01,791
Oh! Did we lose
points for that?

89
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,916
[TENCHI]
What about you, Kinojo?

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,625
Get away from me, you creep!

91
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,958
[TENCHI]
Wha--?

92
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:09,250
[KINOJO] Don't pretend you
weren't coppin' a feel!

93
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,958
Oh, thank goodness
this final event is over!

94
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,750
I can go home
and soak in the tub.

95
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,250
--[FUKA] Not so fast!
--[TENCHI] Huh?

96
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,833
They both went down
at the same time.

97
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,375
There was no declared winner!

98
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,666
[TENCHI]
S'cuse me?

99
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,458
What numbers do you
have for the final score?

100
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,333
1,050 to 1,050. It's a tie.

101
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,083
Sports Day is not over
until this match is complete.

102
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,625
Neither team can win
until that tie is broken!

103
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,125
[ANNOUNCER]
Attention, students!

104
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,666
Sports Day has been extended
to complete the final match.

105
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,833
Resuming now!

106
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,291
[GIRLS cheering]

107
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,250
[KURIHARA] We're gonna
go as long as it takes,

108
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,125
until one of these
teams collapses!

109
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,250
[TENCHI]
Or I do!
