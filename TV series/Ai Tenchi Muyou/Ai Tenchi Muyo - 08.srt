1
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,333
Are you getting used to
how things work around here?

2
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,625
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,208
Or as much as I can,
considering all the chaos.

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,250
Hm?

5
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,541
What's that thing?

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,708
Huh? Oh.

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,000
This is sort of a charm
that was passed down to me

8
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,166
from the shrine in the
town where I grew up.

00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,750
[KURIHARA]
Oh.

10
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,208
So for generations,
the men in your family

11
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:42,125
have been influenced by
the shape of this artifact?

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,416
I think there's a
misunderstanding here.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,666
[KURIHARA]
Oh, please.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,791
Just look at the shape,
the length, the girth.

15
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:51,083
What else could it be for?

16
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,625
And coincidentally,
this event's going on

17
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,000
at the school.

18
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,750
Maybe we should get
together and explore

19
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,083
a little
extra-curricular activity

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,583
since you've brought
along a toy.

21
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:04,875
I appreciate your
kind offer, but...

22
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,208
What a shame you have
so much restraint.

23
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,916
Those two are at it again!

24
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:14,875
--[KURIHARA] Huh?
--[TENCHI] S'cuse me!

25
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,666
I'll be back after
I separate them!

[HACHIKO, KINOJO grunting]

28
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,208
Just hand over the materials!

29
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,208
Where's your voucher?!

30
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,791
We don't need a damn voucher!

31
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,708
We only want a little
bit of it anyway!

32
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:29,500
"We only want a little!"
Sure you do.

33
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,208
In the end, all those
resources get wasted!

[KINOJO growls]

35
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, you two.
Just cut it out!

36
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,041
Go away!

37
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,625
Now surrender your weapons!

38
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,166
[TENCHI]
Whoa!

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,833
We're being discriminated
against by the Student Council!

40
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,541
They refuse to give us
the materials we need!

41
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,583
[TENCHI sighs]

42
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,791
We're all agreed, then?

43
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,875
They get nothing
until they come clean.

44
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,458
The Science Club
has been accused of

45
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,333
deliberately misappropriating
school resources.

46
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:07,041
Bull!

47
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:08,208
That's a phony charge!

48
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,541
Absolutely!

49
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:11,833
We need those tools and
materials for our exhibit!

50
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,208
It's all on the up and up!

51
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,958
We would never use
them to dig for treas--

52
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,291
The bottom line is

53
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,500
if you don't want trouble,
give us what we need!

54

[FUKA gasps]

If you bother
Mistress Momo anymore,

00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,666
your head's gonna be
looking for a new body.

57
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,208
[KURIHARA]
That's enough!

58
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,708
If you lack resources,
make up for it

59
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,958
with brains and wit!

60
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,166
Understood?

[thunder rumbles]

62
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,125
[SARYU] Tori, did you
handle the request

63
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,500
from the Drama Club
for extra resources?

64
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,041
Yes, I approved it.

65
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,416
[SARYU]
Mm. Thank you.

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,291
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.

67
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,250
We seem to be pretty
flush at the moment.

68
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,375
So why'd you turn down--

69
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,708
[SARYU]
It's a simple system.

70
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,583
We give the money
based on how effectively

71
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,583
they justify their
budget request.

72
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,375
This is the responsibility
of the Student Council.

73
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,166
Teachers aren't
supposed to interfere.

74
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,500
Not ever?

75
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,041
If the Science Club's
determined to set its own

76
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,666
budget and resources,

77
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,666
then it will need to take
over control of the school.

78
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,375
That's the bottom line here.

79
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,958
We need to pick up
some materials

80
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,208
from the warehouse.

81
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,416
It won't take long.

82
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,541
Hachiko, would you
mind handling this?

83
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,041
Whatever you wish,
Mistress Momo.

84
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,125
Very good.

85
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,708
But there's quite
a bit to pick up.

86

Oh. No problem!

carrying stuff, I'll do it!
