00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,750
[TENCHI]
This sure is a long line.

3
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,708
I wonder what
we'll see in there.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,500
--Hey! What the heck?
--[MOMO] Huh?

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,250
Watch out!

6
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,333
[MOMO gasps]

7
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,291
[STUDENT A] Look!
It didn't crack that egg!

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,375
[STUDENT B]
Amazing!

9
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,875
[TENCHI laughs]

10
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,041
What's wrong?

11
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,791
Why are you holding
on to me like this?

12
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,666
Oh! Sorry!

13
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,208
There's an arm wrestling
booth over there.

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,291
And it seems
to be quite popular.

15
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,083
[STUDENT C grunting]

16
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,375
Okay, next.

17
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,541
I'm so lucky! l held Kinojo's
hand for a long time!

18
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,833
[giggles]

19
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,083
That's weird.
I wonder why she's so popular.

20
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:13,833
Beni may not look that friendly,

21
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,750
but she's actually very gentle
and won't try to hurt you.

22
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,250
You pointing to me?

23
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,291
--[KINOJO] Mm-hmm.
--[MOMO] Go ahead!

24
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,041
Give it your best, Mr. Tenchi!

25
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,208
I'll try.

26
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,375
[TENCHI yells]

27
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,291
You lay a finger on
my Tenchi's fingers

28
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,041
and I'll crack you like an egg!

29
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:33,791
[TENCHI yelling]

30
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,250
I've heard what you
can do with that hand!

31
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,250
I don't want it near my man.

32
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,041
I'll wrestle you for him,
and I don't intend to lose!

33
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,000
[RYOKO, KINOJO growl]

34
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:55,916
[TENCHI yelling]

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,625
[RYOKO] Wow! I feel like
my hand is caught in a vise!

36
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,083
[KINOJO] What's her
deal with the teacher?

37
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,791
She's a real nut case!

38
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,000
[RYOKO, KINOJO grunting]

--Don't surrender!

[RYOKO, KINOJO grunting]

41
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,500
[RYOKO]
Is she even human?

42
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,583
I'm afraid I'm about
to lose this!

43
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,250
[RYOKO grunting]

44

[TENCHI grunting]

45
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,708
C'mon, Mr. Tenchi.
Where did you go?

46
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,333
[RYOKO, KINOJO]
Hmph!

47
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,916
Please hurry, girls.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,416
--There are a lot more of these.
--Thank you.

49
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,541
You're both gonna have
to work twice as fast.

50
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,958
You have a very big
sweets bill to pay off.

51
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,208
My hands are starting
to shrivel up.

52
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,875
We should have brought
Goriki for this.

53
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,416
Oh, gosh!

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,916
Now because of this, we're gonna
miss the Drama Club's play!

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,125
I really wanted to see
"Beauty and the Prince."

56
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,833
Oh, listen,
my beautiful princess.

57
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,916
I'd bear any suffering to
awaken you from your spell.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,416
And plant a kiss on
your lips one last time

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,083
to seal my love for you.

[HACHIKO gasps]

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,958
[HACHIKO]
How did he get in there?

62
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,416
I know not what to do!

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,625
Improvise!

64
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,958
Go for it!

65
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,625
Yeah, the show must go on!

66
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,166
[kissing noises]

67
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,000
[HACHIKO] This audience is going
to get an award-winning

68
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,375
performance from me!
