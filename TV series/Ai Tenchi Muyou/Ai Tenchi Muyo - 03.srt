1
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:21,000
How pretty!

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,875
[TENCHI]
So, uhh, Washu...

3
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:31,375
Why in the world am I here
strapped to this chair?

4
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,500
Well, Master Tenchi,

5
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,125
it's a long story,
but there's someone

6
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,250
who's in desperate
need of your help.

7
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,750
Someone I've met?

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,083
No, I don't believe so.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,833
You see, there was
a bit of an incident

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,666
during my recent research.

11
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,166
It seems that
one or two people

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,583
accidentally got caught up
in a dimensional warp

13
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,750
that was created during
one of my experiments.

14
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,625
And you have no way
to retrieve them?

15
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,083
[WASHU]
I'm glad you asked!

16
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,458
That's where you come in.

17
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,250
I need you to rescue those
poor castaways for me.

18
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,083
[TENCHI] Why can't you
just go pick them up?

19
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,958
I would, but there
would be complications,

20
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,458
if you know what I'm saying.

21
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,083
The problem is,
I'm such a genius,

22
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:08,375
and so famous.

23
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,125
My mere presence would
be extremely disrupting.

24
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,583
[TENCHI] So you don't want
to be found out, right?

25
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,250
You're so perceptive!

26
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,500
It's important that this job

27
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,791
be carried out
quickly and quietly.

28
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,333
How do I get back?

29
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,791
[TENCHI yelling]

30
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,916
[WASHU] When you find the two
people you're looking for,

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,958
open up the Recovery app,
and leave the rest to me.

32
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,291
[TENCHI]
Got it.

33
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,708
Well, I made it.

34
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,500
But where am I?

35
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:51,708
And what's with
this weird outfit?

36
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,125
--[YOUNG MOMO screaming]
--[TENCHI] Say what?

37
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,833
[YOUNG MOMO screaming]

38
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:55,916
[TENCHI yells]

39
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,625
Owwee.

40
00:01:58,708 --> 00:02:00,750
Oh! It's a person!

41
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,583
[TENCHI grunts]
Huh?

42
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:03,416
Hi.

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,583
[TENCHI]
Oh, hello.

44
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,083
I was looking for someone.
Can you help me?

45
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,375
I climbed a tree to see if
she was somewhere nearby,

46
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,000
but I couldn't find anybody.

47
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,208
Have you seen her?

48
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,458
[TENCHI]
Uh, I don't know.

49
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,708
What does she look like?

50
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,333
[YOUNG MOMO] Well, she's
got these really pointy,

51
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,000
kinda grumpy-looking eyes,
and when she stares at you--

52
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,791
You're scaring me
just talking about her!

53
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,000
[YOUNG MOMO gasps]

54
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,791
First things first.

55
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,000
Who are you?

56
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,000
[crying]

57
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,375
What?

58
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,416
Okay, calm down! I'm sorry!

59
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,458
[TENCHI]
Could she be...?

60
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:42,125
S'cuse me. I have a question.

61
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,916
[YOUNG MOMO]
Huh?

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,458
I believe you said
you've been out here

63
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,916
searching for someone?

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,958
Yes.

65
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,625
And I have to
find her real soon!

66
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,041
[TENCHI]
What a break.

67
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,750
I'll bet anything this little
girl and her lost friend

68
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:57,000
are the exact two people
Washu sent me out here to find.

69
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,125
Don't you worry!

70
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,208
[YOUNG MOMO]
Huh?

71
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,958
How about if I help you
search for your friend?

72
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:05,875
[YOUNG MOMO]
Really?

73
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,166
Sure. I'm happy to help.

74
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,541
Thanks so much!

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,125
What do you think?

76
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,750
How 'bout we take
a look in that place?

77
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,750
Oh. Now that I think of it...

78
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,791
[YOUNG MOMO]
What?

79
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,708
I never asked
what your name was.

80
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,041
I'm Tenchi. Tenchi Masaki.

81
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,583
That seems like a nice name.

82
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,666
[TENCHI]
How 'bout you?

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,166
What's your name?

84
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,666
They call me Momo.

85
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,166
You know what?

86
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,833
I have a feeling you and I
are going to be best friends!
