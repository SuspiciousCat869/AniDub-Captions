1
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,250
Yes, yes.

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,333
There's enough of me
to go around for everyone.

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,416
[SARYU]
This is certainly odd.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
[FUEYAMA] Fuka seems to be
closing the gap in the polls.

5
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,208
Definitely cheating.

6
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,000
That can't be true!
They wouldn't do that!

7
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,208
I'm sure they're doing
the best they can.

8
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,583
I hope you're right,
but I doubt it.

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,208
[FUEYAMA] There's one more
number that is bothering me.

10
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,333
Here's an expense report
from the dining hall.

11
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,541
The fact is, their balance
this month is way out of line.

12
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,875
Who's eating there
doesn't usually change.

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:42,500
Yet the sales are much
lower for this period.

14
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,583
Huh? You don't mean--?

15
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,916
[FUKA]
Thanks in advance!

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,791
Huh? What's this for?

17
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,958
Don't worry about it. It's just
my way of saying thank you!

18
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:52,500
[STUDENT A]
Thanks so much!

19
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,208
Yeah. There's one more vote.

20
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,833
[SARYU]
Excuse me.

21
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:00,125
Why, of course, I would
love to shake your hand.

22
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,958
[SARYU]
Thank you very much.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,291
Huh?

24
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,708
A meal ticket?

25
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't worry about it.

26
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,750
It's just a small thank-you.

27
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,500
In exchange, you can help me.

28
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,666
You know, the
Student Council election?

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,916
All right, see ya!

30
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:15,583
Uh... Hm?

31
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,500
Hey, one meal
ticket's all you get.

32
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,458
[SARYU laughs]

33
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,291
What's so funny anyway?

34
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:23,041
[SARYU] Did you think
I was just another student

35
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,666
who could be bought off?

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,666
Well guess what, you cheater?
You're busted!

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,416
Fuka! You attempted
to bribe a voter!

38
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Ugh. "Bribery" is such
an ugly way to spin it.

39
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,666
I'm just giving a little
token of my appreciation

40
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,125
in return for their support.

41
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,708
[SARYU] That's the definition
of bribery! Look it up!

42
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,291
That's not all we've got on you!
Someone confessed!

43
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,750
[AOI crying]

44
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:46,291
We have proof that you
forged the meal tickets.

45
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,125
Your friend here
told us everything.

46
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:49,208
[FUKA]
You moron!

47
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,708
I'm so sorry!

48
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,458
Fuka. Just admit that
you made a mistake.

49
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,166
You can start over
if you'll just be honest!

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,291
[FUKA]
Hmph!

51
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,916
Looks like she's hiding
another dirty trick!

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,166
[HACHIKO]
Stop playing games, Fuka.

53
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,041
[FUKA sighs]
Okay, you win. Here.

54
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,291
[FUEYAMA]
Hmm?

55
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,208
[screams]

56
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,500
Hey, what's the matter with you?

57
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,541
Huh?

58
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,791
[AOI screaming]

59
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,583
[SARYU]
Hachiko!

60
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,666
Huh? How'd she do that?

61
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,708
Saryu?

62
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,833
My hand's glued;
it's stuck tight!

63
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,666
[SARYU]
What? It's some kind of bomb!

64
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,583
Momo!

65
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,125
We can't let it explode
here; it's too crowded!

66
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,041
I've got to get it
someplace safer!

67
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,541
[TENCHI]
Miss Momo!

68
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,583
Bring the bomb over to me!

69
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,041
Can you help us?

70
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,083
[TENCHI]
Mmm!

71
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,416
Kinojo, are you ready?

72
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,541
Okay, batter up!

73
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,791
It's way too low!

74
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,958
Hachiko! Tori!

75
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,208
[FUEYAMA]
On it!

76
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:04,666
Height bearing, seven!
Angle 38! Distance 90!

77
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,791
Hi-yah!

78
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,916
[MOMO]
Kinojo, wait!

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,375
I just... Mmm...

80
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,791
Thank you!

81
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,791
It's all right.

82
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,625
It felt natural to help.

83
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,875
It's just that... Never mind.

84
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,208
Another thing...

85
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,625
Now my debts to you
are all repaid, Mr. Tenchi.

86
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,416
One thing we've learned today:

87
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,833
The Science Club
will do anything to win.
