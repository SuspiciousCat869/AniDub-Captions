1
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,958
[KURIHARA] First up is the
obstacle course competition.

2
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,875
Runners, take your positions!

3
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,958
Hmph! This race belongs to me!

4
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,250
We'll just see about that,

5
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,166
'cause I don't plan
to lose, either.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,791
What are the rules of this game?

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,458
I think it's obvious.
They have to overcome obstacles.

8
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:29,583
I get that, but isn't
it too dangerous for them

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:30,791
to be carrying swords?

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,208
Oh, quit your worrying.

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,791
According to an
old safety manual,

12
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,375
as long as there
are no steel blades,

13
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,375
swords are allowed.

14
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,541
How old is that safety manual?

15
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,041
[horn blows, starting gun fires]

16
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,875
C'mon, Goriki, where are you?

17
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,208
--[GORIKI roars]
--[GIRLS scream]

18
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,458
Do as I command!
Get over here now!

19
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,541
[GORIKI roars]

20
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,250
[GIRLS yell]

21
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,375
Hold on!

22
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,583
[yells]

23
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,291
[grunts]

24
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,833
Well, I warned you.

25
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,791
Aren't you glad you
have that extra padding?

26
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,291
It's not nearly enough.

27
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,500
Why allow Fuka's team
to have Goriki?

28
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,083
--[KURIHARA] Why not?
--[TENCHI] Huh?

29
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:10,958
[KURIHARA] There's no mention
in the safety manual about it.

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,708
You need a new manual!

31
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,708
I'm catching up with you, Fuka!

32
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:16,750
[growls]

33
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,791
The game is heating
up quite nicely now.

34
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,500
But this isn't a fair game--

35
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,291
at least not the
way you're running it.

36
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,500
Life's not fair.
It's filled with hurdles.

37
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,916
You have to find a way to
survive and overcome them.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,583
Just as you do in this course.

39
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,625
Your biggest obstacle
is your competitor!

40
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,666
[TENCHI sighs]

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,583
[HACHIKO grunting]

42
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,541
I can tap right into her info.

43
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,291
I've found her weak point
and I'm gonna use it to win!

44
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,250
[HACHIKO]
No!

45
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,958
Give... give it back!

46
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,416
Give it back!

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,250
Give me back my sword!

48
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,083
[crying]

49
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:54,083
Hachiko, get up!

50
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,583
Pull yourself together!

51
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:58,958
[HACHIKO]
I can't! I'm scared!

52
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,375
Something made Hachiko
switch to little girl mode.

53
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,000
If she stays there,
it's no good for our team.

54
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,125
Heh! But it sure is
good for mine!

55
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,250
Let's go!

56
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,625
According to my data,
little-girl Hachiko is impaired.

57
00:02:10,708 --> 00:02:13,916
She has only two percent or less
of her normal physical ability.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,333
Oh, boy.

59
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:16,708
Hachiko, get it back!

60
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,833
Don't let her keep your sword!

61
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,166
[HACHIKO]
I'm really scared, Momo!

62
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,916
I don't know if I can!

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,375
Of course you can! Don't let
your fear stop you from acting!

64
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,500
[HACHIKO]
What do I do?

65
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,916
Trust me, we've got your back!

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,666
All you have to do
is focus on your strength!

67
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,166
Looks like I'll be taking
the first-place win!

68
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,541
That's my girl!

69
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,166
Give me back my sword right now!

70
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,250
[crying]

71
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,791
Getting close; almost there.

72
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:44,916
Got it.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
So will you be able
to shut him down?

74
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,750
Hacking complete.
Let's see if this works!

75
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,666
[FUKA]
Take her out, Goriki!

76
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,833
[GORIKI roars]

77
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,083
Hey! What's the problem
with this device?

78
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,416
Come on, why won't it work?

79
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,083
--[SARYU] It's no good!
--[FUKA] Huh?!

80
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,791
You busted him?

81
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,458
--[HACHIKO] Fuka!
--[FUKA] Huh?

82
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,291
How about you and me
finish this fair and square?

83
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,750
All right, now just
give me a moment.

84
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,666
I've got one thing to do
and then I'll be happy

85
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,083
to face off with you!

86
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,041
[HACHIKO chuckles]

87
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,416
[FUKA yelling]

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,541
I'm done for without my Goriki!

89
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,208
[GIRLS cheering]

90
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,708
[TENCHI] It's a big win
for the White Team!

91
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,166
You did it! Way to go, Hachiko!

92
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:30,708
[HACHIKO chuckles]

93
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,291
This really sucks!

94
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,750
[growling]

95
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,333
The next match is mine!
You'd better believe it!
