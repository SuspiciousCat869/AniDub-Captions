1
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,291
[RYOKO]
This is a Jurai ship?

2
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,375
I can't believe the
thing's still functioning!

3
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:22,375
It's intact, so it
shouldn't be completely

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,083
shut down.

5
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:24,083
[BOTH gasp]

6
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,541
We'd better get moving!

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,375
[WASHU]
Ryoko! Are you there?

8
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,875
Washu?

9
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:31,666
That's right! The greatest
genius  in the whole galaxy!

10
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,250
And the prettiest, too!

11
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:36,625
So as we speak, where are you?

12
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,000
About a mile or so
beneath the school.

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,208
I'm down here with
that Kinojo girl.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,375
We're staring at
an old Jurai ship.

15
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,500
Excellent!
Does the ship look okay?

16
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,541
There's a big-ass tree
growing out of it,

17
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,625
but the kid says
it'll still work.

18
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,916
That right?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,625
[KINOJO]
Uh, yeah. It should.

20
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,375
Kinojo, you think you
can get it started up?

21
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,250
[KINOJO] If the main systems
grant me access, I can.

22
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,833
Let's hope they do.

23
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:03,666
I think I know what's going on,
and the answer's in that ship.

24
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,541
[WASHU] Hey, science geeks,
how's your progress?

25
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,208
[FUKA]
Everything's almost done, boss.

26
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,708
We'll get it going soon.

27
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,625
[AOI] You've become such
a team-player, Fuka.

28
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,708
I like it.

29
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,333
[FUKA]
Just connect this, and...

30
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,416
Transmitting!

31
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,375
[TROOPER A]
Hands up!

32
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,458
[FUKA, AOI gasp]

33
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,541
[FUKA, AOI scream]

34
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,583
[FUKA]
You three did this?

35
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,833
Is this revenge 'cause
I ran for President?

36
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,916
I'd never vote
for anyone but Momo!

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,416
Is this really the
time to talk politics?

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,166
Look sharp! Back-up's here.

39
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,083
[KURIHARA]
Lower your weapons!

40
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,000
We need to evacuate.

41
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:43,666
That's an order. Now go!

42
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,666
You should all leave, as well.

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,208
Run as far as you can.

44
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,875
--[GROUP gasps]
--[FUKA, AOI scream]

45
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,125
Momo. Mr. Tenchi.

46
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,166
[MOMO gasps]

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,541
I can't catch him!

48
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,291
But I will!

49
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,916
Every time I find her,
I get sent somewhere else.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,833
Are we stuck
like this... forever?

51
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,500
Can't we at least get
back to where we started?

52
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:36,000
[WASHU] I've got control
of the oscillator!

53
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,000
Try it now.

54
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,041
Okay.

55
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:54,500
[WASHU]
Phase stabilizer, activate!

56
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,375
[KINOJO]
Come on!

57
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,291
Get going, Peach Blossom!

58
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,000
[MOMO]
I can get to him!

59
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,708
[WASHU]
So far so good.

60
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,333
The ship's up and running.

61
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,875
Let's hope it has enough
power to get the job done.

62
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,708
Huh?

63
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,916
Yes, finally.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,416
We're together again!
