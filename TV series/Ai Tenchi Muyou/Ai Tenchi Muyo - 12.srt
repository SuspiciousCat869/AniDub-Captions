00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,583
[RYOKO sighs]

2
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,500
Do you really think I'm
going to let you escape

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,625
after hauling you
all the way to Earth?

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,875
[RYOKO]
Now don't be scared.

5
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,625
What I'm going to do
to you won't hurt.

6
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:24,750
[chuckles]

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,333
[N'DAGON roars]

8
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,125
[TENCHI]
I'm home!

9
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,583
[SASAMI]
Glad you're back, Big Bro!

10
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,583
Hey, how did you get that
nasty scrape on your face?

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,041
Doing preparations
for the Culture Festival.

12
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,750
[SASAMI] Oh, you must have
been working really hard.

13
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,708
Are you wearing an apron?

14
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,125
What's that about?

15
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,333
Do you like it?

16
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,541
[giggles]

17
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:50,000
Washu got it for me
to wear at the festival!

18
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,250
Cute. It looks great on you.

19
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,541
[AYEKA] Sasami, why are
you keeping Master Tenchi

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,458
standing in the doorway?

21
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,541
[TENCHI]
Huh?

22
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,666
You're wearing an
apron too, Ayeka?

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,500
We're going to be competing
at the Culture Festival.

24
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:03,875
We're gonna run a sweet shop,

25
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,416
but I had to get
it approved first.

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,791
[STUDENT A]
Is she a transfer student?

27
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:09,666
[STUDENT B] Maybe a celebrity
chef from somewhere?

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,166
[STUDENT C] We don't stand a
chance if she gets approved.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,541
Two ponytails. Cute!

30
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,666
Whaddya think?
Does she even go to this school?

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,250
I've never seen her before.
We shouldn't approve her.

32
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,666
Get ready, everyone.

33
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,708
Now look directly at this!

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,625
I got permission from
the Student Council

35
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,041
by using this gadget.

36
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,833
It's Washu's invention,
the Hypnolyzer!

37
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:33,208
Well... Seems like
a handy thing.

38
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,458
What's your opinion?
Do I look okay in this?

39
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,541
[TENCHI]
I like it.

40
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,083
'Course everything
looks good on you.

41
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,250
Oh, I know.

42
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,791
Wanted to hear it from you.

43
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,583
Now look what you made me do.
I'm blushing, Master Tenchi.

44
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,708
Wanna try something?

45
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,875
We already made a
big batch of sweets!

46
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,041
Oh, is that the interesting
aroma that I'm smelling?

47
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,958
[N'DAGON growls]

48
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,291
What? Where's that coming from?

49
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,083
The kitchen. Big Sis Ryoko's
making dinner for us tonight.

50
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,750
[TENCHI]
Eh... On her own?!

51
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,250
[N'DAGON growls]

52
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,708
They can say what they want,
but when it comes to food,

53
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,916
I know Tenchi's tastes
better than anyone.

54
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:09,166
Mmm. I think it could
use a little more kick.

55
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,833
Ahh. [laughing]

56
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,291
And lastly...

57
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,708
[MANDRAKE] Somebody,
help me, please! [squeals]

58
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,750
[RYOKO]
Now it's just perfect!

59
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,708
[N'DAGON growls]

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,083
[AYEKA]
Ryoko!

61
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,625
What on earth is in
that pot over there?

62
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,666
Isn't it obvious?
I'm making Tenchi's dinner!

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,250
I want it on record
that I objected to this idea

64
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,541
from the beginning.

65
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,375
We can't serve him
something that is filling up

66
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:39,125
the entire house with
bizarre multi-colored fumes!

67
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,541
[RYOKO]
And just why not?

68
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,208
[SASAMI]
Because it stinks!

69
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,625
Throw it out right now!

70
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,666
No siree!

71
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,791
Tenchi's eating it
and that's that!

72
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,125
[TENCHI gasps]

73
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,958
Tenchi, I poured my heart
and soul into this dish.

74
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,625
You better appreciate it!

75
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,791
--[GROUP gasps]
--Look out behind you!

76
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,000
[RYOKO growling]

77
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,083
[RYOKO grunting]

78
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,791
[N'DAGON growls]

79
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,750
I refuse to take no for
an answer, so bon appetit!

80
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,291
I need to use the
little girl's room. Bye!

81
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,666
Yeah, me too! Wait!

82
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,125
Hey!

83
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,875
This is from the Andre Nebula.

84
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,791
It's an N'dagon I brought
back from the planet C'lulu.

85
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:24,000
It's fresh and tasty, if you
don't mind a little squirming!

86
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,708
One bite'll send
you to the moon!

87
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,916
Let's go, Tenchi,
what are you waiting for?

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,541
Open wide.
You don't even have to chew!

89
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,125
Yum!

90
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,458
[TENCHI]
Somebody help me!

91
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,958
I don't wanna go to the moon!
