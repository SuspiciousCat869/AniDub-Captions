00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,833
[GP CHIEF] Honored directors
of the Scientific Academy,

2
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:16,416
thanks for your patience.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,583
[DIRECTOR A] We did not
come here to wait for you.

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,458
This is unacceptable!

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,125
I'm terribly sorry for that.

6
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:24,125
But unfortunately,
it could not be helped.

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,500
[DIRECTOR B] We all have other
things that need attending to.

8
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,041
Please get to your report.

9
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,458
[GP CHIEF] I have some
good news and some bad news.

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,250
Which one would you
like me to start with?

11
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,208
[DIRECTOR A]
We don't care. Just begin.

12
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,375
Then I'll start off
with the positive.

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,666
We've received some solid
intel about who's behind

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,083
the space-time warp.

15
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,083
[DIRECTOR A]
Well. That is good news.

16
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,291
[DIRECTOR B]
Great. Who is this criminal?

17
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,916
I'm afraid this is where
the bad news begins.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,166
[DIRECTOR A]
Go on.

19
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,916
The person behind
the space-time warp is...

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,458
...Washu. It's Washu Hakubi.

21
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,125
Therefore, I request your
permission to arrest her

22
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,125
and bring her in immediately.

23
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,541
Do you read?
It's the Chief here.

24
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:07,750
I'm about to dispatch
the special forces team

25
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,000
for this mission.

26
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,166
It's extreme, but I'm
afraid you'll need them.

27
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,500
Listen up!

28
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,208
You have to assume the
worst and act accordingly.

29
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,333
Move out!

30
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,125
[FUEYAMA]
That's good. Very sexy.

31
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:24,250
All right, now look this way.

32
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,250
That's right, good good.

33
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,375
What in the world
are you two doing here?

34
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,583
What's it look like?
Isn't it obvious?

35
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,541
[SARYU] I wouldn't be
asking if it were obvious!

36
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,666
[MOMO yells]

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,791
You're supposed to be
creating campaign material!

38
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,125
I've never seen a campaign
use sexy-time photos

39
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,708
like the ones you're taking.
I mean, seriously?

40
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,416
Hachiko, are you paying
attention to this nonsense?

41
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,291
Listen up!

42
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,125
We only have three days
until the election, people,

43
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,541
and we have competition!

44
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,541
Yuki Fuka is a tough candidate!

45
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,541
Well, based on the
current student polls,

46
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,791
Momo is beating Fuka
by a landslide.

47
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,958
It's hard to believe
she could lose.

48
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,791
Maybe in a normal election.

49
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,833
Unfortunately,
this is the Science Club

50
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,333
we're talking about.

51
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:11,083
We can't assume that they will
act like honorable people.

52
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,333
Those guys--

53
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,041
They're tougher to get
rid of than a bad case

54
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:15,333
of food poisoning!

55
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,208
Ugh! We've got to do this right!

56
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,583
[FUKA sneezes]

57
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,375
[AOI]
Oh! Are you all right?

58
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,833
Yep. Check this out!

59
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:24,000
What is this?

60
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,166
It's the new campaign
poster, of course.

61
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,208
What? Huh?

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,416
[SARYU]
Now that looks great!

63
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,166
Don't you think
it's a little stiff?

64
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,000
We should have used
this picture, it's--

65
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,500
Ugh!

66
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,958
[MOMO] I really like this
poster just the way it is.

67
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,833
I mean, everybody helped
with the design of it,

68
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,250
after all.

69
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,541
[FUKA]
Now that is one crappy poster.

70
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,958
[GROUP]
Huh?

71
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,041
There's no need
to be so uptight.

72
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,666
We're just here to hang up
a few posters ourselves.

73
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,208
Let's go, Rui!

74
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,416
Um, 'kay.

75
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,041
[FUKA]
Awesome, huh?

76
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,666
[clears throat]
Mm-hmm!

77
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,000
Hm?

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,833
Stop it!
What are you all implying?

79
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,000
Seriously? Well...

80
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,250
You've increased
your boobs 250%.

81
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,666
Cheating the size
of your assets!

82
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,583
[FUKA] This isn't cheating!
It's just politics.

83
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,541
Everyone enhances their photos!

84
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,125
It won't make a difference.

85
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:24,750
Momo's going to win the race

86
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,916
and continue as
Student Council President.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,375
That's cute. Keep that
thought as long as you can.

88
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,750
Let's go, Rui.

89
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:31,791
Right.

90
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,708
They have some scheme
up their sleeve,

91
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,875
I just know it.

92
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,958
Girls. We need to get serious!
