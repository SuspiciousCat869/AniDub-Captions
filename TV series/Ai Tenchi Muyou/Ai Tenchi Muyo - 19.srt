[FUKA chuckling]

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:23,166
Today we'll show 'em
how tough we are!

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,458
Nicely. We wanna be
good sports on Sports Day.

4
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:28,750
[KINOJO]
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,375
[MOMO humming]

6
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,708
It's gonna be a lively day!

7
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,916
I think a better description
would be "heated."

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,541
Wait till you see what
happens when everyone's

9
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,916
out on the field competing.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,958
A lot is riding
on the outcome today.

11
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,291
Everything is on the line
including all of our seats

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,583
on the Student Council.

13
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:54,833
We can't afford to lose!

14
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,041
I hope we can all
have fun, as well!

15
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,541
I don't think that's
what we've been doing

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,958
all this prep for,
but we'll try to squeeze it in.

17
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,000
Good!

18
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,291
What's with the
tense face, Hachiko?

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,041
You look ready for war!

20
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,458
Sports day is like war.

21
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,041
You either win or lose,
and you don't wanna lose.

22
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,500
The way I see it,
our opponents are the enemy

23
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,875
and defeating them
isn't going to be fun.

24
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,041
[MOMO]
Hachiko, my friend,

25
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,875
you need to lighten up
and chill out.

26
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:18,625
This is supposed
to be a school festival

27
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,541
of sports and good times
where everyone has fun!

28
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:25,000
I hear you, Mistress Momo,
but I can only take that so far.

29
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,708
Fun isn't the same for everyone.

30
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,833
Some people see sports
as a chance to shine

31
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,000
and do their best.

32
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,583
Other people don't
care about it at all.

33
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,750
[MOMO]
I suppose.

34
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,208
Look at Tori.
You might not believe it,

35
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,625
but she's having fun.

36
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,791
Compiling data
and using it to measure

37
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:39,708
every student's athletic
ability in their sport

38
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,666
is quite interesting.

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,833
See?

40
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,416
Now I get the picture!

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,666
Okay!

42
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,916
I'm going to be the best
me with all my might,

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,500
and I'm going to win!

44
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,416
So why?

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,458
[KURIHARA]
What do you mean?

46
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,041
[TENCHI]
This is Sports Day, right?

47
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,583
[KURIHARA]
It certainly is.

48
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,500
Is there some kind of problem?

49
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,708
[TENCHI] Not exactly, but don't
you think I look kind of weird

50
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,458
with all this padding on me?

51
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:01,625
Well, stop obsessing
and get over yourself.

52
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,375
It suits you just fine.

53
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:06,166
Though maybe you could use
a neck protector as well.

54
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,333
[TENCHI]
No thanks.

55
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,500
What am I getting ready for

56
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,541
that requires
all this equipment?

57
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,541
Must I go over this again?

58
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,041
I've already explained
everything to you.

59
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,333
You said that a mandatory part
of my student teacher

60
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:20,541
training course was to referee
all the games on Sports Day.

61
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,625
[KURIHARA] Hmph.
So, you do understand.

62
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,458
I understand what
I'm supposed to do.

63
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,541
What I don't understand
is why I have to wear

64
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,875
all this stuff.

65
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,833
[KURIHARA] Our Sports Day
here is somewhat unique.

66
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:33,125
It's patterned after a folklore
legend that's been passed down

67
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,833
from generation to generation.

68
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,416
It can be quite brutal.

69
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,583
[TENCHI]
Brutal?

70
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,833
I'm afraid so.

71
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,125
You'll be able to see
for yourself very soon.

72
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,583
[TENCHI chuckles]

73
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,791
Now, everyone listen up!

74
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,041
There'll be an extra incentive
for the winning team.

75
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,625
The Most Valuable Player's
club will receive

76
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:02,375
additional resources and
funding for the entire year!

77
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,791
[FUKA] Yeah! Cool!
All right! Best ever!

78
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,041
Let's hear it!
Want more resources?

79
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,625
More resources! More resources!

80
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,541
And do you want more funding?

81
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,458
More funding!
More funding! More funding!

82
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,291
And by the way,
the popular Miss Tenchi

83
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,333
is Mr. Tenchi today and wants
to show his masculine skills

84
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:22,291
for this event as
your volunteer warrior!

85
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,458
[GIRLS cheering]

86
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,708
I'm going to be a warrior!

87
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,208
Hey, I don't remember
volunteering for this!

88
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,541
Isn't it nice you're
so popular, Mr. Tenchi?

89
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,000
Not so much.
I'd rather be an unknown!

90
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,666
Now onto the games!
Let Sports Day begin!

91
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,958
[GIRLS cheering]

92
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,208
It's so exciting!
Everyone's pumped up!

93
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,041
[TENCHI]
Except me!
