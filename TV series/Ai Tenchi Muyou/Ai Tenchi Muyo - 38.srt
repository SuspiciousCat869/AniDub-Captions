take a little break.

[MOMO]
Mm-mm.

4
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,833
We may be in the
middle of an election,

5
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,875
but I can't afford to get behind
in all of my regular duties.

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,750
I'll just finish this pile.

7
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay.

Oh, boy, that's heavy.

Welcome back!

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,583
Ugh. I'm exhausted.

11
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,000
[MOMO]
Hey, what's in the box?

12
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,000
[SARYU] It's filled with
evidence of the Science Club's

13
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,000
cheating!

14
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,250
[MOMO]
Wow!

15
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,708
[MOMO]
Hmm...

16
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,791
How in the world did
they cheat with this?

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,666
[SARYU]
Try writing something with it.

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,458
It's a regular pen.

19
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,916
[SARYU] Trust me,
just wait a little longer.

Hmm...

00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:56,625
[MOMO]
What? It vanished!

22
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,750
Tricky.

23
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:59,250
[SARYU] The plan was
to slip those pens

24
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,500
into the voting booths and
make a lot of ballots invalid.

25
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,916
[MOMO]
What about this?

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,583
[SARYU] Go ahead, try putting
a ballot into the slot

27
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:05,958
and see what happens.

28
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,458
[MOMO]
Huh?

29
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,000
How'd the name get changed?

30
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,416
Check up there.

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,250
There's a small printer
installed in the top of the box.

32
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,833
Look at that! Huh!

33
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,416
[SARYU] This isn't really the
time to appreciate their work.

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,916
If they've got tools like this,

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,541
then we can't win
by playing fair.

steps possible to make
sure she's a shoe-in!

Hello? Huh? Whoa!

Hey! This makes your
voice sound funny!

42
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,916
They sure came up with a lot
of ways to get attention.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,500
[MOMO laughs]
I just sound so silly!

44
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,083
[MOMO]
The very first time I tried it,

45
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,333
I was literally addicted.

46
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,833
Did you ever think
to try and get help

47
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,833
for this problem?

48
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,000
[MOMO]
It never crossed my mind.

49
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,458
I thought I could control it.

50
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,833
I mean, I like to pet kittens;
is that a crime?

51
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,041
They're so darn cute!

52
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,833
Did you take this
cute kitten video

53
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,958
and post it online so the
whole world could see it?

00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,291
Well, I hope you've
learned something.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
about the Science Club, exactly?

[SARYU] In any case,
something's not right.

66
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,250
The whole group was
way too quick to give up.

67

They admitted they were
cheating with this stuff

68
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,666
and just handed it over.

69
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,083
It doesn't make sense that
people who cheat so easily

70
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,333
would give in so easily.
