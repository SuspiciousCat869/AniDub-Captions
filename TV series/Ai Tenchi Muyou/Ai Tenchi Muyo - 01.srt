Where am I?

3
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,166
Is this even the right place?

4
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,500
Oh, great.

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,333
Well, this thing's useless.

[animal growls]

00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,833
Better just follow the path.

[MOMO]
What are you doing down there?

16
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,833
[TENCHI]
I was minding my own business!

17
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,250
[FUKA]
Hold it!

18
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,916
[MOMO] I'd love to chat,
but I've gotta get out of here!

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,708
[TENCHI groans]
Wait a minute!

20
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,416
[MOMO] Oh, there's no
need to apologize, really!

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,208
I'm not upset that you were
able to see my panties!

22
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,791
Bye bye, now! [giggles]

23
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,333
[TENCHI] Uh... I'm pretty sure
I'm the one who deserves

24
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,625
an apology!

25
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,125

Gotcha!

00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:36,750
Great shot, Rui!

Thanks!

29
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,000
[FUKA] Today's the day
they'll finally have to grant us

30
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:41,500
our extra funding!

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,291
Who's this guy?

32
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,083
Now that you mention it,
that's a very good question!

33

--[FUKA] 'Cause he's not Momo!

Release that girl immediately!

[HACHIKO]
Are you all right?

38
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:54,625
Let me get this
netting off of you.

39
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:56,666
Thank heavens!

Damn it, now they're
getting away!

43
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,416
Hand over the real
Mistress Momo!

Momo!

Hold on. Checking database.

[KURIHARA] So you got
lost on the mountain?

50
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,666
That's kind of unusual.

51
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,708
A lot of unusual things
happened up there.

52
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,208
Glad I finally made it.

[KURIHARA]
But I do have to say...

55
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,083
Considering what
you went through,

56
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,041
you seemed to have
bounced right back.

57
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,208
That's the kind of resilience
you're going to need

58
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,291
if you hope to last
two weeks around here

59
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,500
as my plaything.

60
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,625
I mean, as my student teacher.

[KURIHARA]
Here we go.

62

Now quiet down, everyone.

I want to introduce
you to my new toy.

66

I beg your pardon.

67
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,208
I mean your new
student teacher, of course.

68
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,708
Starting today, he'll be
helping you with your studies.
