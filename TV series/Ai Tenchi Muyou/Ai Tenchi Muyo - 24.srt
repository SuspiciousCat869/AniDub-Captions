1
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,041
[TENCHI]
This must be the girls' dorm

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,125
'cause it's plastered with
signs warning guys

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,708
not to go in.

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,208
Lucky me, Mr. new dorm monitor.

5
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,625
Welcome to our dorm!

6
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,958
Mr. Tenchi!

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,541
[TENCHI]
Reporting for duty!

8
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,958
[MOMO] Okay, come with me and
I'll show you around the dorm.

9
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:31,583
Hurry up! This way!

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,583
Like a spider leading
him into her web.

11
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,125
Spider?! Don't let it near me!

12
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,583
I was merely using
a figure of speech.

13
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm gonna make
a web of my own,

14
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,708
and lure him away from her,
so our Science Club

15
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,625
has that teacher in our pocket,
which will end up

16
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,916
getting us perks!

17
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,541
[MOMO]
This is our cafeteria.

18
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,875
And this is our bathing room.

19
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,416
Most of the dorm
bedrooms are on this floor.

20
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,791
[SARYU]
Thought I heard voices.

21
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,958
Oh, nice to see you, Mr. Tenchi.

22
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:58,875
Why are you greeting me
in your underwear?

23
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,083
You'll have to get used to it.

24
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,750
This is what I wear
around the dorm.

25
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,291
--Please cover up!
--Black underwear?

26
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,416
I've never seen you
wearing that before!

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,583
Look, the color's
not really the problem.

28
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,875
The lack of clothes is
certainly the biggest issue

29
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,666
facing us at the moment!

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,708
Looks to me like your
mind is somewhere else,

31
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,500
which is why you're
getting so upset.

32
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,083
[MOMO] If you're saying
Mr. Tenchi's mind

33
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,416
is in the gutter, you're wrong.

34
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,833
He's very proper!

35
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,208
All guys are natural wanderers,
and before you know it,

36
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,666
their hands are
wandering all over you!

37
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,291
Could we change the subject?
This is getting weird!

38
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,916
[SARYU] Afraid to admit
that the way I look

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,125
in my underwear
is exciting to you?

40
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:33,125
Hey! I'm an excitable guy!

41
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,208
Just leave me alone while
I'm in the dorm so I--

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,583
You're gonna have
a problem here.

43
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,875
Absolutely not!

44
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,875
Wait up, Kinojo!

45
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,125
Mr. Tenchi. I heard you
were the new monitor.

46
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,375
I'm sure you'll
see plenty of us.

47
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,833
I already have!
Could you put on some clothes?

48
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,375
Well, that would
be kind of silly.

49
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,291
I'm about to step
into the shower.

50
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,208
Could you do it anyway?

51
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,041
Mr. Tenchi's just
trying to do his job,

52
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:02,166
and he can't if he's
all turned on by you!

53
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,041
--Oh, yeah?
--I never really said that!

54
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:04,958
[MOMO]
Please, Beni!

55
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,291
There's no dress code here.

56
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,666
You can't tell me what to wear!

57
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,750
[SARYU]
She's right.

58
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,125
What?

59
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,208
Where'd he run off to?

60
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,041
[FUKA] Find the spot.
Oh, that's good!

61
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,375
[TENCHI]
I can't hold it forever!

62
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,791
[AOI] Please, Mr. Tenchi,
don't move like that!

63
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,125
I'm almost there!
Just hold it very still!

64
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,958
Don't panic!
We won't let you fall!

65
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,541
[AOI]
O-Okay.

66
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,583
Thanks for the help.

67
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,000
Sorry to have to
bother you with this

68
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,208
when you're busy just
getting started here.

69
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,583
No bother, although
it might be better if I got up

70
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,666
on the ladder;
we don't want Rui to get hurt.

71
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,000
She loves changing bulbs.

72
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,916
She's extremely
passionate about it.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,958
--How odd.
--Yeah!

74
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,166
She's full of surprises.

75
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,083
[TENCHI]
Huh?

76
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,250
[farts]

77
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,833
[TENCHI gasps]

78
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,458
[AOI whimpering]

79
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,250
Basic rule to know when flirting
with the opposite sex.

80
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,708
It is really not sexy to fart
in the face of a guy

81
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,291
when you're flashing
your panties.

82
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,541
Okay, but I always
fart when I'm nervous.

83
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,083
If it happens,
don't do it twice.

84
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,208
Just stick with the plan
to fall into his arms!

85
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,583
[AOI]
I've gotta hold it in!

86
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,208
You seem a little shaky, Rui.

87
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,291
No, I'm fine!

88
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:06,916
You look like you could fall!

89
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,958
This ladder's starting
to wobble!

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,791
[AOI yells]

91
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:11,875
[TENCHI yells]

92
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,750
I gotcha.

93
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,916
Are you all right?

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,666
I'm fine.

95
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,708
Yes!

96
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,791
I feel something.

97
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,750
It's small.

98
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,791
[AOI gasps]

99
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,333
It's a spider!

100
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,750
[TENCHI]
Please let go of my head!

101
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,958
--[AOI screaming]
--[TENCHI] Can't... breathe!

102
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,833
You're squashing Mr. Tenchi!

103
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,041
Is the spider gone?
I'm afraid to look!

104
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,291
[TENCHI]
Call 911!

105
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:38,500
I can't feel anything
below my ears!
