1
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:18,875
[OPERATOR A] Energy field
has now been activated.

2
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,291
[OPERATOR B]
Anti-phase dimensional waves

3
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,041
are oscillating!

4
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,458
[GP CHIEF] Good! Tell them
to send the SWAT team back in.

5
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,000
[SWAT GUY B]
Huh?

6
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,083
What the heck?

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,375
These weren't here before!

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,375
[PLANT chirps]

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,625
[SWAT GUYS yell]

10
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,375
[PLANTS chirp]

11
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,916
[SWAT GUY C screams]

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,041
Here, take it.

13
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,583
But once I use that,
I won't be me anymore.

14
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,375
I'll be a totally
different person.

15
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,708
I'm afraid so.

16
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,833
But if you don't get your
butts back to the past,

17
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,125
this whole planet's gonna
be blown into little pieces!

18
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,250
Hey, don't say that!

19
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,458
And why not? It's the truth!

20
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,708
Just take the thing, will ya?

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,916
[grunts]

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,791
Shut up for a second!

23
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,750
I know this is scary,
but I will protect you. Always.

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,750
[PLANTS chirp]

25
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,500
You'll pay for what
you've done to my troops!

26
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,875
Show yourself, Washu!

27
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,958
[WASHU]
I hear ya. I'm right here.

28
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,416
No need to shout.

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,000
We anticipated your move.

30
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:29,458
It's over for you!

31
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,208
Really? Is that so?

32
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:35,958
[OPERATOR A]
Something's taken control of the

33
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,333
dimensional oscillation!

34
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,916
[OPERATOR B]
They hacked the energy field!

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,625
We can't isolate the malware!

36
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,208
Since they were given to me,
I might as well use the tools.

37
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,916
You pirate!

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,125
[yells]

39
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,500
Nice try, but you're
not quite ready to play

40
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,791
with the big girls yet.

41
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,958
Wow, Ms. Washu!
You are just so incredible!

42
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,916
Oh, well, it comes naturally.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,500
[screams]

44
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,958
I was only looking around
to restock my snacks,

45
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,458
but instead, I found you!

46
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,625
[WASHU gasps]

47
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,291
[MIHOSHI]
I'm gonna arrest you now, okay?

48
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,708
Dammit, I completely
forgot about this airhead.

49
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,291
I'm such an idiot!

50
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,166
[TENCHI]
That's good. Nice and slow.

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,375
Okay.

52
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:25,291
[MOMO, TENCHI] yell

53
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,708
--Did it activate?
--Not yet!

54
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,208
This is from something else!

55
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,625
[TENCHI, MOMO scream]

56
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,375
[GP CHIEF]
What now? What's going on?

57
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,666
Something's wrong with
the dimensional oscillations!

58
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,583
No! This shouldn't be!

59
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,250
[WASHU laughing]

60
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,166
You dimwits really
thought you could control

61
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,875
a hyper-dimensional war?

62
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,250
[KURIHARA]
You're gonna fix this!

63
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,833
[WASHU]
But I didn't break it.

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
[MOMO gasps]

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,541
Whoa...

66
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,375
[TENCHI]
Are these peach blossom petals?

67
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,666
[MOMO]
So familiar...

68
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,250
[KINOJO]
No!

69
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,416
Stop it!
That's no ordinary force field!

70
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,083
Do you have some
kind of death wish?

71
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,291
[KINOJO]
Let me go!

72
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:37,041
[RYOKO, KINOJO yelling]

73
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,375
--[KINOJO] Momo!
--[RYOKO] Tenchi!
