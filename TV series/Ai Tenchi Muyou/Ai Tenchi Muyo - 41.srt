1
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,791
[UN HC] Explain yourself!
What is the meaning of this?

2
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:18,291
[GP CHIEF]
It's routine police activity,

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,583
Mr. High Commissioner.

4
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,625
Your UN Committee on
Extraterrestrial Cultural

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,166
Negotiation has been notified.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,833
What we're doing is covered
under the Okayama Protocol.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,041
Our actions are entirely legal.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,041
That's nonsense!

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,583
Nothing about this is legal!

10
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,250
The protocol allows aliens
to travel to Okayama

11
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,666
in small numbers only!

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,791
Not hordes!

13
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,791
12,000 Galaxy Policemen
is far too many!

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,500
It's a violation
of the agreement!

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,583
[GP CHIEF]
Mr. High Commissioner,

16
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,208
I'm afraid we disagree.

17
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,125
Compared with the entire
extraterrestrial population,

18
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,250
I'd say a mere 12,000 is small.

19
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,583
--Let's show him.
--Sir.

20
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,208
[CHIEF ENGINEER] If the
singularity is left unchecked,

21
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:59,708
in 24 hours, the space-time
warp will reach its limit.

22
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,083
Then, not only will
the Earth be doomed,

23
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,250
but the universe
itself could split.

24
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,458
We've sent you copies of
our findings, Commissioner.

25
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,125
Your scientists can go over
them and explain the rest.

26
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,250
No, wait!

27
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:17,541
That's assuming Earth scientists
can understand them at all.

28
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,416
[alarm blaring]

29
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,583
This just in.
Breaking news from outer space.

30
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,333
According to urgent
reports coming from

31
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:32,708
the United Nations Space
Observation Center,

32
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:34,708
a damaged Russian
satellite has fallen

33
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,041
out of its orbit and
is currently plummeting

34
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,208
towards Earth.

35
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:39,875
[alarm blaring]

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,458
The news hasn't reported
where it will hit,

37
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,541
but we've gotten word.

38
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:49,708
The satellite's point of impact
is going to be near Takahashi.

39
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,666
[GIRLS chattering]

40
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,625
Since that's near us,
we're evacuating the campus!

41
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,708
So what's gonna happen
with the election?

42
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,000
That has been canceled.

43
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,416
Are you serious?

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,833
Self-Defense Forces
are bringing helicopters.

45
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:02,958
They're on their way.

46
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,666
As members of the
Student Council,

47
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,000
you must help with
the evacuation.

48
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:07,666
Right!

49
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,875
[GIRLS screaming]

50
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,583
[OPERATOR A] All area
inhabitants set to be evacuated

51
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,125
within the next 30
minutes, local time.

52
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,041
Hmph. Guess they did understand.

53
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,750
[OPERATOR B] Galaxy Police SWAT
forces confirmed deployed.

54
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,250
They are posing
as JDSF and police.

55
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,708
Step one: We fire the
Dimension Oscillator Bomb

56
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,500
at the Singularity's locale,

57
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,541
thereby using waves
in the opposite phase

58
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,750
to negate the waves emitted
by the dimensional warp.

59
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,833
This will then diminish the
effects of the singularity.

60
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,875
Step Two: Use an energy field
to isolate the area.

61
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,416
Step Three:
Apprehend both the Singularity

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
and Washu, while at the
same time recovering

63
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,625
the dimensional controller
and putting the dimensions

64
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,416
back the way they should be.

65
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,875
This strategy
cannot fail--it's flawless.

66
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,166
Of course it is.

67
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,625
So the only ones left are
you four and the teachers.

68
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,291
You ready? Time to go.

69
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,541
Hold on a second.

70
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,750
Rui Aoi, Beni Kinojo,
and Yuki Fuka.

71
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,416
None of them are accounted for.
They didn't evacuate!

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,958
What? Where are they?

73
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,041
[HACHIKO] They could be
in the old building!

74
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,083
Miss Momo!

75
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:13,958
[TROOPER A]
Get in the helicopter!

76
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,500
We have to go!

77
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,416
I'll get them!

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,625
[TROOPER B]
Hold on!

79
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,916
Go, Mr. Tenchi!

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,875
Why, you...! [grunts]

81
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,541
Take care of Mistress Momo!

82
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,375
[TENCHI]
Mmm!

83
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,000
[OPERATOR A]
Two. One. Zero.

84
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,375
On my mark. And fire!

85
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,250
[OPERATOR A]
Bomb's away.

86
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,250
Ignition confirmed.
60 minutes to impact.
