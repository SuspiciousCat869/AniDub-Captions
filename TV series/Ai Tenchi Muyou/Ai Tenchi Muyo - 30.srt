1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,625
[TENCHI yelling]

2
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,875
[WASHU]
Oh, Master Tenchi!

3
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:22,375
I wasn't expecting you.

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,541
Where's Momo?

5
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:24,583
Mm?

6
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,291
[WASHU]
Hmm...

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,541
Looks like our little
bird is quite busy.

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,583
She's flitting around a lot.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,750
[TENCHI]
Uh...

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,333
She's left a clear trail
behind her, though.

11
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,125
I can almost see
her current location.

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,541
Huh?

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,166
She's getting an award
for her volunteer activities.

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,333
She's assimilating.

15
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,208
[TENCHI]
Washu, come on!

16
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,166
There must be a way I can
help those two girls get back.

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,291
I'm willing to do
anything within my power.

18
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,458
Anything at all!

19
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,833
Whatever you say.

20
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,833
[RYOKO] Do we have
to do this right now?

21
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,791
Can we at least eat lunch first?

22
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,291
Do you ever think
about anything

23
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,750
except your stomach?

24
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,208
Let's concentrate.

25
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,916
How can we infiltrate
Momo's school?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,250
[RYOKO] Why can't we
just race in there

27
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,500
through the front door?

28
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:14,416
It was made clear that
we can't bring attention

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,833
to ourselves!

30
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,958
We need to do everything
we can to keep a low profile!

31
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,333
A disguise would work!

32
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,750
Maybe Tenchi could sneak in
as a girl at the school!

33
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,166
[RYOKO]
Oh, I'd pay to see that happen!

34
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,708
[AYEKA]
It's a ridiculous idea!

35
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,250
[SASAMI]
I don't think so!

36
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,791
[TENCHI]
Excuse me.

37
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,125
Does anyone have
a workable idea?

38
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:30,958
[RYOKO]
How do I know?

39
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,125
[WASHU]
Don't lose focus.

40
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,458
Ideas?

41
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,666
[AYEKA] I think they would
still have men's rooms

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,208
and ladies' rooms.

43
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,291
Is there any game plan that
doesn't have me wearing a dress?

44
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,458
There must be some
male teachers, right?

45
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,416
A teacher! Great idea!

46
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,083
I think you've
found the solution!

47
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,291
--[SASAMI laughs]
--[TENCHI sighs]

48
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,791
[WASHU] Let's review what's
happened up to this point.

49
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,750
We've been trying
to save the two castaways

50
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,000
who were caught up
in the dimensional warp.

51
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,750
We sent Tenchi into the past,
but that effort failed.

52
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,583
Momo and Kinojo
got caught up again,

53
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,375
and we lost track of them.

54
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:00,708
Then...

55
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,750
After an extensive search
through many dimensions,

56
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,583
we finally found a sign of
where they might have ended up.

57
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,291
And wouldn't you know it, they
surfaced in our current time.

58
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:10,708
We've even been able
to pinpoint a location.

59
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,833
[TENCHI]
And this is...?

60
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,083
[WASHU]
The Junai Academy.

61
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,791
It's a girl's school on Earth.

62
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,416
So if we go there,
we can save Momo?

63
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,666
[WASHU] All I can really
say is it's possible.

64
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,291
After all, we still
don't know why

65
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,291
that last rescue
operation failed, do we?

66
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,125
Most likely,
some unknown condition

67
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,375
needs to be addressed--
something we just overlooked.

68
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,625
So that's it.
You, Master Tenchi,

69
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,541
will go and infiltrate
the Junai Academy.

70
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,333
We'll figure out a way
to get you installed

71
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,583
as a student teacher.

72
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,708
That's how you will
do your reconnaissance.

73
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,125
I get it, but it seems
a little awkward.

74
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,916
If it's a girl's school,
wouldn't one of you

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,291
fit in better?

76
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,916
Didn't you say you'd do
anything within your power?

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,708
Uh...

78
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,125
Something like that.

79
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,333
Ryoko.

80
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,500
You'll gather information
on the school's surroundings.

81
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,625
You understand?

82
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,916
As you wish.

83
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,666
[WASHU] Madame Ayeka,
you'll be Ryoko's support

84
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,791
and go-between.

85
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,166
Just leave it to me!

86
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,208
[WASHU] Sasami, you look
after Master Tenchi for us.

87
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,250
Right!

88
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,125
[WASHU] Establishing a fake
identity turned out to be

89
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,583
a piece of cake.

90
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,041
As a student teacher,
you can survey the environment.

91
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,500
Then you'll be able to decide on

92
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,166
the best course
of action for us.

93
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,625
You call the shots.

94
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,541
Understood.

95
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,250
[TENCHI] I hope accepting
this assignment

96
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,625
wasn't a mistake.

97
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,833
This place feels like
it's about to eat me alive!
