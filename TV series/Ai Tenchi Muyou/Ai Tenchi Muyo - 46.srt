Huh?

Did they get transported
somewhere else?

This is a sign.

It's down here!

Her ship, the Peach Blossom.

13

It's at the bottom of that hole.

You're sure?

What the hell
were you thinking?

That's gotta be hundreds
of feet down!

19
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:29,250
You'd never survive!

20
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,875
I have to get down there, now!

the rest of the way?

That's fine.

Sorry you're locked up,
but you're difficult to catch!

You have eluded us up to now,
Washu Hakubi, but not anymore.

Justice has finally
caught up with you

27
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,291
and you're going to pay.

Starting with 70,000

Whatever.

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,875
I did the crime.
I'll do the time.

long enough to take me in.

[MOMO]
I'm sorry, but who are you?

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,625
And how is it that
you know my name?

36
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,083
[TENCHI]
Huh?

37
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,833
Uh...

Oh!

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,083
Are you the school
psychologist they just hired?

40
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,250
What is it?

41
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,416
Did my teachers say
I'm acting strange?

42
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,625
You've got it wrong.

43
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,166
I know this place
is kinda far away.

44
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,333
But it's quiet.

45
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,125
And I can be alone
with my thoughts here.

46
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:28,500
It honestly helps me study.
I swear!

47
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,250
Not that I always
do great on tests,

48
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,583
but I'm working very
hard to get better.

49
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,083
Ah! It's getting late.
I need to go home now.
