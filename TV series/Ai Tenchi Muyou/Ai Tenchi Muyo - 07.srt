1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,083
[KINOJO]
This is impossible!

2
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,666
Gravitational anomalies
this huge don't just appear

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,375
without warning.

4
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,125
Communications are disrupted.

5
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:26,000
How could everything
go wrong all at once?

6
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,166
Beni!

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,333
Princess!
You need to get outta here!

8
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,041
Do you remember
how the controls work?

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:33,291
Yes, I do!
But I won't go alone!

10
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,708
I'm sorry.
But you have to this time.

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,791
I'll follow you soon.

12
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:39,500
Beni, no!
You have to go with me!

13
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,583
Be well, your royal highness.

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,625
[YOUNG MOMO]
Beni!

15
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:46,083
[YOUNG MOMO]
Beni!

16
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,916
Oh, dear.
Now I've gone and done it.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,666
I mean, really.
Why now of all times?

18
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:57,875
[TENCHI]
Excuse me! Is anyone in there?

19
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,083
[HACHIKO] Who are you
and what do you want?

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,791
You're both unknown to me!

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,250
You could be in
the service of monsters!

22
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,291
Inukai, hold on for a moment.

23
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,333
Tamaomi, have you
seen these two before?

24
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,208
I have no memory of them.

25
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,791
One may assume they are
not humans of our village.

26
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,291
[SARYU]
In that case, why should we not

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,625
drive you away from our gates?

28
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,791
We mean you no harm.
Trust me on that.

29
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,750
We're simply
looking for someone.

30
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:24,333
Oh, really? What is your
true relationship to this girl?

31
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,791
Her father? Her brother?
Or perhaps...

32
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:27,916
Her kidnapper!

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,958
You've got it wrong!

34
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,500
He's not kidnapping me!
He saved me!

35
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:32,958
When I was falling
to the ground,

36
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,708
he caught my butt with his face!

37
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:37,250
Excuse me? He did what?

38
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,916
Hey, could you
find some better way

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,916
of saying that?

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,958
Huh?

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,166
Let's try this direction.

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,208
Okay!

43
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,166
Why are you all following me?

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,125
We have important
business in this direction,

45
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,000
as well.

46
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,291
Reports indicate there have been

47
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,833
several monster
sightings in the area.

48
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,583
Really?

49
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,083
Oh, yes.

50
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,666
People have seen a beast
that rips through the sky,

51
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,333
firing arrows of light.

52
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:13,000
A creature that lays
waste to whole villages!

53
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,583
What?

54
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,125
[SARYU]
At last, we've found you!

55
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,916
You're the monster, aren't you?

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,250
Ryoko? What are you
doing in this place?

57
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,041
You mean you know this girl?

58
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,208
Well, whoever you are,
I've never seen you before.

59
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,375
But if you know my name,
you're after the bounty.

60
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,625
That's fine.
I was getting bored anyway.

61
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,375
I might as well kill some
time with you, sweet-cheeks.

62
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,041
It might be amusing for a while.

63
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,375
It'll beat hangin' with these
huckleberries, that's for sure.

64
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,041
No more of your insults!

65
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,583
[RYOKO]
Oh.

66
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,166
So you've decided
you're strong enough

67
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,375
to play with me?

68
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,583
Here you go!

69
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,041
[SARYU, FUEYAMA scream]

70
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,125
This won't end well.

71
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,500
Her power exceeds
all expectations.

72
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,333
Wanna keep playin'?

73
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,583
Stop it!

74

[RYOKO groans]

77
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,875
I admit, that was
surprising, young lady.

78
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,458
Turns out you had some hidden
talents I wasn't aware of.

79

[YOUNG MOMO gasps]

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,250
Ryoko, she's a little girl!
Just stop this!

[MIHOSHI]
Don't move, Space Pirate Ryoko!

85
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,791
This is the Galaxy Police!
