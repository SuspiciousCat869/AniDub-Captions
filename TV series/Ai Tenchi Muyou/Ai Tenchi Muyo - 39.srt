00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,333
[REPORTER A] Mr. Tenchi,
are these reports true?

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,458
[overlapping chatter]

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,250
[KURIHARA] I'm sure you know
why you've been called in

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,500
to see me.

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:25,000
Actually...

6
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,833
Can I tell you what's been
going on here, please? I--Ow!

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,500
[KURIHARA]
The photographs are the proof!

8
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,333
How can you possibly
defend these actions?

9
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,125
The photographs are clear,
but the headlines

10
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,541
are not telling the truth!

11
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,166
[KURIHARA] Whether the article
tells the truth or not

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,666
is irrelevant!

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,291
The problem is this scandal
should never have occurred!

14
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,500
I warned you not
to be too touchy-feely

15
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,625
with the students!

16
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,666
I'm so sorry.

17
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,541
[MOMO]
Let me in!

18
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,291
Please! It's Momo Kawanagare!

19
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,916
We're busy now.
Come back later.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,208
[MOMO] It's about the matter
in the school newspaper.

21
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,000
I believe this discussion
concerns me as well.

22
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,000
You should be aware
that in this photo,

23
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,500
the student's face
can't be seen,

24
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,791
so she can't be
officially identified.

25
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,708
The school has no
intention of punishing you.

26
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,000
But if you walk through that
door, you'll become part 

27
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,375
of this scandal.

28
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,916
The school will have no
choice but to deal with you

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,333
for your involvement.

30
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,333
Don't do it! Don't get involved!

31
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:16,708
I'm coming in!

32
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:22,375
I won't deny it. The student
in that photograph is me!

33
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,833
Mr. Tenchi.

34
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,041
When they took that photo,
had we done anything wrong?

35
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,250
Absolutely not!

36
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,416
Then why not be completely
open about it?

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,666
[KURIHARA]
Very bold!

38
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,541
Since you admit
it's you in the photo,

39
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,166
the school will have
no choice but to take

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,750
some sort of action.

41
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:40,291
For the record, can you
explain what is taking place

42
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,375
in these photos?

43
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,125
And don't try to pass
it off as just an accident!

44
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,000
That answer won't be sufficient!

45
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,208
All right.

46
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,958
What we did was
definitely not an accident.

47
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,500
But if you ask me,
that's not even the point.

48
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,416
Tell me something.
What did we actually do wrong?

49
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,333
What did you do wrong? Ha!

50
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,583
We've got a student and
a teacher in a classroom,

51
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,791
and they're embracing!

52
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,875
[MOMO] And what's
the problem with that?

53
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,041
That picture reflects
what truly happened there,

54
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,208
and I don't think
it's against any rules.

55
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,416
It was nothing more
than a friendly hug!

56
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,708
[KURIHARA laughing]

57
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,083
All right, then.

58
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,666
Let's just see how well
your reasoning holds up.

59
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,583
We'll put this matter on hold,

60
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,750
and see if the majority
of the student body agrees

61
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,666
with you during
the upcoming election.

62
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,208
Think they'll keep
you in office?

63
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,500
If that's the outcome, we'll
just make this little matter

64
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,708
go away.

65
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,750
[REPORTER A]
Did you find them?

66
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:32,750
[REPORTER B]
They're not in the gym.

67
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,875
[REPORTER A]
Try the cafeteria.

68
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,333
[TENCHI sighs]

69
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,583
You know something? You were
pretty amazing back there.

70
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,041
I knew that nobody
would ever be able

71
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,916
to accept that picture
as a complete accident.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,166
So I took responsibility
and owned it.

73
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,041
But I can't begin to tell
you how scared I was.

74
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,708
I bet.

75
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,375
If I wasn't running for
Student Council President again,

76
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,666
this wouldn't have happened.

77
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,458
But you're running
for all the right reasons.

78
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,000
You care about each
and every student here

79
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,250
at the school.

80
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,333
So try not to let this
silly thing bother you.

81
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,333
I do care, but that's not all.

82
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,833
I also want to be
a homing beacon.

83
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,416
I wanna be in a place where
I can shine so brightly

84
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,125
that anybody,
no matter how far away,

85
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,208
would be able to find me
and know that I'm right here.

86
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,291
Does that sound
really stupid to you?

87
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,791
[TENCHI]
Not at all.

88
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,583
There's nothing wrong with
striving to make that happen.

89
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,625
And you know?

90
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,208
I have a feeling that someone
may have found you already

91
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,833
and you just don't know it yet.

92
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,708
That's really kind
of you to say that,

93
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,833
and it gives me
hope and courage.

94
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay!

95
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,541
I'm gonna do my best
to win the debate!

96
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:35,625
Great!
