1
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,041
[TENCHI]
How did you get here?

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,833
[MOMO]
I kept chasing after you...

3
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,125
...but I couldn't catch you.

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,375
My memory was
starting to get foggy.

5
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,875
I was beginning to
forget where I'd been.

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,875
Little by little,
everything was slipping away.

7
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,125
It was strange.

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,500
I thought I might just
disappear completely.

9
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,958
But then,

10
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,583
when I gripped this sword,
I felt stronger.

11
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,583
And somehow,
I was able to reach you.

12
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,833
Glad it worked.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,958
[MOMO]
Mr. Tenchi?

14
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,375
What is it, Momo?

15
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,458
During all that
jumping around in time,

16
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,875
I was chasing after you,

17
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,791
but were you trying
to find me, too?

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,375
Yeah, I didn't know what to do,
so I looked all over for you.

19
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,958
I wanted to swoop in
like a knight

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,333
and come to your rescue,
but that didn't work out.

21
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,583
[MOMO]
It's okay.

22
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,375
Even though you
couldn't help me,

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,125
seeing how hard you tried
made me really happy.

24
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,291
Well for now,
we've gotta figure out

25
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,750
how we're gonna get back.

26
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,583
Maybe if we combined
our powers again...

27
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,583
Mr. Tenchi?

28
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,125
[TENCHI]
Hm?

29
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:15,208
When you arrived here, your
first day as a student teacher.

30
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,833
Do you still remember it?

31
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,416
Yeah. Maybe not the
best first day ever.

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,708
Some people gave me
a pretty rough time.

33
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,750
However, despite
everything that happened,

34
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm still glad I was able
to have the experience.

35
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,916
[MOMO laughs]

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,791
Your experience just
made me remember something.

37
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,000
From way back when
I was a little girl.

38
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,708
You knew me and Beni
in the past,

39
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,416
didn't you, Mr. Tenchi?

40
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,708
That's who you're really
trying to help, isn't it?

41
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,958
[TENCHI]
Uh...

42
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,458
[MOMO] If everything
goes back to the way

43
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:42,583
it's supposed to be,

44
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,833
then I won't be
who I am now, will I?

45
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,083
Well... It's all right.

46
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,708
Pretty much what I thought.

47
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,625
The power output is slowing?

48
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,625
How much does
the ship have left?

49
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,291
[MOMO]
We're out of time.

50
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,500
I wanted to stay
a little longer,

51
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,041
but it looks like I can't.

52
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,000
I could still try
to use my power!

53
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:19,541
[MOMO]
It's too late. I'm fading.

54
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,875
Yet, even though
I'm about to disappear,

55
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm so happy I got
to meet everyone,

56
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,166
especially you, Mr. Tenchi.

57
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,375
And you, as well.

58
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,875
[MOMO crying]

59
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,458
[MOMO]
Mr. Tenchi!

60
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll miss you!

61
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,291
There's a lost little girl
who's waiting for you.

62
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,500
Go find her!

63
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,500
And please don't forget me!

64
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,625
Momo!

65
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,333
I'll see you, someday.

66
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,250
[TENCHI]
Momo!

67
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,000
That nice lady was right,
you're here.

68
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,250
What lady was that?

69
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,250
I don't know.
I was lost and she said to wait.

70
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,208
She said someone would find me
and help me get home.

71
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,583
Welcome back.

72
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,458
Sorry it took so long.

73
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,750
Let's get you home.

74
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,666
Okay!

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,083
Momo!

76
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,708
Beni!

77
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,916
[laughing]

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,125
You're back!

79
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,208
--[RYOKO] Tenchi!
--[TENCHI yells]

80
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,791
I was so worried about you!

81
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,291
Sorry I scared ya.

82
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,166
So. Ready to head back home?

83
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,541
Yeah!
