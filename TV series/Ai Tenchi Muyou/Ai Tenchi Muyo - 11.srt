[TENCHI]
Huh?

C'mon, Hachiko!
You've gotta pull it together!

00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,958
I don't want to!

[KINOJO] If I hadn't injured
myself, I could finish him now!

13
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,708
I'm the one you want,
Scrap Metal!

When did you grow a pair?

Hey, shut up!

16
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,083
My weapon will defend
me against him.

17
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,416
I'm not afraid.

00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,333
[AOI] Do you really think
we should be stealing

34
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,791
all this stuff, Fuka?

35
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm Club President;
we're not stealing!

36
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,416

They're gonna crash.

Girls are always so helpless.

I think you'd better
take that back.

Listen, you both
were very brave today.
