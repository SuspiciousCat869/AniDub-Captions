Here goes! Ha!

00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,125
Ha!

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,791
All right, Momo, it's time!

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,333
Be careful not to pick
on him too much, Saryu!

7
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,500
This really isn't
picking on him.

8
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,291
It's punishment! Mm-hmm!

[AOI]
At this rate,

10
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,750
Goriki will be blown

Kinojo, hold up!

This is something that Aoi
and I have to take care of.

00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,166
What?!

15
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,541
To us, the treasure down there

16
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,291
is nothing more than a bunch
of disposable objects.

17
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:59,125
But to you, I think it's much
more important than that.

[KINOJO gasps]

19
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,875
Look how many
helpers you have here.

20
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:04,666
You'd be foolish to let a
chance like this pass you by.

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,875
You stay here.

22
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,666
Okay, Rui, let's go.

23
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,000
It's time for us to finally
show the Student Council

24
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,875
what the Science Club
is made of!

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:13,833
Right!

26
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:14,916
[RYOKO]
Hold on.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,416
[AOI, FUKA]
Huh?

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,000
We just need to hold them back
for a little while, right?

29
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:20,791
That sounds like a lot
more fun than digging

30
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,000
a stupid hole.

31
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,041
If they're trying
to mess with our Tenchi,

32
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,041
that makes them
our enemies, too.

33
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,166
"Enemies" might be
overstating it a little.

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,166
With 95% probability,

35
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,458
it looks like Tenchi and
Sasami are underneath us

36
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:34,875
right about here.

37
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:36,708
There should be some
stairs in this vicinity--

[BOTH scream]

39
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,416
We've gotta meet up with
Momo and Fueyama, quickly!

40
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,791
[SARYU] There's a stairwell
around the corner.

41
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,791
I can't let you use
the stairs, ladies.

42
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,916
Then you're going down!

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,083
Hm! So bring it on.

44
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,625
[SASAMI]
All right.

45
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,166
Tell us more about
this treasure.

46
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,625
What is it, anyway?

47
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,583
We don't know. That's why
we just call it "treasure."

48
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,708
If we keep digging
down here at random,

49
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:09,666
I know we're gonna
find it eventually.

50

[TENCHI]
Mmm...

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,708
Can you narrow it
down a little?!

You're stronger than
I thought you'd be.

Love strengthens me!

56

Hold it right there, old woman!

57
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,500
You're not fighting very fair.

58
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,333
You called me an old woman!

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,625
I was going to try
and deal with you gently,

60
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,791
but that crack was
way over the line!

Are you in one piece?

What in the world?!

66
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,250
I thought you would be more
of a gentleman with me

67
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,458
because you're attracted
to women with nice butts.

68
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,916
[TENCHI]
Hey, that's not true!

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,333
And now I have the proof

70
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,625
that you can't be trusted
to uphold a lady's honor!

[TENCHI]
Huh?

on the beach with Sasami?!
