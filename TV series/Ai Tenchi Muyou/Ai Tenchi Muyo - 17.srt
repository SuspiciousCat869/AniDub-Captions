1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,041
[SARYU] Here we are,
back for another year!

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,958
By and for school girls!

3
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,458
The Miss Junai Competition!

4
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,291
I'm your host, Hana Saryu!

5
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,750
I'm your show commentator,
Tori Fueyama!

6
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,500
Here's our first contestant!

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,583
Our Student Council President,
Momo Kawanagare!

8
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,541
I hope everyone's having fun!

9
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,250
That's the point
of this festival!

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,375
Momo's scoring well, showing
us the beauty of having fun!

11
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:41,916
And she's scoring for wearing
that cute peachy mascot outfit.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,166
--Looking good!
--[SARYU] Right!

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,250
Let's see if the
judges agree with you.

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,416
[FUKA]
Hmph.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,208
Audience score, five hundred.

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,583
What a bunch of jerks!

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,791
[SARYU]
10, 12, 15, 8, 11!

18
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:54,541
Total score, 56!

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,041
That's really setting
the bar high

20
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:57,791
for the rest of
our contestants.

21
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,250
[FUEYAMA]
And the audience is just loving

22
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:02,041
her whimsical and carefree
display of joy and love!

23
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,875
[MOMO laughing]

24
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:07,416
Have a peachy-cool
Cultural Festival, everybody!

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,041
Our next contestant is the
Student Council's lethal weapon,

26
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,166
Hachiko!

27
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,375
She's here in costume,

28
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,958
straight from her
starring performance in

29
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,416
"Beauty and the Prince"!

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,250
--[HACHIKO] Hmph.
--[AUDIENCE cheering]

31
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,250
[FUKA growls]
1,200 points from the audience?

32
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,166
What's so special?

33
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,750
She was super cool in that role!

34
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,416
Quit praising the enemy!

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,250
And you, go get changed!

36
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,916
Without her,
the play would've bombed!

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,916
Up next, the least
notable threesome,

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,833
straight from the Science Club!

39
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:35,083
Hold on!

40
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:37,041
Why aren't we being
announced separately?

41
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,125
Sorry 'bout that.
It's a tight schedule.

42
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,708
The girl in the blah
swimsuit is Yuki Fuka.

43
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,291
[FUEYAMA] That suit doesn't
flatter her curves,

44
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,875
if she has any.

45
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,250
[SARYU] The one in the workout
clothes and boots is Rui Aoi.

46
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,875
[FUEYAMA] Boy, it must be quite
a challenge to do a spin-cycle

47
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,625
in those knee-high boots!

48
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:55,083
[SARYU] And sporting a
stowaway-meets-pirate motif

49
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,416
is Beni Kinojo.

50
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,791
[FUEYAMA]
Terrific outfit for her,

51
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,125
but watch out for that club!

52
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,791
I'm not sure
how to score them.

53
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,041
Their presentation lacks
personality and charm.

54
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,250
That's enough already!

55
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,916
Why don't you just
let the judges decide?

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,458
[SARYU]
Their composite score is...

57
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,375
[FUEYAMA]
94, and divided by three is

58
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:12,583
--31.333333...
--[FUKA] You're crazy!

59
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,041
There's no way
we scored that badly!

60
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,125
My calculations put us
closer to 120 points each!

61
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,416
[KURIHARA] Knock it off,
you sore losers!

62
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,125
Check out this design!

63
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,041
[SARYU] Our school's voluptuous
principal, Ms. Kurihara!

64
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,791
[FUEYAMA] Flaunting a
generous display of skin

65
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,375
in a skimpy and
very revealing look!

66
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:31,541
This isn't fair!

67
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,875
You're competing against
your own students!

68
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:34,875
[KURIHARA]
Hmph!

69
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:35,750
What the...?

70
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,000
She sure doesn't look that good

71
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,750
when she's giving
Master Tenchi a hard time!

72
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,916
He might give her a hard time
when he sees that outfit.

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,250
[SARYU]
The judges have decided!

74
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a runaway lead!

75
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,125
And now, the final contestant!

76
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,791
Our student teacher,
Mr. Tenchi Masaki!

77
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,458
[gasping]

78
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,375
[KURIHARA]
Huh?

79
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:57,416
[AUDIENCE whispering]

80
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,333
5,000! 7,000! No, 10,000! Gah!

81
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,291
[KURIHARA] I thought he'd
make a fool of himself,

82
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,166
but instead he pulled it off.

83
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,250
It's been a long time
finding a prey worth breaking!

84
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,250
I'm gonna enjoy this!

85
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,583
--He.. just won.
--Just won.

86
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,625
I call Mr. Tenchi... winner!

87
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,625
Nobody has scored so high in
all the years of this contest!

88
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,208
As a woman, he rocks!

89
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,583
[MOMO]
Congratulations on your victory!

90
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,958
[TENCHI laughs]

91
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,916
You did pretty well
yourself, Momo!

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,250
It was a fun contest filled
with so many surprises!

93
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,125
Yeah.

94
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,166
[MOMO]
I'm off to wash up.

95
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,166
You should probably
do that, too!

96
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,458
[SARYU giggles]
