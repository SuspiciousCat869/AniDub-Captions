1
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:15,500
[RYOKO]
I gotta tell ya,

2
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,791
that was a hell
of an experience.

3
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,916
[AYEKA]
Who would have ever thought?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,166
[RYOKO]
Huh?

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,875
That a ship from Jurai
could have been buried

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,541
underneath the school
for all this time,

7
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,333
and nobody knew it.

8
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,375
[RYOKO] If the ship's start-up
sequence had been completed,

9
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,208
we'd all have gotten swept
up and be lost in space now!

10
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,875
[AYEKA]
That was a close call, for sure.

11
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,500
Lucky for us it was out of fuel.

12
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,791
So what in the
world do we do next?

13
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,750
We finally find the Jurai
sword and the earth

14
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,583
swallows it up and
we lose track of it.

15
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,958
[AYEKA gasps]

16
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,666
[RYOKO] I'm sure Tenchi will
come up with something.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,375
Why haven't you guys gone back
to your own dorm rooms yet?

18
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,166
There's still a chance the
Science Club will kidnap you.

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,250
Seems to be about an 80% chance.

20
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:56,541
We decided it would be safer
for us to stay here tonight.

21
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,833
I'm not sure about that.

22
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,458
Time to get under the
covers with Mr. Tenchi!

23
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,791
[grunts]

24
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,000
It's time for you children
to run along home now.

25
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,125
Uh... Whatever you say, Ayeka.

26
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,500
I thought that maybe
I would make

27
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,000
a scrumptious dinner
for all of you

28
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:14,041
as a way of saying
thanks for saving us.

29
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,791
I may not look the part,
but I am an excellent cook!

30
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,583
[RYOKO]
Oh, yeah?

31
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,000
Is that supposed to be
some sort of a challenge?

32
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,125
Ryoko!

33
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,750
I thought we talked
about the nudity!

34
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,208
We don't have anything to hide
from each other, do we?

35
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,125
Don't you see that people
are going to take this

36
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,583
the wrong way?

37
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,875
The challenge is on!

38
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,166
You and I will have
a cook-off battle.

39
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,833
This is one battle
I can't let you fight.

40
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,125
The best home cooking
for Mr. Tenchi wins!

41
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,750
I can do it, I'm sure!

42
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,625
Oh, this is gonna be good!

43
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,833
[FUKA]
We're very sorry.

44
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,416
Things just went
terribly wrong today

45
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,708
and we lost the key.

46
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,208
[WASHU]
Oh, that's okay.

47
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,416
[FUKA, AOI]
Huh?

48
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,250
You mean you're
not upset at us for this?

49
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,791
[WASHU]
Not so much.

50
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,291
I mean, it's good enough
for me to know

51
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,750
that the key and the
treasure are really there.

52
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,125
Now you just have to
go dig them back up.

53
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,875
But the big cavern they're in
is completely destroyed!

54
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:06,541
And we don't have any money
left to pay for anything!

55
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:08,083
[WASHU]
What're you talking about?

56
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:10,958
If you give up,
the game's already over!

57
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,375
[AOI, FUKA, GORIKI]
Huh?

58
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,833
[WASHU] If you've got no funds,
then go and gather some!

59
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,583
If you have no help,
then go and demand some!

60
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,791
How do we do that?

61
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,583
[WASHU]
Through an election, of course.

62
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,250
All you have to do is run
for Student Council President,

63
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,458
and take over the school.
It's easy!

64
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,875
Oh. That sounds
like a great plan!

65
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,166
[WASHU] Go out there and
give it your best shot.

66
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,208
Remember, the gods of victory
favor those who keep trying!

67
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,583
[AOI]
We can do this!

68
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,458
Let the cooking battle begin!

69
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,375
[TENCHI] You never know,
we might get a great meal

70
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,291
out of this!

71
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,166
I wouldn't bet on that.

72
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,875
By the way, if that
sword's the final key,

73
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,333
does that mean those two are...?

74
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,583
[TENCHI]
Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:51,750
I don't think there's
any doubt about that.

76
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,166
So when do you think
we should tell them

77
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,125
the truth?

78
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not sure.

79
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,958
I was considering
not telling them

80
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,291
and seeing what happens.

81
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,458
What?

82
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,541
But if you do, Washu's gonna--

83
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,041
I know, you're right.

84
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,750
It's just that... I have a real
funny feeling about this.

85
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,625
[timer beeping]

86
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,458
This is the bath that
Sasami was sitting in, ahh.

87
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,333
[MIHOSHI] You're right,
that voice absolutely belongs

88
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,875
to Washu.

89
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,666
[KURIHARA] That's quite the
big catch we've stumbled upon.

90
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,000
And to think those girls were
the source of the singularity.

91
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,833
We've found both the
proof and the culprit

92
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,000
behind the space time warp.

93
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,166
Mihoshi, You've done great work.

94
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,041
[MIHOSHI laughs]
Why, thank you!

95
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:36,291
[KURIHARA] I'll report this to
Galaxy Police Headquarters.

96
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,208
You stay where you are and
keep up the investigation.

97
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,375
[MIHOSHI]
Roger that!
