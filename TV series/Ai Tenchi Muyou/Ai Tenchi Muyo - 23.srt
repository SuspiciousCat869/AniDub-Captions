1
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,666
The South...

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,750
Colombia!

3
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,166
[TENCHI]
Correct!

4
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,083
Colombia is the South American
country that connects

5
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,791
the seven countries of
Central America via Panama!

6
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:35,208
I knew that! My palm froze!

7
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,458
--[TENCHI] White Team wins!
--[GIRLS cheering]

8
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:39,375
So we lost the tiebreaker.

9
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,250
Knock it off! No way that
was a legit tiebreaker!

10
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,416
[TENCHI] You need to concede.
Your team lost.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,333
[FUKA] No way! Whoever heard of
Sports Day ending with a quiz?!

12
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,708
It's not even close
to an actual sport!

13
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,375
Close enough to let us go home.

14
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,708
Are you nuts? You think
I'm just gonna concede?

15
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,041
This means everything!

16
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,583
She's right about that.

17
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,750
We're not trying to make your
life difficult, Mr. Masaki,

18
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:01,083
but we just need to win so
we'll have extra resources

19
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,958
and funding to go
after the treasure.

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,458
--[TENCHI] Treasure?
--[FUKA] Rui!

21
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,666
Are you talking about
what's supposedly hidden--

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,000
Forget what you
just heard, Mr. Masaki.

23
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,625
Right now we need
to set it straight

24
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,333
as to whether a quiz
can be regarded

25
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,291
as a proper Sports Day event.

26
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,666
You raise a good question
and we as Student Council

27
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,833
will look into it.

28
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,666
Council President Momo
will mull it over

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,250
and come up with
an answer for you.

30
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,625
This could be the first
time we agree on something.

31
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,375
I think the odds
of that happening

32
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:26,625
are highly unlikely.

33
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,708
If your win is voided
because the tiebreaker

34
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,666
was illegal, I hope you don't
run away crying again.

35
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,500
I'm not running anywhere
except after you, Fuka!

36
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,291
Now don't let her
push your buttons.

37
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,166
She's upset about the quiz
and is taking it out on you.

38
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,208
Have you finished
mulling yet, Momo?

39
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,000
[MOMO]
Mmm...

40
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,708
Let's do some more overtime!

41
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:45,916
Do I have a vote here?!

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,666
The President has
ruled in your favor.

43
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,041
It's your turn to choose
the new tiebreaker.

44
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,250
Well, this better
not be fake news.

45
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,916
Or I won't vote for you again!

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,416
I choose an eating contest!

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,708
That is not a legitimate
Sports Day Event either!

48
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:58,833
Ahh!

49
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,625
[TENCHI sighs]

50
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:03,083
[MOMO]
There you are!

51
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you tired, Mr. Tenchi?

52
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,625
[TENCHI]
Totally exhausted.

53
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:09,375
I wasn't expecting Sports Day
to go on past midnight,

54
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,083
but the eating contest
will break the tie

55
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,416
and I can go home
and just soak in my tub.

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,416
About that... There's a problem.

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,583
It's become a food fight!

58
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,416
[RYOKO]
Keep it comin'!

59
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,458
Ha!

60
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,458
[FUKA]
Hmm...

61
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,666
[SARYU chuckles]

62
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,958
You girls never tire out.
How do ya do it?

63
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,000
Huh?

64
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,833
I could break the tie if we
just had a sleeping contest.

65
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,208
[MOMO] Beni, let's finish
the Bun Battle.

66
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,083
[TENCHI]
Huh?

67
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,125
Oh, don't do that.

68
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,958
I'm in enough trouble as it is!

69
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,375
[RYOKO laughs]

70
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,250
Well now, what a cozy couple!

71
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,708
[TENCHI]
I-It's not what you think!

72
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,166
How do you know what I think?

73
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,708
You're too busy
with the younger girls

74
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,375
to give a thought to me!

75
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,708
So...

76
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,333
[TENCHI] Just relax!
Nothing's going on here!

77
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,875
[RYOKO]
Oh, save your breath!

78
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,583
[TENCHI screams]

79
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,708
[TENCHI groaning]

80
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,291
[TENCHI]
Ow! Take it easy!

81
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,291
Sounds like your body
aches all over.

82
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,416
That's because Ryoko can
really pack a mean punch!

83
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,958
That reminds me,

84
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,125
you'll be starting the dorm
monitoring job tomorrow, right?

85
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,583
[TENCHI]
Yeah, I almost forgot.

86
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,583
Well, the Student Council
passed a very strict

87
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,958
new rule that you
need to be aware of.

88
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,125
They say the dorm
is now off-limits to men,

89
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,708
and any man who dares to come in

90
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,666
may not leave in the same
shape as when he entered!

91
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,375
What?!

92
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,000
But don't worry about it.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

93
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,083
Bye-bye!

94
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,500
[TENCHI]
Hey, hang on a minute!

95
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,541
[SASAMI giggles]

96
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,208
Crud. I suspect my new
school colors are gonna be

97
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,541
black and blue!

98
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:38,708
[groans]

99
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,041
