1
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,291
No matter how much chaos
goes on around here

2
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,458
during the day, everyone
pretty much goes to sleep

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,416
on time.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,458
Huh?

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,791
What are you doing up?
It's after eleven! Huh?

6
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:31,708
[FUKA] You discovered
our secret, did you?

7
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:33,458
[TENCHI gasps]

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,708
[FUKA]
You're eating already?

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,708
It hasn't even been
three minutes yet!

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,375
Sorry, I was so hungry,
I just couldn't wait!

11
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,666
Why did you bother
cooking it at all?

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,000
Mr. Masaki.

13
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:44,958
Since you accepted our
bribe of a bowl of ramen,

14
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,166
you'll keep quiet
about this, right?

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,958
The rules say we're not
supposed to be cooking

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,833
anything after 10 pm!

17
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,666
[TENCHI]
You two are impossible.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,291
But I guess making
a bowl of ramen

19
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,291
doesn't really
qualify as cooking.

20
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,250
It falls more into
the snack category.

21
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,625
--[robot ringing]
--[TENCHI] Huh? [gasps]

22
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,166
[FUKA] Mm-hmm.
That's the three-minute bell.

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,208
Voilà! Time to dig in!

24
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,875
That's a pretty handy
robot you created there.

25
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,000
Tell me something.

26
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,458
What kind of power
source does it use?

27
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:11,291
Don't know.

28
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,291
Seriously?

29
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:13,625
[FUKA]
I drafted the basic plans,

30
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,625
but to tell you the truth,
I'm not too clear

31
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,958
on what makes it go.

32
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,416
[TENCHI] You just assembled it,
pushed a button,

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,416
and it started moving?

34
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,583
[FUKA]
Pretty much, yeah.

35
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,458
[TENCHI] That's actually
a little alarming.

36
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,166
But you could do so
much with those skills.

37
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,833
Just think, you could use
your talents to help people

38
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,541
instead of causing
chaos and trouble

39
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:31,708
everywhere you go.

40
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,833
Don't sit there and
accuse us like that!

41
00:01:33,916 --> 00:01:36,041
Our work does help people,
Mr. Know-It-All!

42
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,125
We're in the midst
of reforming society!

43
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,458
I beg your pardon?

44
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,500
That's right! We're about to--

45
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,375
You're spitting food
all over yourself!

46
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,000
[AOI]
Hm? Sorry about that!

47
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,333
[chewing]

48
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,833
It's kind of a crusade,

49
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,375
but we're really
committed to it.

50
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,583
First, we're going to end
the Student Council's tyranny!

51
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:54,916
[TENCHI]
Tyranny?

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,250
[FUKA] They think they
can do whatever they want

53
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,791
because they control the
budgets for all the clubs!

54
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:00,083
[AOI] But that doesn't
give them the power

55
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,791
to control people's behavior.

56
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:03,583
Take Kinojo, for instance.

57
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,208
What's so different
about Kinojo?

58
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,291
Aren't you all members
of the Science Club?

59
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,833
You're mistaken, Mr. Tenchi.

60
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,791
Kinojo doesn't belong
to any club.

61
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,166
What? Are you serious?

62
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,375
To tell you the honest truth,

63
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,375
we have no idea what
that girl's even up to

64
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,708
most of the time.

65
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,041
She showed up here one day,

66
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,125
but she doesn't know
much about herself, either.

67
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,625
[TENCHI]
Well, that's very unusual.

68
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,416
I don't get it. How can that be?

69
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,916
[AOI]
She has no memories of her past.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,625
[FUKA] It's not even clear
if Kinojo's her real name.

71
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,916
We give her some time alone,

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,208
hoping that she'll
have a breakthrough.

73
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,333
When everyone's in bed,
she's usually up on the roof,

74
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,375
thinking.

75
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,333
So, I'm confused.

76
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,208
Why is it you three
hang out together?

77
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,541
It's not like we're besties
or anything like that.

78
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,500
We've been helping
her search for something.

79
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:47,375
I wonder what it could
be she's looking for.

80
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,791
Is it possible...?

81
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,000
--[robot beeping]
--[GROUP] Huh?

82
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,416
--Is it...?
--It's close!

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,666
Close? What's close?

84
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,958
Don't make a sound!

85
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,208
Where is it?
Where is it? Underneath?

86
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,375
Rui, get ready!

87
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,000
What are we looki--?

88
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,166
[FUKA]
You help, too, Mr. Tenchi!

89
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,208
[TENCHI]
Wha--?

90
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,333
[FUKA]
This is so weird!

91
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:14,166
There's just nothing here!

92
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,500
Did Goriki get it wrong?

93
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,750
[FUKA]
Ugh!

94
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,458
There's nothing more
we can do tonight.

95
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,041
We'll run some tests
tomorrow to make sure

96
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,625
he's operating properly.

97
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:23,666
S'cuse me?

98
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,541
See you tomorrow, Mr. Tenchi.

99
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:26,583
Right.

100
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,083
This is a very
troublesome event.

101
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,291
As far as I know,
Goriki's treasure sensor

102
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,208
has never gone off
in the dorm before.

103
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,291
[FUKA]
Mm-hmm.

104
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,083
[FUKA]
Huh... It stopped working.

105
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,375
[TENCHI] What in the world
was that all about, I wonder?
