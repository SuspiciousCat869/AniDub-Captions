1
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,958
[FUKA]
No way! Absolutely no way!

2
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,208
But Yuki...

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,291
I won't leave!

4
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,625
I think they're all lying!

5
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,875
[MOMO] What are you
three doing out here?

6
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,500
[TENCHI]
Hurry and get in the helicopter!

7
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,458
A satellite's just
gonna fall out of space

8
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,458
and somehow manage
to land right here?

9
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,625
Oh, how convenient!

10
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,041
This is obviously a set-up!

11
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,375
Someone's trying to swoop
in and steal our treasure!

12
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,708
That is ridiculous.

13
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:45,833
This thing's a
government conspiracy!

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,250
She's overthinking this.

15
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,625
There's no conspiracy.
You're just tired.

16
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,500
[TROOPER A] Come quietly!
Nobody needs to get hurt!

17
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,500
[OPERATOR A] Dimension
Oscillator Bomb is on-target

18
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,083
and beginning its descent.

19
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,625
[KURIHARA]
Hm?

20
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, Ms. Kurihara.

21
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,500
We found the remaining students.
The campus is empty.

22
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,916
[KURIHARA]
Excellent. Arrest them!

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,625
[TROOPER A]
Ma'am!

24
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,791
What is this?!

25
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,500
What on Earth do you
think you're doing?

26
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,416
Playtime's over, Mr. Masaki.

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,458
Captain! Incoming message.

28
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:27,250
Dimension Oscillator Bomb
arrives in 45 minutes.

29
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:30,500
So you've been in disguise
before I even arrived!

30
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,791
Take them to the
bomb shelter, Officer.

31
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:33,916
Right away.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,583
I promise I'll explain
everything soon.

33
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,125
[TENCHI yells]

34
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:46,958
[TENCHI]
Ryoko!

35
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,125
Run for it, Tenchi!

36
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,125
None of these guys
are from planet Earth!

37
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,208
[MOMO, TENCHI panting]

38
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,083
I'm gonna spare
your life, Captain,

39
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,625
but only this one time.

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,500
[KURIHARA coughing]

41
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,083
How predictable.

42
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:11,791
Ryoko would use all that fire
power for a mere diversion.

43
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:12,833
Ah!

44
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,541
Captain! You weren't
injured, were you?

45
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,375
I'm fine. Just get the
wounded to the shelter.

46
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,458
What about the singularity?

47
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,041
Our targets could only
be going to one place.

48
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,083
[computer beeps]

49
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,500
Surveillance report!

50
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,750
Movement detected on
the roof of the structure!

51
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,875
What?!

52
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,000
[GP CHIEF]
Is it her?

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,666
Could be a decoy.

54
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,041
Quick, scan to verify!

55
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,041
Status of the Dimension
Oscillator Bomb?

56
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,208
It's entering
the atmosphere now.

57
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,000
Within the next hour,

58
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,166
the satellite will
crash in Japan.

59
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,083
[FEMALE REPORTER] The President
of the United States

60
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,166
has announced his
country will send aid

61
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,500
to the affected areas.

62
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,666
[OPERATOR A] Composite elements,
gravitational profile,

63
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,833
and brain waves are
all a perfect match!

64
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,625
This is Washu Hakubi!

65
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,833
I've been waiting for
this day a long time now.

66
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,125
You're finished.

67
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,416
The universe will no
longer be your plaything!

68
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,083
Your disruption ends here.

69
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,708
My SWAT teams are going
to bring you down!

70
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,291
You think you can just
waltz onto my playground

71
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,625
and take over?

72
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,833
You've got some nerve,
my friend.
