1
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,375
[TENCHI sighs]
Glad that's over.

2
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,458
[SARYU]
Hello!

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,166
Huh? Who's there?

4
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,666
Hey, what's wrong?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,416
Mr. Masaki, you're not wearing
your dress and make-up!

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,333
That's 'cause the
Culture Festival's over.

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,750
Do you need something?

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,541
Hey. If you're looking
for help with the cleanup,

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,625
I'm not available.
Classes are starting.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,625
I know that!

11
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,708
What I wanna know is
may I call you Miss, Mr. Masaki?

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:46,750
Uh, excuse me?

13
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:48,125
Not all the time. I mean...

14
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,833
Just when we're
alone doing girl talk.

15
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,583
What? I'm confused.

16
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,666
Also, Sports Day is coming up.

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,291
You'll need a kick-pleat skirt!

18
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,708
[TENCHI yelling]

19
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,083
[TENCHI] How do you
like these high kicks?

20
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:02,541
Pretty cool, huh?

21
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,041
[SARYU] I'll need every one
of those kicks in my fight

22
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,541
to retain my
Student Council seat!

23
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,041
Lead the cheers for me!

24
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,500
With you, my B.F.F.,

25
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,416
looking so cute in your
cheerleader outfit, I'll win!

26
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,500
--[SARYU] Hmm?
--[TENCHI] Uh... uh-uh, uh-uh.

27
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,375
I take it that's a no, then?

28
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,791
Yeah.

29
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,875
That was a one-time only
stunt for the Culture Festival.

30
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,708
[SARYU sighs]

31
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,291
Sorry, but I can't.

32
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,125
[SARYU]
Yeah, I get it.

33
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,666
Your beauty as a girl
has burned into my eyes.

34
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,375
I see you in that
dress over and over.

35
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,708
And the memory of your long hair
will be in my mind forever.

36
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,500
Actually, I'd rather
you erase that image

37
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,291
--[SARYU] I can't!
--as soon as possible.

38
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,208
I've already made this adult
erotic comic book of you!

39
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,208
You're kidding me, right?

40
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,958
I have the printing
press working overtime.

41
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,958
Everybody will get one!
They'll be out tomorrow!

42
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,041
[TENCHI]
Great...

43
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:51,416
[SARYU giggling]

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,375
[SARYU] I'll see you manana,
Miss Tenchi Masaki!

45
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,875
Yeah! Manana, I can't wait.

46
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:04,458
[RYOKO] You're quite the popular
lady these days, Miss Tenchi.

47
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,958
[TENCHI]
How did you all get in here?

48
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,041
[AYEKA] The back door was
open and we tippy-toed in

49
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,916
quietly so as to not
interrupt your conversation.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,708
From what I heard,
somebody has the hots for you.

51
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,083
Right?

52
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,291
I think it's great the
students have an open mind.

53
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,333
They've accepted you
totally as a girl!

54
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,000
You'll need my help again!

55
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,208
For Sports Day, we'll have
to girly you back up!

56
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,791
No, absolutely not!

57
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,708
I can't run around
with long hair in my eyes.

58
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,375
--What a shame.
--I'm the game referee!

59
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,833
--You're cute with long hair.
--[TENCHI] Ayeka!

60
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,500
--[RYOKO] Huh? What's this?
--[TENCHI] Give that back!

61
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,125
What are you hiding?

62
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:33,875
Huh?

63
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,041
[gasps]

64
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,083
[AYEKA]
Hey, I wanna see, too.

65
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,083
[RYOKO] This certainly leaves
nothing to the imagination!

66
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,958
It takes infatuation with Miss
Tenchi to a whole new level!

67
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,666
Hey! I wanna see the pictures!

68
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,958
[AYEKA]
Absolutely not!

69
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,583
You'll have to wait till
you're much older!

70
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:49,875
[SASAMI]
You're such a party poop!

71
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,541
[RYOKO] You might as
well doll it up, Tenchi.

72
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,833
When this comes out,

73
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,708
everyone will have
already seen up your skirt!

74
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,416
[TENCHI]
No way!

75
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,750
[FUKA]
Launch mode set!

76
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,416
[KINOJO growling]

77
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,583
We'll win big on Sports Day.
Nobody will defeat us!

78
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,041
[HACHIKO grunts]

79
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,958
[HACHIKO]
Certain victory is ours!

80
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,666
[KURIHARA laughs]

81
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,500
My prey is in my sights!
