00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,916
[SARYU] It's finally time
for the big debate.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,250
[FUEYAMA] Fuka's closed the gap
in the polls with her cheating.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,791
It's now dead even.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,458
[HACHIKO]
We have to stay focused.

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,875
[MOMO]
Mm-hmm!

6
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,083
[gasps] Mr. Tenchi!

7
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,125
I think it's about time
to go to our seats, girls.

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,750
Momo, you'll be wonderful.

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:30,833
Thanks!

10
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:35,375
[TENCHI] I can't really
take sides for this,

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,375
but, well, you know.

12
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,916
Thank you, Mr. Tenchi.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,375
It means a lot to me
that you feel that way.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,250
I appreciate your support.

15
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,250
Mr. Tenchi.

16
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,875
I have the weirdest feeling.

17
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,625
Like I've known you before.

18
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,416
Like these hands have
been protecting me.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,625
Not just now,
but for a long time.

20
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,416
Now! Time to win a debate!

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,958
[TENCHI]
Mmm!

22
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,416
[STUDENT A] The final debate for
the Student Council election

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
is about to begin!

24
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:07,833
[STUDENTS cheering, clapping]

25
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,333
When I'm elected as your
Student Council President,

26
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,916
I promise you this. First:

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,875
Free school lunches,
and I'll double the budgets

28
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,500
on all student activities!

29
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,291
You're gonna be rolling
in so much money,

30
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,833
you're not gonna believe it!

31
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,125
What?!

32
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,333
Of course, there's no way
to deliver on either

33
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,375
of those promises.

34
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,666
What a lot of hot air!

35
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,500
Well. More politics
as usual, I see.

36
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:31,291
What? Fuka's poll numbers
are climbing like crazy!

37
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,916
And that's not all, people.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,625
To protect the dignity
of this school,

39
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,875
I promise to stamp out this
kind of scandalous behavior!

40
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,208
It certainly appears that
the student in this photo

41
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,166
is Ms. Momo Kawanagare!

42
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,833
That's correct.

43
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:48,791
The student who appears
in that photograph is me!

44
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,875
[STUDENTS chattering]

45
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:53,291
Are you aware of what
you just said to everyone?

46
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,875
The person you're hugging
in that picture is a teacher.

47
00:01:55,958 --> 00:01:58,833
He's a student teacher,
but a teacher nonetheless.

48
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,666
--I'm well aware.
--You are?

49
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,125
There's something I don't
understand about all this.

50
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,000
Ms. Fuka here seems
to be suggesting

51
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,500
that this kind of behavior
should not be allowed.

52
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,041
For what possible reason
should that be prohibited?

53
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,291
It's so obvious!

54
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,458
One of the two is in
a position of authority!

55
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,666
Regardless, it's just
between two people.

56
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,125
Everybody knows that.

57
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:20,166
It's natural that two people
can develop feelings

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,458
for each other;
it's common sense!

59
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:27,291
Feelings of respect or trust,
friendship, distrust, hatred.

60
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,916
Or even... love!

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,250
[STUDENTS chattering]

62
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,333
I just cannot believe that
you would find it wrong

63
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,416
for someone to feel love
for someone else!

64
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,083
Cut the sappy nonsense!

65
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:40,000
Some relationships are just
completely unacceptable!

66
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,083
Maybe.

67
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,708
But people are
certainly responsible

68
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,250
for the things they say
and do in the name of love.

69
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,791
And yes, they can make
mistakes because of love.

70
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,291
But that's forgivable.

71
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,125
Love is the one true thing
that binds people together!

72
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,541
Love forms societies.

73
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,166
Love forms families.

74
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,583
It nurtures life.

75
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,500
Love is the root of everything!

76
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,000
So I'm not ashamed!

77
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,666
And no one can
make me feel ashamed

78
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,541
for embracing the power of love!

79
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,208
The truth of the matter is,

80
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:07,625
I do have special feelings
for another person.

81
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,458
And I'm proud of that!

82
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,791
[STUDENTS clapping]

00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:19,916
