00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,416
Huh? Hachiko?

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,333
[kissing noises]

4
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:28,416
What's going on?!

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,708
What have you done
to my pretty princess?!

6
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:34,166
[AUDIENCE chattering]

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,916
Why's Mr. Masaki in the play?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,166
Is he the ugly frog?

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,958
Oh! Mr. Tenchi,
we've been looking for you!

10
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,083
What a surprise!

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,625
He must've been
bored with patrol duty

12
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,000
and thought this would be fun.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,125
I wanted to play that part,
but they gave it to him!

14
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,250
So sorry.

15
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,958
I've gotta get away from here!

16
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,333
Wait! You forgot my kiss!

17
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,958
[kissing noises]

18
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,916
[TENCHI] I don't remember
being cast in that play!

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,041
[yells]

20
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,291
I thought I warned you about
getting too touchy-feely

21
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:05,000
with your students!

22
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:07,333
You were watching me
in the play?

23
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,583
I've got my eye
on you every minute!

24
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,875
Just like a security camera,
I see every move you make!

25
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,625
You will do what I want!

26
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,583
[TENCHI chuckles, chokes]

27
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,458
So now we need to get you ready
for the Miss Junai Contest.

28
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,041
Think I missed the entry window.

29
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,041
[KURIHARA] Not to worry,
I signed you up.

30
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,750
Can't wait to see you
strutting around in your dress!

31
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,416
[TENCHI grunting]

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,333
[AYEKA] You both can
leave after you finish up

33
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,625
these last stacks.

34
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,958
[AYEKA gasps, screams]

35
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,416
What are you doing
in my kitchen?

36
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:43,416
[GORIKI chattering]

37
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:49,000
[FUKA]
Ugh! I am so beat.

38
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,208
Gosh! Glad we're done with that.

39
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,291
Wonder if Goriki had any
problem with those dishes.

40
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,666
--[AOI] What's that?
--[FUKA] Huh?

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,166
[FUKA] There wasn't supposed
to be anything going on

42
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,333
in that space.

43
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:04,500
[RYOKO grunting]

44
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,291
[RYOKO]
Ha!

45
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,750
[KINOJO]
Ha!

46
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,500
[KINOJO]
Ha!

47
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:22,166
[CROWD cheers, claps]

48
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,291
Wow!

49
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,166
She made that into
something beautiful!

50
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,958
I doubt beauty was on her mind.

51
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:28,291
What are you trying to prove?

52
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,458
Who's stronger!

53
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,125
[FUKA] Who cares?
We have a beauty contest

54
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,458
starting any minute!

55
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:35,208
C'mon, you've gotta
get ready, and you too, Rui.

56
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,416
Okay.

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,291
I care!

58
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,166
I wanna prove I'm stronger!

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Besides, beauty shows are dull!

60
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,833
There, that looks about right.

61
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,791
[TENCHI]
What exactly do you mean?

62
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,833
[KURIHARA chuckles]

63
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,500
Take a look.

64
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,083
Now I've got to
get myself ready.

65
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,958
You'll have to do
the rest on your own.

66
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,375
[TENCHI]
Uh... That's me?!

67
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,708
[TENCHI yelling]

68
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,250
[SASAMI laughing]

69
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,625
You're actually gonna
be a beauty contestant?

70
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,916
Sasami, stop laughing
at Master Tenchi.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,416
He looks very pretty.

72
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,208
[AYEKA laughing]

73
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,208
[TENCHI]
Thanks, Ayeka.

74
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,250
[AYEKA]
I'm sorry!

75
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,750
Why not go for it?

76
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,916
We'll make you the
prettiest contestant ever!

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,458
[GIRLS chattering]

78
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,208
Here we are back
for another year!

79
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,458
By schoolgirls, for schoolgirls.

80
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,416
The Miss Junai Competition!

81
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,875
[TENCHI]
See you at the show, Ryoko.

82
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,458
[RYOKO]
Or not.

83
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,541
Huh?!

84
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,833
[RYOKO gasps]
