[GIRLS chattering]

2
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,333
Welcome to our
sweet shop, girls!

3
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,083
Oh, Master Tenchi!

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:26,000
[TENCHI] Just thought I'd drop
by to see how you're doing.

5
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:29,375
[TENCHI]
Oh!

6
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,916
[TENCHI]
This place is hoppin'!

7
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:37,916
[SASAMI] Get ready for
something special, girls!

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,750
[TENCHI]
Huh?

9
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,750
Tasty n' sweet!

10
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,625
A colorful treat!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,583
[GIRLS gasp]

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,875
Love the colors!

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,916
--They smell so good!
--I want all three!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,625
Everybody seems to
really love your shop!

15
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,750
[FUKA]
Check, please!

16
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,833
[AYEKA]
Uh-huh!

17
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,541
Thanks for stopping by,
Master Tenchi.

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,875
Ahh! That was amazing!

19
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,250
Glad you enjoyed it.

20
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:04,666
[gasps]

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,291
This has got to be a mistake!

22
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,833
It's the total for both of you.

23
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,958
Your friend said you'd be
paying for her sweets too.

24
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,291
Another one, please!

25
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,208
And keep 'em coming!

26
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:17,083
Stop eating right now!

27
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,250
I wish I could.

28
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:19,958
They're way too delicious.
I'm addicted!

29
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,833
I refuse to pay for all of them!

30
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,916
This bill is bull-hockey!

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,833
Speak to the
Complaint Department.

32
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,375
--Hey, Ryoko!
--[RYOKO] Yeah?

33
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,333
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

34
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,541
[FUKA]
You don't scare me!

35
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:32,833
She scares me!

36
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,666
These customers have
a complaint to lodge

37
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,250
about the size of their bill.

38
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,625
[RYOKO]
Yeah?

39
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,916
Step into my office!
I'm sure we can work this out!

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,083
Our mistake!
No need for violence!

41
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:43,708
We'll pay! Please forgive us!

42
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,416
They're making money
hand over fist!

43
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,125
--[MOMO] Mr. Tenchi?
--[TENCHI] Hm?

44
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,916
Are you on patrol duty, too?

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,791
[TENCHI]
Sort of.

46
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,875
Well, then.

47
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:52,708
Why don't we all
just patrol together?

48
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:53,708
Okay, girls?

49
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,291
Fine by me. No problem.

50
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,750
I'm gonna take a break. See ya!

51
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,041
I'm okay with it!

52
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,125
Didn't you wanna try the
stuff at the sweet shop?

53
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,083
[FUEYAMA] I wouldn't mind
taking a taste of everything,

54
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,916
especially Sasami.
She's so cute!

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,166
We're off to the sweet shop!
Enjoy your patrol!

56
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,416
[FUEYAMA]
Oh! I can hardly wait...

57
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,750
They're having a
wonderful time.

58
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,750
Yeah, this is my
idea of heaven!

59
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,625
It's due to your efforts
that this event

60
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:14,666
is such a success.

61
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,250
I don't deserve the credit.

62
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,416
It's thanks to
everyone's hard work.

63
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,708
You too, Mr. Tenchi.
You did a lot!

64
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,416
I really appreciate it!

65
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,583
It was nothing. I just hauled
some stuff in my backpack.

66
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,625
[HACHIKO]
Huh?

67
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,500
[HACHIKO]
That's what he calls nothing?

68
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,625
--[TENCHI] Hm?
--[MOMO] Huh?

69
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,208
I was just thinking.

70
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,666
Mistress Momo, I need to
go and work on my lines

71
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,541
for the play.

72
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,500
So soon?

73
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,583
Afraid so.

74
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,750
What play?

75
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,666
The one Hachiko's
been cast in as a member

76
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,916
of the Drama Club.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,500
They're performing it tonight.

78
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,250
It's called
"Beauty and the Prince."

79
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,750
Hachiko's been cast
as the prince.

80
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,500
I think she'll do a very
good job in that part.

81
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,208
You should come see
it with me, Mr. Tenchi.

82
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,291
[MOMO gasps]

83
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:02,583
[TENCHI]
Hm?

84
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,625
[WASHU chuckles]

85
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,833
That hair looks familiar.

86
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,250
[MOMO]
Sorry, Mr. Tenchi.

87
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,291
But did it really bother
you that much?

88
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,750
--[KURIHARA] Hey!
--[TENCHI grunts]

89
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,125
We encourage teachers
to be close to their students.

90
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,083
But you've taken it
a step too far!

91
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,791
[TENCHI] Won't happen
again, Miss Kurihara!

92
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,000
You can enter the
Miss Junai Contest

93
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,333
or be fired.

94
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,083
Those are your choices. Pick.

95
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,333
[MOMO]
Huh?

96
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,666
[RYOKO squeals]

97
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,041
Tenchi!
