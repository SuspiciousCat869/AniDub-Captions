1
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,208
--[TENCHI] Momo?
--[YOUNG MOMO] Huh?

2
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,541
[TENCHI]
What in the world is going on?

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,083
Have I gone back in time?

4
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,166
[YOUNG MOMO]
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,583
Do I know you?

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
[TENCHI]
Uh...

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,041
[RYOKO]
Does this hole have a bottom?

8
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,208
Hey.

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:39,916
Are you certain there's
really a ship down here?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,791
What if we go straight through
the Earth and pop out

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,833
on the other side?

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,958
Gee, lady, can't ya
even crack a smile?

13
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,416
Not when she needs me.

14
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,416
You mean Miss Momo?

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,208
[KINOJO] When I had no
idea what my purpose was

16
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,833
or how to use my power,
she helped me find my way.

17
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,041
Protecting her
isn't just my job.

18
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,541
It's a sacred duty.

19
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,500
Look. I'm only helping you
out here because of Tenchi.

20
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,250
I don't really need to know
your entire life story.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,250
[CHIEF ENGINEER]
This is awful!

22
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,000
If the rift keeps
expanding like this,

23
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,541
it won't just engulf the Earth,

24
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:17,125
it'll swallow up every star
and planet in this whole system!

25
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,375
[GP CHIEF growls]
Fine, then shut it down!

26
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,541
We can't, sir!

27
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:22,750
If you can't,
then tell me who can!

28
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,291
[CHIEF ENGINEER]
Mmm...

29
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,041
[GP CHIEF growls]

30
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,333
Damn.

31
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,541
Huh? What?

32
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,625
Sorry, I couldn't
quite hear you.

33
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,875
We won't be able to stop this
without your help.

34
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,458
Well, I would help,
but there's not much I can do

35
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,500
if I'm stuck behind bars.

36
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:39,916
Of course, if someone were
able to fix that situation,

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,416
I'd gladly lend a hand.

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,458
Just what are you implying?

39
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,500
All the stuff that I did
that you arrested me for.

40
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,916
Make it go away.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,750
[GP CHIEF growls]

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,041
What are you doing out
here all by yourself?

43
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,125
Because I'm new here,
everyone treats me

44
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,666
like I'm from another planet.

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,291
Maybe I just wasn't
meant to have any friends.

46
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,750
[TENCHI]
They'll come around.

47
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,791
[YOUNG MOMO]
Huh?

48
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,166
[TENCHI]
Just give it some time.

49
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,833
Once people know you,
you'll make lots of friends.

50
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:10,583
[YOUNG MOMO]
You think so?

51
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:11,666
Yeah.

52
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,875
[TENCHI gasps]

53
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,625
[MOMO screams]

54
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:19,708
[TENCHI]
Momo!

55
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,166
[TENCHI grunts]

56
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,958
What am I supposed to do?

57
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,291
On behalf of the
Galaxy Police, I hereby...

58
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,041
...pardon Washu Hakubi,

59
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,625
and exonerate her of
all her past offenses.

60
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,708
[WASHU]
Thank you.

61
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,041
Now that I'm free,
you've got a deal.

62
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,041
Congratulations on being
an honest citizen again!

63
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,500
All right, then.

64
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,083
This has gone on long enough.

65
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:28,208
Time to fix things.

66
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,791
I've gotta hold up
my end of the bargain.

67
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,666
This is one creepy place.

68
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,791
There it is!
