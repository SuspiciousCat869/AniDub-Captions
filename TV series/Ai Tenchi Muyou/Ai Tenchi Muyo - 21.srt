[GIRLS chattering] 

2
00:00:15,708 --> 00:00:18,000
So this next event is
called the Chicken Fight?

3
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,291
Hmph. It's a popular
tradition on Sports Day.

4
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,833
Something tells me this
won't be easy to referee.

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,833
Bound be a lot of "fowl" plays!

6
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,916
[GIRLS cheering]

7
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,583
Sounds like they're
out for blood,

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:38,041
and it's not chicken blood
I'm talking about!

9
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,166
Hey, we have very simple rules.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,666
If your Captain's ribbon
falls off her head, you lose!

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,041
[HACHIKO]
Got a question for you!

12
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,375
Hope I can answer it.

13
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,750
Why is that oversized
tin can competing?

14
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,875
[FUKA] You should apologize
for being so rude!

15
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,916
He's not oversized, just husky!

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,166
I'm still bothered that
he's allowed to participate

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,708
in the Obstacle Course.

18
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,625
He's not enrolled
here as a student.

19
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,833
[FUEYAMA] According to
this institution's by-laws,

20
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,208
non-students are strictly
forbidden from taking part

21
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,833
in special school events.

22
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,541
[SARYU] Not to mention
the fact that your player's

23
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,875
not even human.

24
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,291
Are you saying that robots
don't have basic rights?

25
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,416
Who made you the judge
of what Goriki can do?

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,458
[HACHIKO] As usual,
you're missing the point!

27
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,166
Why don't you
all just calm down?

28
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,791
We should let the referee do
his job and settle this issue.

29
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,166
[GIRLS growl]

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,458
Let me see...

31
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,666
It's an obvious answer.

32
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,875
Goriki is going to be
allowed to participate.

33
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,750
You guys lose. Too bad.

34
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:29,666
At least we tried
to make it fair.

35
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,333
Despite all the odds,
we're gonna go for the win!

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,083
Yeah, whatever, bring it on!

37
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,250
--[TENCHI] Let the match begin!

38

[GIRLS yelling]

39
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,583
Wow! You are so strong!

40
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,416
Leave it to me,
Mistress Momo!

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,833
I'll make sure they never
lay a finger on you!

42
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,708
[GIRLS yelling]

43
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,083
[FUKA] What am I doing down
here in the line of fire?

44
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,416
There's a lot more
protection on top of Goriki!

45
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,750
Anyone can see that!

46
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,958
[GIRLS yelling]

47
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,458
You should've let
me handle those girls!

48
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,500
[gasps]

49
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,458
Happy with my work,
or do you still wanna complain?

50
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,583
You're fine.
Please ignore my comments.

51
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,166
[AOI] But that's not
fair fighting, is it?

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,916
It is when you're
fighting to win!

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
[ANNOUNCER] That's three
points for the Red Team!

54
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,750
The White Team pushed ahead
with disastrous results.

55
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,083
All four White Team Units
were wiped out!

56
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,583
Medics, please get the
injured off the field!

57
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,166
[FUKA]
Only one more battle left!

58
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,583
[MOMO] No matter how bad
it seems, keep fighting!

59
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,583
[HACHIKO, KINOJO growl]

60
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:33,708
Watch out, everyone!

61
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,041
Punch coming from Goriki!

62
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:35,833
[GORIKI growls]

63
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,375
Smart maneuver!

64
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,166
But we're still in the lead and
we have more power than you

65
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,375
to bring home a win!

66
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,333
Well, power alone isn't
what decides a match

67
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,916
like this and we'll prove it!

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We need to make sure that
no matter what they do,

69
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,500
we don't lose.

70
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:49,875
And I have something in my
pocket that'll seal the deal!

71
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,333
Take a peek! Here!

72
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,375
[AOI]
Huh?

73
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,666
Spider! [screams]

74
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,125
[FUKA]
Go, Rui!

75
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,666
[AOI screaming]

76
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,166
[HACHIKO yells]

77
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,375
[MOMO]
Let me help you!

78
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,791
Don't worry about me!
Protect your ribbon,

79
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,041
Mistress Momo!

80
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,083
It's much more important
that we stay together

81
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,958
than worrying about
any silly ribbon!

82
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,083
[HACHIKO]
But we'll lose!

83
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:10,750
[AOI screaming]

84
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:16,375
[TENCHI yells]

85
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,625
Well, I suppose we lost.

86
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,875
It looks like the
winner is the Red Team.

87
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,208
[groans]

88
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,458
All right!
