Hey! Come back here!

[TENCHI yelling]

[TENCHI gasps]

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:28,750
Oh, crap!

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,583
[TENCHI] There's gotta
be a place to hide!

7
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,666
[yelling]

8
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,750
This is a complete nightmare!

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,000
[TENCHI] I just need
to find some place--

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,416
Any place without an audience
to put on my clothes!

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,291
[yelling]

12
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,750
[TENCHI sighs]

13
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,583
That was awful!

14
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,333
I've never seen this room.

15
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:55,541
Where am I?

16
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,083
[TENCHI]
Hm?

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:08,708
Huh? Wait a minute.

18
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,291
I thought this
was the bottom floor!

19
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,333
[yelling]

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,000
[TENCHI groaning]

21
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,041
Huh?

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,541
What's happening? How weird.

23
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,291
[FUKA] Prioritize your digging
in the third quadrant!

24
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:28,625
[FEMALE OVERSEER A]
Keep it up!

25
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,333
We've still got three feet
of rock to cut through!

26
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,833
[FUKA]
We've gotta find this treasure

27
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:33,625
before the Student Council does!

28
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:34,750
[GIRLS]
Right!

29
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,458
If we can just
get hold of it first,

30
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,458
those goody-two-shoes
will be toast.

31
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,416
We're not really gonna
cook them, are we?

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
--[FUKA] Yeah!
--[AOI] Oh!

33
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:43,291
We're gonna cook
their collective goose!

34
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:45,958
Listen, this is war!
War, do you hear me?

35
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,458
They control our
operating budget--

36
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,791
they think they can make us
do whatever they want!

37
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,250
Wake up and smell
the oppression!

38
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,333
[FEMALE OVERSEER B]
We found it!

39
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,333
[FUKA]
That's just a lump of iron ore!

40
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,458
Keep digging!

41
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,000
Is this some kind
of a school project?

42
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,000
[MIHOSHI]
I can't do this anymore!

43
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,250
I'm so hungry
I can't swing my pick!

44
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,166
If you can't work,
you don't get any food!

45
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,250
[MIHOSHI] Does the
principal know about this?

46
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,750
Wait a second! Is that--?

47
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,500
I recognize that voice!

48
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,375
[FUKA]
Who's there?

49
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,458
[AOI gasps]

50
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,041
[TENCHI]
Meow!

51
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:18,666
[AOI]
It's a kitty! I wanna pet it!

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,416
[FUKA]
Are you for real?

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,625
[TENCHI yells]

54
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,875
Why don't you
come along quietly?

55
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,416
[TENCHI grunts]

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,666
[TENCHI]
Hey, let me go!

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,666
What do you think you're doing?

58
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,166
[FUKA]
Great work, Kinojo!

59
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,625
That's why you're
the muscle on this team!

60
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,625
[KINOJO] Well, I did
promise to protect the club.

61
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,125
So, what's next?

62
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:45,000
He knows about this place.
We don't have much choice.

63
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,958
Hold on,
what are you gonna do?!

64
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,083
I have to think about it.

65
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:51,125
Yeah, that should work.

66
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,291
[chuckles] Hey, Kinojo.

67
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,583
Let's start by getting
this guy's clothes off!

68
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,750
[TENCHI]
Why is that necessary?

69
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:01,166
Well, you could be
a Student Council spy.

70
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,916
Who knows what hidden weapons
you might have on you!

71
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,125
[FUKA chuckling]

72
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,708
Oh, my!

75
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,208
[FUKA]
Hmm...

76
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,333
He looks clean enough so far.

77
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,166
Just one place left to search.

78
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,750
We have to make sure this dude

79
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,000
doesn't pose a threat
of any kind!

80
