00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,500
[TENCHI sighs]

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,125
Weeding, repairing the roof, now
scrubbing the bathing room.

3
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:22,333
What a day! I feel like
an overused plow horse!

4
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,166
Huh?

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,291
Close to bathing time.

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,666
Better finish before
the girls show up!

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,541
Huh? A time change note?

8
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,833
The bath is open?!

9
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,000
Nobody's here! Yay!

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,791
Hey, Momo, don't forget
to wash up first!

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,291
That's right.

12
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,625
Bathers are required to cleanse
before entering the water.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,416
The sole purpose
of soaking in the bath

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,708
is to purify you.

15
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,958
[MOMO]
Oh please, I know all that!

16
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,875
[MOMO humming]

17
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,000
[SARYU humming]

18
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,041
[TENCHI] I'm trapped, and
the whole Student Council's

19
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,416
naked in front of me!

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,708
Not good!

21
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,500
Oh! I think they got
bigger again, didn't they?

22
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,833
That's right, but it takes
a lot of extra effort

23
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,250
to stand up straight.

24
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:11,166
Well, that doesn't seem
like a bad trade-off to me.

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,416
[MOMO gasps]

26
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,875
Wanna have beauties like mine?

27
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,458
I'll show you my technique.

28
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:16,583
How's it work?

29
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,000
[SARYU]
You massage them like this,

30
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,750
but you have to hold still
while I demonstrate.

31
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,208
There's no scientific
data proving that massage

32
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,666
will stimulate breast growth.

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,708
[SARYU] If you don't have
any facts to say it doesn't,

34
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,083
why not try?

35
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,583
[TENCHI]
More fun than pulling weeds!

36
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,291
How can I get that assignment?

37
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,500
That should be enough for now
'cause you're still growing.

38
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't want to stretch
'em too much.

39
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,958
Now get some warm water on you
so you don't catch a cold.

40
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,833
[MOMO laughs]

41
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:46,875
[MOMO yells]

42
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,541
Huh?

43
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,125
--Why are you in our tub?
--Shh!

44
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,208
I was cleaning and I couldn't
escape before you all came in.

45
00:01:58,458 --> 00:01:59,750
You're in hot water.

46
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,166
And it's gonna get a lot
hotter when I report this!

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,375
According to my data,

48
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,208
you already have
a bad reputation.

49
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,291
You're gonna feel the
consequences of ogling us

50
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,208
in our birthday suits, buddy!

51
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,000
[TENCHI] This is bad!
How can I hide?

52
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,916
They won't see you.
I've got you covered!

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,375
[SARYU]
Now, we need to talk business.

54
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,000
The Science Club is
getting more and more

55
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,041
out of hand.

56
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,750
We need to keep
a close eye on them.

57
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,041
Just in the last few months,

58
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,291
they've committed more
than fifty infractions.

59
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,875
That includes embezzlement and
Illicit occupation of buildings

60
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,250
on the school grounds.

61
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,458
[SARYU] We're gonna have
to take some kind of action.

62
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,666
Let's not waste our time
thinking about it.

63
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,666
This requires brute force!

64
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,458
No mercy, no listening
to their stupid excuses.

65
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,833
Give 'em a thorough beatdown!

66
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,791
[MOMO] No, using physical
force is not the way

67
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,708
the Student Council
should behave!

68
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,458
[SARYU]
Huh?

69
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,666
Do you have indigestion?

70
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,250
[MOMO]
No, it was just a little burp!

71
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,166
Anyway, let's try to find
a solution that makes

72
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,291
everybody happy!

73
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,416
Are you serious?

74
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,583
What universe are you living in?

75
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:58,000
[FUEYAMA]
According to the simulations,

76
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,708
the probability of an agreeable
solution is almost zero!

77
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,208
Why should we work
things out with them?

78
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,416
They'll just take
advantage of any kindness.

79
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,916
And right now,

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,750
Rui has proof they've been
running around behind our backs

81
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,666
and getting away
with embezzlement!

82
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,541
Worse than that,
I'll bet at this very moment,

83
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,041
they're plotting
to snatch the treasure

84
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,791
before we can even get near it!

85
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,416
[TENCHI]
You know about the treasure?

86
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,750
You've gotta be quiet!
They'll discover you!

87
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:21,916
Get down!

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,333
[TENCHI grunts]

89
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,875
[TENCHI] Momo, let go!
Can't breathe...!

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,958
[TENCHI gasps]

91
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,291
[TENCHI]
What should I do?

92
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,916
Momo and the others don't know
what they're getting into.

93
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,291
This is bad.
