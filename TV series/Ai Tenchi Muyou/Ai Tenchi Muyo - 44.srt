1
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:16,416
[OPERATOR A] Dimension
Oscillator Bomb will impact

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,625
in T minus five minutes!

3
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,750
All area SWAT teams:
Seek shelter immediately!

4
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:24,125
They began the
ground assault too early.

5
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:26,041
They were supposed
to start after impact.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,166
Don't worry,
nothing can stop us now.

7
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,750
[GP CHIEF]
Hmph!

8
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,583
[RYOKO grunts]
Dammit!

9
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,458
[MOMO gasps, yells]

10
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,750
[TENCHI]
Kawanagare!

11
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:58,666
[MOMO yelling]

12
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,500
Take it easy. You're okay.

13
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,375
[TENCHI]
There you go.

14
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,000
What did you just do?

15
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,708
The dimensional warp appears
to be nearing its limit.

16
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,041
My power can help for now,
but not forever.

17
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,750
What now?

18
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,500
[OFFICER A] We have a report
from the surveillance team.

19
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:27,250
Someone repositioned the
antenna on the school's roof.

20
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,541
Have Unit 3 destroy it!
Right away!

21
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,125
[OFFICER A] But Captain,
the Dimension Oscillator--

22
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,291
[AYEKA]
Not so fast!

23
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,916
[AYEKA] The Galaxy Police
are currently in violation

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,333
of the Okayama Protocol.

25
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,083
As a royal princess of Jurai,

26
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,666
I can't let you continue
your illegal actions.

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,416
[KURIHARA]
Who cares? Arrest them, too.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,666
[OFFICER A] A gravitational
distortion is being emitted

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,333
from the antenna!

30
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,083
Its size is incredible!

31
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,250
And there seems to be
an event horizon forming!

32
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,333
A black hole creator.

33
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,458
So this was the
ace up her sleeve.

34
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,833
Nice move.

35
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:12,791
[GORIKI growls]

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,250
[OPERATOR A] Sending black
hole to parallel dimension.

37
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,708
Such a waste of effort.

38
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,250
There's a high-energy
signature near the antenna!

39
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,583
It's a robot!

40
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,541
It appears to be absorbing
pieces of the building

41
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,541
and getting bigger!

42
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,750
A robot?

43
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,458
Go! Swing for the fences!
Hit it outta the park!

44
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,625
[GORIKI growls]

45
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,041
[GORIKI growls]

46
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:55,791
[GORIKI growls]

47
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,750
We have impact and detonation.

48
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,958
[GROUP yelling]

49
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,541
[TENCHI]
Ryoko!

50
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,625
[RYOKO]
Huh?

51
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,708
[yells]

52
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,208
[grunting]

53
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,583
Hey! I have the artifact!

54
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,333
Get outta there!

55
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,625
Ryoko!

56
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,500
Here, Tenchi,
I got the darn thing.

57
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,541
Thanks, Ryoko, great work!

58
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,250
It was no big deal.

59
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,833
Hey, if you're not busy,
could you unfold me?
