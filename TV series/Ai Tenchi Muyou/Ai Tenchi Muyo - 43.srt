1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,541
Oh, good! You made it!

2
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,375
Nice work getting away.

3
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,750
Washu! It's you!

4
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,458
What the heck is going on?

5
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,750
Why don't we save
all the details for later?

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,000
Get moving!

7
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,375
The Galaxy Police are
on their way over here!

8
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:33,958
Master Tenchi, Ryoko,

9
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,208
take those two and
head down below.

10
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,500
As for you...

11
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,083
You girls are going
to help me ambush

12
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:40,708
those alien nitwits.

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,083
I know that voice!

14
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,791
You're the one we heard?

15
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,875
[WASHU]
Hm?

16
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,041
[SWAT GUY A]
This is Galaxy Police SWAT!

17
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,708
We've got the building
completely surrounded!

18
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,500
You're sweatin', rookie.

19
00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,583
A little nervous?

20
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,791
Yeah. I mean... I'm okay.

21
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:04,125
You're gonna want to
change out your equipment.

22
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,041
A gun's no good for
what we're up against.

23
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,166
Roger that.

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,250
There's no shame
in being scared, kid.

25
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,833
This is Washu Hakubi
we're talkin' about.

26
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,291
Behind the Academy's back,

27
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,916
she did whatever she wanted
and called it "research."

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,416
Who knows how many
planets she destroyed?

29
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,000
No one's counted them all.

30
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,583
Yet she's never shown
one shred of remorse.

31
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,708
Her eyes are cold as ice.

32
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,833
She is evil!

33
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:27,375
Don't you think she
should be stopped?

34
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,583
I do!

35
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,750
[KINOJO]
Are you serious?

36
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,250
[MOMO] You're saying
we're not from Earth?

37
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,625
I don't understand!

38
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,333
[TENCHI]
I know it sounds unbelievable,

39
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,166
but it's the truth.

40
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,666
1,300 years ago,
you and Kinojo were caught

41
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,500
in a dimensional warp
and flung to Earth.

42
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:45,083
Eventually you wound up
here, in the present day.

43
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,166
But this is the place
where everything started

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,416
all those years ago.

45
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,791
So.

46
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,750
It's right that it
end here, as well.

47
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,166
Hey!

48
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,916
I hope it's time for snacks,
'cause I'm hungry.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,958
What? You're still
digging down here?

50
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,250
[MIHOSHI]
Should I not be?

51
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,500
[WASHU] Looks like they
disarmed my booby traps.

52
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,250
Well, good for them.

53
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,666
You're nuts!

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,125
You want me to squeeze
down in there?

55
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,166
You have to!

56
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,208
[RYOKO]
Ugh!

57
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,291
[SWAT GUY A]
No barricades or force fields.

58
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,958
This should be a piece of cake!

59
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,125
[SWAT GUY A grunts]

60
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,083
[SWAT GUYS grunting]

61
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,291
[FUKA laughs]

62
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,791
I don't know if you guys
are aliens or what,

63
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,666
but you're not getting past me!

64
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,625
[SWAT GUY B]
Go around her! Huh?

65
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:49,958
[AOI screaming]

66
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,125
It's a spider!

67
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,833
Get it away! Get it away!

68
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,750
Get it away!

69
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:56,708
[SWAT GUYS yell]

70
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,083
[KURIHARA]
Call your men back.

71
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,291
I don't want them using
any deadly weapons,

72
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,458
not on the humans.

73
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,500
[SWAT OFFICER]
Their weapons are a joke.

74
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,541
A wooden stick?

75
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,125
Primitive savages!

76
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,458
[yells]

77
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,875
[KURIHARA] Watch your mouth!
They're my students.

78
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,458
You girls!
You both need to stop!

79
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,916
If you resist,
you'll lose all credits

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,375
you earned this year,
and be expelled!

81
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,958
[FUKA]
That's not fair! Aww!

82
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,625
[WASHU] Well, at least
they bought us some time.

83
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,791
[chuckles]
It's almost here.

84
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,791
I'd never do this
for anyone but Tenchi.

85
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,041
Huh?

86
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,708
Is that it?
