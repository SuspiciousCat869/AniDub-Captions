1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,958
[MOMO]
Hold it right there!

2
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,083
[GIRLS gasp]

3
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,500
I don't believe this!

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,750
[MOMO]
The Student Council has arrived!

5
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,750
Believe it, sister!

6
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,666
How did you find this site?

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,791
[SARYU chuckles]

8
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:34,125
[FUKA]
A transmitter?! Ugh!

9
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,666
You've gotta be kidding!

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,000
[TENCHI]
How did that get in there?!

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,708
[SARYU] What an interesting
excavation you have

12
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,125
going on here, right under
the grounds of the school!

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,958
[FUEYAMA] The size of this
area is approximately

14
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,166
as large as the grounds
of Takahashi Castle

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,458
in Okayama Prefecture.

16
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:51,208
The question is,
what's about to happen?

17
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,000
[HACHIKO] If you flee,
we won't pursue you,

18
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,333
but we'll show you no mercy
if you stay and fight!

19
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:56,750
[GIRLS scream]

20
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,958
[FUKA]
Hey, quit running, you wimps!

21
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,958
And now, we'll be
taking back Mr. Tenchi!

22
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,291
[TENCHI muffled yelling]

23
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,250
[MOMO]
Here I come!

24
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:13,666
[grunting]

25
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,833
Hold on, Hachiko!

26
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,291
Don't worry!
I'm not gonna let you fall!

27
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,166
You've saved the day!

28
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,916
Umm... guys.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,166
I hate to undercut this
dramatic moment,

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,333
but you might want to look down.

31
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,958
Huh?

32
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,166
[chuckles]

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,875
Sorry 'bout that!
Now I'm ready to fight!

34
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:32,708
[HACHIKO grunts]

35
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,750
[MOMO yells]

36
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,875
[FUKA]
Show 'em who's boss, Kinojo!

37
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,166
C'mon, Rui!

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,625
[MOMO]
This isn't over, Fuka!

39
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,250
[SARYU]
Momo, you go get Mr. Tenchi!

40
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,333
[MOMO]
Right!

41
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,166
[HACHIKO]
Stay clear, Mistress Momo!

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,958
[MOMO]
Are you okay, Mr. Tenchi?

43
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,291
Tori!

44
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,166
I can't believe this!
Are you all right?

45
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,666
Yes! I think so!

46
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,750
[FUEYAMA] It looks like the
cave is beginning to collapse.

47
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,291
Well, now that
Mr. Tenchi's safe,

48
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,083
what are we sticking
around here for?

49
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,791
Let's go, Momo!

50
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,041
Gotcha!

51
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,166
Ready to move out?

52
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,166
I should be fine.
Thanks, Kawanagare.

53
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,916
Only problem is
you have no clothes!

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,083
[TENCHI gasps]

55
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,083
[TENCHI]
Watch out!

56
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,166
[MOMO gasps]

57
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,541
Are you all right?

58
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,541
[MOMO]
Uh-huh.

59
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,416
[TENCHI]
Let's go!

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,208
What's taking you both so long?

61
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,000
I estimate thirty more
seconds until cave-in.

62
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,166
Move your butt!

63
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,125
[MOMO gasps]

64
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,291
[TENCHI]
I've got you!

65
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,500
[TENCHI grunts]
We just made it!

66
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,125
Is everyone crazy around here?

67
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,666
[MOMO]
Excuse me, Mr. Tenchi.

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,333
If it's not you doing
something weird,

69
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,833
it's everyone else around you!

70
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:15,541
What's the deal with
this crazy place?

71
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,583
[MOMO]
You're hurting me.

72
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,875
[TENCHI]
Huh?

73
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,583
What?

74
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,208
I'm sorry, I didn't realize!

75
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,750
[HACHIKO]
You swine!

76
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,250
You have some nerve, laying
your hooves on Mistress Momo!

77
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,708
[TENCHI] No! I didn't
mean to squeeze her!

78
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,958
Entering current database:

79
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,458
Mr. Tenchi has lain his
hoof on Mistress Momo.

80
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,500
Duly noted.

81
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,583
[TENCHI]
You've got it all wrong!

82
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,708
Quit slandering me!

83
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,750
You say we're lying?!

84
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,458
[TENCHI screams]
