00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,291
[TENCHI]
Sorry about this, Kawanagare.

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,166
I hate to have you use
your precious break time

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,750
showing me around the school.

4
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,625
No big deal.
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,416
It's all in a day's work for
the Student Council President.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,250
I do appreciate it.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,708
And, uh...

8
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,166
...the rest of you
are okay with this?

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,333
Oh, absolutely!

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,875
Supporting the President
is one of the jobs

11
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,333
of the Vice-President.

12
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,000
[SARYU] Unless, of course,
you and the President

13
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,333
would rather have this
time all to yourselves.

14
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,333
That's not what I was saying!

15
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,375

Entering data.

00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:47,875
Tenchi Masaki
wants solitary time

17
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,208
with the Council President.

18
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:50,833
Why are you putting
that in your records?

19
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:52,458
Gathering data around the campus

20
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,041
is one of my most important
duties as Treasurer.

21
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,250
--I see, but there's been a mi--
--[HACHIKO] You pervert!

22
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,916
Why are you trying to get
Mistress Momo alone?

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,416
I won't let you lay
a single finger on her!

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,000
That's my duty as auditor!

25
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,541
You're sure this is all
coming from your position

26
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,041
as auditor?

27
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,000
Of course it is! What are you
implying by that remark?

28
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,083
[MOMO laughs]

29
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,708
Hold on.

30
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,125
Could she be the one who lan--?

31
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,083
Goodness, what seems
to have caught your eye?

32
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,208
You've got me all wrong!

33
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,791
[HACHIKO]
Back off, you filthy animal!

34
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,041
Entering data in log:

35
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,625
Tenchi Masaki peeked up
Momo Kawanagare's skirt

36
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,125
on his very first day of work.

37
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,833
[TENCHI] Hey, that's not
what happened at all!

38
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,833
That's right!
Stop implying things!

39
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:43,250
I'm sure he's a helpless
victim of his own temptation!

40
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,666
Oh, Momo, you're so
kind and understanding.

41
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,000
Wait a minute!
I object to that explanation!

42
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,250
[TENCHI]
Huh?

43
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,416
Is something the matter?

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,875
Just a feeling.

45
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,916
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

46
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,000
[MOMO] This is the Student
Council Headquarters.

47
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,208
Don't be shy.

48
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,750
Please, go on in.

49
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:07,875
[TENCHI]
Uh...

50
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,750
[yelling]

51
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,791
Huh?

52
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,333
[SARYU]
Hachiko.

53
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,000
Ah! What are you doing?!

54
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,458
What is everybody up to?

55
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,083
Just hang on, you'll see.

56
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,125
Tori?

57
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,583
We're going to give you a test.

58
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,041
Why didn't anyone tell me?
A test about what?

59
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,666
About whether or not
this cretin intends

60
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,000
to do harm to you.

61
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,416
[MOMO]
What?

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,250
Why would Mr. Tenchi want
to do something like that?

63
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,541
The fact of the matter is,

64
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,625
the school database
has almost no information

65
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,750
on Mr. Tenchi.

66
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,416
We don't even know
where he came from.

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,041
So what would be the best way
to get more information?

68
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,416
Hm, I guess ask
Mr. Tenchi directly.

69
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,166
You're right!
What a great idea!

70
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,333
[MOMO laughs]

71
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,916
And in this case,

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,041
we'll be asking his body
those questions.

73
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,208
How will his body
be able to answer you?

74
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,958
It depends how
we ask the question.

75
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,291
No matter how much they resist,

76
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,541
their body always
answers honestly.

77
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,625
Hey, Mr. Tenchi,
what's your favorite food?

78
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,791
Hey. It doesn't
seem to be answering.

79
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,000
You're getting a little
bit ahead of yourself.

80
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,375
There's a trick to the
technique, you see.

81
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,708
[FUEYAMA]
Don't worry, Mistress Momo.

82
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:15,833
The data shows that in
the hands of Hana Saryu,

83
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,958
even the most hardened
spy is going to crack

84
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,333
in an average of 7.2 seconds.

85
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,583
[SARYU chuckles]
This won't take very long.

86
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,208
Before you know it,
it'll all be over.

87
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,333
Will you quit squirming
around! Hachiko!

88
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,875
[TENCHI grunts]

89
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, look who's
finally calmed down.

90
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,083
Everybody ready?
Let's continue.

91
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,000
[MOMO laughs]
