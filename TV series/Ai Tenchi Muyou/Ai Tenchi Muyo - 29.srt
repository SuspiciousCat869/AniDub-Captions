[GIRLS chattering]

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:27,083
Come on, Mr. Tenchi!
Everything's almost ready!

3
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,625
Thanks a lot, Momo!

4
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,125
I'll be down as soon as
I get this hole patched!

5
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,291
So what's the deal?
Is this ready yet?

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,458
Go away!

7
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,416
Go set the table.
Make yourself useful!

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,791
I'm not leaving!

9
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,750
I'm keeping an eye on
you girls and these grills!

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,958
Stand there as long as you want!

11
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,458
This meal's in honor
of Master Tenchi,

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,750
and we're not eating
until he finishes his work!

13
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,208
Hey, thanks for inviting us.

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,541
We owe him a lot for
saving our friend here.

15
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,583
You're welcome.
We should thank you.

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,791
We couldn't have
done this if you hadn't

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,666
gotten permission
to use the courtyard.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,000
[FUEYAMA] Who are these
friends of Mr. Tenchi's?

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,791
Normally, only dorm
students and proctors

20
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,208
are allowed in here.

21
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:00,583
[SASAMI laughing]

22
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,125
[MOMO] Since you were
going to all this trouble

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,416
for Mr. Tenchi's sake,

24
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,791
how could we not let
you use the facilities?

25
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:07,708
Well, that, plus the
delicious barbecue

26
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:08,541
you brought in!

27
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:09,916
[stomach growling]

28
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,375
A-ha! Apparently,
we have an eager stomach!

29
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:18,375
[FUEYAMA] This data confirms
that smiling over your shoulder

30
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:21,750
has 80 times the seductive force
of smiling straight ahead!

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,416
[FUKA yawns]
I'm bored, guys.

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,333
Why is the courtyard so busy?

33
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,541
[GROUP gasps]

34
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,875
Why are you here?

35
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,208
We live here.

36
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,416
[AYEKA. SASAMI]
Hm?

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,750
[RYOKO]
Huh?

38
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:40,416
You again!

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,166
[FUKA sighs]
We're not here to pick a fight.

40
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,416
Sorry for intruding.

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,833
--Come on, ladies.
--[MOMO] Wait!

42
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,541
What's the problem?
I said we were leaving.

43
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,666
Isn't that good enough?

44
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,041
That's not what I meant!

45
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,750
Why don't you stay
and have some food?

46
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,250
I think for these
kind of events,

47
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,333
the more the merrier,
don't you agree?

48
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,166
Sasami, can we handle it?

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,583
Sure!

50
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,333
We've got plenty of food.
Why not spread it around?

51
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,708
This is ridiculous! What makes
you think we'd be willing

52
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,125
to take handouts from our--
[stomach growls]

53
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,291
Sure about that?

54
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,000
Good! That settles it!

55
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's have a nice,
friendly party together,

56
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,083
what do you say?

57
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,500
[TENCHI sighs]

58
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,458
It's not perfect, but at least
it'll keep out the rain!

59
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,666
[FUEYAMA]
Heat penetration, 74 degrees.

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,208
A perfect medium-rare.

61
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,625
[SASAMI laughs]

62
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,083
All right, my
super-secret meat sauce

63
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,083
is ready to go!

64
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,125
[BOTH arguing]

65
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,708
Wow, what service!

66
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,708
[BOTH gasp]

67
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,750
Want me to flip
you some veggies?

68
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,625
No, thanks!

69
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,500
Somebody threw the
party switch around here!

70
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,583
You're finally
down off the roof!

71
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,375
We waited as
long as we could!

72
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,500
Thank you.

73
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,125
[GIRLS chattering]

74
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,375
Everyone's getting along.
I wish it was always like this.

75
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,791
[TENCHI]
Huh?

76
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,541
It's no fun feeling
like you're all alone

77
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,916
in the world.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,416
Yeah.

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,416
[MOMO] I know, because
I was alone for so long.

80
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,958
--I never realized.
--Oh!

81
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,791
But now I'm a lot better!

82
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,416
I have all these great
friends around me!

83
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
And you know what?
It feels fantastic!

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,916
C'mon, guys!

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,333
If you don't move your feet,
you're gonna lose your meat!

86
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,750
She's right!
We'd better go join the party!

87
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,125
The guest of honor is here!

88
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,708
Save him some food!
