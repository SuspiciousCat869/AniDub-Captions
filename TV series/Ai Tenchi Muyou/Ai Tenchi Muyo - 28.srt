1
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,291
[TENCHI]
So you are up here!

2
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,750
[KINOJO]
Mr. Tenchi...

3
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,500
Did you come up
here for a reason?

4
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,750
No need to get freaked out!

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,166
Just wanted to
have a little chat!

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,750
Is it okay if I sit by you?

7
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,750
[TENCHI sighs]

8
00:00:35,666 --> 00:00:36,833
[TENCHI]
There we go.

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,416
What a view. The stars sure do
look beautiful from up here,

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,416
don't they?

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,916
Too many to count.
You like stars, Kinojo?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,333
Not really.

13
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,166
It just calms me down
to look at 'em.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,916
What do you really want?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,541
I wanna talk about
that thing you're searching for.

16
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:55,750
[KINOJO gasps]

17
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,000
I suppose those two
opened their big mouths.

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,041
I presume that it's
something pretty important.

19
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,458
Don't worry about it;
it's none of your business!

20
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,791
I was wondering
if it's connected

21
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,041
to this treasure everyone--

22
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,666
How do you know about that?!

23
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,583
I'm just here to talk!
Can you put that down, please?

24
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:12,208
It doesn't encourage
conversation!

25
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,833
[KINOJO] Come to think of it,
I've got something I wanna

26
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,083
ask you, too.

27
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:16,250
[TENCHI]
Huh?

28
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,458
How 'bout telling me
exactly who you are,

29
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,583
Mr. Tenchi?

30
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,250
I'm just a regular
old student teacher!

31
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,583
Don't lie to me!

32
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,291
Don't forget, I was there!

33
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,791
I saw how you brought
down that big robot!

34
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,125
[TENCHI]
That was just instinct!

35
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,250
The adrenaline
brought that out in me!

36
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:30,791
[KINOJO]
Do you think I'm stupid?

37
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,625
If you don't wanna tell the
truth, we can play this

38
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:34,333
--a different way.
--What do you have in mind?

39
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,541
I'll question you, with my club!

40
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,250
I'm not really a
big fan of that plan!

41
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,916
I have no clear memories
of my distant past!

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,916
I don't even know
exactly who I am!

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,916
But...

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,750
There's one thing
I know for sure!

45
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,250
I don't belong here!

46
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:52,083
I don't fit in, and I'm
not a normal person!

47
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:53,916
[TENCHI]
What's not normal about you?

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,541
[KINOJO] Show me a
normal high-school girl

49
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,916
who can handle a chunk
of metal like this!

50
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,708
Point taken.

51
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:05,541
[KINOJO] With this power, I
could accidentally hurt someone.

52
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,000
It's all I can think
about anymore.

53
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,833
Since I'm not like anyone else,

54
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:11,916
It's dangerous for me
to be around people.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,041
[TENCHI] Have you thought about
just putting down the club?

56
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,333
[KINOJO] I thought I was
doomed to total isolation,

57
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:19,083
but then I found you and
realized I wasn't alone.

58
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm right here!

59
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,208
[KINOJO]
Since you won't talk,

60
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,250
I've decided to beat
the truth out of you.

61
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,916
You'd better fight back,
Mr. Tenchi,

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,666
or you and this roof
will be smashed

63
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,083
into a million pieces!

64
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,541
[TENCHI]
Do I have a vote in all this?

65
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,625
[KINOJO] You can reveal
yourself or you can bleed.

66
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:32,875
It's up to you!

67
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:36,333
What is all the
commotion up here?

68
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,458
What in the--?

69
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,500
[TENCHI]
Look out, Kawanagare!

70
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,625
[MOMO yells]

71
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,333
[coughing]

72
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,000
What happened up there?

73
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,458
You're both okay, right?

74
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,833
[MOMO]
Are we still alive?!

75
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,958
[KINOJO coughs]

76
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,458
Why do you have
your arm around me?!

77
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,500
I'm sorry!
I was just trying to help you.

78
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,083
[KURIHARA]
Well, well.

79
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,500
Here you are in the courtyard,
and with two partners, no less!

80
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,875
I thought I'd made myself clear.

81
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,125
I told you to stop
being so touchy-feely

82
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,083
with the students!

83
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,291
You've got this wrong!

84
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,666
[KURIHARA]
Since you don't seem to listen,

85
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,041
I'll have to use
a more forceful lesson!

86
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,208
[TENCHI]
Somebody help me!

87
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,000
[MOMO]
Beni, your fingers are hurt!

88
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,708
[KINOJO gasps]

89
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,541
[BABY MOMO cooing]

90
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,166
Huh?

91
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,375
Keep your distance!
