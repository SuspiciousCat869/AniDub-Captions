1
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,625
Space Pirate Ryoko,
surrender or be destroyed!

2
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,750
Your reign of terror
ends right now!

3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,333
Ha! Big talk!

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,000
Go ahead, try to get me!

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:28,166
[MIHOSHI]
You missed!

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:31,375
[YOUNG MOMO gasps]

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,541
We've gotta move! Let's beat it!

8
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,208
[RYOKO grunting]

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,833
[MIHOSHI yelling]

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,541
[RYOKO laughing]

11
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,875
[MIHOSHI] Give up!
You don't stand a chance!

12
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,541
Ha! We'll just see about that!

13
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,958
There's a little girl here!

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,791
Don't fire your blasters
over this area!

15
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,083
[MIHOSHI]
Oh, my goodness!

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,083
I didn't know anyone was there!

17
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,333
I'm very sorry about that!

18
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:01,541
Right! I'll show you what real
sorry is for attacking me!

19
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,416
[MIHOSHI yells]

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,208
Hold on tight. We're outta here!

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,625
[MIHOSHI yelling]

22
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,250
Here's the big finish!

23
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:11,333
[MIHOSHI yells]

24
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,625
That's for giving me
a hard time.

25
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,041
Huh? What's going on?

26
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,208
[MIHOSHI, RYOKO yelling]

27
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,125
[TENCHI gasps]
They just totally disappeared!

28
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,833
[YOUNG MOMO] I want to thank
you all for trusting us.

29
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,000
We should thank you for
keeping that Space Pirate

30
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:36,458
from causing us harm.

31
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:41,458
We're very grateful
for what you did.

32
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,125
It seems strange to be
saved by a little girl.

33
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,333
You're all fine.

34
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,250
And that's really
what matters the most.

35
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,291
Right. I have to agree.

36
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,916
We still don't know anything
about the two of you.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,958
Where you came from,
how you got here.

38
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,666
We have a mountain of questions
and an anthill of answers.

39
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,041
We know one thing.

40
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,166
You came here because
you're looking for someone.

41
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,416
We'd like to help you find
whoever you're looking for

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,875
as a way of saying thanks.

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,416
You'd really do that?

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,791
That's great. Means a lot to us.

45
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,500
It's kind of
difficult to explain.

46
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,125
Momo got stranded here and
we're trying to find her friend,

47
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,083
who was supposed to be
coming along after her.

48
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,958
He's walking this trail
like he has a guide beside him.

49
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,416
Like someone's giving him
directions on where to search.

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,083
That thing in his hand
must have something

51
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:23,916
to do with it.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,375
What's in the little box?

53
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,166
Some kind of divining rod?

54
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,708
No, but it sort of
works that way.

55
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,125
[YOUNG MOMO] Tenchi, if there's
a signal coming from the ship,

56
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,625
I should be able to pick
it up on this thing.

57
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,458
I keep trying,
but it's just not working.

58
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,583
Something burned the trees.

59
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,208
[SARYU]
From the top.

60
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,166
Whatever it was
gave off extreme heat

61
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,791
as it passed through.

62
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,375
--[YOUNG MOMO] This way!
--[TENCHI] Hey!

63
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,541
Where's my ship?

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,208
--[YOUNG MOMO yells]
--[TENCHI] Careful!

65
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,166
Something blew up.

66
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,125
It's the only way this hole
could've been created.

67
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
[beeping noise]
