1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,666
[STEWARD]
I believe your name is Kurenai,

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,041
if I'm not mistaken.

3
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:25,666
How tragic for you to
have lost all your relatives.

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,458
You're very brave
for one so young.

5
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:31,083
Their Royal Highnesses must
have sensed a real strength

6
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,916
in you to entrust
you with the care

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,375
of their dear daughter.

8
00:00:39,166 --> 00:00:42,750
I hope you will justify that
trust in fulfilling this task.

9
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,666
You've freed me.

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,833
Do you really
think that's smart?

11
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,208
After all,
I could crush her throat.

12
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,875
Then what happens?

13
00:00:56,958 --> 00:00:58,958
The royal line
would be destroyed!

14
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,750
Why should--!

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,708
[BABY MOMO cooing]

16
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,250
Beni!

17
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,583
Hey, it's not Beni.
It's Kurenai.

18
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,208
How many times
must I tell you that?

19
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,541
Right. Hey, is this my ship?

20
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,875
[KINOJO] Yes.
It's called the Peach Blossom.

21
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,791
It's a gift from
the Jurai family.

22
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,291
[YOUNG MOMO]
Peach Blossom.

23
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,875
And it's the ship that's
going to take me far away?

24
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:39,416
That's right.

25
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,541
It's your destiny,
Mistress Momo.

26
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,000
[YOUNG MOMO]
What about you, Beni?

27
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,291
You're coming with me, right?

28
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,083
[KINOJO]
Yes. Of course.

29
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,125
[YOUNG MOMO laughs]

30
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,541
[tracker beeping]

31
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,625
I think this is the right place.

32
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:17,125
[HACHIKO] Hey!
There's something over here!

33
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,083
[SARYU]
What is this?

34
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,125
[FUEYAMA] I've never
seen anything like it.

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,708
She's okay!

36
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,625
That's great news.

37
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,541
[YOUNG MOMO] Now, if I can
get this thing to work right,

38
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,291
we can call someone for help.

39
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,375
Uh, Momo?

40
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,708
Huh?

41
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,041
[TENCHI]
The truth is,

42
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm the one who was sent
here to help you and Beni

43
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,625
with your mission.

44
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,791
Now that you two
have been reunited,

45
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,083
things should start
to happen in a way

46
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,083
that gets you back on track.

47
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,250
Sorry you had to go
through this disruption.

48
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,458
You're not staying?

49
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,583
[GROUP]
Huh?

50
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,166
I'm glad I got to meet you.

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,208
And now...

52
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,041
[TENCHI gasps]

53
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:08,750
Huh?

54
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:09,791
[yells]

55
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,958
[TENCHI grunts]

56
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,791
[YOUNG MOMO yells]

57
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,500
Oh, no!

58
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,083
[GROUP gasps]

59
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,541
This is wrong!

60
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,583
It's not what's
supposed to happen!

61
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,625
Beni!

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,083
Beni!

63
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,750
