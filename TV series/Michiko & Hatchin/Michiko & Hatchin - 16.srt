1
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:53,416
I have a fairly,
prominent mole on my right arm.

2
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,666
When he discovered it
and discovered the hair

3
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,458
growing out of it.

4
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:11,416
I could feel my face
burning with embarrassment.

5
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,500
But he was amused.

6
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,583
And just kept touching it.

7
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,666
Flicking it back and forth.

8
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,166
What are you saying?

9
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,666
That I'm some kind of poison?

10
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,708
That perfume is pretty intense.

11
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,416
Your face tells me you have
no need for a wreck like me.

12
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,958
We should end this
while we can both still

13
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,791
look back fondly on it.

14
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:46,250
I get it, your feelings are
so transparent, Feliciano.

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,208
Fine!

16
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,333
I'll make it a game for you.

17
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,000
Run away, if you like.

18
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,625
I'll chase after you.

19
00:02:52,708 --> 00:03:00,000
After all, the only future I can
see is the one with you in it.

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,958
What a crock.

21
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:43,375
Jeez, we're going nowhere fast.

22
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,666
Ah, no rush.

23
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,000
We know where she's heading.

24
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,166
Won't be long at all.

25
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,666
Yo!

26
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,833
Sorry for the wait.

27
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,583
What do you think?

28
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah, um.

29
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,750
Who exactly is, Rock Morena?

30
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,000
Where'd you hear that?

31
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,666
From the picture
in the newspaper!

32
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,916
It said the man holding
that crazy tomato is named

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,375
Rock Morena, not Hiroshi.

34
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,125
Hey, I don't know
where he got the name.

35
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,708
--Does it even really matter?
--Yes, it matters!

36
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,541
It absolutely matters!

37
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,500
What if it's the
wrong person again?

38
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,791
You know, you tend to
miss these kinds of details.

39
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,750
Look at it again!

40
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,708
It's fuckin' Hiroshi!

41
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,250
There's no way
I'd mistake him!

42
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,500
Of course he
looks even hotter now.

43
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,833
That's the kind of guy he is.

44
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:00,291
But, how have I held up?

45
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,916
Shit!

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Goddammit!

47
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,291
I'm going to change.

48
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,083
Hey, hold it!

49
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,916
No entry, unless you
have business here.

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,208
I do have business here.

51
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:42,833
This is the main gate.

52
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:43,833
I've got an intruder.

53
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,958
No, wait! Listen!

54
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,208
--The hell are you doing?
--I'm using my brain!

55
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,833
Are you sure this is the place?

56
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,291
I don't see any
tomato fields around here!

57
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,958
Look, just like the picture.

58
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,458
We've already come this far.

59
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm going inside.

60
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,250
Fine, suit yourself.

61
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,166
Wait for me right here.

62
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,625
Our happy ending's coming soon.

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,458
Hey!

64
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,000
I told you,
this area is off lim-!

65
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,625
Damn it!

66
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,125
Idiot!

67
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,458
Ma'am!

68
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,208
Seems we have
an intruder situation.

69
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,625
Uh, no.

70
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,541
This is the woman
we're concerned with.

71
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,166
Shall I call this in?

72
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,041
Damn, you guys are persistent!

73
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,666
Hey! Freeze!

74
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,666
We've captured
the intruder, ma'am.

75
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,458
Excellent work.

76
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:19,250
If you wouldn't mind, bring
her in here for me, please.

77
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,541
She is our guest, after all.

78
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,333
Go on!

79
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,500
Are you okay?

80
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:36,666
All done.

81
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,500
What're you doing in here?

82
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,791
What do you think, jerk?

83
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,125
I came here for you!

84
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,250
You dummy, I told you
to wait outside!

85
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,875
Why the hell did you come in?

86
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,291
Quarreling?

87
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,250
That's a bit surprising.

88
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,708
So, where is he?

89
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,166
Where's who?

90
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,500
This ain't a game,
and I ain't playing!

91
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,208
Damn it!

92
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,666
Aright, bring it on you bitch!

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,833
You have, long legs.

94
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,708
Anyway, have you had lunch yet?

95
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,208
We grew these here.

96
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,333
Have it.

97
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,333
Vitamin A.

98
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,458
I don't need
your damn handouts!

99
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,083
Excuse me!

100
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,500
We came here, to see
a man named Rock Morena.

101
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,375
Yes, I know.

102
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,791
What're those doing there?

103
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,583
What's this room for?

104
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,541
Shit!

105
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,625
Damn it!

106
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,083
Son of a--!

107
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,458
Hiroshi!

108
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,375
You here?

109
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,500
Damn you!

110
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,791
Where'd you hide Hiroshi?

111
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,000
Michiko! Let's go!
He's not he--!

112
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:04,875
Shut up!

113
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,083
You stay outta this!

114
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,958
The grown-ups are talking!

115
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,583
You're an awfully cruel woman!

116
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,625
You know that?

117
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,791
Yeah? So what if I am?

118
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,708
What's the big idea?

119
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,958
You trying to
distract me or something?

120
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,000
You could've
just kissed me back.

121
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,541
Would've been nice.

122
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,958
You've got something
in your hair.

123
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,458
Knock it off with
this coming onto me crap!

124
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,875
Bring him out here!

125
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,666
Bring him out here, right now!

126
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,125
He ran away.

127
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,375
He ran.

128
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,416
Away?

129
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Really?

130
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,958
Yeah, because he knew
you were coming.

131
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,500
Hmm.

132
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,250
It's Hiroshi, is it?

133
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,583
He told me he didn't have
a name, and I believed him.

134
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,708
When he came here,
he said he was looking for work

135
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,458
as a farmhand.

136
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,416
I was still just starting out
at the time, and my research

137
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,750
consisted of one long
string of failures.

138
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,208
After failing again and again,

139
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,041
one day I finally
found a sprout.

140
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,583
I was so happy, I wept.

141
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,916
And then, he wept with me.

142
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,750
He was a hell of a guy.

143
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,791
That Rock Morena.

144
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,916
That was the name
of a dog I had once.

145
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,333
Like it?

146
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:57,833
When I suggested it
to him, he just laughed.

147
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,958
"Woof!" he said to me.

148
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,333
That's enough!

149
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,625
That perfume.

150
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:12,708
Did he, like it,
once upon a time?

151
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,625
He did.

152
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,875
Which one started it?

153
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,083
Answer me, you thieving hussy!

154
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,958
He started it.

155
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,375
Hey, you wanted to know;
I'm simply laying out

156
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,458
the facts for you.

157
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,375
Shit!

158
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,458
I guess, he knew.

159
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,083
Huh?

160
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,583
That I'd go as far as it took.

161
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,166
He wants me to tell him,
that I forgive him.

162
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,125
He's a selfish brat.

163
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,041
I don't think,
that's true of him now.

164
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,083
Oh yeah?

165
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,791
That's the man
Hiroshi Morenos is!

166
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:52,125
So, are you using the child
as an excuse to see him?

167
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,083
She is his, right?

168
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,291
How disappointing.

169
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,166
You sure talk
a good game, though.

170
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,375
I don't give a fuck
what you think.

171
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:06,458
The religious
family's soon-to-be

172
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,125
ten year-old daughter,
Hana Belembauza Yamada,

173
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,875
was abducted after a motorcycle
crashed into the home.

174
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,750
Authorities are now saying
the culprit is escaped felon

175
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,458
Michiko Malandro.

176
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,500
Police describe a chaotic
scene at the humble parish,

177
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,125
as shotgun shells
and broken glass...

178
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,416
Someone you know?

179
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,791
Crazy.

180
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,208
Where do you
suppose they're headed?

181
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,708
Yes?

182
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,833
Ma'am, the police are here.

183
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,416
She hung up.

184
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,916
What floor is it?

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,791
She's up on six.

186
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,375
Ricardo.

187
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,583
Yeah?

188
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,958
Security office.

189
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,500
Follow them on the monitors.

190
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,875
Hurry up, Hatchin!

191
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,583
He went to São Paraíso.

192
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,333
São Paraíso?

193
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,416
Take the elevator
down to the basement.

194
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,041
That's the farm level.

195
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,625
I'll make sure
the door's open for you.

196
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,333
Run for the emergency
exit, and you should come

197
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:15,875
out on the street.

198
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,583
Why are you helping us?

199
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,583
Because I find you adorable.

200
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,833
A silly little lovesick fool.

201
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,583
Tell me this; know how
many women there are

202
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,958
in the world better than me?

203
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,291
He sure as hell does.

204
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,750
Where they at?

205
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,458
The elevators.

206
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,375
Aw, which floor?

207
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,750
Currently on the fifth.

208
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,625
Stop them! Now!

209
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,291
Right!

210
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,958
And keep your eyes on them!

211
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,833
What the?

212
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,750
The hell's going on?

213
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,375
Fire on five near Passageway A!

214
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,416
I repeat there is a fire on.

215
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,125
Wait!

216
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,166
Aw, hell!

217
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,750
Fire on four too!

218
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,041
Another fire on three!

219
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,416
Near Passageway B!

220
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,291
Those two are-.

221
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,875
Son of a bitch!

222
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,583
Damn it!

223
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,750
We're almost there!

224
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:57,750
Don't let go!

225
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,291
Michiko!

226
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,041
You are not getting away!

227
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:15,791
Michiko!

228
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,708
Hatchin, come on, quick!

229
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,125
Michiko!

230
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:05,666
Inspector,
it's Ricardo, come in.

231
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,166
Damn it!

232
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,000
What's up?

233
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,083
We had them in the elevator,

234
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,208
but we lost them
in the second basement.

235
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,416
What's down there?

236
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,958
That's just our
agricultural space, however.

237
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,500
The power to the plant
has been shut off,

238
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,041
and I can't confirm anything.

239
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,916
I, have to go.

240
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,166
Yeah, so.

241
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,875
Should we like,
kiss or something'?

242
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,916
It's the end for us and all.

243
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,750
That just wasn't right.

244
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,708
I got a few questions.

245
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,375
You know her?

246
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,583
São Paraíso.

247
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,333
São Paraíso?

248
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah, they're
heading to São Paraíso.

249
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,500
You gave them up awfully quick.

250
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:30,666
Sure did.

251
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,583
We appreciate your cooperation.

252
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,500
Feels good to move on.
