1
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,416
Shit!

2
00:01:57,625 --> 00:02:02,250
Someone from down that road
is going to come for me.

3
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,041
Sorry about the wait, Hana.

4
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,541
I came to get you.

5
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,541
I got a call this morning.

6
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,541
They said one of
the children was missing.

7
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,708
Joaquim Sanchez.

8
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,625
Apparently he stole
some of my money and ran away.

9
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,416
You know we can't
bring the police into this.

10
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,291
If word gets out
we've been selling children,

11
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,041
we'll all be finished.

12
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,583
Now get out there
and find this brat!

13
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,875
Don't you have some
work you should be doing?

14
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,791
It's fine.

15
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,458
And there they go.

16
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,958
Which one are you betting on?

17
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,041
Marco?

18
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:22,000
Or the bull?

19
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,250
Buzz the hell off, jerk.

20
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,458
Welcome--

21
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:31,916
You hag!

22
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:43,250
You wanna tell me why the hell
you sent Hatchin away like that?

23
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,875
You don't even have the common
courtesy to give me a "hello,"

24
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,625
yet you ask me
to take in a child?

25
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,875
And now you think coming
in here shouting insults

26
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,041
is what a parent deserves?

27
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,916
Ain't no fuckin' parent here!

28
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,666
You don't fool me, Michiko.

29
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,625
You may have a big grown-up
body now to turn men's heads,

30
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,541
but in my eyes
you're still that immature,

31
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,208
snot-nosed little girl.

32
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,875
Listen'a me.

33
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,958
Thanks to your stupid ass,
Hatchin's been taken

34
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,458
by Fantasma.

35
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,333
That's got nothin'
to do with me.

36
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,666
Shirkov the Third
suddenly charges in!

37
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,791
He's sending Marco
a strong message:

38
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,500
"You may have landed some
blows, but I'm still the boss!

39
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,625
Can Marco hold on?"

40
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,083
Now Marco braces
for the attack!

41
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,833
He's done it!

42
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,875
Marco has masterfully
defeated Shirkov the Third!

43
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,166
And who the hell is he?

44
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,916
Your lover?

45
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,541
Or is--

46
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,458
If anything's happened
to her, you're gonna pay, hag!

47
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,083
Mark my damn words!

48
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,875
Sure hon, whatever.

49
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,791
Hold on.

50
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,583
After all these years,
why'd you send her to me?

51
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,583
'Cause in spite
of everything else,

52
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,333
you taught me
to believe in you.

53
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,583
You taught me to trust you!

54
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,791
After all these years
I realized.

55
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,875
Someone who thinks that way
can't have any deceit in them.

56
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:14,833
Then again.

57
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,625
You just tricked me.

58
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,625
Shows ya what the
fuck I know, right?

59
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:22,916
If she's hurt, I'll put you
on an express train to hell.

60
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,458
Atsuko!

61
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,458
You sold off Iolanda, right?

62
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,291
Where did she go?

63
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,833
She'll be happier.

64
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,416
That's a flat-out lie.

65
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,125
You sold her somewhere awful!

66
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,375
That should be her money!

67
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,666
So why shouldn't
I take it to her?

68
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,916
Tell me Michiko.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,708
Why do you assume the worst
about me every single time?

70
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,000
'Cause it's true!

71
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,000
What's wrong?

72
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,208
Can't you trust me
even a little?

73
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,375
Greedy old hags like you
should go straight to hell,

74
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,708
and I should send
you there myself!

75
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,833
You're a hag!

76
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,125
A dirty old hag!

77
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,000
That's enough!

78
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,916
Don't--!

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,708
C'mon.

80
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,625
Let's go home.

81
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,916
Lemme go, you old hag!

82
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,333
I'm beat.

83
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,666
That nearly killed me.

84
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,500
Why'd you chase me?

85
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,458
Damn!

86
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,833
Stupid sore feet!

87
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,041
Give it!

88
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,666
Now don't you start crying.

89
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,416
Be a man.

90
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,333
Is this really all you took?

91
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,875
Just small potatoes.

92
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,666
You're taking
this back with me.

93
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,500
You can accept that, right?

94
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,041
Can't you trust
that I know what's best?

95
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,250
Listen, kid, I was your
age once, too, you know.

96
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,375
I really don't like seein'
you this miserable.

97
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,875
Come on, stand up.

98
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,583
Let's go.

99
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,208
Dammit!

100
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:49,416
If you want in, smile
and tell me you're sorry.

101
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,958
Those are my terms.

102
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,000
And that was a look
at former pro bullfighter

103
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,583
and Marco's father-in-law,
Arnaldo Santoro...

104
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,625
She's gone.

105
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,666
Hatchin has been kidnapped.

106
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,041
I know it's Fantasma.

107
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,750
Can you tell me
where they took her?

108
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:12,791
No can do.

109
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,875
Ivan, please.

110
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,833
I said "no can do,"
all right?

111
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,708
You planning to
go there alone?

112
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,875
And how do you
think that's gonna work out?

113
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,833
They still got
plenty of muscle left.

114
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,250
You show up and-- Pop!

115
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:24,958
Pop!

116
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:25,833
Pop!

117
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,375
You're swiss cheese.

118
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,125
Besides I'm sure she's okay.

119
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,500
They're not gonna
kill her at this point.

120
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,791
Least, not until
they've got you.

121
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,750
Honestly, I couldn't
help you anyway.

122
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,791
I dunno where they are.

123
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,541
Though, if you wandered the
streets flapping your arms

124
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,666
saying, "Here I am,
it's Michiko,"

125
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,833
I'm sure they'd come to you.

126
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:46,875
Wait!

127
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,291
I'm joking,
please don't do that.

128
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,291
But seriously, tomorrow's
your day to strike.

129
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,333
Marco's gonna be
fighting Romão the Fourth.

130
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,416
If they're using
Hatchin as their trump,

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,416
you're gonna need a damn
high card of your own.

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,041
You remember their leader,
don't you?

133
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,583
It's Vasily Nabokov.

134
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,375
That eager errand boy
Kiril took under his wing.

135
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,208
No.

136
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,375
Don't recall.

137
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,458
Well, he's a big,
long-haired fatty now,

138
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,125
so look for him
at the bull fight.

139
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,875
He's always there.

140
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,333
'Kay.

141
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,416
I let you come in.

142
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,208
Now smile and tell me
you're sorry.

143
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,375
Yeah, uh.

144
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,625
Sorry.

145
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,833
Huh?

146
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,791
What's that?

147
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,833
I don't think I heard you.

148
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,958
Okay?

150
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:33,833
Yeah.

151
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:34,791
Okay.

152
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,250
We're good.

153
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,541
Thank you.

154
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,041
He carries those hopes and
dreams as tomorrow's showdown

155
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,541
quickly approaches.

156
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,750
Ms. Zelia Bastos, who even today
still checks in on Marco,

157
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:50,083
had this to say:

158
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,750
Well. Good luck and be careful.

159
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,458
What's so funny?

160
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:01,583
It's nothin',
sorry, forget it.

161
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,958
You gotta be kiddin' me.

162
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,000
You are hungry, yes?

163
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,375
Is good to stop and
smell the roses sometimes.

164
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,833
Ah.

165
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,750
Most of these bulls
are tough and no good.

166
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,125
But you, Shirkov the Third.

167
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:38,458
You are so delicious
I could cry like child!

168
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,041
So what are you to that woman?

169
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,458
Huh?

170
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,375
Her daughter?

171
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,125
Who am I to who?

172
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:50,750
Ugh.

173
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,375
Michiko Malandro.

174
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,250
Michiko Malandro.

175
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,375
Michiko!

176
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:56,541
Michiko!

177
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,333
Michiko!

178
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,041
Michiko!

179
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,750
Michiko!

180
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,250
Sorry about that.

181
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:05,833
What is your name then?

182
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,375
Hana Morenos.

183
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,708
Morenos.

184
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,208
Not related to
Hiroshi Morenos are you?

185
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,666
I'm not sure,
but supposedly he's my dad.

186
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,541
Wait a minute.

187
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,333
Didn't he die a long time ago?

188
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,333
Yeah.

189
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,916
Don't ask me
to explain the math.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah all right,
whatever you say.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How can meat taste this good?

192
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,875
It's one of the
wonders of the world.

193
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,458
So, Hana-yenka.

194
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,500
Hana what?

195
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,416
Michiko will come
for you, right?

196
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,250
Friends are important and we
must do what we can for them.

197
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,291
That is what I believe.

198
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:42,541
Phone call, Mr. Vasily, sir.

199
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,500
What is it?

200
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,625
It's Mr. Satoshi, sir.

201
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,375
Hello!

202
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,125
What's going on, Fatso?

203
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,750
You tryin' to fuck me over?

204
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:57,750
I still haven't got my cut from
any of you Fantasma shitheads.

205
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,666
What's that about?

206
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,083
You turning on me?

207
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,416
No sir! Of course not!
Our bulls just keep losing.

208
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,625
You're a real strip.

209
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,250
Strip?

210
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,416
Of bacon, stupid.

211
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,583
Use your brain.

212
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,666
You're breathing hard,
something wrong?

213
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,041
Too much lard
dripping out your ass?

214
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,208
No.

215
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,708
I'll have it all ready
by tomorrow night,

216
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:17,750
in one lump sum.

217
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,333
God damn right, ham hock!

218
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,250
I will, sir.

219
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,291
One more thing.

220
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,666
Michiko Milandro's turned up.

221
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,333
Do we have permission to
take care of her ourselves?

222
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,625
I'm not saying this makes up
for it, but we'll send her

223
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,541
along with the money
as a present.

224
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,125
A present, huh?

225
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,541
Da.

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,625
Still haven't seen anyone
who looks like Michiko, sir.

227
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:49,541
Keep looking!

228
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,958
Find the bitch!

229
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,291
Moving the kid now.

230
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,333
We'll leave soon
as we get the money.

231
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:55,500
Good.

232
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,916
Just make sure to tell
that idiot Satoshi

233
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,458
you're on your way.

234
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,166
Snipers are ready, boss.

235
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,416
Recheck those silencers again.

236
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,458
And when you hit Marco,
make sure it's a kill shot.

237
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,291
Marco Bussi Santoro faces
the biggest challenge yet

238
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,250
in his stellar career;
the bloodthirsty demon bull,

239
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,500
Romão the Fourth!

240
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,208
Coming up next!

241
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,833
Inspection time.

242
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,208
Open up the back.

243
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:25,041
This is just our usual
scheduled delivery sir.

244
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,791
Then your permits, too.

245
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,250
Well?

246
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,041
It looks okay.

247
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,666
I thought we were
dead for sure.

248
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,958
It's all sticky
and nasty in here!

249
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:49,625
Oh, quitcher bitchin' princess,
I told you I washed it out.

250
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:50,833
Let's go.

251
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,791
--Mich--
--Quiet!

252
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,291
Are you crazy?

253
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,500
Once we're in the kitchen
we'll dress you up like

254
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,583
a concession girl, then
you can roam the stands

255
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,208
with no problem.

256
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,791
Michiko?

257
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,458
Looky what I found.

258
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:44,583
Wait bro!

259
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't shoot!

260
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,791
Ivan!

261
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,041
Get down!

262
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:55,916
Huh?

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,625
What?

264
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,458
I said get down, now!

265
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,833
Get that bitch!

266
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,750
What's the Michiko situation?

267
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,291
Nobody's seen her!

268
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,541
What?

269
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,000
This is it, folks, the moment
we've all been waiting for!

270
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,875
The smiling young prince
has entered the ring,

271
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,416
giving a hearty
response to his fans.

272
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,666
But what's this?

273
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,875
Marco is wearing a mask!

274
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,375
What could be motivating this
unexpected theatrical flair?

275
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,625
Whatever prompted it, the
choice seems well-received,

276
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:40,166
as he's got the entire
crowd on their feet!

277
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,458
And now from the
opposite end of the arena,

278
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,583
we're seeing
Marco's challenger,

279
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,833
the indomitable
Romão the Fourth!

280
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,875
Romão leaps into action!

281
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,166
And Marco sidesteps cleanly!

282
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:07,583
Again Romão lunges,
and Marco narrowly evades!

283
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,125
A dirty trick from Marco!

284
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,708
He takes full advantage of
the move and spears the bull!

285
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,541
But no, it doesn't stick!

286
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,125
An uncharacteristically
disgraceful retreat,

287
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,208
and Marco has
left himself open.

288
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,958
His cloak and mask
have come off and-- wait!

289
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,833
That isn't Marco at all!

290
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,166
It's a woman!

291
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,791
The matador is
an unknown female!

292
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,333
There's a cacophony
of boos from the audience!

293
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,375
That's it, folks.

294
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,208
No wagers will
be honored now!

295
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,208
Yeah that's her!

296
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,125
Target is the matador!

297
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,291
The unknown woman
faces Romão.

298
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,375
She spears him!

299
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,833
She actually spears him!

300
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,416
A surprising turn!

301
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,666
A cheer swells up
from the crowd!

302
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,958
She's taking a sword now?

303
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,916
All customs are
out the window!

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,916
And that's the problem
with amateurs!

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,166
Where's Michiko?

306
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,541
 Is she here?

307
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,208
Damn it!

308
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,541
She needs my help!

309
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,208
Cut these ropes!

310
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,041
She's clearly
distracted by something.

311
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,583
I'm sure I'm not
the only fan wishing

312
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,625
she'd focus on the fight.

313
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,875
But now she turns
to face Romão!

314
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,750
We could have ourselves
a bout after all!

315
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,708
What?

316
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,083
Oh!

317
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,666
She leaps into the air,
using Romão as a kickboard

318
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,833
to launch into the stands!

319
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,750
Has she come this far
just to surrender?

320
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,750
It's been a hundred years
since we met here last, Michiko.

321
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,500
Seriously, a hundred years?

322
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,041
I'm all for exaggeration,
but come on!

323
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,750
This is what you
call sword fighting?

324
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,416
Not exactly graceful.

325
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,041
You'll die all the same.

326
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,666
Oh, now I remember you.

327
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,166
Little Vasily,
the errand boy!

328
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,750
Michiko, horosho!

329
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,291
The entire stadium is
erupting in excitement over

330
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,291
a second surprise performer!

331
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,541
It appears to be a young girl
armed only with a ladle!

332
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,291
Romão has locked
onto her quickly...

333
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,458
What in the world are
those two doing in there?

334
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,458
Do svidaniya, Michiko!

335
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,833
I got ya now, Vasily.

336
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,833
Tell me where Hatchin is!

337
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,541
Should be well on her way to
that dumb-shit Satoshi by now.

338
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,125
Oh crap.

339
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:14,916
Use that.

340
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,541
What are you idiots
waiting for?

341
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,875
Come down here and help me!

342
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,625
Shoot the bull!

343
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,291
What are you doing down there?

344
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,666
I'm on my way,
don't let it getcha!

345
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,708
No no no no no no no no no!

346
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,125
Why can't you just sit still
like a good hostage?

347
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:42,500
Oh shut up!

348
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,958
Grab on!

349
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:45,833
Damn it!

350
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,000
Come back!

351
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,208
I can't!

352
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,250
Hatchin, get up!

353
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,000
Over here!

354
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,291
Run!

355
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,083
Um, let's get while
the gettin's good!

356
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,125
You okay?

357
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,458
Stop lookin'
for trouble you don't need.

358
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,416
What'd you expect me
to do Michiko?

359
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,333
I don't want you to die.

360
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,083
Hey, I won't.

361
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,791
But thank you.

362
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,625
The mystery woman has
rescued the ladle girl,

363
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:38,708
and seems to have no interest
in continuing the bullfight.

364
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,166
We're just getting word now
that Marco has been found

365
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,291
in his dressing room...

366
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,041
I suppose I should feel lucky.

367
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,708
No more "express
train to hell."

368
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,375
So you're actually
planning to visit Satoshi?

369
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,666
Yup.

370
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,000
Unbelievable.

371
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,291
The word is,
Satoshi's in Osso.

372
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,083
But it's a nest
for unfriendlies

373
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,625
so he's supposedly
gone underground.

374
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,708
Understood.

375
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,208
Thanks for that.

376
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,916
We'll be back.

377
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,416
Don't get yourselves killed!
