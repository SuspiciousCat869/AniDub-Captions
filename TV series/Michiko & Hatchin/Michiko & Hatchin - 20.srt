1
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,875
Which way?

2
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,791
Off your ass, kid!

3
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,208
How much farther
do we have to walk?

4
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,166
And what the heck
are you doing?

5
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,458
You really want to know, huh?

6
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,750
That's just my hysteria.

7
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,958
Hysteria?

8
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,958
Such a puny-ass town.

9
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:12,125
And I'm the one
who drove it to ruin.

10
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,875
Destroyed it.

11
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,166
Yeah, fuck this place.

12
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,125
Hello?

13
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,500
Satoshi?

14
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,708
I found old man Tito for you.

15
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,000
Yo!

16
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,833
You Tito Ducha?

17
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,708
The weaselly old prick's been
trying to convince me he ain't.

18
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,916
Just had lunch at your place.

19
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,166
Wife offered up
quite the spread.

20
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,000
That's a fine lady you got.

21
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,666
Everything was delicious.

22
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
I'm not him.

23
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,791
I swear!

24
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,791
You got the wrong guy!

25
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,916
Then she don't matter to you?

26
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,208
Can't understand a word
this fool is saying.

27
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,791
All right.

28
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,250
It's been real, but
it's time to finish this.

29
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,291
Wait hold up a minute!

30
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,541
I just had a great idea!

31
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:51,916
Ten minutes.

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,166
If he's still kicking
after that, we spare him.

33
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,083
Course, your average Joe
wouldn't be able to last

34
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,916
more than like,
seven, eight tops.

35
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,750
Be pretty sweet
if he survives!

36
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,458
Can anyone even go that long?

37
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,583
Oh yeah, sure.

38
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,916
My old man did.

39
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,583
Then again, he was never
really the same after that.

40
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,750
Mostly he just
drools a lot and shit.

41
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,666
I think I could do it though.

42
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,000
Go ten minutes
without losing my marbles.

43
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,375
Fuck yeah.

44
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:22,291
You could definitely make it,
no doubt in my mind.

45
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,708
Yeah, right?

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,458
Yo!

47
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,833
Oh shit, Satoshi?

48
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,041
Don't matter how many
piss-ant soldiers you send,

49
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,375
they won't save you!

50
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,416
If we do this,
we do it one on one.

51
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,541
Come alone, I'll take you on!

52
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,875
Yeah?

53
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:54,958
Remind me.

54
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,291
Which of us made
the first move on who?

55
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,000
You know something?

56
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,708
I been sitting here, thinking
about you for a while now.

57
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,833
Then all of a sudden, the phone
scares the crap outta me,

58
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,166
and it's you.

59
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,166
Got to say, though, Satoshi.

60
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,625
I was really hoping
for an apology.

61
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,833
Deep from the heart.

62
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,875
Good chance I'd forgive you.

63
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,958
So which is it?

64
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:19,166
Which is what?

65
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,583
Are we going to do this
or ain't we?

66
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,333
Yeah, okay, that
"which is it", huh?

67
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,666
So you're really
that eager to die.

68
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,416
In case you forgot, you only
become boss because of me.

69
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,541
Me.

70
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,166
I was the one who
did all the killing.

71
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,708
Remember that?

72
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,625
You done?

73
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,666
Oh, I'm at my breaking point.

74
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,166
Say it!

75
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,875
Say it to me straight up
that you hate me!

76
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:50,583
Casa Vento.

77
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,500
If you don't come to me,
I'm coming for you.

78
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,125
Yeah, um.

79
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,375
Here!

80
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,291
Eat up!

81
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,583
Will you please get out?

82
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,250
I am not sharing
a room with you.

83
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,625
Look, kiddo.

84
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:30,333
I don't think you appreciate
the position you're in.

85
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,375
On top of that, some
assassins are on their way

86
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,791
here to kill me.

87
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,875
Without my help, you'll get
caught in the crossfire

88
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,291
and wind up dead.

89
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,791
Can't have that.

90
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,000
What?

91
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,333
It's more dangerous
being anywhere near you.

92
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,833
You'll end up dead
no matter what!

93
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,625
I am not ready to die
and leave things like this.

94
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,708
You see?

95
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,125
That's why you got
to stick with me.

96
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,291
Nonsense!

97
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,500
Didn't you hear me?

98
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,583
This is not working!

99
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,000
Suit yourself.

100
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,000
Great.

101
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,041
So where am I
supposed to sleep?

102
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,458
No!

103
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,875
Not a chance!

104
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,333
For starters, when was
the last time you bathed?

105
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:09,416
Last time I what?

106
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,958
Don't you smell yourself?

107
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,500
I can barely stomach it!

108
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,041
How long since your last shower?

109
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,291
How the fuck should I know?

110
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,000
If you're sleeping in here, I'll
have to find somewhere else to--

111
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,208
Why are your pants off?

112
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,125
Ain't it obvious?

113
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,458
No it is not!

114
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,958
That was ripe!

115
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,041
Um.

116
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,541
Are you the Satoshi?

117
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,541
Really?

118
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,958
What do you mean?

119
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,291
Ah.

120
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,375
So, you're itching to hear
all about Hiroshi, huh?

121
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,708
Fine, I'll talk.

122
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,458
At first glance, ain't much
to see when it comes to him.

123
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,458
He's a bony-ass son-of-a-bitch
and fragile as he looks.

124
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,833
Did you know that?

125
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,791
Even so, he's still the best.

126
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:12,875
Back when I was running Monstro,
a lot of shit went down.

127
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,416
Everybody was glaring at me
with that fire in their eyes,

128
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,791
know what I mean?

129
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,583
That look that says,
"Let your guard down and Pow!"

130
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
But Hiroshi wasn't like that.

131
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,333
We'd known each other
ever since we were kids.

132
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,000
He just understood me.

133
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,500
He was the only one
I could tell everything to.

134
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,458
Even the embarrassing shit.

135
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,375
And always, he would
lend me a sympathetic ear.

136
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,166
What's that look on your face?

137
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,666
Forget it.

138
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,708
It's nothing.

139
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,750
You got something
to say, spit it.

140
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,375
From what I've heard, I get
the feeling he's not so great.

141
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,666
Honestly, I bet Hiroshi
wasn't even listening to you

142
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,000
when you were talking.

143
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,333
Probably thinking about
what he wants for dinner.

144
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,875
Or some other
dumb thing like that.

145
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,000
I knew him pretty damn well
and that's not how he was.

146
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,416
He paid me his full attention,
always listening with both ears.

147
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
No way!

148
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,125
Hiroshi's not like that!

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,708
Pipsqueak.

150
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:27,375
Why's that wretched bimbo been
dragging you across the country?

151
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,791
Do you know something
about Hiroshi?

152
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,583
I think at first that was
what she must've thought.

153
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,291
Just at first?

154
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,583
Yeah, cause I didn't know
anything about him then.

155
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:40,416
I've never even met him.

156
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,625
So, I couldn't really
be much help to her.

157
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,416
Even so she stuck with me.

158
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,291
Then you just been
stringing me along, huh?

159
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,083
Shit, you never even met him?

160
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,166
No, but I know
where to find him.

161
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,708
Yeah, where?

162
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,708
I can't say.

163
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,500
I'll let you in on something.

164
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,250
That cold-ass bitch
is still using you.

165
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,916
That's for damn sure.

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,875
Michiko told me
to believe in her.

167
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,666
And she made me a promise,
that she'd always protect me.

168
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,291
Do you believe in her?

169
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,916
Yes.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,375
I'm positive
I'll see her again.

171
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,833
Which means she must
know where he is, too then.

172
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,541
--are saying both the freight
train derailment, and the bar

173
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,583
shootout that preceded it, may
be part of an ongoing series

174
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,083
of gang vendettas.

175
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
Sources say the violence
stems from an internal feud

176
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,458
within Monstro, as well
as a power struggle

177
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,291
with rival faction,
the Heike.

178
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,708
However, that hasn't been
confirmed at this time.

179
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,000
In response to this latest
outbreak of bloodshed,

180
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,125
officials have raised the
alert in surrounding areas

181
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,583
to Level Four.

182
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,291
It's the first
Level Four in ten years.

183
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,125
The last time coincided with
the turmoil caused by Monstro's

184
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,708
initial rise to power,
indicating the severity

185
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,666
of this current crisis.

186
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Dammit!

187
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,875
Here they come.

188
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,333
Stop the vehicle!

189
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,458
Pull the vehicle over now!

190
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,208
You expect me to stop?

191
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,375
Car Five-Five to Dispatch,
we've got a rollover

192
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,916
on Route One-Seventy.

193
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,791
A vehicle we were pursuing,
about eight kilometers

194
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,958
from the checkpoint.

195
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,750
One suspect is confirmed alive.

196
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,375
A female, approximately
twenty to thirty years old.

197
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,083
Uh, the suspect's waking up!

198
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,500
Hey.

199
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,916
You all right?

200
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:38,875
Put the weapon down!

201
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,875
Hold on.

202
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,208
--Don't do it!
--Stay back, pigs!

203
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,291
Your friends try and shoot
me; they'll turn your body

204
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,875
to Swiss cheese.

205
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,416
Quit worrying and go to sleep.

206
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,458
I can't I'm too nervous.

207
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,166
But you should get some rest.

208
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,750
I'll take half an hour
then wake me up.

209
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,416
'Kay.

210
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,416
How far you planning on going?

211
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,708
I don't really know yet.

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,083
They're here!

213
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,833
All right, have fun boys!

214
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,208
Copy that.

215
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,333
You're a freaking pant load
and a half, Captain Diarrhea.

216
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,666
Kid!

217
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,916
Hide on the
other side of the bed!

218
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,125
What are you
pussies so scared of?

219
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,583
He's only one man.

220
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,166
That's one down.

221
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,083
There he is!

222
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,916
Hell, yeah!

223
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,041
You too.

224
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,250
Let's go!

225
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,083
Hey, he went down!

226
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,125
Yo, pipsqueak!

227
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,458
I'll go aim through the door.

228
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,041
If any of them come down
the hole, just blast away!

229
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,500
Yeah, but--!

230
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:11,916
Don't worry.

231
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,958
Till you tell me where he is,
we're stuck together.

232
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,041
So try not to die before then.

233
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:39,750
We're screwed!

234
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,291
We're screwed!

235
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,291
We're totally--!

236
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,958
Yo.

237
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,916
Come out and play.

238
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,791
Satoshi's lost his damn mind.

239
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,625
I'm outta here!

240
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,208
Car's bulletproof!

241
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:58,875
Hey!

242
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,166
Not going to work.

243
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,791
Bulletproof, right?

244
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,166
Come on.

245
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,541
Let's do this outside.

246
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,875
All right.

247
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:40,333
If you're kicking after
ten minutes, I'll forgive you.

248
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,750
I still think you can make it.

249
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,791
No doubt in my mind.

250
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:51,916
Look, I swear
I never meant to--.

251
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,750
Go on.

252
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,333
Hang in there,
just five minutes longer.

253
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,750
Get up.

254
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,208
I guess we were both wrong
about what you could do.

255
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:36,875
Shinsuke, what the
fuck happened to you?

256
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,833
Requesting backup
on Route Eighty-Eight.

257
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,583
We've set up a blockade
at an intersection

258
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:56,041
about fifteen kilometers
outside of Goinia.

259
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,708
Pull it over.

260
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,916
This is where you get out.

261
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,041
I'll keep my promise to you.

262
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,125
Take me there.

263
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Here they come.

264
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,416
Huh, looks like the woman's
the only one in the car.

265
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,541
That's not what we were told.

266
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,083
Goinia.

267
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,125
That has to be it.

268
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,291
Here it goes, Hatchin.

269
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,833
Move it!
