1
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:41,166
First time I ever killed
a man, was back when I was

2
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,125
still just a
snot-nosed little punk.

3
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,416
Just wanted to know what
that kinda score felt like.

4
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,208
Why are you quitting, Jair?

5
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:05,416
One day out of the blue,
I started crying like a baby.

6
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,833
So I said one more
job and I'm out.

7
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,416
Don't make any
sense to me, old man.

8
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,375
But I got a real bitch
of a swan song for ya.

9
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,458
Tricky.

10
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,000
Listen, junior.

11
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,166
I've never used more than
one bullet on any prey

12
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,791
I've hunted in my life.

13
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,291
Understand?

14
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,208
Yeah, okay, I got ya.

15
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,416
Now.

16
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,000
We got a piece of shit
escaped convict.

17
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,791
A piece of shit cop.

18
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,708
And a sneaky little
piece of shit Monstro punk.

19
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,875
All three of 'em
done a number on me.

20
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,333
And any one would be
a satisfying last job.

21
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,958
And where am I likely
to find these marks now?

22
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,458
Like her.

23
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,750
That one's been
bouncing all over the place.

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:54,458
Latest word is she's headed up
north on Route Three-Thirty-One.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,166
She should pass through
here in two days on her way

26
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,458
to Arónpolis.

27
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,166
So, which one of 'ems
the biggest skidmark?

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,541
Definitely not what
I woulda guessed.

29
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,458
Looks like he has to concentrate
just to keep breathin'.

30
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,750
I know, right?

31
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:14,208
Yet he's safe in Mãn
after trying to kill me.

32
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,041
That's messed up.

33
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:17,791
If you ask me, seems
a character like that

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,458
should be the first to die.

35
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,000
Then it's settled.

36
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,458
This is Car Double-O Three,
pursuing wanted escaped convict

37
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:03,000
Michiko Malandro, northbound
on Route Three-Thirty-One.

38
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,541
Suspect fleeing toward
Arónpolis, possibly making

39
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,458
a run for the border.

40
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,833
This is HQ.

41
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,875
Pursuit outside our
jurisdiction is not authorized.

42
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,166
Apprehend suspect
before she crosses border.

43
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,208
Use of firearms is permitted.

44
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,583
Hey pig!

45
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,958
If you don't stop chasin'
me while you can,

46
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,416
you'll be pushing up raisins!

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,625
--That's daisies!
--Open the window!

48
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,458
I've got a shot!

49
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,750
Go!

50
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,666
Michiko.

51
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,041
Look out!

52
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, sorry.

53
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,166
You know I don't like
to wait, Shinsuke.

54
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,333
What's your problem?

55
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,375
Huh?

56
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,083
Can't fight the
call of nature, man!

57
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,958
I just dropped a huge dump.

58
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,250
Had me twisting in pain.

59
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:31,250
Hey!

60
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:31,958
Wanna see it?

61
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,791
I'll send you a picture!

62
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,750
Where you at right now?

63
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,625
Want me to guess?

64
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't you ever shut your mouth?

65
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,916
What's with the crappy mood?

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,416
You're the one who gave
Michiko the gun, right?

67
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,708
Oh that.

68
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,166
Surprised you, huh?

69
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,375
Hell yeah it did, which is
why I'm done with you, man.

70
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,458
Fucking done.

71
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,583
Aw come on, you really
mad about that?

72
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,625
Man, you're brutal,
can't you take a joke--?

73
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,083
I hired Jair to take
your dumb ass out.

74
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,208
Jair?

75
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,458
You kiddin' me?

76
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,041
Why would you do that?

77
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,666
You the one who
said I was brutal.

78
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,291
After all we been through?

79
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,666
I don't understand!

80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,958
Hello?

81
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:14,375
Fuck!

82
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,000
Fuck!

83
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,708
Fuck!

84
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,875
If I said I was in a tight spot,
would that be an understatement?

85
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,291
This ain't fun, man,
Jair's the real thing.

86
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,500
What do I do now?

87
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,250
Um.

88
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,416
For starters,
you could apologize.

89
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,041
Yeah that's right.

90
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,541
I could just
apologize real good.

91
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,791
Michiko, we're smoking.

92
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,416
So, a woman ran out on you.

93
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,541
And you lose your
mind and your spine?

94
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,166
That's all it took to bring the
"Murano Samurai" to his knees.

95
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,208
Huh?

96
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,333
Leave me alone.

97
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,916
You don't know
anything about me.

98
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,208
I've realized my future isn't
in this place anymore, Jim.

99
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,791
That's why I have to go.

100
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,833
Nor do I really care.

101
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:50,833
But she'll come back to you
if you got enough dough, right?

102
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,916
I hear that's what you've been
telling people around town.

103
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,416
Yeah.

104
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,791
It's the truth.

105
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,208
With money I could
buy her a future.

106
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,541
Pick one.

107
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,291
I don't kill women
or children!

108
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,625
That's no woman.

109
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,250
That right there's your future.

110
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,833
The one you want
so bad you could scream.

111
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,333
I don't kill women or children.

112
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,291
Don't move.

113
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,208
Who the hell are you?

114
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,250
Let's just say I represent the
interests of Satoshi Batista.

115
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,458
So the fucker's
still alive, huh?

116
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,041
You're a lively one, ain'tcha?

117
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,041
Guess you're not afraid'a
me pullin' this trigger.

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,750
I like your nerve.

119
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,458
Let's have a contest.

120
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,291
To the death.

121
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,583
When you feel like you
got me in your sights

122
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,375
and can make it count,
then take your shot.

123
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,875
Miss your chance
and you're through.

124
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,375
Here.

125
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,750
Get some shut-eye; I'll
leave you some ammunition

126
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,625
at the front desk,
first thing in the morning.

127
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,875
If you wanna junk it,
I'll take if off your hands--

128
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,333
a hundred arcas.

129
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:24,083
How 'bout you just
do your job and fix it?

130
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,083
Watch how you
speak to me, lady.

131
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:28,750
Sorry.

132
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,833
Could you please fix it, sir?

133
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,916
Okay.

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,583
I'll explain this
for your sake.

135
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,875
Your idiot friend's got
a bike with a rotten engine

136
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,583
that needs to be swapped out.

137
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,541
And I don't have a replacement.

138
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:40,541
--Big shocker--
--Michiko!

139
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,916
My son's got a shop
of his own out in Corpo,

140
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,291
the next state over.

141
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,000
You can get one from him
if you can find a ride.

142
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,208
I see.

143
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,750
And where do you think
we could-- Michiko!

144
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,916
I gotta get to Planície,
and I'm in a hurry.

145
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,250
If Corpo's close,
why don'tcha go for us,

146
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,166
say hello to your son?

147
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,875
My back's killin' me and drivin'
only makes it feel worse.

148
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,333
I'm not runnin'
any damn errands.

149
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,666
Sorry, miss.

150
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,000
That's too bad.

151
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,375
Then I'll take your truck
and pick it up for you.

152
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,750
We'll throw in a nice massage
for your poor old back, too.

153
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,458
Sound good?

154
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,208
Be back real soon.

155
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,916
Why do I have to be the one
to rub his dumb back?

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,041
'Cause I hafta drive, Hatchin.

157
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,583
And if we wanna get
the bike fixed we gotta

158
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,708
give 'im something in return.

159
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,166
That's just how it is.

160
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,125
Be a good girl.

161
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:52,041
But he's fine!

162
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,333
He's full of it!

163
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,375
His back doesn't hurt at all!

164
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,083
Put the pedal down,
don't let her get away.

165
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,583
What are you laughing at,
old geezer?

166
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,958
Hook it to the right.

167
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,625
Okay, now left.

168
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,958
Idiot!

169
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,791
Damn it.

170
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,416
That's right.

171
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,750
I shoulda called
Satoshi by now.

172
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,375
You're one lucky junkie.

173
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,208
'Cause this?

174
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,041
This was love at first sight.

175
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:12,875
Hey.

176
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,208
I'm gonna give you a signal.

177
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,041
When I do,
you slam on the brakes.

178
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,750
She'll pass, and I'll
finish this dance.

179
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,791
Just keep driving.

180
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay, old man,
make your move.

181
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,041
Where the hell are you?

182
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,250
You're not a woman.

183
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,791
You're money.

184
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,666
You're my future.

185
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,833
Damn it!

186
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,458
Shit!

187
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,916
Old-ass hippie.

188
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,708
Akasha.

189
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,958
We gotta postpone this.

190
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,666
The cops are on our butts.

191
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,875
Want a ride?

192
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,500
You'll have to
leave that, though.

193
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,958
Can't have you blowing my
brains out in the car, right?

194
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,541
Fine.

195
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,208
Persistent.

196
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,416
Son of a bitch.

197
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,583
One shot wasn't enough, huh?

198
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,000
Ah, he's done.

199
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,166
Who was he, anyway?

200
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,833
Hell if I know.

201
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,541
I see.

202
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,000
Aw, you kiddin' me?

203
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,000
That better be a goddamn ghost.

204
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,000
Motherfucker!

205
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,416
No wai--!

206
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:13,416
The hell is this?

207
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,541
It's like--It hurts.

208
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,625
It hurts real bad.
