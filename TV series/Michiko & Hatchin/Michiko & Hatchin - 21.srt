1
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,625
We made it.

2
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,208
Yeah.

3
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:57,500
Almost time.

4
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,708
Yeah.

5
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:13,833
We'll always
be together, Hatchin.

6
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,791
Officers say the suspect,
Michiko Malandro,

7
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:03,166
stole a patrol car and led
police on a high-speed pursuit,

8
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,333
which finally came to end when
the suspect drove into a river.

9
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,625
After pulling the vehicle out,
authorities failed to find

10
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,333
any trace of Malandro.

11
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,458
Tracking teams are currently
searching the area for

12
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,375
any clues as to
her whereabouts.

13
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:16,791
Authorities are cautioning all
local citizens that until

14
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,125
she is found or killed, Michiko
Malandro must be considered

15
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,833
at-large, and
extremely dangerous.

16
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,750
Weather coming up
after the break.

17
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,041
Hey!

18
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,500
Hey, let go!

19
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,291
You don't have to drag me!

20
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,333
You looking for someone, pal?

21
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, where's your boss?

22
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,583
Juninho, there's some guy,
wants to see you.

23
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,833
What guy?

24
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,000
How many?

25
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,375
What's my dose?

26
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,791
For an adult?

27
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,458
Three pills, I think.

28
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,000
Then double the dose
should be doubly effective.

29
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,000
What are we doing
wasting time in this place?

30
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,833
We're going to get
their help finding Hiroshi.

31
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,541
I mean it's not like
you know where he is.

32
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,333
What ya doing?

33
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,625
Leaving!

34
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,750
I'm no help to you anymore,
so just let me go!

35
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,750
Sorry, kid.

36
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:29,833
Why not?

37
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,916
Put me down!

38
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,750
You're the only one
dumb and brave enough

39
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,250
to defy Satoshi Batista.

40
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,625
I did see a little girl like
this, but I'm not sure

41
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,041
she's the one
you're looking for.

42
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,958
I don't want to be rude and
send you on a wild goose chase.

43
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:08,875
Yeah thanks.

44
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:09,833
Now where'd you see her?

45
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,750
Was she with a guy?

46
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,333
Yeah, big ole fro.

47
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,750
Had a real dangerous
look in his eye, too.

48
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:18,750
Got it.

49
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,000
Thanks.

50
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:25,875
Hey.

51
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,166
Sir, may I speak to you?

52
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,208
My partners here
say you asked to see me.

53
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,583
She look familiar?

54
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,958
You know her Dad?

55
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,291
Hiroshi Morenos.

56
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,166
Hiroshi Morenos?

57
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,750
Are you paying for this info?

58
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,625
So, he was here?

59
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,833
You run with this guy, huh?

60
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:13,583
I just realized, I don't think I
ever actually caught your name.

61
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,666
Satoru.

62
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,791
All right, Mr. Satoru.

63
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,458
You shared with me,
now I'll share with you.

64
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,583
Believe it or not, I'm looking
for the little girl's dad, too.

65
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,666
He ran up quite the
debt with my operation

66
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,208
before skipping
town in the night.

67
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,458
I hate having to be this way.

68
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,333
But don't blame me for this,
blame your ole pal, Hiroshi.

69
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,375
You're a two-bit conman.

70
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,041
No, sir.

71
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,208
I'm the next
fucking presidente!

72
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:49,250
Suspect spotted!

73
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,333
Look out for a woman
in an army coat!

74
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,750
Back the fuck off!

75
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,833
We're at the bazaar!

76
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,500
Suspect re-acquired,
pursuing on foot!

77
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,625
Freeze, lady!

78
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,916
Suspect appears to be
leaving the bazaar

79
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,333
and entering Market Square.

80
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:56,166
She is armed and
extremely dangerous.

81
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,625
Request backup!

82
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,458
If you want your money back,
don't bother me.

83
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,625
Find Hiroshi Morenos.

84
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,500
I can't hear you!

85
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,833
Okay!

86
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,833
Much better.

87
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,541
And I promise I won't tell
anyone you pissed your pants

88
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,750
just now.

89
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,458
Police caution that
the female has fired

90
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,583
several rounds at officers.

91
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,375
I'm now hearing that authorities
have confirmed the shooter

92
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,041
is the escaped felon,
Michiko Malandro.

93
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,791
Officers believe she's holed up
inside the traveling carnival

94
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,875
at the Market Square Bazaar.

95
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,000
Escaped felon Michiko Malandro
continues her standoff

96
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,666
with police in the
Market Square carnival.

97
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,333
Officers on the scene report
the unstable woman is holding

98
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,625
three staff members hostage.

99
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,125
Authorities are urging
citizens to avoid the entire

100
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,916
Market Square district
until Malandro is arrested

101
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,708
or eliminated.

102
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,541
Shut up, lady!

103
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,500
I said, shut the fuck up!

104
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,291
Status report.

105
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,208
Miguel, talk.

106
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,750
Same as last time, sir.

107
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,500
With the hostages there, we're
trying to avoid a shoot-out.

108
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,833
All it takes is one psycho.

109
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,541
What a damn mess.

110
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,458
We're going in now!

111
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:39,708
Sir!

112
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,375
Jeez, what now?

113
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,666
Oh, the gun?

114
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,041
I'm not going to use it
on you guys, okay?

115
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,750
Now shut the hell up!

116
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,916
Drop it!

117
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,916
She broke through!

118
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,291
Oh shit.

119
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,500
Don't let her get away!

120
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,958
One of the hostages is down!

121
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,958
We need first aid!

122
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,666
Dammit, Miguel.

123
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,375
This was her gun?

124
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:01,583
Yes, sir.

125
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,875
Bag it and tag it.

126
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,041
Should make our case airtight.

127
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,375
Sir.

128
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,041
What are we going
to do about this?

129
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,875
Pin the shooting on Malandro.

130
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,833
And you forget this happened.

131
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,125
Are we clear?

132
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,375
Captain!

133
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,250
What now?

134
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,041
Word's come down from the top.

135
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,000
They're sending a special
detective to handle

136
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,500
the Malandro case.

137
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,125
They want her brought in alive.

138
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,750
Yeah, understood.

139
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:31,958
Dismissed.

140
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,625
Sir!

141
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,083
Stay cool, Miguel.

142
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,708
You're fine.

143
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,250
I'm the one up shit creek, now.

144
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,916
Breaking news.

145
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Escaped convict, Michiko
Malandro, shot a hostage

146
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,541
while attemping to flee police.

147
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,000
The victim was
rushed to a hospital,

148
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,875
but died of massive blood loss.

149
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,000
Until now, Malandro's path
of destruction had been

150
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,750
mostly confined to the police
and her known enemies.

151
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:08,500
Residents in the area are urged
to exercise extreme caution.

152
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,875
No way.

153
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:13,750
I'm leaving.

154
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,916
No you ain't, kid.

155
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,958
You are such a liar!

156
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,125
You said I'm free if
I tell you where he is.

157
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,750
Then you say you won't
let me go until we get here.

158
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,541
And now you're just
sitting on your butt!

159
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,625
Would you shut up?

160
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,750
No, I'm leaving!

161
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,166
Wait!

162
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,208
Let me go!

163
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,583
Don't touch me!

164
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,833
You listen good.

165
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,666
Your gal pal's toast.

166
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,083
Wrong!

167
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,250
You're going to have to learn
to survive on your own.

168
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,250
Good! I want to
leave you behind!

169
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,416
I'll survive longer
than you will!

170
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,333
Get back here!

171
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,666
Where's the party?

172
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,958
Damn, can't see a thing.

173
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,708
Fuck you, Satoru!

174
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,083
Juninho, man.

175
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,250
That's Satoshi Batista.

176
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
What?

177
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
You serious?

178
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,458
Yeah, I overheard him calling
himself that earlier.

179
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,166
If that is him, he's
practically a damn celebrity.

180
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,875
Found you.

181
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,250
Well, I think
I just found Hiroshi.

182
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,666
Yeah, where?

183
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,541
You'll have to choose.

184
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,666
Him or me.

185
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:24,708
Come on kid.

186
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,666
No way.

187
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,750
Michiko's waiting for me.

188
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,750
You got balls for a girl;
I'll give you that.

189
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,750
That's the face I wanted.

190
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,000
Say cheese.

191
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,958
Don't move!

192
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,666
Michiko!

193
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,208
Michiko!

194
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,333
Michiko!

195
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,041
Gods are smiling
on me for once.

196
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm so sick of your shit.

197
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,541
Hatchin!

198
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,083
Can you guys help me out?

199
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,416
I'll give you
anything you wa--.

200
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,291
Oops!

201
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:12,666
My-- My name is
Satoshi Batista.

202
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,708
Bingo!

203
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,250
I swear, I'm going
to kill you bastards.

204
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,541
What's that?

205
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,583
Sorry, can't hear you.

206
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,416
Huh?

207
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,916
Sure, I won't tell anyone you
done you shit in your pants.

208
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,375
Train now arriving
at the station.

209
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:09,416
All departing passengers
please wait on Platform J.

210
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,000
Your destination, sir?

211
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,375
Uh, to Centro.

212
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,250
Have a good trip.
