1
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,875
A photo?

2
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,750
No, I don't think so.

3
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:50,083
Your baby Michiko's always with
you, so you don't need one.

4
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,750
Right, Hiroshi?

5
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,625
Come here!

6
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:08,958
A photo, huh?

7
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,041
Hey babe.

8
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,333
Michiko.

9
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey.

10
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,041
--What?
--More great music coming up.

11
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:54,333
But first, let's get an
update from the newsroom.

12
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,125
Thanks, Pepper.

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,291
In Vermelha, apparent tumult
in the criminal organization

14
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,083
"Monstro Preto" continues
to alarm authorities.

15
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,750
Many of the group's
highest ranking members

16
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,958
have disappeared, and now
they're turning up dead,

17
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,583
one body at a time.

18
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,208
Officials fear an all-out
war with "Fantasma--'

19
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,208
Whaddya say we
take one together?

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,916
Easy, honey.

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,333
That's your tenth shot.

22
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,250
Don't make me cut you off.

23
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,583
Aw, come on!

24
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,166
What are you doing?

25
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,041
Put me down.

26
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,875
You really outdid yourself.

27
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,291
I said put me down!

28
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,458
Let go of me!

29
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,166
Now!

30
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,083
I'm quitting Monstro!

31
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,416
I went to see
Satoshi yesterday.

32
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,583
You serious?

33
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,875
Yeah.

34
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,708
No fucking way.

35
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,708
S'not gonna help
to run, you know.

36
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,166
I'll come after you,
no matter what.

37
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,583
You belong to me forever.

38
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,625
Yeah.

39
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,041
Attention in the terminal.

40
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,333
Passengers for Bus 104,
bound for São Marcelo;

41
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,583
boarding is now underway.

42
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:26,500
Now you are one hard man
to track down, Manabe.

43
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,041
Long time no see, huh?

44
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,291
What's wrong?

45
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,166
You haven't forgotten
your old pal, have you?

46
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,541
Well say something.

47
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,583
So, a family man now.

48
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,000
Drive.

49
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:47,708
Why?

50
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,541
Where to?

51
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
Home sweet home, Daddy.

52
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,916
We can talk right here!

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,666
You don't wanna be pushing
my buttons today man.

54
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,375
I'm sleep-deprived.

55
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,291
Now go.

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,541
Welcome home.

57
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,833
Sit down.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,541
Where's the little guy?

59
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,583
He's playing outside today.

60
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,625
He's gone.

61
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,250
Sure about that?

62
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,708
Yo it's me.

63
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,041
How things going?

64
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,750
Mission accomplished!

65
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,833
Alright, good, good.

66
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,791
I still gotta finish up here.

67
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,375
You put Michiko on the train.

68
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,625
Then head to Mãn
for some bill collection.

69
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,208
No way, that's gofer work.

70
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,916
I ain't doing that.

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,166
You have some kind of a stroke
that fucked with your head,

72
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,208
Shinsuke?

73
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,541
Forget who's boss?

74
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,916
Huh?

75
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,291
I don't discriminate,
and I don't play favorites.

76
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:18,250
We only need one man at the
top, and I'm the strongest.

77
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,125
You're just a foot soldier.

78
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,625
Got me?

79
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,708
Right now, in here,
I ain't the boss of Monstro.

80
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:30,750
I'm just barefoot Satoshi
Batista, the boy you made cry.

81
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,416
Chazzo!

82
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,625
Hide this somewhere
in Michiko's clothes.

83
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,250
Time to find out who's
the strongest one there is!

84
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,666
Personally,
I'm bettin' on her.

85
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,916
A little luck an'
Satoshi's gonna die!

86
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,083
We'll be there by morning.

87
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,875
Michiko's gonna be there?

88
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,125
She should be on her way now.

89
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,416
Everything cool?

90
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,666
I put Shinsuke
in charge of her.

91
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,375
Hold on.

92
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,291
She is alive, right?

93
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:34,541
Ricardo!

94
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,458
Change of plans.

95
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,083
We're going to Terra.

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,333
Satoshi.

97
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,750
Satoshi?

98
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,083
Sir.

99
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,375
One more time?

100
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,750
Mr. Satoshi, sir.

101
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:56,125
When I was running things,
I was crazy, I know.

102
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,958
I won't ask you to spare me.

103
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,041
But I'm pleading
with you, man to man.

104
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,291
Spare my wife and so--

105
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,708
What, you ready to die?

106
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,208
Gonna roll over,
just like that?

107
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,500
Don't fuck with me.

108
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,750
You took being
boss so serious.

109
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,166
All grim n' shit.

110
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,750
And always plannin'
three moves ahead.

111
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,041
Murderin', extortion,
wife-jackin'.

112
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,041
Yeah.

113
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,958
That was all just business.

114
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,250
Crazy was never part of it.

115
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,291
Your asses stay
on the hammock.

116
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,208
Mama?

117
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,166
Papa?

118
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,791
Now, unless you want your
precious family killed,

119
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,208
Manabe, you're gonna
do exactly what I say.

120
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,500
Train's coming about
an hour from now.

121
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:44,333
And onboard there'll be
a woman in real bad shape.

122
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,583
You're gonna bring
her back here.

123
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:55,500
Hi, sir, who're you?

124
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:59,458
Screw this up, and your
boy loses his future.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,625
He has nothing
to do with this!

126
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,375
If you need a
hostage, take me.

127
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,000
That's my decision to make!

128
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm the damn boss!

129
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,750
Hey kid.

130
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,875
How old are you?

131
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,583
I'm ten.

132
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,250
So you got any friends?

133
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,041
Got any hair down there yet?

134
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,500
Who's there?

135
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:05,708
C'mon!

136
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,583
Get that punk!

137
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,750
I saw him go this way!

138
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,041
Was that them?

139
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,250
Yeah.

140
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,833
You saved my skin.

141
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,708
So dude, you got a name?

142
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,083
Hiroshi Morenos.

143
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,083
Well my name's
Satoshi Batista.

144
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,750
Don'tchu forget it.

145
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,708
Got any hair down there yet?

146
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:32,750
Yeah.

147
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,708
A little.

148
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,625
I'm full-out bushy.

149
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,500
We adults now, man.

150
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,458
And soon I'm'onna
be in charge.

151
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,833
You know Seiji Manabe?

152
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,041
I'm gonna take over
his whole gang.

153
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,333
You can help me
when I make my move.

154
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,208
Take 'em.

155
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,791
This too.

156
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,375
Since I'm gonna
be el president.

157
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,125
S'pose I'll make you
my right hand man.

158
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,625
Shinsuke, you overdid it.

159
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:17,666
Where are they?

160
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,708
Huh?

161
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,958
What'd you do with my family?

162
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,708
Answer me!

163
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,166
Make me laugh before I'm
finished with this smoke--

164
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,041
--and maybe I won't
take your life.

165
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,250
Don't know 'bout your ass,
but I'm having Déjà Vu.

166
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:46,875
What is that,
physical comedy?

167
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:48,916
Can't say I'm a fan.

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,750
Jeez I'm beat.

169
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,375
I bet you couldn't sleep
much either, right?

170
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,416
Back when you were boss-man?

171
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,791
Huh?

172
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,666
That's the face
I'm looking for.

173
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,041
Just hang in there.

174
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,791
We're almost done.

175
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,625
Nothing but enemies
on every side.

176
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,583
No one you can trust.

177
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,791
Run!

178
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,958
What's wrong?

179
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,291
Satoshi got caught
trying to kill Manabe!

180
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,958
That means we're screwed, too!

181
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,208
If they catch us,
we're all dead!

182
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,458
Well shit.

183
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,250
I'm outta goddamn cigarettes.

184
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,583
Here, sir.

185
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,791
Here's the deal, kid.

186
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,791
Make me laugh before
I finish this smoke,

187
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,666
and I won't take your life.

188
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,291
See, I'm feeling generous.

189
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,333
I'll just settle
for your feet.

190
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,125
Hey.

191
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,958
This ain't a bathroom,
you filthy, little prick.

192
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,666
Hold on.

193
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,375
Did I just laugh?

194
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,750
Well fuck me.

195
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:26,458
Okay.

196
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,083
Feet it is.

197
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,375
One'a you boys
get me a knife!

198
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,583
Good and sharp.

199
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:33,958
What's wrong?

200
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,833
Hey!

201
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,583
What the--?

202
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,041
After all this time,
Michiko, what do you want?

203
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,125
I just wanna know where
the hell Hiroshi is.

204
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,583
And I'm sorry.

205
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,541
You're the
only one I can ask.

206
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,875
I know he's alive.

207
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,250
You are aware that the bus he
was riding on exploded, right?

208
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,541
Blew to high heaven.

209
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:12,541
I saw his body with my own eyes,
burned to a fuckin' crisp.

210
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,833
I don't buy that shit.

211
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,583
You persistent,
meddlesome, bitch!

212
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,208
He's dead!

213
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,333
I don't know what
Hiroshi told you back then,

214
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,833
but I took out all the
top guys in Monstro.

215
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,750
Everyone!

216
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:37,666
Yeah.

217
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,708
It was all my doin'.

218
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,791
Figured if I pinned
the bloodbath on Fantasma--

219
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,791
--then the whole fucking
show could be mine.

220
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,458
Called it "Operation:
Blitz the Devil's Triangle."

221
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,750
Got a real nice
ring, don't it?

222
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,666
I got some brains.

223
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,375
You're an idio--

224
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,000
Thanks to your rampage, hitting
Fantasma hard as you did,

225
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,666
Kiril asked for a sit down.

226
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,416
Wanted to work out a truce
or something, I don't know.

227
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,416
Didn't matter.

228
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,750
When he showed up--Blam.

229
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,958
End of an era.

230
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,083
Then, just as the
real fun was startin'--

231
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,708
--Hiroshi told me
he was up and quitting.

232
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,916
He said he was
running away with you.

233
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,541
Crazy right?

234
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:27,125
So I made up a story 'bout
dead-ass Kiril going missing.

235
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,750
Told Hiroshi if he wanted out,
he had to find Kiril first.

236
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,041
With him busy, I could
eliminate the problem:

237
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,833
your interfering ass.

238
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,250
It's your fault!

239
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,875
If it wasn't for you, it
wouldn'ta gone down like that!

240
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,791
Oh, what's this?

241
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,541
Damn it Shinsuke,
this is your handiwork.

242
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,500
A'ight.

243
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,833
Just don't miss.

244
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,333
Shoot me right here.

245
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,916
Or right here.

246
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,875
Come morning, it's back
to the big house.

247
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,875
I sold you out to Atsuko.

248
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,750
--Tell me, please!
--Get off me, you headcase!

249
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,708
Hiroshi is still alive.

250
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,750
Isn't he?

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,708
Hiroshi.

252
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,625
Damn it.

253
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,250
I don't know where the hell
he is either, alright?

254
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,375
Hang on.

255
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,583
Who's the old-ass bald fuck?

256
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,500
Just my trusty sidekick.

257
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,208
Who else you got with you?

258
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:42,125
No one.

259
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,333
Cash?

260
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,500
It's a sunny day after all.

261
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,333
Don't move.

262
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:53,250
Satoshi Batista,
we have got you surrounded.

263
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,083
You backstabbing bitch!

264
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,333
It's not me!

265
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,500
What is this?

266
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,791
I requested backup
from the local precinct.

267
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,208
You know that's not
what I'm asking you!

268
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,375
No!

269
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,750
Stand down!

270
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,000
This is my fuckin' collar!

271
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,875
God damn it!

272
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,291
If we let Malandro slip
through our fingers again,

273
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,500
we'll be writing parking
tickets until retirement.

274
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,291
You didn't have to do this.

275
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,958
I'm bringing her in.

276
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,000
Inspector, let me give it
to you nice and straight;

277
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,875
I'm done cleaning
up your messes.

278
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,208
You know how hard it's been
tagging along with some

279
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,750
"wonder-girl" inspector
younger than I am?

280
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,166
I have a family to feed, and a
mortgage on a brand-new house.

281
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm not even this interested
in a double suicide with you.

282
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,875
The last thing I need
is to get demoted.

283
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,541
I'm taking the lead.

284
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,750
We've got two targets.

285
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,208
Michiko Malandro,
and Satoshi Batista.

286
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,708
Both have violent personalities,
and may be armed.

287
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,583
If necessary, you have
permission to shoot to kill.

288
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
Be careful.

289
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,791
Asshole!

290
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,000
Finally, I get
to be rid of you.

291
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,041
Today will make sure of that.

292
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,458
It looks like
they've both fled.

293
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,375
In pursuit now.

294
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,208
Copy that.

295
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,583
I'm coming to assist.

296
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,125
Hey!

297
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,333
That was not a suspect,
that was a mouse.

298
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,916
Repeat, that was only a mouse.

299
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,750
Suspects still at large.

300
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,125
Your face looks like hell.

301
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,916
You gonna shoot me or what?

302
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,375
Just let me go.

303
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:24,458
This once.

304
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:25,291
Sorry.

305
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,500
Got my head in a noose, too.

306
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,458
We're friends, right, Atsuko?

307
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,333
Don't even try
that shit with me.

308
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,000
What's the use in
pointing an empty gun?

309
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,583
Is that the kind of
woman you are, Michiko?

310
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:45,041
Go ahead and sneer, and spew
some crap, and call me "Jambo."

311
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,541
Then pistol-whip me and run!

312
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,916
Or I can shoot you.

313
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,125
I found him!

314
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,125
Hurry up and go.

315
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,166
Thanks.

316
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,625
Inspector.
