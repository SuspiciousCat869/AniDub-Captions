1
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,708
Hey.

2
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:43,416
You sure it'll take
two days to fix?

3
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,333
Cause you better not be
talking outcher ass, old man.

4
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,791
Sorry.

5
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,000
We're checked in.

6
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:52,000
Uh, thanks for this.

7
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,833
Is something wrong?

8
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:05,958
Nah, I'm fine.

9
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,875
Just bored.

10
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,541
Hold on a second.

11
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,541
You smell like ass.

12
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,916
When was your last shower?

13
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,083
--Five da--
--Get up!

14
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,750
Can't wash my hair
with just soap.

15
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,583
What am I doin'?

16
00:04:59,083 --> 00:04:59,750
Yo, Hatchin!

17
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,875
Up and-at-em.

18
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,250
What's goin' on?

19
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,500
I can still smell your hair
halfway across the room!

20
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,416
You want me to wash it
with a bar o' soap?

21
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't you sass me!

22
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,208
Wait.

23
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,875
Did you take
a shower yesterday?

24
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,458
Wha--?
Whadaya mean?

25
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,000
Of course I did.

26
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,000
Then how come you didn't know
there's no shampoo in there?

27
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,125
Quit hittin' me just
'cause you're mad!

28
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,000
Can it.

29
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,125
If you hair smelled like roses,

30
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,666
we wouldn't hafta
go through this.

31
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,291
Just go buy shampoo.

32
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,541
Store's down the street.

33
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,625
Shouldn't take you long, okay?

34
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,000
Sorry I hit you.

35
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,166
Like roses, huh?

36
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,083
Well, underneath
the roses is dirt.

37
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,791
--So technically--
--Buy the damn shampoo!

38
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,875
Hey!

39
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,291
Girly!

40
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,458
These waters
belong to the Ventos.

41
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,083
You wanna pass,
you gotta pay the tax.

42
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,250
Unless you want us to hurt ya.

43
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,291
Hey, nice kicks.

44
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,125
No, get off!

45
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,125
Dude, you okay?

46
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now you went n' pissed me off!

47
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,458
C'mon!

48
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,125
Help me toss her over!

49
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,500
There's another salon
in town a bit closer,

50
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,875
but my wife swears
this one's the best.

51
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,208
Run by a foreigner
named Anastacia.

52
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,375
She's good, though.

53
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,416
Beautiful, too.

54
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,041
Like a Russian model.

55
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,541
Maybe we shouldn't.

56
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,375
Maybe we should.

57
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,958
Don't play games with me.

58
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,791
Life's playing the game.

59
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,708
It finally gave you
what you're looking for.

60
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,958
And it put me right here,
within your grasp...

61
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,458
Your hair is so pretty,
I'll just trim the split-ends.

62
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,208
...No, it's--It's someone else.

63
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,375
You've already suffered
so much for someone

64
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,958
you may never see again.

65
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,625
Let me heal
those wounds for you.

66
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,500
I saw you yesterday.

67
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,375
People call me Anastacia.

68
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,125
Did you enjoy my tobacco?

69
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,375
Tobacco?

70
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,625
That's right.

71
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,625
My husband often likes
to borrow my tobacco.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,458
I say borrow, but he is always
taking it without asking.

73
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,541
Still, it is mine.

74
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,791
Too bad he doesn't
seem to care.

75
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,000
So then.

76
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,333
Where are you from?

77
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,125
I take it you're
just passing through?

78
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,833
Yeah.

79
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,791
Ah.

80
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,458
That is too bad.

81
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,666
I'll give ya a lift back.

82
00:08:37,833 --> 00:08:39,250
Here.

83
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,291
I'll come by your room tomorrow
afternoon at around one.

84
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:11,625
If I'm reading you wrong,
don't answer the door.

85
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,625
...some boy in a bath
towel attacked me with

86
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,000
two of his dumb friends!

87
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,791
And they held me down
and stole my shoes!

88
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
--Again!
--Bruno.

89
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,291
Hey?

90
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,333
Are you listening to me?

91
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,625
'Ey, when'd you get here?

92
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,166
What?

93
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,500
You mean you really didn't hear
a single thing I just said?

94
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,916
I got the gist of it.

95
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,166
Get shampoo?

96
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,041
See?

97
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,375
You really weren't listening!

98
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,166
Like I said, I was attacked
by a boy in a towel

99
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,416
who stole my money and shoes.

100
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,125
That's why I couldn't
buy any shampoo!

101
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,250
You lost your shoes
and your money?

102
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,875
I ain't falling
for a lie like that.

103
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,250
You should learn
to respect your elders.

104
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,583
--How can you--
--Shut up!

105
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,416
Hey! Cool it with the crazy!

106
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,708
Whadda ya think you're doin'?

107
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,500
Knock it off, now!

108
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,541
You gonna hang
around here all day?

109
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,416
Shut up.

110
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,750
Don't be mad.

111
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,583
I was a jerk.

112
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,291
Y'haven't had
lunch yet, right?

113
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,333
Here, take this.

114
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,333
Go get some shampoo, too.

115
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,000
S'not like that.

116
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,208
I missed the boat out today.

117
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,500
So.

118
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,083
I don't know.

119
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,166
Why are we doing this?

120
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,750
Do we need a reason?

121
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:02,791
It's messed up.

122
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,750
I know, it is.

123
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,458
Am I being too forceful?

124
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,208
It's just--You're married.

125
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,416
I only found out 'cause
I was at your salon.

126
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,833
Must mean fate's
bringing us together.

127
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,333
Please, just stop.

128
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,125
You don't believe in fate?

129
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,333
That's what brought me here.

130
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,416
What if you hadn't
been waiting for me?

131
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,625
What if we never
had this conversation?

132
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:46,000
Could you go through life
wondering, "What if?"

133
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,333
I know I can't.

134
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,791
Wait!

135
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,416
I'm with another man.

136
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,333
And I'm a married man,
so what?

137
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,500
No, it's different.

138
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,708
I'm in love.

139
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:04,750
Tell me, does this man
love you back?

140
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,666
He has to; I'm all he's got.

141
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,000
If that's true,
then where is he?

142
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:10,958
Shut up!

143
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,833
Shut up.

144
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,416
'Cause I wouldn't leave.

145
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,375
I could never hurt
a woman like you.

146
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,708
So, what's your name?

147
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,750
Michiko Malandro.

148
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,625
Go on!

149
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,875
She needs a wash.

150
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,750
Sure, no problem.

151
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,166
What're you lookin' at?

152
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,750
Sit down.

153
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,208
I'd like a shampoo, please.

154
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,083
The way you two get along--
is she your mom?

155
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,333
No.

156
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,458
I figured as much.

157
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,375
But you know, they say
the closer you are,

158
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,375
the more you argue.

159
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,500
Never heard that.

160
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,791
Oh, well.

161
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,083
It's just something
people tell me.

162
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:58,416
Though I can't speak
from my own experience.

163
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,250
My husband and I haven't fought
in years, and we're still close.

164
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,750
Is that right?

165
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,333
I wouldn't know.

166
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,541
Long ago these waters
were full of healthy fish

167
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,583
swimming all over.

168
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:20,083
They were free to go wherever,
whenever they wanted.

169
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,416
Strange as this sounds,
you actually remind me

170
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,125
of those fish.

171
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,000
And I want to
swim alongside you.

172
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,000
And what is it
you want us to do?

173
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,708
I ain't so sure.

174
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:32,958
Michiko.

175
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,916
I'm in love with you.

176
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,083
Hey, Hatchin.

177
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,875
Wouldn't it be nice
to float around and do

178
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,166
whatever you want, whenever?

179
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,416
It's like--

180
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,125
People aren't meant to
spend their whole lives

181
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,833
swimming in just
one body of water.

182
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,541
You mean an affair.

183
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,708
That's crazy!

184
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,166
All I'm saying is
I wanna do a better job

185
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,708
of going with the flow.

186
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,791
Like a big fish.

187
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,750
Jesus, an affair.

188
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:17,250
Don't you go
makin' things up!

189
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,833
Then why're you
all worked up?

190
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,541
Sounds bad.

191
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,791
What're you doing?

192
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,958
I've decided to go
look for Hiroshi on my own.

193
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,291
What the hell you
talkin' about girl?

194
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,625
You ain't gonna
find him by yourself!

195
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,250
Don't touch me!
I'll be fine!

196
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,500
Just leave me alone!

197
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,750
I don't need you anymore!

198
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,666
Ow!

199
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,666
Why did you do that?

200
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,666
Goodbye, Michiko!

201
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,541
Punkasses!

202
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,541
Gimme back the money
and shoes you stole!

203
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,375
I'll fight'cha if I have to!

204
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,416
Cram a sock in it, girl.

205
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
These?

206
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,416
Sure, I'll give
'em back to ya!

207
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,666
But let's have more
fun than a fist-fight.

208
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,458
Just name it, I'll stomp ya!

209
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,208
Right.

210
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,833
Whoever can get 'em from the
bottom of the river first,

211
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:34,875
keeps them.

212
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,083
And that.

213
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,208
Well if I win,
I get your luggage, too.

214
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,000
All right fine, but if
I win I get your boat.

215
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,791
Deal.

216
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,041
Hello again.

217
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:04,541
I thought these might look
kind of nice on the girl.

218
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,708
How'd you know
where we were staying?

219
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,500
I asked at the front desk.

220
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,041
Is there other way
I should've known?

221
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,708
No.

222
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,458
Well.

223
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,750
Give the girl my regards.

224
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,541
Were you hoping Bruno
would leave me for you?

225
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,583
Go!

226
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,041
Get her!

227
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,083
You are fooling yourself.

228
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,500
How much woman
do you think you are?

229
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,000
He'll go cold.

230
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,958
He'll lose interest,
and forget you're even there.

231
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,958
He'll do to you
what he did to me.

232
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,291
Do you really want to give up

233
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,375
everything you are--For
a man who acts this way?

234
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,666
What about you?

235
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,041
What are you gonna do?

236
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,666
I'll be fine.

237
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,250
You know, Bruno likes to
think of himself as a fish,

238
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
swimming freely
wherever he wants.

239
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,291
But what he really likes--Is
for me to come along

240
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,708
and scoop him up in my net.

241
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,458
Now.

242
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,666
Let me ask you something.

243
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,458
What did you ever see in him?

244
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,958
He said, "Sorry.
He left you those,

245
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,500
but he couldn't let
you have the boat."

246
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,250
What is it, child?

247
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,041
My birthday.

248
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,666
I just turned ten.

249
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,541
Oh!

250
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,250
Parabéns!
