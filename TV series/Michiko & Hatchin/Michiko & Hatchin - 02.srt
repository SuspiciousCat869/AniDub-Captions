1
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,708
What you're seeing now is
the prison van transporting

2
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,625
the defendant, Michiko
Malandro, accused of repeated,

3
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,708
vicious attacks against
sites connected with

4
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,916
the crime syndicate
known as "Fantasma".

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,666
Though she has fervently
denied all allegations,

6
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,583
work by state investigators has
brought other serious crimes

7
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,125
to light, and she is
being incarcerated today

8
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,125
at Diamandra Penitentiary.
Many viewers will recognize

9
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,083
the name Diamandra,
the remote prison where

10
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,583
the nation's most heinous
offenders are detained.

11
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:10,375
Her only chance of freedom now
might very well be her death.

12
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,541
The capture of Malandro
by Officer Atsuko Jackson...

13
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,000
Michiko.

14
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,958
Hope you suffer good.

15
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,583
403, you got a visitor.

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,875
Prison garb suits you.

17
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,541
You look good.

18
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,875
The brass promoted me
up to Sergeant.

19
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you impressed?

20
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,666
Ooh.

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,000
"Sergeant Jambo" now!

22
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,541
Jam--?

23
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,958
Yeah!

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,541
You can't escape.

25
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,500
Face the facts.

26
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,583
Today marks my third attempt.

27
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,125
And each time I get farther.

28
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:19,000
This man who ran off.

29
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,958
You miss him that much?

30
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,833
It's like a sickness.

31
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,375
You're a slave to the sex.

32
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,958
Atsuko.

33
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,500
When we were kids I'd beat your
ass and you'd beg me to stop,

34
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,541
but the whole time you'd have
this dreamy look in your eyes.

35
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:37,250
Always creep me out.

36
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,375
You're the sick one.

37
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:42,583
Come here and I'll
give you what you want.

38
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,291
Oh, you like to pull hair now,
does that start you up?

39
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,708
You bitch!

40
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:54,708
Now tell me again
who ran away from who, huh?

41
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,375
Get off me!

42
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,291
You want some too?

43
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,416
Atsuko, you pussy!

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Come here!

45
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,791
Fight me one on one!

46
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:12,166
Ina Telles, Pinício Yazik, Elena
Yogi, and Jucelino Vilalão.

47
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,625
All have been identified as
passengers in the horrific

48
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,708
bus explosion that rocked
São João earlier today.

49
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,250
While authorities
refuse to speculate

50
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,208
on what caused the blast
or if foul play is suspected,

51
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,416
Hiroshi Morenos, notorious
member of the outlaw gang

52
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,250
"Preto Monstro," was also
confirmed dead at the scene.

53
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,208
What did he just say?

54
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,250
What did he say?

55
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,916
Hey!

56
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,916
Armed robbery
in progress in Lenteelia.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,041
Suspect identifies herself
as Michiko Malandro.

58
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,083
She's taken customers
hostage and holed up inside.

59
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,333
Standoff approaching one hour.

60
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,875
Identity not yet confirmed,
but should be considered

61
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,250
extremely dangerous.

62
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,541
This is the special unit,
proceeding to scene now.

63
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,500
ETA 30 minutes.

64
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:23,958
Quit your whining
or I'll shoot you next!

65
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:35,166
You've put on weight since
I saw you last, Michiko.

66
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,166
Fun's over, Miss Malandro.

67
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,500
Time to go back to Diamandra.

68
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,958
I don't deserve that hellhole.

69
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,041
I'm not really Michiko.

70
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,958
Yeah, no shit, tubby.

71
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,166
But you fucked up.

72
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,208
You made the mistake
of getting my hopes up.

73
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,666
Using her name?

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,333
You're gonna regret
that for years.

75
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,125
Hana Belembauza Yamada.

76
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,791
Look at her, Michiko.

77
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,458
Recognize those features?

78
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,625
Bet you do.

79
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,250
So um.

80
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,458
Yeah?

81
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,250
Could you tell me who you are?

82
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,833
Who am I?

83
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,958
My name's Michiko Malandro.

84
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:43,333
Well yeah, you
told me that much.

85
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,458
Then why the hell
did you ask me?

86
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,833
I know your name.

87
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,750
But I don't know
anything else.

88
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:52,166
I don't know why you
took me, for instance.

89
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,916
I don't even know
where I'm walking to.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,625
Hey, hold up!

91
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,708
Break time.

92
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,541
It's fucking hot.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,250
I know your old man pretty
well, I can tell you that.

94
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,875
Who, Father Pedro?

95
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,541
Who the hell's he?

96
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,375
Oh, you mean my real father.

97
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,291
Who is he, exactly?

98
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,708
That's the million-dollar
question, isn't it?

99
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,708
Name's Hiroshi.

100
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,458
Hiroshi Morenos.

101
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:32,750
Now you say it.

102
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,750
Hiroshi Morenos.

103
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,041
Hiroshi...

104
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,458
Morenos, is it?

105
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,708
Yeah even his name
sounds handsome.

106
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't it?

107
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,958
He was one hell of a man.

108
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,708
Cool as a glacier.

109
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,666
And nice, too.

110
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,166
Made me fall for him
with one look.

111
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,416
Yeah me, can you picture that?

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,166
He was that good.

113
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,250
Then he left,
without a word.

114
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,583
Not even a half-assed goodbye.

115
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,500
Then he died.

116
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
Really?

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,750
Yeah, so, I was thinking
I'd go pay him a visit.

118
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,166
Where is he?

119
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,416
You know something, right?

120
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,083
What?

121
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,666
But, Isn't he dead?

122
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,375
Yeah.

123
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,500
A bus blew up.

124
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,875
So he is dead?

125
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:18,791
Yeah.

126
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,291
So how can you
pay him a visit?

127
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,416
Do you mean his grave?
Or do you wanna die too?

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,166
Or?

129
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,333
Stupid!

130
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,750
Just wait 'til
I finished talking, okay!

131
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,833
Okay, but you
did stop talking.

132
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,208
It was all over the news.

133
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,208
Hiroshi died in a bus
explosion eleven years ago.

134
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,833
Now tell me how old you are.

135
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,291
I'm nine years old.

136
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,416
But my birthday is next month.

137
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,041
So tell me this, Hana.

138
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,833
What's eleven minus nine?

139
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:46,541
Two.

140
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,125
That's right, hold on!

141
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,041
You're not exactly
a math whiz, are you?

142
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,208
Shut your mouth!

143
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,291
I know what I'm
talking about here.

144
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,500
Don't make me sound stupid.

145
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,416
Lift up your skirt.

146
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,250
And why would I do that?

147
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,625
To show it!

148
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,750
You do have one, right?

149
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,166
No, I don't.

150
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,625
--Show me then!
--I will not!

151
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,500
Oh come on!

152
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,208
No!

153
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,750
I don't show
anyone my bellybutton.

154
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,625
Real life of the party.

155
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,916
You ain't nothing
like your dad.

156
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,666
Hey, look at me
when I'm talking to you!

157
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,708
What do you mean
you're all out?

158
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,583
I mean the tanks
are empty, what else?

159
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,958
Then why the hell
are you open?

160
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,833
You telling me
you don't have one drop?

161
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,583
A drop or two, sure.

162
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,125
That should get your bike going
about fifteen, twenty more feet.

163
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,541
There's a town down the road.

164
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,208
More of a village, really.

165
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,541
Thing is, it's
a ways from here.

166
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,208
But they'll have gas
at their market.

167
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,666
You'll pay out the nose,
but it's your best bet.

168
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,333
Ladrão's the name.

169
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,875
How far down the road?

170
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,000
On foot, uhhh.

171
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,416
Maybe like, three hours
if you're lucky.

172
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,916
Ain't you gonna
drink that, Hana?

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,833
Um.

174
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,375
What?

175
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,583
Can you not call me Hana?

176
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,791
That's your name, right?

177
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,041
Yeah, but I hate it.

178
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,333
And I saw what you did, too.

179
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,875
You just stole these sodas.

180
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,916
Yeah so?

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,125
Who cares?

182
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,666
I bet that man does.

183
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,458
He was watching you.

184
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:50,833
Nice, who's gonna
clean that up?

185
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,916
I'll get it.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,166
If you show me
your damn stomach.

187
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:59,333
Hey, get back here,
Ha--um, chin?

188
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:02,041
Chin?

189
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,166
Let's go.

190
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,750
Chin?

191
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,041
And when you heard the
woman on the bike outside,

192
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,791
what'd you do?

193
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,791
I got up from the table
and waited in here,

194
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,125
so I could protect my family.

195
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,208
And that was when she came
crashing in through the window.

196
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,125
So you then fired your shotgun
from the living room?

197
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,458
Yes.

198
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,458
Four rounds?

199
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,333
Yes.

200
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:30,541
Lady, are you a cop, too?

201
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,250
Uh-huh.

202
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,000
You in charge?

203
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,500
Kind of.

204
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,375
Inspector, we just got
a report that a woman

205
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,375
matching the description
of Michiko Malandro

206
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,750
was spotted at a gas
station near Ladrão.

207
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:47,875
The witness says
a young girl was with her.

208
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,583
All right, we're done here!

209
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,416
I remember those eyes.

210
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,250
Oh yeah.

211
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,750
Hiroshi used to stare
at me in the same way.

212
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,458
Usually it was right
before grabbing my tits.

213
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,083
You keep your ears
way cleaner than him.

214
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,875
But the resemblance.

215
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,416
Your nose is
all wrong, though.

216
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,750
And your chin too.

217
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,791
It doesn't look
anything like his did.

218
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,166
In fact, it's kinda
pissing me off.

219
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,375
Who'd ya inherit
those from, huh?

220
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,583
I don't know.

221
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,541
You sure this isn't
some kind of mistake?

222
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,125
You calling me stupid again?

223
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,875
No, never mind, sorry.

224
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,791
That's the little girl
who saved me.

225
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,500
I can't tell you how many days
I've stared at that face.

226
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,208
She's Hiroshi's
daughter for sure.

227
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,625
Yeah, but.

228
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,875
What if that's not?

229
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,625
What if there's
no tattoo on my stomach?

230
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,166
What would you do then?

231
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,250
I'd ditch your ass.

232
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,750
I can't babysit
some stranger's kid.

233
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,250
Not my style.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,500
Breaking news.

235
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,958
We now have a suspect in this
morning's appalling kidnapping

236
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,750
at the rectory
of São Pedro Church,

237
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,333
on the outskirts of Laranja.

238
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,375
The religious family's
soon-to-be ten year-old

239
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,958
daughter, Hana Belembauza
Yamada, was abducted

240
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,500
after a motorcycle
crashed into the home.

241
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,333
Authorities are now saying
the culprit is escaped felon

242
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,041
Michiko Malandro.

243
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,125
Police describe a chaotic
scene at the humble parish,

244
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,875
as shotgun shells
and broken glass...

245
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,458
I'll do anything for
the girl with that ink.

246
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,291
Made a promise.

247
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:56,000
So, do you have it?

248
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,250
Sorry, I don't.

249
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,916
...vow a quick resolution
to this heinous crime.

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
While Milandro's motivations
are not yet clear,

251
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,375
experts say it's most likely
a kidnapping for ransom.

252
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,708
Gimme a sec.

253
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,541
Yeah, I'm telling you, she
was just here with the girl.

254
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,958
No they left a minute ago.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,041
Thanks.

256
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,208
Nothing to worry about kid.

257
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,041
We're old friends.

258
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,750
Sorry to spoil
your joyride pal.

259
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,416
Still obsessed with me, huh?

260
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,333
Wow!

261
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,875
You get taller, Jambo,
or is it the heels?

262
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,291
Don't call me Jambo,
you dirty bitch!

263
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,875
Sorry, who's the dirty one?

264
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,583
Shouldn't use that word
knowing all the filth

265
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,458
rattling around your head.

266
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,125
You ever get that counseling?

267
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,958
Funny, the lifelong
screw-up thinks I'm crazy.

268
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,750
Now that's the pot
calling the kettle black

269
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,083
if I've ever seen it.

270
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,708
Pot's fine, kettle-face.

271
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,291
I'm sparkling next to you.

272
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,875
You're about the filthiest
bitch I've ever met.

273
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,791
I'm gonna put
a bullet in your head!

274
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,458
You're embarrassing yourself!

275
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,041
Let it go already!

276
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,333
Sinner!

277
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,833
Let the girl go and
accept your punishment!

278
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,041
Who's the Padre?

279
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,333
He looks kinda familiar.

280
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:37,583
Have we met before?

281
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,541
Hana!

282
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,916
Get over here!

283
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,666
What about my child support?

284
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,708
After everything
I did for you!

285
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,041
You want to saddle me
with debt?

286
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,416
This is how you thank our
family for giving you a home?

287
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,583
It's all right, look at me.

288
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,750
I believe in you, Hatchin.

289
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,958
So you believe in me.

290
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,958
The devil sent you to test me,
but you won't succeed!

291
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,666
God will have the last word!

292
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,208
Hey Michiko.

293
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,833
Little baby Michiko,
pinching off her poo.

294
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,625
Damn you!

295
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,416
Hey Atsuko.

296
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,833
What?

297
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:36,125
You know ending it this quick
won't be any fun, right?

298
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,833
Lean in for a sec, you don't
want your men to hear this.

299
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,000
Come on.

300
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,708
It's the words you
been waiting for.

301
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,625
Back off, boys.

302
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,041
You know we should do
this more often, Atsuko.

303
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,208
Take care.

304
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,291
Hold on tight.

305
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,208
Insurance money.

306
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,208
If Hana were to die here.

307
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,500
Then I would get
the insurance money.

308
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:18,833
Get her!

309
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,541
Move it!

310
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,916
Ah, shit.

311
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,083
You all right, kid?

312
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,416
Hana, get back here!

313
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,416
You're going to be
with the Lord now.

314
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,583
Hana.

315
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,000
No!

316
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,416
Michiko!

317
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:20,583
Michiko!

318
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,916
Hey Padre, you dead?

319
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,833
You crying, Hatchin?

320
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,666
I can't tell if it's tears
or snot on my chest,

321
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,083
but it's definitely gross.

322
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm not crying.

323
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,083
That was convincing.

324
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,041
Be quiet!

325
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,083
And what's with
this "Hatchin"?

326
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,041
What kind of name is that?

327
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,791
Ah, who cares?

328
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,375
It's cute.

329
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:26,708
Michiko!

330
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,791
Michiko!

331
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,333
Michiko!

332
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,041
Michiko!

333
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,666
Um, Michiko?

334
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,125
Yeah?

335
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,416
I lied to you.

336
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,375
About the tattoo?

337
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,208
Yes.

338
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,125
I know, I told you
I believed in you.

339
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,375
Yeah, thank you.

340
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,458
Sure.

341
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,833
Um.

342
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,083
What?

343
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,375
What'd you do?

344
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:57,666
To get arrested?

345
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,333
I didn't do nothing.

346
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,541
Just raised
a little bit of hell.

347
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,666
A little.

348
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,791
That's all?

349
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,208
Yeah.

350
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,958
Okay, and how about that song
your friend was singing?

351
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,083
What was that all about?

352
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,166
Everyone has little accidents
when they're kids, right?

353
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,250
But fuck that.

354
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,625
You know it's rude
to ask grown-ups

355
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,583
so many questions,
don't you?

356
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,750
I'm not rude!

357
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,000
Rude as they come!

358
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,666
I am not!
