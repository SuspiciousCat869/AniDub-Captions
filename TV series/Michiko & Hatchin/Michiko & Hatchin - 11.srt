1
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,375
Police in Terra suffered eight
casualties in a raid commanded

2
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,791
by Inspector Atsuko Jackson,
who is now being

3
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,583
investigated for misconduct.

4
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,750
Officials have accused
Jackson of taking bribes

5
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,208
from the criminal
group, Monstro Preto.

6
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,708
A startling revelation
that came to light thanks

7
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,375
to the brave work of
sergeant-turned-whistle-blower,

8
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,041
Ricardo Solo.

9
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:58,666
We'll follow this
story as it develops.

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,333
But now, a special report
from ace reporter

11
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,791
Daniela Carneiro Junior.

12
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,166
It's a sad story of
desperate boys and girls being

13
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,208
preyed upon and behind it all,
the darkest of black markets.

14
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,375
I, Daniela Carnerio Junior
will pull back the curtain.

15
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:17,583
Tune in to see the true face
of an evil traveling circus!

16
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,375
Oh, my sweet corned beef!

17
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:30,916
Please come and satisfy my
hunger with your salty grease!

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,875
Te amo.

19
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,208
Te amo.

20
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,166
Te amo.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,875
Te amo.

22
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,333
Hi.

23
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,041
Whassup, kid.

24
00:02:59,125 --> 00:02:59,833
Uh.

25
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:00,541
Here.

26
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,583
You want this, right?

27
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,750
Go ahead, take it.

28
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:03,541
Huh?

29
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:04,750
Is it money you want?

30
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,416
I keep that mostly
at home, though.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,041
All I have here is my bike.

32
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,333
It's a little beat up, but
it used to be quite valuable,

33
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,958
I swear on my life.

34
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,666
Don't hurt me.

35
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,125
I'm a good guy.

36
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,666
I'm on the road following
a traveling circus to rescue

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,416
a girl I love named Rita!

38
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,291
I don't care
about Reba whoever.

39
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:28,083
But I do care about this circus;
you say it's that way, right?

40
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,000
At least I lived.

41
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,375
Hot!

42
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,583
Turns out the tales
of an evil traveling circus

43
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,125
selling children
into slavery are true.

44
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,250
Any child who resists
is brutally beaten!

45
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,500
Hey!

46
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,625
Some fake blood
to make things more dramatic.

47
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,083
Dani.

48
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,500
What are you doing?

49
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,833
Come on, it makes
for good television.

50
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,458
Okay, Zoe, start
wide on the circus.

51
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,500
Then I'll enter, deliver
a spiel, cross to the tent,

52
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,708
meet this little guy over here.

53
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:16,291
Yeah, let's not do it that way.

54
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,291
Good point.

55
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,666
You shoot the kid first.

56
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,583
I'll spread around more
of this fresh chicken blood

57
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,750
before it goes bad.

58
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:25,541
Not the problem I had with it.

59
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,708
Yeah whatever,
I'm getting my scoop.

60
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,291
And just what part
of this is a scoop?

61
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,666
I am in charge here!

62
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,125
Roll tape!

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,166
Hey!

64
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,291
What the hell?

65
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,750
C'mon kiddo.

66
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,958
Now what are you doing?

67
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,041
Going back to Sao Paraiso.

68
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,750
You can't take my truck!

69
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,291
Hey!

70
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,625
You dumb bitch!

71
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,791
I'm putting your photos online!

72
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,750
The ones where
you're spread like butter!

73
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,083
The world will
see every inch of you!

74
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,541
All done!

75
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,208
What should I--

76
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,708
Lazy, pipsqueak!

77
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,875
I turn around for a second
and you're nappin' on the job?

78
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,458
I wasn't napping.

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,416
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,541
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,375
Go hand out some flyers.

82
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,833
Do you have--

83
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,416
You get them, ya dope!

84
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,750
Move it!

85
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,250
I'm sorry, sir!

86
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,958
Welcome to a world
of make believe,

87
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,916
floating in a
universe of illusion!

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,583
It is our hope
that the excitement

89
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,333
you're about to witness
drives you all insane!

90
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,791
So bid your waking life
a fond farewell and prepare

91
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,750
to enter a nightmare!

92
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,208
Let the show begin!

93
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,375
Hey.

94
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,916
--Whoa, hold on.
--Whaddya want?

95
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,000
That a shiner?

96
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,541
You tried to run away,
didn't you?

97
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,250
Leave me alone!

98
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,250
'Ey it's cool.

99
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,750
I'm on your side, kid.

100
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,041
Do you know "As Cinco Horas"?

101
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,625
That's my TV show.

102
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,791
It'll only take one
of my 'special exposés'

103
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,625
to save your poor life.

104
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,000
Now gimme dirt,
and I'll give you this.

105
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,166
What kinda dirt?

106
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,250
Lying, neglect,
physical abuse.

107
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,083
The whole list of
terrible things this circus

108
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,416
has done to you.

109
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,750
Abuse?

110
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,791
This mark?

111
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,208
That's where
a kangaroo hit me.

112
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:42,166
"Kangaroo?"
And that's code for?

113
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,000
What?

114
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,500
Some psycho, hoppin' around?

115
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,541
Oh, I get it.

116
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,375
They scared you
into keepin' quiet.

117
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,250
Put a knife
to your throat, or worse!

118
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,291
Well, thankfully, I, Daniela
Carneiro Junior have found you!

119
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,000
--I'll tell your story!
--None of that is right.

120
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,541
Truth is, they're taking my
picture for something tomorrow.

121
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,916
I'm just bummed about
this bruise on my face.

122
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,208
Takin' your picture?

123
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,541
What for?

124
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,125
I don't know.

125
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:10,875
A picture.

126
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,458
"Michiko?"

127
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,000
Good morning!

128
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,333
Did you all get your
beauty sleep last night?

129
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,666
Answer the lady!

130
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,458
Madam Michiko wants
to know if you slept well

131
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,791
--and are ready for pictures!
--Michiko?

132
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,958
Nuno!

133
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,250
Okay, let's get started.

134
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,583
Tell me, child, do you
have any special talents?

135
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,833
Huh-uh.

136
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,041
Well, what have they
got you doin' right now?

137
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,833
Lately, I've just been helping
look after the animals.

138
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,208
I clean up, too.

139
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,125
That's good.

140
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,708
Cleaning is an important skill.

141
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,208
Very good!

142
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,416
 And as cute as a button, too!

143
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,833
Hold on.

144
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,625
With this bruise
you're more like a panda!

145
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,583
Nuno!

146
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,833
Yes ma'am?

147
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,625
You can't go turning
our kids into pandas!

148
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,333
Ah!

149
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,166
Uh.

150
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,041
I don't think I--

151
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,958
You little fool.

152
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,500
So sorry, hon.

153
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,333
Now, what's your name?

154
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,500
Uh.

155
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,083
Michiko Menezes!

156
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,166
Your criminal career is over!

157
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,208
I, however, am back on top!

158
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,458
You're Daniela Carneiro!

159
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,791
The pornographer who lures
children into a life of filth!

160
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,166
How many is it?

161
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,666
How many lives have you
destroyed with that camera?

162
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,666
What?

163
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,875
I won't let you
lay a dirty finger

164
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,666
on any of these precious souls!

165
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,458
I'll protect them
with my life, if I have to!

166
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,041
What--the hell?

167
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,583
Time for a little nap,
you pervert.

168
00:08:58,666 --> 00:09:01,666
Nighty-night, smut peddler.

169
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,291
The fuck?

170
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,541
It's getting stormy out there.

171
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,708
Yeah.

172
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,208
Sounds like the
thunder's getting louder.

173
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,666
You seem to make
the best of things.

174
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,291
What?

175
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,916
Just thinkin' out loud.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,041
My clothes!

177
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,791
You're wearing 'em.

178
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,416
Yeah, thanks again.

179
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,041
They look good on you.

180
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,583
Really?

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,208
Dinner is served.

182
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,291
Thanks so much.

183
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,750
Looks good.

184
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,500
Dang, Hana, this is good.

185
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,333
You could be a chef.

186
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,750
Damn, you cook good, Hatchin.

187
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,375
Why thank you.

188
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, come on.

189
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,500
What's the hold up back there?

190
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's get going!

191
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,875
Awright, awright, we're moving.

192
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,500
Time to clean up.

193
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,500
Huh?

194
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,958
Gotta new group
of kids coming in.

195
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,500
So you need ta clean
all this crap outta here!

196
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,000
--Got it?
--Yes!

197
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,875
Yes, what?

198
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,708
Um, sir.

199
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,333
Good.

200
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,875
And when you've got this place
spotless, report to the Madam.

201
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,333
Yes, sir.

202
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,666
Sorry.

203
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,416
I know the flash is bright.

204
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,541
Now turn so we can
see your pretty face.

205
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,458
Kay.

206
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,625
Oh, very good!

207
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,333
Tonight we'll be
taking you to Wonderland.

208
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,208
You'll have such
a lovely time there!

209
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,958
Is that like a theme park?

210
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:46,625
Yes!

211
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,916
Theme park!

212
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,291
Well, I'm back.

213
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,625
"I'm back?"

214
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,000
You at least gonna take off
your sunglasses to talk to me?

215
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,958
What happened to your face?

216
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:49,916
Were you fighting again?

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,666
No, no fight.

218
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,791
What are you
even doing out here?

219
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,125
I'm not following you anymore!

220
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,041
Hatchin.

221
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,000
You just gonna
kidnap me again?

222
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,291
Naw, it's not like that.

223
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,500
Then what?

224
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,125
Well, I saw you on
the TV and you looked

225
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,208
so pitiful and depressed.

226
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,458
I wanted to come by
in person and check up on you.

227
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,791
I'm doing fine!

228
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,583
I'm safe, happy and healthy.

229
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,125
I even made a real friend here.

230
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,083
Gave ya some clothes,
too, I see.

231
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:19,041
Not bad.

232
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,125
The casual pixie look works.

233
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,250
Go away.

234
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,458
Go away!

235
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,208
There's a lady here
named Michiko, too.

236
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,958
You have the same name but
she doesn't treat me like crap.

237
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,000
She actually cares about me!

238
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,750
I... I hate you!

239
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:39,916
Awright, then.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,166
If that's your choice.

241
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,458
Go be with your new Michiko!

242
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,708
Hatchin!

243
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,708
God, I'm an idiot!

244
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,166
What are you doing?

245
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,416
We're leaving now.

246
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,666
Wear this!

247
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,250
While we're young!

248
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,708
Awright, awright!

249
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,500
Ya!

250
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,958
Your hero has returned!

251
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,791
I will not turn
a blind eye to evil!

252
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,916
Here's the proof!

253
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,416
Children, I've rescued you!

254
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,875
Follow me!

255
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,166
What?

256
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,833
Uh, hey!

257
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:39,666
No, stop!

258
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,000
Come back!

259
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,875
Aren't children just
so pure in their instincts?

260
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,125
They can always tell who the
bad guy in the situation is.

261
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,083
You liar!

262
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,625
Kids, don't listen to her!

263
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,708
Fight the power!

264
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,208
Join with me--

265
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,958
Sorry, ace.

266
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,125
Go, Nuno;
get the balloon ready.

267
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,041
We can't take it out
in this kinda weather!

268
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,500
Silence!

269
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,333
You do as I say!

270
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,833
Hatchin.

271
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,708
Awright!

272
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,625
We're all set.

273
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,500
Cut the ropes!

274
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,250
Aye-aye!

275
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,500
My scoop's about
to float away.

276
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,791
I won't let it!

277
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,541
I'm taking you down,
Michiko Menezes!

278
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,666
What'd he say?

279
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,083
That's her?

280
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:43,125
Michiko?

281
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,083
Oh, Hatchin,
you gotta be shittin' me.

282
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,833
You finally stabbed me in the
heart this time, you know that?

283
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:56,833
What's happening?

284
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,333
We got too much
weight in the basket!

285
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,375
Well we can't dump
any of the cargo overboard;

286
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,583
we haven't even
gotten paid for 'em yet!

287
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,750
Michiko Menezes!

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,250
You vile--

289
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,208
How many times do
we have to go through this?

290
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,875
Now, let's try this again!

291
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,583
Later, sucker!

292
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,791
What the hell
you think yer doin'?

293
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,625
You lied about the theme park!

294
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,791
You're gonna
sell us like slaves!

295
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,333
My, aren't you a smart one.

296
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,208
What the--?

297
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,041
But that won't save you.

298
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,916
You're far too adorable
for me to let go of.

299
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,041
Don't touch her!

300
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,125
No giant piece of carny trash
is stealing my Hatchin!

301
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,250
Who's that?

302
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,375
I dunno.

303
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,958
Michiko!

304
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,791
Hang on, I'm comin'!

305
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:53,916
This isn't happening.

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,166
Shoot her, Nuno!

307
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,916
Only tranq darts I got
left are for small game!

308
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,416
Just shoot her, you idiot!

309
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,583
Ah! What the hell!

310
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,375
Don't you jack with me!

311
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,416
Who is this crazy broad?

312
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,208
Hatchin!

313
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,625
Michiko!

314
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,875
I'm the only Michiko
that cares about you!

315
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,333
Don't ever forget it!

316
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,750
Nice one!

317
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,458
Bitch, you stole my cargo!

318
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,000
Screw you, bowling ball!

319
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,708
I don't go down that easy.

320
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,875
Michiko!

321
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,708
What do we do now?

322
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,166
If we show up empty-handed,
they're gonna kill us!

323
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,416
Let's just run away!

324
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,125
You ain't runnin' nowhere!

325
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,500
You're still there?

326
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,375
Just give up already!

327
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,083
Michiko!

328
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:10,625
Get!

329
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:11,291
Off!

330
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:11,875
My!

331
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:12,958
Balloon!

332
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,833
Michiko!

333
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:34,166
Hatchin?

334
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,375
I took care of them!

335
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,125
Climb up!

336
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,416
Your face looks like shit.

337
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,625
Leggo of me.

338
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,791
We're over the water, right?

339
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,333
I'll be fine.

340
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:54,708
You're barely conscious!

341
00:18:54,791 --> 00:19:00,375
Hatchin, just lemme fall in.

342
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,875
I'll survive.

343
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,083
Michiko!

344
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,000
You're right, Michiko.

345
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,375
You will be fine.

346
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,458
Because I'm never
letting go of you again.

347
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,125
The scoop is mine!

348
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,000
What happened?

349
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,041
She lives!

350
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,375
Nice day, huh?

351
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,708
Really?

352
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,000
That's all you have to say?

353
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,625
Yeah, what about you?

354
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,708
Already said it.

355
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,041
Fine.

356
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,958
Thanks n' stuff, Hatchin.

357
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,875
Hey, look is
somebody over there?

358
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,333
Well, guess you
owe me one, Michiko.

359
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,958
Hana!

360
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,625
Rita!

361
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,625
Thank God.

362
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,791
I thought you were dead!

363
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,125
Rita?

364
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,666
I thought it was Reba.

365
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,291
What do you care, lady?

366
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,750
Met some kid looking for you.

367
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,750
Glasses, likes
his corned beef?

368
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,125
That your boyfriend?

369
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,833
No! He's gross!

370
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,791
Good bye, Hana.

371
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,375
Don't worry,
we'll see each other again.

372
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,541
Soon.

373
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,250
Let's go.

374
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,791
Long road ahead.
