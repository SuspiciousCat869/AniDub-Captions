1
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,625
Captain.

2
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,791
You know she's the one who's
been wrecking my reputation,

3
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:24,083
Miguel.

4
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,416
Don't you?

5
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,166
Then wouldn't it be better
just to shoot her now?

6
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,583
Not everyone
understands what happened.

7
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:32,458
We'll need a reason
to shoot her dead.

8
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,041
Sadly for us, she's unarmed.

9
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:37,916
What's the matter?

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,875
Don't you like the gift?

11
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,500
Michiko.

12
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,625
You can relax;
it's not even loaded.

13
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,666
Kid's got nothing to do
with this, right?

14
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,458
Can one of you take her?

15
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,583
Yeah, of course.

16
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,791
What's going on?

17
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:58,333
Go!

18
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,583
Now!

19
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:03,916
I ain't getting rid of you.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,166
I'm getting us
out of this together.

21
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,250
It's all right.

22
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,666
I swear it.

23
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm right behind you.

24
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,291
Sometime today?

25
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,166
Go fuck yourself!

26
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,458
Go on.

27
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,083
I'll see you later.

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,083
Come on!

29
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,833
Get a move on!

30
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,000
What about Hiroshi?

31
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,708
We have to find him together!

32
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,208
We've come this far, right?

33
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:54,833
Don't touch me!

34
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,958
Come on!

35
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,666
Stop!

36
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,875
What are you're doing?

37
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:05,916
Michiko!

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,541
Listen!

39
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,916
I saw Hiroshi!

40
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,416
I'm not some weak
little girl who can't

41
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,125
protect her loved ones!

42
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,666
What are you idiots
waiting for?

43
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,125
Grab her!

44
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,166
Let go of him!

45
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,416
No!

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,541
Michiko!

47
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,750
Run!

48
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,375
--Get her!
--Fire!

49
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,416
She's dead!

50
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,666
Not today!

51
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,125
Behave yourself!

52
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:07,833
No!

53
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,416
Asshole!

54
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,500
Get in!

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,750
Hurry!

56
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,375
Get after them!

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,375
Shit.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,125
Kind of reckless of you!

59
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:27,916
It was not!

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,375
Fighting cops? You're ten!

61
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,625
Hatchin, get down!

62
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,291
Shit.

63
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,708
They're fleeing
down Marco Street!

64
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,416
Take them alive.

65
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,791
I'll finish them off myself.

66
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,125
My sidearm.

67
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,958
Go find my goddamn gun!

68
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,083
Sir!

69
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,583
Right away, sir!

70
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,875
Come on!

71
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,000
Suspect spotted from behind!

72
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,958
Then move in from the front!

73
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,000
Suspect apprehended.

74
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,541
I'll be right there.

75
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,208
Are you hurt?

76
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,500
Tell me.

77
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,750
Where was it you saw him?

78
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,666
Hiroshi.

79
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,041
Bus stop.

80
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,708
I think he's going to run.

81
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,750
Like before.

82
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:02,958
Good.

83
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,458
Now come on out
you dirty bitch.

84
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,041
We'll make this real simple.

85
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,416
The killer, Michiko Malandro,
attempted to flee,

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,583
but I stopped her.

87
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:24,416
Tragic she used
a kid as a shield.

88
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,625
A precious young life,
destroyed in the maniac's wake.

89
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,916
One big bullet
for each of you.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,500
Damn you.

91
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,625
It's lights out, ladies.

92
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,125
You!

93
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,083
You stupid fuck!

94
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,125
Come on!

95
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,125
Hold it!

96
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,500
Don't just stand there!

97
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,000
--Get them!
--Sir!

98
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm taking custody
of Michiko Malandro.

99
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,375
You should've
gotten a bulletin.

100
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:14,250
And then I'll need detailed
statements from those involved

101
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,333
in the carnival incident, and
the men under your command.

102
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,125
We clear?

103
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,708
Let's not make this hard!

104
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,916
Now start walking.

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,208
Michiko!

106
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,916
Hey, get back here!

107
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,458
No, let go!

108
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,833
You must be Michiko Malandro.

109
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,333
Yeah.

110
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:14,833
Ready to go back to Diamandra?

111
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,791
Can we talk?

112
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,750
What?

113
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,083
Don't touch me!

114
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,125
Let go!

115
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,416
Let go!

116
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Ricardo!

117
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,500
Cut the girl loose.

118
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,791
Not this horse shit again!

119
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,250
Hiroshi!

120
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,208
I found you!

121
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,208
You prick!

122
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,541
So you haven't forgotten me?

123
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,333
That's good.

124
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:03,666
You've grown your hair out.

125
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,250
I've been chasing you
a long time.

126
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,708
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,458
Is that all?

128
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:17,333
So, what now?

129
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,791
Hatchin.

130
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,750
This is your dad.

131
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,708
Nice to meet you.

132
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,666
Something's not right.

133
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,041
Hey, come on!

134
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,583
Open up!

135
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,041
You got any idea what
fucking time it is?

136
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,250
None at all.

137
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,291
Now listen up.

138
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,875
We need us a plane.

139
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,375
Can you help us out, or what?

140
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,958
In the morning's,
the best I can do.

141
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,833
So, there's three of you?

142
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,833
Just two.

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,250
You folks in the mood
for some breakfast?

144
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,791
--Sure.
--Then come help.

145
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,791
You should eat
it's a long flight.

146
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,125
Do I call you Hatchin, or--?

147
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,333
No, please don't.

148
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,500
I'll help.

149
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,083
Nah, I got it.

150
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,208
You even know how to cook?

151
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,916
Best in the world, you kidding?

152
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,625
Funny, cause I've
never seen you--

153
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,166
Then prepare to have
your mind blown.

154
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,458
What's up your butt?

155
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,375
What were you thinking?

156
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,625
About what?

157
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,541
I don't need him
in my life, okay?

158
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,750
Hatchin.

159
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:31,833
Once this all shakes out,
I'll come see you.

160
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,208
It's not "goodbye,"
it's "see you later."

161
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,375
I promise, Hatchin.

162
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,333
Hiroshi.

163
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:03,791
You stick with her,
and I swear you'll be happy.

164
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,958
I swear to god.

165
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,208
Yeah.

166
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,291
You believe it so I will.

167
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,333
You promised me, Michiko.

168
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,875
You promised this
wasn't really goodbye.

169
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,500
Land this thing!

170
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,625
--Hey! Calm down!
--I need out!

171
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,500
You're rocking the plane!

172
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,833
Let me go!

173
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,416
Let me go!

174
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,166
We'll need ten more pastéis.

175
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,000
If you can, Hana?

176
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:37,875
Sure.

177
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,291
Coming up!

178
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,083
Every day, from nine in the
morning to eight at night,

179
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,666
this is what I do.

180
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,625
I got another package from
an unknown sender today.

181
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,041
It was the sixth one.

182
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,250
The first one arrived
two weeks ago.

183
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,333
It was some incredibly
garish underthings.

184
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,208
They were so hideous.

185
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,041
I could never wear them.

186
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,083
And why were they so big?

187
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,541
I spend my rare days off
like this, with my son.

188
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:43,166
The boy's father only lasted
three months before it was over.

189
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,791
Hey!

190
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,916
As for who he
takes after, well.

191
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,750
Let's just say
he's wild and a handful.

192
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,541
But I'll admit.

193
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,375
Occasionally, there are times
when I feel a bit lonely.

194
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,291
In a surprise turn, escaped
convict Michiko Malandro

195
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,791
has turned herself in.

196
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,958
Authorities say they will
keep a much tighter watch

197
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,166
on the escapee, and pursue
convictions on any crimes

198
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,750
committed while
she was on the run.

199
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,333
What's going on?

200
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,833
Crossing the border.

201
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,833
I can see it now.

202
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,541
We'll fill the void.

203
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,958
That great big, ten-year void.

204
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:44,000
That man, burning with hope,
professing his love for family,

205
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,916
ended up running off with
some new woman before long.

206
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,166
Was I hurt?

207
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,083
Well, I don't think my
feelings were ever there

208
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,875
in the first place.

209
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,458
Yes!

210
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:05,458
Still though, I kind of
felt like an empty shell.

211
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:19,541
It was just a crazy idea.

212
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,916
But I wrote a letter,
to Michiko.

213
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,083
But a few days later
it came right back.

214
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,958
"Undeliverable".

215
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,708
"No longer at that address,"
or something.

216
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,750
The handwriting
was pretty sloppy.

217
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:53,791
Sloppy, writing?

218
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,291
Wait a second.

219
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,000
Could it?

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,250
No doubt about it.

221
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,375
It was a path
leading straight to me.

222
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:42,708
Just then, I felt a jolt!

223
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,708
It was from down this road.

224
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,000
That's the way she'd be coming.

225
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:13,291
So, how far should we
go this time?

226
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,333
Michiko?
