1
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,083
Okay!

2
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,875
Say "Cheese."

3
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,208
Not what I am expecting.

4
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,083
Young lady, so beautiful.

5
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,666
Boy looks good, also.

6
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,041
One shot together.

7
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,125
For make memories, yes?

8
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,791
Michiko!

9
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,750
Wait for me there.

10
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,041
You're going alone?

11
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,875
No telling what kind
of place I'm walking into.

12
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,250
It's fine.

13
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
Don't worry about me;
I'll wrap this up real quick.

14
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,250
Be right back.

15
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,333
All people have dream.

16
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,000
Come here make dream come true.

17
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,000
Want I.D.

18
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,375
and passport.

19
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,208
This cheapest city
in world, small price pay.

20
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,333
Qián.

21
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:40,916
He saying money first.

22
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,583
Got it right--

23
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,083
Old man, listen to me.

24
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:03,000
I must of been pickpocketed.

25
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:07,333
No shit, I had the cash just
a second ago, I swear to you!

26
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,458
Look right here!

27
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,166
This the eye of a liar?

28
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:14,375
Does he get a word I'm saying?

29
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,208
Not problem.

30
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,000
Seem you have hard luck,
not you fault.

31
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,041
Ok pretty lady find
way make money fast.

32
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,958
Rub some, get rub some.

33
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,625
Make lot, qián.

34
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:28,000
We sympathize with
the situation you're in.

35
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,250
But what kind of chumps
would we be just to smile

36
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,041
and hand over I.D.s without
some kind of payment?

37
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:35,708
We are still trying
to run a business here.

38
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,583
A month on your back should
get you on your feet again.

39
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,375
You guys in this together?

40
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,041
Fucking dicks!

41
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,666
Not matter how
lose money, you pay--!

42
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,750
Hey, Michiko?

43
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,541
Excuse me!

44
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,791
Sir!

45
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,541
"Dong gong, sea gong?"

46
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,958
You look lost kid?

47
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,666
Come with me.

48
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,708
Let go of me!

49
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,416
Where are you taking me?

50
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,541
Go through the market
to the main street.

51
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:14,708
Get away from here.

52
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,458
Yeah but, my friend.

53
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,666
Oh god!

54
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,708
Are you a girl?

55
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,250
All the more reason.

56
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,541
Watch your step.

57
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,166
You know what that's about?

58
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,875
The mother's right over there.

59
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,875
She's trying to get
someone to step on her baby

60
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,750
so she can shake them
down for money.

61
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,291
This place is hell.

62
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,208
And especially unkind
to outsiders like you.

63
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:44,166
So, go on.

64
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,541
I'm so lost.

65
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,875
Hold up.

66
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,500
Thought I told you
to get outta here.

67
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,583
I don't know what your deal is,
but you'd best leave before

68
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,208
something bad happens.

69
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,708
I'll take you to your room.

70
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,416
What's the hotel?

71
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,666
No, you don't have to.

72
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,625
What's the name of the place?

73
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,416
I'm not real sure,
the sign's in Chinese.

74
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,708
Then draw it for me.

75
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,250
Just try to remember it
as best you can.

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Thank you, but I'm sure
I'll be all right.

77
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,000
That market you were in?

78
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,250
It's the turf of
the Heike syndicate.

79
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,666
Not a place a tourist
wants to wander.

80
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,625
I brought some tea.

81
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:23,208
Can't make it out.

82
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,791
Sorry.

83
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:25,708
It's just.

84
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,708
I came here with someone.

85
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,583
But she went off on
her own a while ago

86
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,208
and hasn't made it back yet.

87
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,958
She was having some
I.D.s made for us.

88
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,916
While I was looking for her.

89
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,250
I spotted the man who
took her to go get them,

90
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,875
and I tried to follow him.

91
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,041
But, I lost him.

92
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,125
Oh, wait!

93
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,958
While you were out, did you
happen to see this woman?

94
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:00,500
Ah!

95
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,041
Smile!

96
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,625
Michiko!

97
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,791
Knock it off!

98
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,291
It'll be all right.

99
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,458
But let's eat first, okay?

100
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,291
Bebel, sit down and join us.

101
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,375
All right.

102
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,666
I'll check around before work,

103
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,208
ask if any of the
Heike have seen her.

104
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,916
Look after our guest
while I'm out, Bebel, okay?

105
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,333
Sure.

106
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,000
Now, please eat.

107
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,416
If he says it'll be
all right, it will be.

108
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,250
It'll work out fine,
so just let us guys

109
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,666
handle everything, okay?

110
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,791
Whoops!

111
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,916
Yeah, what?

112
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,583
"Us guys?"

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,791
Um, yeah!

114
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,041
Why are you making that face?

115
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,375
While we're at it, what's with
the raggedy-ass boy's haircut?

116
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,708
Like seriously, do you just not
give a shit how ghetto you look?

117
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,958
Everything about you
just screams slob!

118
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,750
It's like; I can't
even look at you!

119
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:35,541
No slouching!

120
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,208
Stand up straight!

121
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,958
You really are
ghetto trash, aren't you?

122
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,958
Like that skank you're with.

123
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,791
What if I were homeless, huh?

124
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,083
Maybe I like being a slob!

125
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:59,000
The ugly he-girl yelled
at me like a big meanie!

126
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,041
Don't think you'll
get off that easy.

127
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,625
There's more to do.

128
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,625
That's right.

129
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,291
It's my dad.

130
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,958
He's not gay, if that's
what you're thinking.

131
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,208
He's a dan actor.

132
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,916
The best there is,
hands down!

133
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,666
And I'm going to be a
female-role-playing star,

134
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,375
too, just like him!

135
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,666
Nei Feng-yi, steals the scenes!

136
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,875
And you will see, that nobody
else does it better than he!

137
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:49,916
He's a world-famous superstar.

138
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,750
But he's something
more than that.

139
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,750
Dad's a real man among men!

140
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,416
You get me?

141
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,666
See, back in the day, when I
was little, he was never home.

142
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,250
He was a low-life bum
who was always off

143
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,875
getting drunk somewhere.

144
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,458
But things changed.

145
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,791
When mom died and left the two
of us on our own, Dad said he'd

146
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,666
straighten up to protect me,
and he became a real father.

147
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,375
Now he's always there.

148
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Got nothing to worry about.

149
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,875
He'll come through for you too.

150
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,291
I believe in him!

151
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,250
No, scratch that!

152
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,541
"Believe" is a lame
word for what I feel.

153
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,166
But if he says
he'll do something,

154
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,083
you can be sure he'll do it.

155
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,708
Every friggin' day, it just
gets blurrier and blurrier.

156
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,375
Fact, I can't see
a damn thing out of it.

157
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,166
It's like I bumped my noggin.

158
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,166
Been popping
painkillers like candy.

159
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,958
Can't even think without them.

160
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:56,000
Anyway, what I want
to ask you is simple.

161
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,708
I'm looking' for my boss.

162
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,375
Can you find him for me?

163
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,125
I can pay you real nice-like.

164
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,625
Just one catch.

165
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,666
I need the sly bastard alive,
and that's no joke.

166
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,791
I figured he'd stay away
from Monstro territory,

167
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,583
but now I can't find
his punk ass anywhere.

168
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:17,625
Excuse me, got a package
from Nei Feng-yi for ya, Boss.

169
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,208
So.

170
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,625
Let's say you do find yourself
in charge of the Monstro group.

171
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,541
We don't need
your handsome payment.

172
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:26,416
What we want is to do
business openly on your turf.

173
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,416
And we would like to pay Monstro
nothing for this privilege.

174
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,666
Understand?

175
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,208
We will never fall
under Monstro's umbrella.

176
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,333
Starting right now,
Monstro and Heike,

177
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,333
we are the best of friends.

178
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,916
When you are in a jam, no longer
must you turn to the gods.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,958
You come to your friends.

180
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,625
Well, "friend", can you
help me outta this jam?

181
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,708
Shinsuke, brah--.

182
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,208
You do see that
I'm hurting' real bad?

183
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,916
So will he.

184
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,875
Ni hao!

185
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,625
Thank you for waiting.

186
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,875
You picked out a fine bird.

187
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,166
It's first-rate!

188
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,750
I'm listening,
so start talking.

189
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,333
If my information
is wrong, forgive me.

190
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,166
But I hear that your people
may have snatched up

191
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,333
a young woman yesterday.

192
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,500
Seems she's with a little girl
I've come to know recently.

193
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,208
Could I possibly
ask you to free her?

194
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,583
You know I am truly enraptured
by your angelic singing voice.

195
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,291
And this duck you've
given me is quite delicious.

196
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,500
Can you believe how
I am devouring it?

197
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,833
I should stop,
but it is too divine.

198
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:54,375
Since it's too late
to give it back.

199
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,625
Are you performing tonight?

200
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,875
Yes.

201
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,208
I suppose I have kept
you waiting long enough

202
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,291
Okay!

203
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,250
I'll arrange for
this woman to undergo

204
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,333
a contest of chance, yes?

205
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,791
We will let them
decide her fate.

206
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,041
Even we are too afraid
to go against them.

207
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,000
They'll get their revenge.

208
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,041
Rock, paper, scissor,
three rounds!

209
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,333
It'll be nice and quick.

210
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,125
Woman!

211
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,875
Rock, paper, scissor!

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,625
I ain't playing no game!

213
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,250
Oh, we not playing around.

214
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,125
Your life is on the line here!

215
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,416
Wen!

216
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,958
You, huh?

217
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,291
Look.

218
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,000
That's what I'll play first.

219
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,416
I'm not trying
to trick you, I promise.

220
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,250
Ready?

221
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,458
Here we go!

222
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,208
Rock--

223
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,625
Yo, bitch, quit fucking around
before I smash your face!

224
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,291
Oh, shove it up your ass!

225
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,958
Listen, this is one of Dad's.

226
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,083
He's a master of
every aspect of the dan.

227
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,583
Guaranteed to wipe
that dumb frown away.

228
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,333
What the hell?

229
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,416
Something awful must
of happened to Dad!

230
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,333
Let's go!

231
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,166
Grab a weapon, too.

232
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,291
Come on!

233
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,500
I give up!

234
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:35,250
It's completely hopeless!

235
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,166
Hope! Less!

236
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,458
Don't you believe in him?

237
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:43,916
You're a man, right?

238
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,833
I guess, but you saw.

239
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,333
I fell and my stick broke!

240
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,916
Everything's going to be fine!

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,666
I can feel it, okay?

242
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,916
Hold on!

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,458
I'll stand in for her.

244
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,583
You'll what?

245
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,666
What the hell does that mean?

246
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,791
Do with me,
what you'd do with her.

247
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,083
So you think,
we should whore you out?

248
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,125
Instead of this
feisty little minx?

249
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,125
Is that it?

250
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,458
That's correct.

251
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,708
Any man who heard you sing
would fall instantly in love.

252
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,833
You'd be our
most popular escort.

253
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,166
But I really don't want
to see you like that, Nei;

254
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,166
and I'd give you a pass if
I could, but my hands are tied.

255
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,291
It would set
a very bad precedent.

256
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,375
Not to mention, people
would say I'd gone queer

257
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,333
for the tranny songbird.

258
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,958
Put on a blindfold and run
from one end to the other.

259
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,416
A simple chicken race.

260
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,208
All you have to do is run.

261
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,125
And hope the god
of victory smiles upon you.

262
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,041
Do that, and I
forget everything.

263
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,750
Clean slate.

264
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,250
Fine, I accept.

265
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:01,291
Someone fetch a rope
and tie the woman to Nei.

266
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:06,583
Your precious damsel and I, will
both be gambling on the gods.

267
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,208
Ladies and gentlemen: Tonight's
opera, "The Peacock Wooed

268
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,666
by the Duck," is scheduled
to begin at this time.

269
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,708
However, the arrival
of Nei Fong-yi,

270
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:17,083
pride and star of Seentwan,
has been unexpectedly delayed.

271
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,625
The performance will
begin very, very shortly.

272
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,625
We ask that you
please remain patient.

273
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you.

274
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,458
You ready?

275
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,250
We won't die here, assholes!

276
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,375
We won your fucking game!

277
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,625
Now you can honor
your deal or die!

278
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,541
Guan Yu, god of war!

279
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,291
Furious in the face of defeat.

280
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,625
What a foolish god!

281
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,541
Did she ask you for help?

282
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,541
No, it was me who
wanted to play the hero.

283
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,166
Scared me shitless.

284
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,375
Well, it didn't show.

285
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,000
So thanks.

286
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,083
Hey, come on!
You got to hurry!

287
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,083
What are you doing here?

288
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,458
You should be at home.

289
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,750
I told you to look
after our guest, right?

290
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,458
I'm sorry, Dad.

291
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:38,708
But still.

292
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,750
How many times I got
to tell you something?

293
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,708
Did I not tell you
to wait for me?

294
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,583
And I told you
not to worry, too!

295
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,750
Right?

296
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,250
Why are you always
running off on your own,

297
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,375
getting into trouble and causing
me all kinds of headaches?

298
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm running out
of goddamn lives here

299
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,583
and it's all your fault, missy!

300
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,458
You hear me? Your fault!

301
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:21,041
Ladies and gentlemen,
we thank you for your patience.

302
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,958
Michiko, I'm sorry.
