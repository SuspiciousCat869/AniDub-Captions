1
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:49,375
Hat-chin.

2
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,375
Hatchin, hm?

3
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,666
"They don't look special;
just shiny rocks."

4
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,000
That's what you're
thinking, right?

5
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,208
Yeah.

6
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:14,000
I can assure you if you
keep thinking that,

7
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,875
you'll never experience the true
magic each stone holds within.

8
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,833
This one is known
as a "Força Piedra"

9
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,916
It's a kind of miracle stone.

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,458
Keep it in your pocket
wherever you go to drive away

11
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,250
all manner of evil.

12
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:30,333
And, if you like that,
you'll love this.

13
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,166
Dirt from under the
fingernails of God.

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,333
Add it to boiling
water, drink up,

15
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,708
and you'll get
supernatural powers.

16
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,458
Mostly. Results may vary.

17
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,375
What's this old lady's story?

18
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,666
They say she speaks
to the spirits.

19
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,041
Come here!

20
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,916
What?

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,250
On your lap?

22
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:51,500
They're all outta chairs,
what's the friggin deal?

23
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,041
No thanks.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,583
Why you giving me a face
like I'm some kinda

25
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,708
common street criminal?

26
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:03,750
I always have this face.

27
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,083
Such a pity.

28
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:07,333
A person isn't just
born with a face like that.

29
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,000
It grows from within.

30
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,541
You got that?

31
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,541
A person's face reflects the
energy they keep inside of them.

32
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,000
And yours has some
deep dark juju indeed.

33
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:17,666
Really?

34
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,833
That bad?

35
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,041
Bad is too soft,
she's the worst I've seen!

36
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,666
What do we do, Hatchin?

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,833
She says you're
the worst ever.

38
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,625
Now that you understand,
what would you say,

39
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,458
if I could read your futures?

40
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,250
Help you dodge any darkness
that might escape from her

41
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,708
and harm you both?

42
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,833
You'd want to
hear that, right?

43
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,500
You're serious?

44
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,291
Yeah, but it'll cost you.

45
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,916
What, is something wrong?

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,875
He's somewhere in this city.

47
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,375
Hiroshi, I mean.

48
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,208
It's all coming together.

49
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,666
Ah, shit!

50
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,083
That's the
fingernail dirt working!

51
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,333
See!

52
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:01,291
You really believe that lady?

53
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,625
Seems legit to me, here catch.

54
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,333
"Força Pedra" for ya!

55
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,041
All yours honey.

56
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,833
This ain't no act,
little girl!

57
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:28,166
These rolled back eyes,
are windows into the trance!

58
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,833
My spirit is venturing
onto the astral plane!

59
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,166
Now I'm flying!

60
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,166
Ahhh!

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,375
Higher and higher!

62
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,708
I'm up among
the Constellations!

63
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,458
I'm one with
the river of time!

64
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,333
I'm traveling to your future!

65
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,375
My future?

66
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,041
Yes, you!

67
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:48,125
You're looking
for someone, I see.

68
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,125
A man!

69
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,375
A man?

70
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,416
Yes.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,166
I can see the
man's glowing aura!

72
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,125
Aura?

73
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,166
It's him!

74
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,916
The man you're looking for!

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,291
Oh, joy of joys!

76
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,583
Now I see a house!

77
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,750
Two kids!

78
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,166
A happy family!

79
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,291
When's this happen?

80
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,333
Where is he?

81
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,875
This future is near!

82
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,208
All you must do is try,
and your fates will meet!

83
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,666
--And you, child!
--What?

84
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,250
I see you too!

85
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,250
I see your right foot!

86
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,375
A small misfortune to it.

87
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,791
Will cause a greater one!

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,791
Stop!

89
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,166
Do not chase
the one who flees!

90
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,125
Don't go!

91
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,791
Don't climb the mountain!

92
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,166
I hear gunshots!

93
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,625
Death by the ocean!

94
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:34,666
You will die!

95
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,708
You!

96
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,833
Will!

97
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,708
Die!

98
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:47,375
Yeah, so, uh, those magic
stones do work, right?

99
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,375
Haven't failed me yet.

100
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,458
They'll protect her?

101
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,125
Sure.

102
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,875
Like, save her life and stuff?

103
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,625
Why of course.

104
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,041
Do not waste your
money on that junk!

105
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,791
How about I throw in
the fingernail dirt?

106
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,041
We'll call it the
"Happy Ending Combo Pack",

107
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,375
and I'll go
twenty percent off!

108
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,041
This is stupid,
I don't need it!

109
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,291
Hatchin, wait!

110
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,208
Hold on!

111
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,333
Where you think
you're going?

112
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,000
Do whatever
you want, Michiko.

113
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,833
I'm fed up with all of your--

114
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,333
Poop?

115
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,208
Hey, that's your right foot.

116
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,416
See, Hatchin!

117
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,250
The old lady knows what
she's talking about.

118
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,875
Now get back here!

119
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,625
Fine!

120
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,208
Yo, Hatchin.

121
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,875
Let's go out, huh?

122
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm not going.

123
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,916
Okay.

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,208
Just to be safe though,
don't leave until I get back.

125
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,541
You hear me, girl?

126
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,041
Yeah.

127
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,291
Yo!

128
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,291
Yo, Hatchin.

129
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,458
Welcome back.

130
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,500
What?

131
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,791
What happened?

132
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:38,875
Got this.

133
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,458
It's Hiroshi.

134
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,583
That's him, Hiroshi?

135
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,291
Yeah, your father, remember?

136
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,458
Anyway, I found this street
artist who sketched him for me.

137
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:54,083
Pretty good, huh?

138
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,666
Oh, and I got you those.

139
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,875
Try them on.

140
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,625
What's going on?

141
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,666
With this picture.

142
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,041
We'll find him easy!

143
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,250
Right?

144
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,708
No! With the shoes!

145
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,041
How did you get these shoes?

146
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,208
I found them.

147
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,875
Where was that?

148
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,458
A shoe store.

149
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,916
And did you pay for the shoes?

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,250
Or, did you just take them?

151
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,500
Did you?

152
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,333
Umm.

153
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,291
Did you steal them?

154
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,375
These insinuations are
bullshit you know that?

155
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,333
The shoe store
guy gave them to me.

156
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,083
As a free shoe
Sample Day, thingy.

157
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,083
Aw, man.

158
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,916
Now where'd that
girl run off to?

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
Hang on!

160
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,166
Hi there.

161
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,833
What food you want?

162
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,500
No, I wanna work here.

163
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,416
Please.

164
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,166
I no hire little kid.

165
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,416
I'll work really hard.

166
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,125
Everyone always say that.

167
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,708
Even grown-up people.

168
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,625
But no one ever
keep up with me.

169
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,541
And you know why?

170
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,291
It because Lam Yin
kitchen master!

171
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:56,541
Now please get hell out.

172
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,583
I'm not leaving!

173
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,083
How do you know that
I'm not some kind of

174
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,750
kitchen master, also?

175
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,625
You can't kick me out until
you at least let me show you!

176
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,083
Please just give me a chance.

177
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,166
What your name, kid?

178
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,500
It's Hana More-, Hana.

179
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,041
Hana-more-hana?

180
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,291
No, just... Hana.

181
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,750
Have ID?

182
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,458
I don't.

183
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,541
Why you waste my time?

184
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,083
Wait hold on!

185
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,875
Why you no have shoes on?

186
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:29,791
Because.

187
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,458
I haven't paid for them yet.

188
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,666
That's why I need to get a job.

189
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,416
You right before
I should not kick you out.

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,291
I should give you
try out first.

191
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,458
Since you still just
a baby, I give you only

192
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:50,833
half normal wages for day,
so, you get ten Arca.

193
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,666
But you still
must try out first.

194
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,208
Today you work for free.

195
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,208
And cause you have no ID,
you work free tomorrow, too.

196
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,625
After that, you get ten Arca!

197
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:00,708
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,000
Got that, Hana?

199
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,166
'Kay, but.

200
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,125
Could you please
not call me that?

201
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,208
What for?

202
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,708
You just told me
that Hana is your name!

203
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,916
I don't like it.

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,791
Whenever I hear it
anymore it reminds me

205
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,833
of this bad man's face.

206
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,083
Girl always so damn picky!

207
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,375
What name you want then?

208
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,333
Hat-chin.

209
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,500
Okay, Hatchet!

210
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,416
Hatchet?

211
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,333
Now go memorize diner menu.

212
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,666
And when I go touch my ear
like this, it signal.

213
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,958
So you watch out.

214
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,708
Watch out for what?

215
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,666
Five guests welcome!

216
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,125
What you want eat!

217
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,416
Yo pops, you seen this dude?

218
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,208
Goes by the name,
Hiroshi Morenos?

219
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,375
No, ma'am.

220
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,625
Can't say that I have.

221
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:02,375
Try pretending this
picture's my tits.

222
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,000
Anything now?

223
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,041
Well?

224
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,125
Sorry.

225
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,000
What about this one?

226
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,750
It's a little girl.

227
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,250
Sorry.

228
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:27,875
So.

229
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,916
C'mon, let's go!

230
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:33,958
No wonder!

231
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,083
They don't look
related at all!

232
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,750
I wish you wouldn't run off
and scare me like that!

233
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,333
Where'd you go anyway?

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,875
Three pot sticker up!

235
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:19,208
The signal?

236
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,166
Dine-and-dash!

237
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,583
Skipping out on bill punishable
by death in my diner!

238
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,916
I remember your face!

239
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,708
I see you next time
I Kung Fu chop you!

240
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:45,166
You know Hatchet, I have a
daughter about as old as you.

241
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,166
But she way more capable.

242
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,458
Smarter than you.

243
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,166
No make mistake.

244
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,458
I'm sorry, sir.

245
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,291
It like you not here at all.

246
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:56,708
I don't need you.

247
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,083
But, I nice guy.

248
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,875
I give you try out.

249
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:03,750
Remember, you must work
free tomorrow, too, though.

250
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,750
More capable my butt!

251
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:10,708
You, are not a nice guy,
you're a jerk!

252
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,375
Today's the first day
of the new me.

253
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,458
I'm psyched and ready to go.

254
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,750
Hey!

255
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,250
Oh, that guy, huh.

256
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,625
I'm trying to remember
where I've seen him around.

257
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,458
What did you say?

258
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,958
Where'd you see him, huh?

259
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,000
I need to know!

260
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:52,875
C'mon, Gramps!

261
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:53,875
Cough it up!

262
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,250
Oh!

263
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,166
Yeah, that one nicer house,
just outside the favela!

264
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,750
Thanks, Gramps.

265
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,875
You sure know how
to please a girl.

266
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:19,875
I'm going!

267
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,416
No!

268
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,500
Get any closer and I'll cut
your face, you dumb bitch!

269
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,083
Just shut up and
pay me, you jerk!

270
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,333
Hey!

271
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,166
Those are my shoes!

272
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,291
Stop!

273
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,833
Do not chase
the one who flees!

274
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,208
Don't climb the mountain!

275
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,208
Where'd he go?

276
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,083
There she is!

277
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,166
I hear gunshots!

278
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,291
You will die!

279
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:57,625
You will die!

280
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,333
I see her!

281
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,000
Down in there!

282
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,833
Oh yeah, the stupid rock.

283
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,833
Aw! Fuck me!

284
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,708
Antonio, you okay?

285
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,041
Hey!

286
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,625
Move it, you brat!

287
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,958
I coulda burned off
that bird-nest hairdo.

288
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,416
Stupid kid!

289
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,375
What do ya mean?

290
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,333
You came charging
right at me!

291
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,166
Hang on.

292
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,958
Is that you, Hatchin?

293
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,750
What are you doing here,
dressed like that?

294
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,666
Dine and dash.

295
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,208
--You stole?
--Not me!

296
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,541
Move it you old skank!

297
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:27,750
You're blocking my gun here!

298
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,916
Old skank, what?

299
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,666
I said get outta here bitch.

300
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,291
Or you want me to blow a hole
in them tig ol' bitties?

301
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,125
You got any idea who you're
talking to, little shit?

302
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,250
Whatever, old lady,
I don't need to put up!

303
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,625
I'm sorry I didn't
quite hear you.

304
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,708
What'd you call me?

305
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,750
An old what?

306
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:47,375
Say it again.

307
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,833
I dare you!

308
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,625
Last chance fuck face!

309
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,250
Old?

310
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,916
Older sister?

311
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,833
That's much better.

312
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,250
I ain't gonna forget this!

313
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,916
The hell was all this?

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,833
It's nothing.

315
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,708
What's with the dress?

316
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,583
I found him.

317
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,458
I found Hiroshi!

318
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,416
What are you selling?

319
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,083
Honey, get out here!

320
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,666
What is it?

321
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:07,708
Hello.

322
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,875
Nice to meet you, Fa--.

323
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,041
Hey, what are you doing?

324
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,208
That's Hiroshi, right?

325
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,166
My Dad?

326
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,541
--Let go!
--Not him.

327
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,791
What do ya mean?

328
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,041
It's gotta be, he looks
just like the picture.

329
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,000
Look I got the
wrong guy, okay!

330
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,541
That guy was not
your father.

331
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,375
Didn't have the
swagger at all.

332
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,416
Let's go.

333
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,958
Are you sure
that it's not him?

334
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,625
Jeez, drop it, will ya?

335
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,250
Is the sketch even right?

336
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,791
Does it actually
look like him at all?

337
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,208
The features are close enough,
but it doesn't matter.

338
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:48,250
No sketch artist in the world
could capture his cool.

339
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:51,625
If you're gonna blame anything,
blame that dumb fortune teller.

340
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,333
She didn't get
a single thing right.

341
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,833
It was a total rip-off.

342
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,958
Magic rocks, my ass.

343
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,500
She was right, though.

344
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,125
About what exactly?

345
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,583
You still look like you're
pretty damn alive to me!

346
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,791
That hag can go to hell.

347
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,791
Next time I see her,
I'm smacking her!

348
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,916
And don't you try to stop me.

349
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,125
I don't care what Michiko says;
I think the fortune was right.

350
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,250
It was the sketch
that was wrong.

351
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,583
But still.

352
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,458
If I really had met
my father here tonight.

353
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,000
I wonder.

354
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,416
What kind of face
would I have made then?
