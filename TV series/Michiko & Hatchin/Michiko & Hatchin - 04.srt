1
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,916
Knock it off!

2
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,333
Turn that down!

3
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,083
Seriously, kill the music.

4
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,291
I can't even
hear myself drink!

5
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,708
What's with your cans?

6
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,125
They ain't got no jiggle.

7
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,291
Fake don't quake.

8
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,708
I'm talkin' to you, puta!

9
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,583
You fu--

10
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,625
So, um.

11
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,833
Did he have any
friends or anything?

12
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,541
Who do you mean?

13
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,958
Hiroshi.

14
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,333
Ya know, someone who
might know where he went.

15
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,125
Satoshi.

16
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,791
No, he didn't.

17
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:31,958
Hit the spot, Hatchin.

18
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,541
Thanks.

19
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,916
Come with us, lady.

20
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,125
The dine-and-dasher!

21
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,875
In my shoes!

22
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,708
Shoe thief!

23
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,791
Good work, good work.

24
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,291
Who the fuck are you?

25
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,708
The name's Rico.

26
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,750
Top dog, gerente geral
of this favela.

27
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,625
Meanin' I run shit around here
and take care of any problems.

28
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:18,041
And what do I call you, babe?

29
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,958
Michiko Malandro.

30
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,791
Nice!

31
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,125
Nice!

32
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,666
Michiko.

33
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,500
What was it?

34
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,666
Malandro.

35
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,750
Ah, like a wild
kitty-cat gone rogue, huh?

36
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,208
Michiko Spicy Cat!

37
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,083
Tony!

38
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,083
This is Tony,
my top soldier.

39
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,000
But you two've already met.

40
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,166
Yeah, can't say we have.

41
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know the
little shit-stain.

42
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,291
Oh, really?

43
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,458
You don't know him, huh?

44
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,416
This is the right hand
of the little shit-stain.

45
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,708
Sure you don't know him now?

46
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,083
How 'bout now?

47
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,625
This trigger any memories?

48
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,916
Why don't you just try and
see if you can remember him,

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,250
my spicy cat.

50
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,625
I'll give you five seconds.

51
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,291
Okay?

52
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:09,250
One, two, three.

53
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,083
Four.

54
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,416
That's a good kitty-cat!

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,375
You do remember!

56
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,833
No, I still--

57
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,333
Look, I'd really rather not
get blood on these walls.

58
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,833
So.

59
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,291
How do you wanna make amends?

60
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,208
Cash?

61
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,041
A little
"physical labor" maybe?

62
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,083
No!

63
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,875
What are you doing, Feliciano?

64
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,833
What could you possibly see
in that stupid woman?

65
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,583
Hey, Spicy Cat, are you
listening to me here?

66
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,583
Die!

67
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:55,791
Money!

68
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,041
Let's go with money, okay?

69
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,458
Yeah?

70
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,041
The cost of Tony's medical
bills, plus a little extra

71
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,250
for the broken TV?

72
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,416
Fine, whatever.

73
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,333
Come pick it up.

74
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,291
Three oh four. Got it?

75
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,958
Oh yeah, now we're
talkin', kitty-cat!

76
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,416
Let's get outta here.

77
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,958
Easy!

78
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,083
Shouldn't go places
like this on your own.

79
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,541
You'll get your ass killed.

80
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:25,625
Don't have to be
a jerk about it.

81
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,166
I came here 'cause
I was worried about you.

82
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,791
And then you treat me
like I'm a baby.

83
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:35,250
Just a simple "Thanks
for caring" would suffice.

84
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,083
All right, all right, jeez!

85
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,583
Thanks for giving a shit.

86
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,583
Now come here and hold
my hand before you get dead.

87
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,750
Great.

88
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,541
Aren't you that ho-bag with
the fake tits from last night?

89
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,458
Fine, I'll do it myself!

90
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,875
Come on!

91
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,833
Next time you stand
in my way, bitch,

92
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,875
I really will
kill you, got it?

93
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,083
That lady kinda
reminds me of you, Michiko.

94
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,250
Lulu.

95
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,333
Did you enjoy that?

96
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:23,875
Yeah. It tastes yummy.

97
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,750
That'll be
sixty-eight arcas, please.

98
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,833
Hiroshi Morenos.

99
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,791
What's he to you?

100
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,041
He's my father.

101
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,375
Prob'ly.

102
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:39,583
So then, does that make
that crazy bitch your mom?

103
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:40,791
Yeah, no.

104
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,291
And you're lookin' for him.

105
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,583
I guess.

106
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,041
You know, he's a decent guy,
Hiroshi Morenos.

107
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,666
Yeah, we go way back.

108
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,916
Tomorrow night.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,333
They're throwin' a party
for me over at Rumba.

110
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,208
A birthday party.

111
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,208
You should come.

112
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,041
I'll tell you
all about Hiroshi.

113
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,375
If you want.

114
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,291
Hatchet!

115
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,541
Why you flap you gums?

116
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:04,500
Sorry!

117
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,166
I'm low.

118
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,541
On funds.

119
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,000
You dine-and-dash?

120
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,541
Do you see me dashing?

121
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,000
You give me money now!

122
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,500
All out.

123
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,250
Right here!
Everything you got right here!

124
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,583
Here you go.

125
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,000
S'all I got.

126
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:22,625
Hatchet.

127
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:23,666
How much there?

128
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,541
Five arcas.

129
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,541
Cao ni ma! That not 'nough
buy two pot sticker!

130
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,208
You gonna pay big now, lady!

131
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,958
Lulu.

132
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,625
When you come home,
bring the crazy woman.

133
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,083
Hey! Get back here!

134
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,333
So, did you pay the man?

135
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,541
Yeah.

136
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,875
I hate it when
things get complicated.

137
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,291
Oh yeah, that Pepê Lima woman
came by the restaurant today.

138
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,666
Pepê who now?

139
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,541
The lady I said
reminded me of you.

140
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,125
You mean that psycho skank?

141
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,291
She says that she knows
things about Hiroshi.

142
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,958
She what?

143
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,250
Maybe she's lying.

144
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,166
I mean, she had that
sketch from the other day.

145
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,958
That don't make any sense!

146
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,416
You telling me Hiroshi messed
around with that piece of trash?

147
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,333
No!

148
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,250
No fucking way!

149
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,833
Claro?

150
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,791
Lulu.

151
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,291
If you don't wanna,
you can say so.

152
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,666
It's okay, Pepê.

153
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,958
I'll do it.

154
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,291
You should smile.

155
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,666
When you smile
it makes me happy.

156
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,250
Hey, Pepê, we got
a packed house for ya.

157
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,291
Looking good, looking good.

158
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,708
Lulu.

159
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,375
Who was that?

160
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,916
Does it really
fucking matter, Rico?

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
Just do me up.

162
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,875
Hey.

163
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,083
Do you love me?

164
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,166
Yeah. Of course.

165
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,875
'Kay, then give me some money.

166
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,708
I give you money all the time.

167
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,458
Yeah, well I want more.

168
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,750
Not right now.

169
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,583
What's tonight's take?

170
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,750
You're rakin' it in, right?

171
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,916
Hold it right there, babe.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,125
For reals?

173
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,416
You want me to give you
a cut outta my take?

174
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,708
Not gonna happen!

175
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,041
You forgot what day it is.

176
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,958
Oh, right,
happy birthday, baby!

177
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,250
Jesus.

178
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,500
Show some love for the
birthday girl, Miss Pepê Lima!

179
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:37,916
Yeah.

180
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,166
What's that skank doin'?

181
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,125
Heck if I know!

182
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,791
S'all over, huh?

183
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,125
Yup, it's over.

184
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,708
Glad you came.

185
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,000
Wouldn't miss
it for the world.

186
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,625
Man, I am beat!

187
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:01,583
Well here, have
a drink with us.

188
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,625
Here you go.

189
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,500
Oh.

190
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,166
--Sorry 'bout that.
--So.

191
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,416
You claim to know Hiroshi.

192
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,375
Forget about that!

193
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:09,458
Nobody cares!

194
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,208
But I do have something
I wanna ask you.

195
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,166
How much money you get
for sellin' your undies

196
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,625
to that dude?

197
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,750
While we're on the subject,
you even wearing any now?

198
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,291
Don't know.

199
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,541
Can't tell.

200
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:22,875
You can't tell?

201
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,583
Don't play cute
with me, toots!

202
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:27,375
Why, you looking
to sell yours?

203
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:30,625
Please, why would
I wanna sell my undies?

204
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,500
Don't be ridiculous!

205
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,541
I watched you up there!

206
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,000
Money, money, money, money.

207
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,500
What's up with that?

208
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,416
Do you really
like money that much?

209
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,833
Is it that important to you?

210
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,750
I don't "like it", per se.

211
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,041
But I do need it.

212
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,125
And why's it so
flippin' important?

213
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,500
As long as I've got money,
no one will ever laugh at

214
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,875
or look down on me again.

215
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,166
And that matters a lot.

216
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,625
Who laughed down on you?

217
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,083
I want names!

218
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,916
I'll go clobber 'em
for you, personally!

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,750
I've long since forgotten 'em.

220
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:02,916
Liar!

221
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,750
You remember every one of 'em!

222
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,833
I don't believe your lying
lies for a second, liar!

223
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,875
Now spill!

224
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,875
Despite my present attire.

225
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,666
I was a proper
young lady once.

226
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,250
They all treated me like
I was a little princess.

227
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,916
And I acted like one.

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,166
But then.

229
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,500
My dad kicked the
bucket and left

230
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,625
the family drowning in debt.

231
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,125
I was tossed out on my ass,
along with my baby sister.

232
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:30,166
Not a single person
ever stepped up to help out.

233
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,791
Must be why I don't
put my trust in anyone.

234
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,791
I mean, look at
all those people.

235
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,291
Every one of 'em's a friend.

236
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,458
But--

237
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,375
When I'm down,
none of 'em will be there.

238
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,583
Not a one.

239
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,125
That is so sad!

240
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,500
Like the saddest thing ever!

241
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,375
Whoa, look out!

242
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,083
Someone can't handle her juice!

243
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,541
Shut up, I hate you!

244
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,166
Gotta pee.

245
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,583
You know, she keeps on
saying you remind her of me.

246
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,875
But you and I,
we're different.

247
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,875
See, unlike you, I do believe.

248
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,750
'Specially in my friends.

249
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,625
Still, thanks for
the cute little fairy tale.

250
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,583
So you're saying you
don't believe my story?

251
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:14,000
Guess you don't
consider me a friend then.

252
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,958
What's the money for?

253
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,875
Going to São Para-íso.

254
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,958
It's finally my turn to
laugh at all those fuckers

255
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,000
who used to laugh at me.

256
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,291
You'll never get in.

257
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,291
Yeah, but that's what
fake IDs are for, right?

258
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,125
I found a guy
who can make 'em.

259
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,666
All I have to do is
find my way to Chinatown.

260
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,583
Then, next stop, paradise.

261
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,541
Only, I still don't have
enough for both of us.

262
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,875
Both o' you?

263
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:38,875
I toldja.

264
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:41,458
It's me and my kid sister.

265
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,458
We're gonna get
our happy ending.

266
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:45,916
She ain't much like you.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Sure hope not.

268
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,041
I want her to grow up to be
a far better woman than me.

269
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,125
I'll just have to
protect her 'til then.

270
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,791
You wanna have
a drinking contest?

271
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,791
You're lookin' for info
about Hiroshi M-Moreno, right?

272
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,291
If you win I'll tell you
all I know about 'im.

273
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,750
And if I win, you can
just give me cash!

274
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,541
You're on.

275
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,291
Now spit up what
you know 'bout Hiroshi.

276
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:34,041
Hiroshi, you shee,
he'sh a big-time patron.

277
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,041
Whoo!

278
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,125
Real problem.

279
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,208
Hold on.

280
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,375
Let go 'a me.

281
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,666
Yeah, no, but I'm
not finished telling--

282
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,958
I'm a dancin' fool 'cause
I dance so cool an'--

283
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,250
We're leaving.

284
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,958
Hey, I'm still drinking!

285
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,416
Hey, wait a minute!

286
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,291
Don't go--

287
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,708
Hey!

288
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,291
You little--

289
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,958
Fuck you!

290
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,250
Oh, you're back.

291
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,750
Thank goodness.

292
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,208
Sorry, Pepe.

293
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,875
No IDs.

294
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,583
I looked twice.

295
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,416
It's okay, we'll get Rico
to give us the party money.

296
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,875
Shoulda been mine
anyway, right?

297
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,000
And that'll be enough
for a fake ID for you.

298
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,875
But you need one, too.

299
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,208
I'll just keep working.

300
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:57,875
Though I won't be able
to stick around here anymore.

301
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,666
We'll have to make
a run for it.

302
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,416
Close off every
road outta here!

303
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,541
Don't let 'em set one foot
out of this favela!

304
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,916
Five hundred for
each one of those tramps!

305
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,250
You shoot 'em on sight!

306
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,916
The photo!

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,833
Photo?

308
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,375
The one of you.

309
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,416
I had a cute picture all picked
out to use for your fake ID

310
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,083
and I left it at home.

311
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,250
Fuck!

312
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,750
How could I be so stupid?

313
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,000
I'll go get it.

314
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,875
I can be right back.

315
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,750
It's okay, 'cause
nobody knows who I am.

316
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,875
And besides,
I can run real fast.

317
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,583
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

318
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,416
Lulu!

319
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,291
Wait for me at the bus stop!

320
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,875
I'll be there soon!

321
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,041
For Chrissakes.

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,708
Little piece of shit,
I oughta snatch her up!

323
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,041
You got a lotta nerve,
showin' up here.

324
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,083
She never came back.

325
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:43,583
See, we jacked Rico's money and
it went off without a hitch.

326
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,166
But I forgot something
and she went to get it

327
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,291
and hasn't come back.

328
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,875
And if you two putas just
had some fucking IDs on you,

329
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,250
then none of this
would've ever had to happen!

330
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,041
So you're comin' with me.

331
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,875
What?

332
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,250
You're not gonna help?

333
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,458
Did you hear what I said?

334
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,500
This isn't my problem!

335
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,500
Don't put it on me.

336
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,833
You gotta come with me.

337
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,416
I'm worried something
terrible's happened to her.

338
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,375
Please, I'm begging you.

339
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:18,541
Help me.

340
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,708
Got enough trouble, sister.

341
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,708
Here I thought I'd
finally found someone

342
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,833
I could believe in.

343
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,166
I know exactly who you are,
Michiko-- Whatever-the-hell,

344
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,541
escaped con.

345
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,458
So what's it gonna be?

346
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,166
Should I call the cops?

347
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,458
How's that for
trouble, "sister?"

348
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,291
Please!

349
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,250
All I'm asking you to do is
come with me to Rico's, okay?

350
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,500
That's it.

351
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,625
I just wanna return his
money and get Lulu back.

352
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,500
But I'm afraid Rico isn't
gonna forgive me so easily,

353
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,333
which is why I need some backup,
someone to cover my ass.

354
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:54,250
You can do that, right?

355
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:00,000
If you're gonna call
the cops, go ahead.

356
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,458
Why?

357
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,958
Why won't you just
fucking help me out here?

358
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,666
Is it 'cause you
think I'm a whore?

359
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,083
Huh?

360
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,708
Not good enough for "your
majesty?" Well, screw you!

361
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,375
'Cause I've made
my own commitments.

362
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,458
And if anything were to
happen to me--who'd look

363
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,750
after Hatchin?

364
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,916
You, Pepê?

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,333
Are you gonna do that?

366
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:33,583
Hey wait.

367
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,958
You're still goin'?

368
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah, of course I am.

369
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:46,000
This ain't nearly enough.

370
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,958
Damn it!

371
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,250
Why didn't I just help her?
