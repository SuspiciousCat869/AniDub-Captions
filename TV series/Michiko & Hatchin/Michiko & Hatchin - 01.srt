1
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,625
Hands behind your head,
step away from the bars!

2
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,333
Hey, that's Number
Four-Oh-Three, ain't it?

3
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:05,416
Yeah, probably.

4
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,916
Little wager?

5
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,708
Like on how far
the bitch gets?

6
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:13,375
The only way out from there is
through all of the ductwork.

7
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,541
She'll never friggin' make it.

8
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,166
How much?

9
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,041
'Cause I'm thinking,
knowing her,

10
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,208
she's for sure gonna make it.

11
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,166
For sure.

12
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:58,041
Hey, pigs!

13
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,166
If you're gonna
chase my ass down,

14
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,583
I hope you like
what's comin' to ya!

15
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,125
Who wants the
first bullet up the ass?!

16
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,250
Number Four-Oh-Three!

17
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,500
Michiko Malandro!

18
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:08,625
Give yourself up now!

19
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,791
Or we will shoot you
where you stand!

20
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,333
March Tenth, sunny.

21
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,125
Up at 6 today,
first one up.

22
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,750
Authorities have identified
the woman who broke out

23
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,208
of the high-security and
purportedly escape-proof

24
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,541
Diamandra Special Penitentiary
early yesterday morning.

25
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,916
Her name is Michiko Malandro.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,708
Under the cover of last night's
storm, she has disappeared,

27
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,750
and as of yet, there have been
no reported sightings of her.

28
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,416
Malandro should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

29
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,250
Which, as the outsider
in the house, I always am.

30
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,916
I make breakfast, too.

31
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,083
Omelets, easy on the salt.

32
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,083
A bit of shell fell in.

33
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,208
And I might've
burned them a little.

34
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,500
Good morning everyone.

35
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,083
Father Pedro,
and his wife, Joana.

36
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,500
My kinda-sorta parents.

37
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:12,750
Oh, dear.

38
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,458
Were you hiding this?

39
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,541
Really?

40
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,791
Hana, we do not raise
our children to cover up

41
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,333
their failures.

42
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,625
And with that, he made me
cook the omelets again.

43
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,291
And clean up.

44
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,791
My sister.

45
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,375
My foster sister, Maria.

46
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,541
The name is way too
pretty for her.

47
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,833
The younger brother, Gabriel.

48
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,958
That's us, the members of the
Belembauza Yamada family.

49
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:58,125
My name is Hana, and this is
how my days usually start.

50
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,250
Bless us, O Lord,
and, these thy gifts.

51
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:04,791
Which we are about to receive
from thy bounty, amen.

52
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,083
And pretty much how they end.

53
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,416
Hang in there.

54
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,375
Please don't do that.

55
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,250
Hey, Hankie!

56
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,250
Below here is the ocean.

57
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,916
So right now,
you're underwater!

58
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,333
Pick it up.

59
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:03,500
You can't walk in water!

60
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,166
Swim for it!

61
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,125
I said swim!

62
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,541
Swim for it!

63
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,000
Swim for it!

64
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,000
Swim for it!

65
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,708
Why am I doing this?

66
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,083
How can you
breathe in the ocean!

67
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,166
Heads up!

68
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,791
What is the meaning of this?

69
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,875
Can you explain why this
dark stain is here?

70
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:45,541
It was, the mop bucket.

71
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,166
I spilled it.

72
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,083
Do you know how much
this is going to cost?

73
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,000
Getting away with things
just because you're a child

74
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,375
doesn't fly around
here, young lady.

75
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,916
Towels are for wiping, stupid.

76
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,875
Not for wearing.

77
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,458
Hey, wait!

78
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,458
Stop it!

79
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,083
What are you holding on for?

80
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,833
Just let it go!

81
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,083
No!

82
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,416
This kind of thing
goes on, day in and day out.

83
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,958
Fill up the bag,
and make it snappy.

84
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,250
Otherwise, I open fire
and splatter blood

85
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,166
all over this place!

86
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,750
March Fifteenth.

87
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:55,625
Today, someone from the city
is coming to check on me.

88
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,750
But he never really does.

89
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,250
He just drops off
the money and leaves.

90
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,000
That's all it ever is.

91
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,333
Hana, I want for you
to have these.

92
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,125
Thank you very much.

93
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,125
Hana, do you remember
the news this morning?

94
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,541
Around here, children in
your situation are forced

95
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,666
to make their living by
either selling their bodies,

96
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,666
or selling what's inside them.

97
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,416
But you know who it was who
saved you from that fate, right?

98
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,875
Yes.

99
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:31,583
Who was it?

100
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,083
It was, God.

101
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,291
In other words?

102
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,791
It was you, Father.

103
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:43,416
"Thou shalt not avenge, but
love thy neighbor as thyself."

104
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,416
He just bought me off.

105
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,916
Using Maria's hand-me-downs.

106
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,166
He totally just bought me off.

107
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,916
An update now,
on the bank robbery

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,958
that occurred in Paraí-town.

109
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,541
Authorities believe it is
highly likely that the culprit

110
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,791
is Michiko Malandro...

111
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,500
This is a fine piece,
very nice.

112
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,500
It must've set
you back a bit.

113
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,083
Oh my goodness, no.

114
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,916
It was a gift from one of the
flock, so the price was right.

115
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,958
Free is always good!

116
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,541
Here you are.

117
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,500
It's nice to see you again.

118
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,916
You look like you're
doing all right, huh?

119
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,250
Yes sir.

120
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,416
Good to hear.

121
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,416
Ah, thanks.

122
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:41,833
Are you familiar with
the "Devotee of the Year"?

123
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,875
Sorry, I can't say that I am.

124
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,375
"Dee-vo-tee"?

125
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,291
That's it, right up there.

126
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,250
It's only given to those
who have performed

127
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,166
outstanding deeds...

128
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,125
And my husband was fortunate
enough to be chosen!

129
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,125
Uh-Huh!

130
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,250
Interesting.

131
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,958
That's quite
a prize you got there.

132
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,125
There was a young man
in the community;

133
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,291
Gonzales was his name,
truly rotten to the core.

134
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,583
But one sermon from Pedro
turned him right around!

135
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,958
Even now, he is an upstanding
member of the flock.

136
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,333
That's impressive!

137
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,750
That's a lie.

138
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,000
The thing about Gonzales,
is he only changed because

139
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,916
of the bullet that was
lodged in his head.

140
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,541
Gonzales, the Lord God loves
you and he forgives you

141
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,916
for all of your transgressions.

142
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,166
Ah, what an adorable kitty.

143
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,625
Does she belong to you?

144
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:57,583
Yes, well, Maria took
the poor thing in.

145
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,208
No!

146
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,333
I did!

147
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,166
Sorry dear, is that right?

148
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,208
They just adore
looking after her.

149
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,708
Branco just pooped.

150
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,625
Do something about it.

151
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,833
Would you mind taking care
of Branco for me?

152
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,166
I've been feeling horribly
lightheaded all day.

153
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,041
So, who's on
Branco duty today?

154
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,166
It's my turn.

155
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,833
Never increases, does it?

156
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,375
Christ sakes!

157
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,375
How much do they think it costs
to raise a child these days?

158
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,750
Geez!

159
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,583
Get off!

160
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,791
Ugh, that dirty fleabag!

161
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,333
Chore time!

162
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,541
Go get rid of this for me!

163
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,750
We clear?

164
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,000
Mom, you seen Branco?

165
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,958
No, not all morning,
now that you mention it.

166
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,208
I haven't seen her
since last night.

167
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,166
Hana, have you seen her?

168
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,208
No, sorry.

169
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,208
Well, I find
that hard to believe.

170
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:32,208
After all, I saw you
take her outside last night.

171
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,916
Where did you take her?

172
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:35,791
Hey!

173
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,041
Where did you take Branco?!

174
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,166
C'mon!

175
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,416
Giddy-up!

176
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,000
You suck at this!

177
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,541
You have to go faster!

178
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,041
What do we have here?

179
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,833
Look, it's Branco Two.

180
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,208
This Branco looks even filthier
than the first one was.

181
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:02,958
Ew!

182
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,500
You're gross!

183
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,875
Hang on, Gabe.

184
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,333
I know what we should do.

185
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,916
Branco means
"white," doesn't it?

186
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,875
She's got to be clean.

187
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,083
Whoa there, girl!

188
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:20,791
Aah!

189
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,041
I said "whoa"!

190
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,666
Not so fast!

191
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,541
Hey! Stop moving!

192
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,250
Yeah!

193
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,958
Rodeo time, h-yah!

194
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,250
Now, just hold still
for a sec!

195
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,791
That hurt!

196
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,041
Owwww!

197
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,208
Apologize, right now!

198
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,916
I told you to apologize!

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,041
For what?

200
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,416
I didn't do,
I didn't do anything!

201
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,125
Really, you think you
can challenge me now?

202
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,458
Alright then!

203
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,291
If that's the case, get out!

204
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,000
We just don't need you here.

205
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,416
And no one cares
about you anyway.

206
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,916
I've had it!

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,583
I've put up with
this for too long!

208
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,291
You treat me
like dirt every day,

209
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,500
and you don't care
what that does to me!

210
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,000
Do you even know I'm a person?

211
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,750
Look at me!

212
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,416
Look me right in the face!

213
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,041
Good, now remember it!

214
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,458
What the heck am I
supposed to do now?

215
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,208
I can't go back.

216
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,916
It was too scary to go
home alone, so I decided

217
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,208
to bring Branco back with me.

218
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:27,458
Someone from down that road,
is going to come for me.

219
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,500
Sorry about the wait, Hana.

220
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,750
I came to get you.

221
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,791
Yeah, that'll never happen.

222
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,500
This the Belem-something
Yamada's?

223
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,750
Yes.

224
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,625
May I ask who's calling?

225
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,541
Got a kid named Hana?

226
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll be there tomorrow,
get her ready.

227
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,916
I'm sorry, but who
is this exactly?

228
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,333
Who am I?

229
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,416
I'm her mother.

230
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:19,541
Apparently, Hana's mother
is coming tomorrow.

231
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,666
Her mother is dead,
isn't she?

232
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,958
Well, that's what
I'd always heard.

233
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:25,583
So what does this mean?

234
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,333
Got me.

235
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,458
Of course.

236
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,250
Kidnapping.

237
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,833
Clearly someone
jealous of my position.

238
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,458
Yeah, must be.

239
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,208
What are they after?

240
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,583
Money?

241
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,583
Or do they just wanna stick
it to me, by cutting off

242
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,333
our child support?

243
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,416
Go and fetch my shotgun.

244
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,458
I'm gonna get these
sons of bitches first.

245
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,750
Amen.

246
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,291
Dig in everyone.

247
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,041
Go hide Hana somewhere safe.

248
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,291
Hey!

249
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,041
Yeah you, four-eyes.

250
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,375
Look at me.

251
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,833
Is your name Hana?

252
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,041
Then it's you.

253
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:43,083
She's just staring at me,
mouth hanging open.

254
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,083
Not ladylike at all.

255
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,291
C'mon, Hana.

256
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,958
Or you gonna
sit there all day?

257
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,208
"Someone is going
to come for me".

258
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,208
It's what I'd wished for,
all this time.

259
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:16,125
On the morning of March
Seventeenth, that person came.

260
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,666
The only problem.

261
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,750
I have no idea who she is!
