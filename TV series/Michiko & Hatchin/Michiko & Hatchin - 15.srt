1
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:56,416
Lenine!

2
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:59,333
Lenine!

3
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,583
Yeah, I'll do it now.

4
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:18,958
I can't believe it.

5
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,541
It feels like her hand is
reaching out to the light.

6
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:25,000
And touching my heart.

7
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,000
Whoa, hey!

8
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,666
How much for an hour?

9
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,125
Come on name your price!

10
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,250
I won't haggle I got money.

11
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,291
João, what happened to that
"Toucan in the Rain" book?

12
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,458
Did you sell it?

13
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,291
I did.

14
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:09,541
Do you remember to who?

15
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,875
Was it a blonde girl?

16
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,541
Well, she was an older lady.

17
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,458
Maybe she was blonde once.

18
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,833
That bike really screwed us.

19
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,666
It's like, talk
about your bad luck.

20
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,958
We're almost there.

21
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,625
Hiroshi is in
the next town over!

22
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,541
Isn't that what you heard?

23
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,583
Now what's up your butt?

24
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:41,083
If there's something on your
mind, then let's hear it.

25
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,416
It's just;
there's a book I want.

26
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,416
A book?

27
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,708
What kind?

28
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,250
It's about a boy who
takes a bird from its cage

29
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,083
and they go on a journey.

30
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,000
They're trying to track down
the bird's family.

31
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,125
Back in Laranja, I was
reading it in secret.

32
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:02,291
But then you came and took me
away and I never finished it.

33
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,708
All right, so go buy it.

34
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,333
Can I go now then?

35
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,333
Yeah, but you know, money's
tight so I can't let you

36
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,708
have any more than ten arcas.

37
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,333
If it's more than that,
you got to scrounge up

38
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,166
the dough yourself.

39
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,541
Fresh vegetables
at low, low prices.

40
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,583
Grown by the best farmers,
and picked by the best

41
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,208
field hands just this morning!

42
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,166
Then why do these
look so messed up?

43
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,583
Oh, they're not bad;
they're full of growth hormone,

44
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,083
which is
perfectly safe to eat.

45
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,916
We call them "Monstro-matoes"
Just one of them is worth

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,458
twenty-five regular ones.

47
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:04,041
And I'm the only one in
the market who sells them.

48
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,250
Yeah?

49
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,333
So the guy who
trucks them in is this him?

50
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:08,791
Hey, move your foot!

51
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,041
Don't change the subject,
just take a real close look.

52
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,583
Is this him?

53
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:16,625
The scruffy-looking handsome
guy, carrying the tomatoes.

54
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,125
Fish!

55
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,541
Get your fresh
caught fish here!

56
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,333
Nice and cheap!

57
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,791
Fresh fish!

58
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,708
Cheap fish!

59
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,666
You bought a lot, huh?

60
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,250
Hi, there.

61
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,375
Oh, the fish!

62
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,375
I'm helping a friend,
it's just temporary.

63
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,250
No, I mean.

64
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,166
The book?

65
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,750
Sorry, someone bought it.

66
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:06,583
It was "The Toucan
in the Rain" wasn't it?

67
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,833
Uh yeah.

68
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,541
Oh.

69
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,250
Don't be sad.

70
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,041
Hatchin!

71
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,458
Where'd you run off to?

72
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,541
Hatchin?

73
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,833
That's a pretty name.

74
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,041
I should go now.

75
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,875
I'll wait for you!

76
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,541
This afternoon!

77
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,166
Outside the church when
the bells ring, at three.

78
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,375
Here.

79
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,500
Oh, and this too.

80
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,041
Oh uh, how much for it?

81
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,125
No, it's a gift.

82
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,625
Are you sure?

83
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,416
Yeah.

84
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,541
You want to go up with me?

85
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,083
To the top of the tower.

86
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,541
So Hatchin, is this
your first time here?

87
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,166
Yeah.

88
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,625
I've been wondering.

89
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,166
What brought you
to Penínsoola, Hatchin?

90
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:42,375
Listen, could you please
not call me by that name?

91
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,750
Oh um, sorry.

92
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,958
It's fine.

93
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,666
My name's Leniñe.
At least I think it is.

94
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,750
That's what they call me.

95
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:57,500
Hana, that's um, my real name.

96
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,708
I'm searching for my father.

97
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,541
We've been on
the road for months.

98
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,375
Planície's our next stop.

99
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:08,083
But our bike broke down again,
so we're stuck here for a bit.

100
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,708
You're searching for your dad?

101
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,291
That sounds kind
of familiar, huh?

102
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,750
It's like in
"The Toucan in the Rain!"

103
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:20,250
So, uh.

104
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,708
I can't accept
this gift from you.

105
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,500
I have to give it back.

106
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,333
"Soyokaze, I've caught you".

107
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,958
Wait, it's just a quote.

108
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,708
"There is a kind
of bird called the 'toucan'".

109
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,125
"A species not native
to this land.

110
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,625
So when I saw one, I took her,
and we went on an adventure".

111
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,625
"She wanted a new world.

112
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,833
So that's where we went".

113
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,291
Here you go.

114
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,666
Says he's down there
waiting for you.

115
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,083
What?

116
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,666
This is for you, right?

117
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,250
--Hey watch it!
--Go getcha some!

118
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,875
I'm going shopping.

119
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,833
What's with her?

120
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,083
Hana!

121
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,833
Hana!

122
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,500
Hana!

123
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,416
It's okay; I won't
hold it against you.

124
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,041
Because, no matter what.

125
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,458
I'm still in love with you.

126
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,416
Good, you're finally back!

127
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,875
We split town tomorrow.

128
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,083
The bike's all fixed.

129
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,875
We're ready to hit the road.

130
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,375
Sure took his
sweet ass time though.

131
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,875
Michiko what's
that book doing here?

132
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,500
That little artsy kid
dropped it off for you.

133
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,333
Anyway we're heading
out bright and early.

134
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,708
Are you packed?

135
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,375
Hey!

136
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,583
Don't go getting
all mopey on me now!

137
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,041
You knew from the start
we were only going

138
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,208
to be in this town
for a little while.

139
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,833
What's that mean?

140
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,500
You read it!

141
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,750
Didn't you?

142
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,541
Please, I need to know.

143
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,750
Lenine, is that his name?

144
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,916
You did read it!

145
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,041
What are you stomping me for?

146
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,000
Why do you think?

147
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,458
So that's what this is.

148
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,833
First time some boy's
paying attention to you,

149
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,791
and now you're thinking
you're hot shit.

150
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,541
Right?

151
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,708
Wrong!

152
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,500
Why is everything
about boys with you!

153
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,333
I am nothing like you!

154
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,291
Listen!

155
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,500
If it weren't for the fact
that you're Hiroshi's daughter.

156
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,250
Right now you'd be taking a dirt
nap out in the high desert!

157
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,208
But, I am an adult;
I forgive you.

158
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,541
Now, say you're sorry!

159
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,041
Come on in.

160
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,625
Um sir, can you return
this to Leniñe please?

161
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,791
I get it now.

162
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,291
You must be the angel
he told me about.

163
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,666
It's all right.

164
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,708
I'll smooth
things over with him.

165
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,625
Actually, um.

166
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,541
I should return it myself.

167
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,375
Lenine hasn't told you
about his accident, has he?

168
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,083
He doesn't have any memories.

169
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,958
There was an explosion.

170
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,541
An old building had
a gas leak that ignited

171
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,166
just as Lenine
was walking past.

172
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,416
Debris flew everywhere, and
some struck him right on top

173
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,666
of his head.

174
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,416
When he came to, he had
no memory of anything

175
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,166
that had come before.

176
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,250
Other than that, his personality
didn't really change.

177
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,750
He still soars through life,
as free as a bird.

178
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,125
But they'll come back.

179
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,166
Eventually, I hope.

180
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,083
Though, when those old memories
return, they say he'll forget

181
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,416
everything that happened
to him since the accident.

182
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,625
Like he was just
waking up from it.

183
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:04,708
If that happens, will you
still be able to say goodbye

184
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,833
to the Lenine you
know with a smile?

185
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,500
Today's all I have left.

186
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:17,708
Tomorrow, I'm heading
out to Planície.

187
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,666
I'm leaving for good.

188
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,166
Hana!

189
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,666
Hang on!

190
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,958
I was wrong!

191
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,708
I didn't come to see you,
it's not like that!

192
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,958
Hana.

193
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,250
Ever since I met you,
I've become so much more

194
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,458
grateful for the
things in my life.

195
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,708
It feels like I've found someone
who can be a part of my soul.

196
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,875
But you're going to
forget all about this!

197
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,666
Everything about me!

198
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,333
The old man in the bookstore.

199
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,291
Told me all about the explosion,
and your memory loss.

200
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,791
I won't forget you, I swear,
I'll never forget you.

201
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,708
I may not remember
what kind of person I was.

202
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,666
And this town I grew up in
may feel strange and foreign.

203
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,375
Every day,
the world's a blank slate.

204
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,916
But I still know I'm me.

205
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I still keep moving forward.

206
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,833
Leaving only footprints behind.

207
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:51,541
I'm just trying to fill in that
slate, one new memory at a time.

208
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,666
And I promise I've etched
your memory into my heart.

209
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,041
Hatchin, trust me.

210
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,291
Stop making me
feel so confused!

211
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,375
I hate you!

212
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,166
I hate you and
your stupid face!

213
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,000
No!

214
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,500
I don't want to lose you!

215
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,875
Hana!

216
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,083
Hello there.

217
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,000
Haven't seen you around.

218
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,916
Just passing through?

219
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,875
This?

220
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,750
This is "Toucan in the Rain".

221
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,583
Sounds kind of silly but,
this book is magic.

222
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,291
Never fails to make me
feel better whenever I read it.

223
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,375
And that's no lie,
I wanted the girl who lived

224
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,083
here to read it, too.

225
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,500
Actually, you seem
a lot like her somehow.

226
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,375
The first time
I laid eyes on her.

227
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:06,791
I thought I was
looking at an angel.

228
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,250
I feel like I was
scared of waking up.

229
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,666
And I stayed asleep
for a long time.

230
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
Too long.

231
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,791
Thank you.

232
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,416
Goodbye, Hana.

233
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,541
We're leaving this afternoon?

234
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,250
Yeah.

235
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,000
Are you all packed?

236
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,166
Cause I'm not
helping you this time.

237
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,416
You good?

238
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,375
What's wrong?

239
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,791
I was actually happy.

240
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:19,875
Michiko, it hurts so much.

241
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,916
Why?
