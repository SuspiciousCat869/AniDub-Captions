1
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,250
So I was running a little
behind on fixing her bike.

2
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:45,083
I even felt kinda bad keeping
them stranded here so long.

3
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:47,333
That was 'til that broad
totally screwed me over.

4
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:49,291
She calls me, wakes me up
before dawn, and tells me

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,041
to get my ass to the hotel
and bring her chopper.

6
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,958
Not only doesn't she pay me
a single talgo--But then

7
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,041
she just guns her bike,
tearin' the bridge all to hell

8
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,875
with me standing on it!

9
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,000
And since she was my customer,
they're sticking me

10
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,875
with the bill
for the bridge repairs.

11
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,291
I mean, have you ever heard
of anything so ridiculous?

12
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,000
Excuse me.

13
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,208
Inspector.

14
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,916
Think we finally got
a line on Malandro.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,375
According to the front desk,
she was on her way to Osso.

16
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:16,958
Osso?

17
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,208
Several witnesses overheard
her say she wants to meet up

18
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,291
with Satoshi Batista.

19
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,208
This trip's been
a real bitch.

20
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:25,250
Ma'am?

21
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,125
Like that overpriced
Chinese place.

22
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,875
After eating in that dump
for three days straight,

23
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,458
we only got one word
outta that fat fuck.

24
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,333
"Hatchet."

25
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,458
You're a hot mess, honey.

26
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,708
Then back to Vermelha,
something I swore I'd never do,

27
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:43,333
so those two queens
could shit-talk me.

28
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,250
Here you go.

29
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,291
And of course
Old Lady Zélia shook me down

30
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,000
while giving
nothing in return.

31
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,958
All we had to show
for that detour--

32
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,666
--was a pound and
a half of stringy beef.

33
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,791
And even that's gone now.

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,291
Play me a song, pops.

35
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,666
Somethin' nice n' funky.

36
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,416
Yo, Hatchin, can you--

37
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,500
Why'd you run off
on your own like that?

38
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,875
I was thirsty, so I'm getting
some juice, if you don't mind.

39
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,291
Hey, watch the attitude.

40
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,958
Knock it off!

41
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,333
Listen, Hatchin.

42
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,791
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say!

43
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,125
Stop it!

44
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,166
Hey, why are you so
pissed off all of a sudden?

45
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,000
If you don't tell me,
how am I s'posed to--

46
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,500
Now you wanna
know why I'm mad?

47
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,625
'Cause it's not
all of a sudden!

48
00:03:58,708 --> 00:03:59,666
Wha'd I do?

49
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,208
You destroy
everything in your path!

50
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,750
You run off without
paying for stuff!

51
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,500
You--

52
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,291
What are you lookin' at?

53
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,125
Seriously, what in the
world is wrong with you?

54
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,208
I've seen you make too many
people cry with the way you act.

55
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,500
Like just the other day,
when you threatened that poor,

56
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,000
old mechanic.

57
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,416
I really hated that.

58
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,916
That's how grown-ups,
y'know, negotiate.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,916
What, with a wrench
in their hand?

60
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,500
I can't stand it anymore!

61
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,583
Any of it!

62
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,500
Sorry for the wait.

63
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,541
Suit yourself.

64
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,291
Goin' out for a bit.

65
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,375
I'll try not to stay out
too late, though.

66
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,166
Don't even think about
wandering off on your own!

67
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:18,750
Fuck!

68
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:19,750
Yo, yo!

69
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,291
I brought over
the creamy cocoa!

70
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:23,250
'Ey, homes.

71
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,083
What's wrong
with this machine?

72
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,791
Motherfucker's busted!

73
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,083
I ain't won
jack shit all night!

74
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,916
I don't know what to tell you.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,041
That so?

76
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,916
You do know who I am,
don't you?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,166
Yes, of course,
Mister Satoshi.

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,458
I know.

79
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,416
Then you also know
I'm the goddamn president

80
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,125
of Monstro Preto.

81
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,583
And it's a fucking bad idea
to make me angry.

82
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,416
So clean out your ear-holes,
you dumbass hick

83
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,958
and listen real careful.

84
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,916
You're gonna go get two thousand
arcas and bring it to me now.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,791
That's everything I lost
and what I shoulda won.

86
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,125
Otherwise, this unpleasant
motherfucker's thunder-stick

87
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,500
is gonna shoot a huge
load of fire up your ass.

88
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll go get you your money!

89
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,083
All right, son!

90
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,208
I got a question for ya.

91
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,750
Satoshi Batista.

92
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,375
You seen him around here?

93
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,833
I heard rumors he was
somewhere in the city.

94
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,458
Sorry, ma'am,
I can't help you.

95
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,541
Yeah, figures.

96
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,083
Keep it holstered!

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,583
Evenin', Cue-ball.

98
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,500
Mister Shinsuke?

99
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,875
What's the matter, Pogo?

100
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,625
No need to be so nervous.

101
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,750
What brings uh--What
brings you here?

102
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,916
Not that I'm not happy
to see you, of course.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,166
See, thing is.

104
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,166
Talkin' on the phone
was gettin' us nowhere.

105
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,375
And this whole matter's
completely unacceptable

106
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,208
ta our Satoshi.

107
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,583
You can see why, right?

108
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,000
We ain't been gettin'
our cut from you Presa guys.

109
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:11,250
But now-- 

110
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,000
Here's this Satoshi and
you pay up like a bitch.

111
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,416
That's a little, I dunno, odd.

112
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,833
Sorry, don't mind us.

113
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,750
Dig in, I'll be leaving soon.

114
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,833
So I thought, maybe I should
drop in, meet this fella.

115
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:27,166
N' word on the street
is you're putting him up.

116
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,458
Spill it, Colonel Kurtz.

117
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,500
Where is this imposter?

118
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:48,750
You're bad.

119
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,041
I know.

120
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,500
Please, don't do this,
Mister Satoshi!

121
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,833
What is this?

122
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,875
You mistake me for a big,
brown, cuddly, teddy bear?

123
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,833
Who is it makes this crap-hole
bar of yours possible?

124
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,458
You, Mister Satoshi! You do!

125
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,416
You're damn straight.

126
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,208
So no more fuckin' excuses.

127
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:11,500
Pay what you owe or
I'll crush your bolas.

128
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:12,791
What'll it be, homie?

129
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,208
Want me to mash on
this pedal and play us

130
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,583
a thumping samba beat?

131
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,666
Huh?

132
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,666
I'll pay you!

133
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,833
Whatever you want!

134
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
Now we're talking, meu mano.

135
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,541
I'm so touched by
your change of heart,

136
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,666
I can barely
hold back the tears.

137
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,875
Y'have any idea
what time it is, girl?

138
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,208
Let go!

139
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,375
--Why, you little--
--Don't hit me!

140
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,791
Jeez you're so quick
to turn violent.

141
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,791
You haven't even
let me talk yet!

142
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,375
I happened across a guy named
Satoshi, and I followed him.

143
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,750
Satoshi huh?

144
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,500
Where'd you follow him?

145
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,083
A hotel.

146
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,041
Which one?

147
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,833
Estrela.

148
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,625
Every time we open
our mouths, we argue.

149
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,166
I've been thinking.

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,500
Maybe we just shouldn't
be together anymore.

151
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:23,583
I don't even want to look
at your face, Michiko.

152
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,708
But I promised that
I would protect you.

153
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,041
It's okay.

154
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,666
You don't have
to keep that one.

155
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,208
Hey, Pogo!

156
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,208
I thought you said
this was supposed to be

157
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,666
a four-star joint.

158
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,125
So how come the security
here is zero-star?

159
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,458
I mean, some bitch-ass prowler
just waltzed on in here

160
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,375
like it was nothing.

161
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,041
Yo!

162
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,333
Is your ass asleep?

163
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,000
Say something,
for fuck's sake!

164
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,708
I don't have that luxury.

165
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,583
I can't sleep like this!

166
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,458
You gonna upgrade me
to your finest suite.

167
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,916
Ya feel me?

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,375
And Pogo, get some armed
escorts down here for us.

169
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,750
Yeah.

170
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,916
I'mma let you pick up
the tab for that shit, too.

171
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,750
Where the hell
those escorts at, huh?

172
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,500
That Pogo fool
ain't pickin' up.

173
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,166
For real?

174
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,333
I kick his ass!

175
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,541
Gimme that!

176
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,875
Fat bastard!

177
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,541
Lemme have it.

178
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,958
Oh.

179
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,666
Pogo, you dumbass.

180
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,500
That what you thought
I meant by escort?

181
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,875
Not that I'm complaining.

182
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,791
Where's Satoshi Batista?

183
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,458
Right here.

184
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,500
Satoshi, Prez of the Slums, but
you can just call me "Daddy."

185
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,666
You ain't foolin'
no one, wannabe.

186
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,750
Whoa, that's a little
cold, don't you think?

187
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,333
How 'bout I warm you up some?

188
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,583
Make a little
friction together?

189
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,041
Maybe work up a sweat?

190
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,375
Come on, lemme get you
all hot and bothered.

191
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,208
Bad move.

192
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,750
You're up next, big boy.

193
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,833
You can call me
"Jesus H. Magnificent"!

194
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,958
Wanna take a swing
at my divine jaw?

195
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,125
Oh, babe.

196
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,166
Looks like you just made me
spill my love juice--

197
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,166
Baby, don't go!

198
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,666
I think I'm in love wit'chu!

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,166
Move the hand,
or I clobber you.

200
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,458
Yeah, I like it rough!

201
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,375
For real.

202
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,958
When you kicked
me in the balls,

203
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,250
you gave my heart
a reach-around.

204
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,750
You got fuckin' issues.

205
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,625
I'll come with you!

206
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,208
Yo, boys, grab us a cab!

207
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,625
Like, three seconds ago!

208
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,500
I ain't leaving.

209
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,208
What happened to him?

210
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,541
Is that blood?

211
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,583
Marque?

212
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:10,916
Hey!

213
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,250
Stay here.

214
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,000
My boy.

215
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,291
Well, good morning,
"Mister President".

216
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,583
Who the fuck is this?

217
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,958
You know who we are.

218
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,083
We're known as the
Black Monster, Monstro Preto.

219
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,541
And we got the
hotel surrounded.

220
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,500
Yo, Davi, what
was that all about?

221
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,458
It's all over!

222
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,500
We are so screwed!

223
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,791
Don't hang up on me.

224
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,625
I got more to say to you.

225
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,291
Hello there, Shinsuke.

226
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,666
Whozzis?

227
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,666
Oh come on.

228
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,625
You forget my voice already?

229
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,750
Aw, holy shit!

230
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,833
I hear you did
a number in Vermelha.

231
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,375
What's shakin'?

232
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,000
I came to see Satoshi.

233
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,875
Sucks to be you!

234
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,375
Yeah.

235
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,083
Anyway, would you mind putting
"o presidente" on for me?

236
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,416
Think he's done.

237
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,083
So anyway, Shinsuke.

238
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,833
You gonna let me
see your real boss?

239
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,625
Damn girl, I ain't
no fuckin' charity!

240
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,500
You want cash?

241
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,750
I gots cash.

242
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,333
Naw, what I want
is to play a game.

243
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:24,208
You fuckin' with me or what?

244
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,458
You know the kinda
person I am, right?

245
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,583
Just come on down here
and talk to me.

246
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,166
Oh, I don't think
I wanna do that.

247
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,583
Where's the fun?

248
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:33,833
If that's how you're gonna be
guess I got no choice

249
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,625
but to force you to talk.

250
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,583
Hey, bitch, that's my bag!

251
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,875
Get a new one!

252
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,875
Hey I only said I was Satoshi!

253
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,000
Never said Satoshi Batista!

254
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,875
We got some muscle, so we
went ahead and told people

255
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,666
we were Monstro Preto.

256
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,875
Big fucking deal!

257
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,541
We lived up to
the reputation.

258
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,458
Didn't we?

259
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,250
Say something,
goddamn it!

260
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,125
You got no clue who you picked
a fight with here, do you?

261
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,750
This guy is a monster.

262
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,291
Fo' real.

263
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,583
What'll it be?

264
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,708
I'll play your damn game.

265
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,041
Yeah?

266
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,708
In exchange, you agree
to leave this fake Satoshi

267
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,666
and what's left of
his crew here alone.

268
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,625
I'll make sure they give back
all the money they've taken.

269
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,708
Also.

270
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,541
I'm planning to win
this hands down.

271
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,375
When I do, I see Satoshi.

272
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,708
Those are my terms.

273
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,833
Sure thing!

274
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,791
But the fakers
gotta play too.

275
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,041
That's not what--

276
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,958
You said you're gonna
win hands down, right?

277
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,958
If you do, I let the
rest of 'em go free

278
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,583
and I'll let you see
your darling Satoshi.

279
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,958
That's not a problem is it?

280
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,000
--Ya got a deal.
--Great.

281
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,541
Lemme 'splain the rules.

282
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,041
You're gonna come see me.

283
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,208
And you're gonna ride the
trolleys I'm about to give you.

284
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,625
Make it here in one piece,
and we'll call it a win.

285
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:02,083
I call this--

286
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,666
"The Nonstop Transfer Game!"
O' course, you ain't gonna

287
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,833
know where the
trolleys're comin' from.

288
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:08,958
And if you miss a train,
it's game over.

289
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,541
Yeah, we'll shoot you
without a second thought.

290
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,708
But if you outrun us--
--and get back on track?

291
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,041
We'll let it slide.

292
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,333
'Kay, now, here's your route.

293
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,125
I'm only tellin' you once,
so remember it--

294
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,250
Get the hell on with it!

295
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,416
Don't rush me.

296
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,750
Now, listen up.

297
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,208
The trolley bound for
the obelisk is runnin' by

298
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,416
you right now, ain't it?

299
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,708
Board it, then transfer to the
westbound Parque Triângulo.

300
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,958
From there, take the
Salão line, got it?

301
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:35,208
Ride that for a while, then hop
on the Santa Estrela bound--

302
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,333
Oh, wait, no, I messed that up.

303
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,500
Fuck you!

304
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,541
Mercado Central, right.

305
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,625
Get on that one then
jump to the Santa Estrela.

306
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:48,083
Parque Triângulo, "PT".
Salão, "S".

307
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,166
Mercadoo-something, "MS"?

308
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,000
Santa Es, "SE".

309
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,000
Next comes the Truta line,
followed by the Centro,

310
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,291
and after that, the Rua Nova.

311
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,916
And, uh, that's pretty much it.

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,125
..."C".

313
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,375
..."RN".

314
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,333
Just transfer in
exactly that order,

315
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,541
then at six o'clock
sharp, hop off.

316
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,000
When you do, you'll find out
where your final transfer's at.

317
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,291
Hey, are you listening?

318
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,750
Shut up!

319
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,333
'Kay, that's it for now.

320
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,916
I'll keep the guys out
front from shooting

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,291
for the next
five minutes or so.

322
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,875
Hotel Ilha Solitária,
how can I help you?

323
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,625
I have a message
for room three oh three.

324
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,250
A promise is a promise.

325
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,791
I'll be back.

326
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,833
Wait for me.

327
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:43,875
That's it!

328
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,625
Get on!

329
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,208
Yo!

330
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,375
Wait up!

331
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,750
Next, "PT."

332
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,791
Look!

333
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,625
Isn't that the Parque?

334
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,041
Shit!

335
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,458
"SE".

336
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,291
What'd that stand for?

337
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,458
Yo!

338
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,125
São Emar!

339
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,750
That has to be it.

340
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:13,916
Shit!

341
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,083
Ah! Son of a--!

342
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,166
What the hell
did we do wrong?

343
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,916
"SE."

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,541
Damn it, took the wrong one!

345
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,375
That's our trolley!

346
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,166
Hop on!

347
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,166
What?

348
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,791
Naw, y'never leave
a man behind!

349
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,833
Suit yourself.

350
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,791
Come on!

351
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,166
But what about Andréa?

352
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,000
Dude!

353
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,458
Hey come on you pricks!

354
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,416
Where you guys goin'?

355
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,291
You can't leave me
here to die!

356
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:00,875
"T"!

357
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:01,833
Truta!

358
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,083
Jump!

359
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,458
Hey!

360
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,958
Davi.

361
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,666
This is all 'cause of you!

362
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,333
This is all 'cause
of your louco-ass idea!

363
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,333
Well, fuck you and your
"Black Monster" bullshit!

364
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,375
Get us outta this mess!

365
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,583
Rocco.

366
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,250
If we don't go now,
they shoot our asses!

367
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,375
Why we gotta play
their game, man?

368
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,000
Dammit, Davi, just get us
outta this, okay?

369
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,416
Asshole!

370
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,958
What's up next?

371
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:36,625
"C"!

372
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,375
"C".

373
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:38,458
And after that?

374
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,375
Not sure.

375
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,625
Come on, lady.

376
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,041
You better remember.

377
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,166
Damn.

378
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,333
Which one?

379
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,791
Which "C" is it?

380
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,000
Damn it!

381
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:58,541
Left!

382
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,625
Take the left!

383
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,458
Yo.

384
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,125
'Ey, you hear me?

385
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,291
Almost time.

386
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,250
This the right place?

387
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,958
We sure about that?

388
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:39,791
Yeah.

389
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,583
So then where's our clue at?

390
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,458
Congratulations, Michi!

391
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:20,333
Just keep walkin' straight
on down the tracks.

392
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,541
I'll be waitin' right here
for you, promise.

393
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:24,958
See you soon.

394
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,625
Real soon.

395
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,958
Stay on your feet!

396
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,041
You said--

397
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,833
Hey, I'm a man of my word.

398
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:49,333
So here--You wanna
see him, right?

399
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,625
And you--

400
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,333
Fly!

401
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,000
Be free!

402
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,708
Yo, Atsuko.

403
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:02,833
It's me.

404
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,666
Satoshi.

405
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,208
Terra, huh?

406
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,458
Got it.

407
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,541
Ricardo, change of plans.

408
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:13,708
We're going to Terra.

409
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,291
Huh?

410
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,333
What about Osso?

411
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:16,833
Don't make me repeat myself.

412
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,583
I said Terra.
