1
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,250
So you've come
all the way to Perna,

2
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,000
but you didn't come
for the tratamento?

3
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:11,083
Our Lady of the Desert
will grant any wish.

4
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,666
Fantastic, huh?

5
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,291
And Toni Kaká's maps
will lead the way.

6
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,208
Only costs two arcas!

7
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:21,166
Well, normal price, but you're
so pretty, I'll go one arca,

8
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,791
fifty talgos!

9
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:23,708
Uh, hey!

10
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,708
'Scuse me.

11
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,625
Yo, what's happenin'?

12
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,875
This map.

13
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,583
You pressured me into
buying it, yesterday?

14
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,750
But I'm really
hard up for money.

15
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,041
So um--I'd like to return
it for a refund please.

16
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,750
Are you sure you
got that thing from me?

17
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,541
Yes.

18
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,208
You are Toni Kaká, right?

19
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,458
Sorry.

20
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,333
You're mistaken,
I'm Garcia Boroots.

21
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,916
Gabe!

22
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,458
Why are you here?

23
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,750
Didn't I already tell you
we were done, Masão?

24
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,333
I'll be the one who decides
when we're done, Rita.

25
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,208
But I'm not gonna do that.

26
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,958
Who's that?

27
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,750
Boyfriend.

28
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,416
But he's just
a shrimpy little kid!

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,875
Yeah, he's a little shrimpy.

30
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,416
So what?

31
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,833
So, uh--

32
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,958
Hey you're not
as shrimpy as I thought.

33
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:58,958
Yeah, no.

34
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,666
I'm not.

35
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,583
I like you.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,583
Whoa!

37
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,500
What are you doing?

38
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,708
Duh. Kissing.

39
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,416
Wait, listen!

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,916
I'm a girl!

41
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,208
Whaddaya know.

42
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,958
How old are you?

43
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,083
I just recently turned ten.

44
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
Me too!

45
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,333
Oh yeah?

46
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,333
You don't say.

47
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,166
You talk polite.

48
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,458
Kinda weirds me out.

49
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,166
I'm very sorry.

50
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,166
Are you sick?

51
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,375
Or just hungry?

52
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,541
Yeah, I'm starving.

53
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,166
Well, let's go.

54
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,166
But I have no money.

55
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,208
That's okay.

56
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,791
Reporting from Osso,
where, amid the busy...

57
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,833
Forgot your wallet, huh?

58
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,708
Yup.

59
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,916
I'm sure I can cover you girls.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,625
Really?

61
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:55,583
No problem!

62
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:56,958
Thank you!

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,708
The victims were reportedly
posing as members

64
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,791
of "Monstro Preto," and carrying
on fraudulent activities.

65
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,500
It is strongly suspected
that this incident

66
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,375
was carried out in retaliation.

67
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,625
The body of the group's
leader, Davi Nativa,

68
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,458
was found in front of a
train garage twenty-eight

69
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,041
kilometers outside Osso.

70
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,750
It is also believed that prison
escapee Michiko Malandro

71
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,208
was witnessed
fleeing the scene.

72
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,083
All righty.

73
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,250
What's wrong?

74
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,375
Well um, we didn't
pay anyone for our food.

75
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,791
That rube inside was
about to pay his tab

76
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,000
so I talked him into
coverin' ours, too.

77
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,541
Let's head this way.

78
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,708
Feels like I'm leakin'
down my string.

79
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,291
String?

80
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,666
Tampon.

81
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,750
Oh, I'm Rita.

82
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,000
What's your name?

83
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,250
Hana.

84
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,583
Hana?

85
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:55,958
Hm.

86
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,541
So, you sleep in the park?

87
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,791
For now.

88
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,958
All alone?

89
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,333
Where're you from?

90
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,125
Check it!

91
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,916
You bought that?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,750
The map?

93
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,083
From Toni Kaká.

94
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,333
Are you hoping
for the tratamento?

95
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,208
Wanna look?

96
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,333
Know what?

97
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,500
I know the secret of the Maria
statue and her "tratamento".

98
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,500
Whole thing's a big scam.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,208
What's up with a statue that
cries tears of blood, anyway?

100
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,541
S'like a bad horror movie.

101
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,416
The statue cries blood?

102
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,416
Mm-hmm.

103
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,250
When you see it,
you say a prayer.

104
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,208
Everyone says that's
how your wish is granted.

105
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,125
So you don't believe in it?

106
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,166
A Maria statue suddenly
appearing in the middle

107
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,041
of nowhere and wishes
being granted?

108
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,916
I'm young but I'm not stupid.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,083
Those stories sound like dreams;
like a whole buncha nonsense.

110
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,500
The real world is a lot less
forgiving than that.

111
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
It's fine, take it.

112
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,583
You didn't have to
but thanks, Rita.

113
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,250
Curious about that?

114
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,791
Because I happen
to work there.

115
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:46,125
Come by anytime
and I'll get you in.

116
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,750
Are you sure?

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,083
It's a promise.

118
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,541
So come.

119
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,250
Oh, shoot.

120
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:57,791
Gotta go.

121
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,458
Okay.

122
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,083
See ya.

123
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,750
Why the heck should I be the
least bit concerned about her?

124
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,625
Gino!

125
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,333
Don't get up!

126
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,041
You do not look down at me!

127
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,541
I told you to keep
an eye on that girl!

128
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,666
What's your deal?

129
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,041
She came back, didn't she?

130
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,208
Don't talk back
to me, you fool!

131
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,791
Why didn't you come?

132
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,583
Why bother?

133
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,041
You came right back here.

134
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,375
Dang it Gino!

135
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,250
Do what I want you to do now!

136
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,125
Otherwise, I'm
leaving for real!

137
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,291
Did I wake you?

138
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,666
You okay?

139
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,541
You have anyone you like?

140
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,791
Because, that's
the problem I have.

141
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,625
His name's Gino.

142
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:35,250
We're always together and we
have been ever since I was born.

143
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:39,041
You see, my parents abandoned
me outside of that tent.

144
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,500
The first thing I ever
remember seeing was Gino.

145
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,791
I'm always looking at him.

146
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,666
But then,
he never looks at me.

147
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,708
So I've tried to make
him jealous by talking

148
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:55,833
to a whole bunch of men but
he still doesn't look at me.

149
00:09:55,916 --> 00:10:00,291
Even when I run away like this,
he won't come after me.

150
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,958
My heart aches like it's
all tangled up in my chest.

151
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,583
Good morning!

152
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,083
Good morning!

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,750
Good morning!

154
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,125
Hey, dirty boy!

155
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,500
I'm callin' you out!

156
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,083
Don't you go making eyes
at my Rita anymore!

157
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,250
Or else, my fist is
gonna meet your face!

158
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:50,958
Whoa!

159
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,375
Look, I'm a girl!

160
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,750
I'll bet you are!

161
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,000
And that just
proves my-- Huh?

162
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,208
Listen, could you
come with me for a bit?

163
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,083
Huh?

164
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,833
Just come on!

165
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,708
Fine lady, right?

166
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,166
Name's Natália.

167
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,875
She's Gino's girlfriend.

168
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,958
Oh yeah, and he
just knocked her up.

169
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,625
And now you know what's what.

170
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,333
Go on, you can order
anything you like.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,166
No one can make Rita happy.

172
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,625
No one but me, anyways.

173
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,041
Looking prettier
than ever, darlin'!

174
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:37,916
Oh, stop.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,708
You think?

176
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:40,291
Hey!

177
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,375
You get it?

178
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,916
I'm askin' you
to shill for me.

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,666
I'll totally feed you whatever
you want and in exchange--

180
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,291
--you can talk me
up around Rita.

181
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,166
I really am a nice guy.

182
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,166
Hey, what's wrong?

183
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,250
Ow!

184
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,958
Faster, Gino!

185
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:33,708
You're okay.

186
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,375
Stop it!

187
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,041
Don't touch me!

188
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,541
Move it, ya little snot!

189
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:46,958
Lemme go!

190
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,916
You some kinda thief,
creepin' around like a roach?

191
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,541
No!

192
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:50,958
I am not a thief!

193
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:51,708
Hana!

194
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,666
Rita!

195
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,500
Take that,
you nasty, filthy--!

196
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,250
What's wrong?

197
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,125
You know, Rita.

198
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,416
I heard that Gino
has a girlfriend.

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,041
And I heard other things, too.

200
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,083
Did you come here
to tell me to give up?

201
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,833
I don't believe you!

202
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,708
Get out!

203
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,625
So uh, has that girl
Rita come out yet?

204
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,708
Huh-uh.

205
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,291
Oh, I see.

206
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,250
Thank you very much.

207
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,708
No, wait.

208
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,708
You're Gino, aren't you?

209
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm Hana.

210
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm one of Rita's friends.

211
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,000
She's in an awful lot of pain.

212
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,208
How come?

213
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:03,458
It's because of the way
she feels about you.

214
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,958
So please, if you could,
give her a closer look.

215
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,041
If you'd be so kind.

216
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,750
Your hair looks
like cotton candy.

217
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,666
Sorry, but I can't do that.

218
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,250
Huh?

219
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,583
You see, when the show closes
day after tomorrow, I'm staying.

220
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,833
Also, I'm gonna be a daddy!

221
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,000
What about Rita?

222
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,458
Does that mean
you can't stay with her?

223
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,958
That's how these
things normally work.

224
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,916
Then does she know
about any of this yet?

225
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,541
Huh?

226
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,583
Know what?

227
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,333
Which part?

228
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,333
Like you staying here?

229
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,333
Oh, she'll be fine.

230
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,750
She's still so young.

231
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,416
She's got her whole life
ahead of her, right?

232
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,291
She'll meet all sorts of guys,
and eventually find someone

233
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,916
who's right for her.

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,958
She'll be a fine
woman someday.

235
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,375
Rita.

236
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,541
I didn't know
where else I could go.

237
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,875
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,583
There's something
wrong with me.

239
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:35,000
Are you leaving?

240
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,916
I'll come with you.

241
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:46,541
Mm-hm.

242
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,791
It's Masão's.

243
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,500
Rock-paper-scissors!

244
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,625
One, two, three!

245
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,125
Get on.

246
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,291
Hurry up.

247
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,500
Ready?

248
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,125
Yup.

249
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:03,875
Easy, Hana!

250
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,041
Whoa!

251
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,500
What are you guys doing?

252
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,833
Just switchin'
the ol' lady out.

253
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,166
Why?

254
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,375
Some damn idiot ran off
with the other one's head.

255
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,250
Buncha savages around here.

256
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,666
Anyway, we swapped
it out for a new one.

257
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:05,083
But does this one cry?

258
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,125
Please, she just has to!

259
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean, how else
is she gonna grant wishes?

260
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:10,583
Huh?

261
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,458
Tell me!

262
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,833
Please!

263
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,291
Rita!

264
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:08,833
Can't wait until
I'm finally a grownup.

265
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,666
Would you two get to work?

266
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,333
Rita!

267
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,166
Gino!

268
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,625
You're on!

269
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,750
Gino Costa and Rita Ozzetti!

270
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,916
Hop to, everybody!

271
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,791
We're outta here tomorrow!

272
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,166
Awesome show as always, Gino.

273
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,875
I'm okay now.

274
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,291
Hey.

275
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,333
You look great out there.

276
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,666
Thank you, Hana.

277
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,250
This is goodbye, huh?

278
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,958
I'll see ya.

279
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,125
Do you think I could
come with you guys?
