Class B license.

00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:02,583
Nidia da Glória.

5
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,000
Ama Alexandro Gigio.

6
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,333
Hometown is Neiro.

7
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:10,875
Address is Fifteen
Ostra Street, Marisco, Neiro.

8
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,541
Hundred year-old, man?

9
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,833
You sure?

10
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,291
Uh.

11
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,125
Hatchin!

12
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,333
Let's roll!

13
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,583
Hey!

14
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,708
Freeze kid!

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Come on jump!

16
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,833
An illegal entry at an São
Paraíso border checkpoint,

17
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,666
is having unexpected traffic
repercussions, with thousands

18
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,458
of travelers delayed as officers
shut down the entire gate.

19
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,375
Given that it's Milenãrio
de Samba season in the city,

20
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,166
the delayed, would-be-partiers
are making the best of it.

21
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,833
Getting an early start on
the celebration postponed

22
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,291
by the illegal entry.

23
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,041
Authorities tell us
the checkpoint jumpers

24
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,458
are both female, one of
them a ten-year-old child.

25
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:27,333
I'll never forget
that face, brother.

26
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,958
I'm so sorry.

27
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,375
Don't apologize.

28
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,416
You made the right choice.

29
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,125
Should we check the
surveillance tapes?

30
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,125
Tell me, Ricardo.

31
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:52,000
Ever think about, going home?

32
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,666
Huh?

33
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,583
Can't sleep, huh?

34
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,083
Bunch of spoiled-ass rich kids.

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,375
Find any new info?

36
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,875
Nope, same old hunch.

37
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,333
Don't get down, Hatchin,
we're going to find him.

38
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:47,000
Your Dad's got loads of talent.

39
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,250
I bet he's rich by now,
which makes him easy to spot.

40
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,541
Only reason he'd
come here's to make bank.

41
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,416
You see?

42
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,625
All that matters is we're here.

43
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm sure he's working
some scam or other.

44
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,833
I hope you're right this time.

45
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,541
I really hope you're right.

46
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,333
What's he doing?

47
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,375
Hey!

48
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,250
Who are you?

49
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,458
You want to fight with me, pal?

50
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,875
No, Miss!

51
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,791
Your kid looks familiar's all.

52
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:28,083
She resembles this guy I knew,
name of Rock Morena.

53
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:32,916
Hold on!

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,750
You talking about this guy?

55
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,708
Yeah, it's him all right.

56
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,291
Rock Morena.

57
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,875
Hear that, Hatchin?

58
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,791
He's here.

59
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,875
This is the place
he used to shack up.

60
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,666
Two of us even ran
a little racket together.

61
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,583
We'd boost iron in copper
gates and manhole covers,

62
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,333
then flip them to junk metal
dealers for quick cash.

63
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,375
I ain't real proud of it,
but when times are tough,

64
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,041
you do what you got to survive.

65
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,875
But then he took off,
with my half of the score

66
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,333
and all I had before.

67
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,416
I earned that money, dammit!

68
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,791
And I'd kill to get it back in
my pockets where it belongs.

69
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,875
Yeah, we're after him, too.

70
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,625
Did he ever
open up about stuff?

71
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,375
Like how he had a woman who
loved him and that he'd die for.

72
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,916
Or like a family that he
wanted to settle down with?

73
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,833
Maybe this ain't the same guy.

74
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,625
All he talked about was
becoming a big shot in Monstro.

75
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,458
But he couldn't throw a punch
for shit, or how he used to

76
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,916
grow tomatoes bigger
than King Kong's balls,

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,041
but he'd never eat them.

78
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,708
Could never tell
what was real with him,

79
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,875
or what was lies
to impress folks.

80
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,583
Oh, and one more lie!

81
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,541
He once claimed some
TV actor saw him in a bar

82
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,458
and invited him to be on his
show, but he turned it down.

83
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,416
Ridiculous!

84
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,333
What, was I born yesterday?

85
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,791
So I ask him, "what's this
actor guy look like;

86
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,958
what TV show is he on?"
And he's all, "You know,

87
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,166
that douchey-looking guy
on the big drama."

88
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,750
Rock was a good crook,
but a terrible liar!

89
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,875
Hey, let go!

90
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,416
Listen up, Mister:
Hiroshi was in Monstro,

91
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,458
he did grow those tomatoes
and he ain't no liar.

92
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:31,666
And you ask me?

93
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,375
He could be an actor
because he is super-hot.

94
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:36,250
Then why'd he turn it down?

95
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,750
Because he's
still in love with me.

96
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,333
You're so gullible.

97
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,583
Listen, toots,
he abandoned you and the girl.

98
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,250
Don't sound like love to me.

99
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,791
Damn you!

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,250
Proceeding to reported area.

101
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,875
Arriving now.

102
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,625
No immediate sign.

103
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,916
Looks like they cleared out.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,708
Will investigate on foot.

105
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,458
Why did--

106
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,416
Why did he come to this city?

107
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,458
Maybe he really
was just running away.

108
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,125
I guess, I always knew.

109
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,083
That's just the kind
of man Hiroshi is.

110
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,541
Some prefer to get lost
in the weeds of character,

111
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,208
but I like a bird's eye view
of the whole production.

112
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,083
If I don't have
that level of perspective,

113
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,875
I won't be able
to perform at my best.

114
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,333
And the best is what
my legions of fans deserve.

115
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,708
Anything less is a betrayal.

116
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,875
The success of the show clearly
owes so much to you, Feliciano.

117
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:03,208
Yes, but without all those hard
workers behind the scenes,

118
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,000
my greatness
wouldn't be possible.

119
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,750
And, of course, the fans...

120
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,541
"Douchey looking guy
on a big drama?"

121
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:10,875
That must be him!

122
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,333
And fans have even more
to look forward to...

123
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,750
Hiroshi did grow
those giant tomatoes.

124
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,750
And was in Monstro.

125
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,958
I guess he met this guy too.

126
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,458
Even with all the tragedy,
this show's a love story.

127
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,375
And as long as I
give it all I've got,

128
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,375
the viewers will
fall in love too.

129
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,833
That's great to hear!

130
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,625
Thanks for your time, and
for your wisdom, Feliciano.

131
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,625
Please come back soon.

132
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,708
We are mere moments away from
the new Museum of Modern Art

133
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,250
being lit up, like a
UFO for a big TV shoot!

134
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,333
Dang it.

135
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,458
I like it when she smiles.

136
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,166
I will get Michiko
smiling again!

137
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,333
No matter what it takes!

138
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,250
Feliciano's using the city's
frenzy around Milenario de Samba

139
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,125
as a backdrop to shoot
a climactic scene

140
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,208
at the museum right behind me!

141
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,125
How we gonna end
this thing with a bang?

142
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,791
Do we go up into space,
or come down from it?

143
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,083
How many times can
we argue over this ending?

144
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,666
Just stick to the damn script!

145
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,083
The script blows!

146
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,666
Viewers want us to ratchet
things up for the finale!

147
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,708
Love surrounds us!

148
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,541
It's the whole universe!

149
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:39,583
Men are cool, icy planets,
and women are black holes!

150
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,791
They suck us in and
trap us for eternity!

151
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,166
Feliciano will finally come
to realize this cosmic truth!

152
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,500
You feel me, man?

153
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,916
We open with me
standing on this roof.

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,875
I shiver with emotion,
then throw out my arms,

155
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,166
tears streaming down my face!

156
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,875
I love you.

157
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,291
Fade to black!

158
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,583
Boom! The End!

159
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,125
Well, you love it, don't you?

160
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,875
Well, it's certainly an idea.

161
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,333
You're passing on this?

162
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,916
You don't think it's gold?

163
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,750
Guess what pal, this
is primo-24-karat stuff!

164
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,833
It's shit.

165
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,291
It's art!

166
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,833
Go back to film school, son!

167
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,166
I ain't working with
no bush league rookie!

168
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,208
Mr. Feliciano's
running off the set!

169
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,791
Someone stop him!

170
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,458
The hell?

171
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,375
Crazy-ass groupies
keep getting younger.

172
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,625
Hey, stop!

173
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,500
You just ran a red!

174
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:13,458
Michiko, I have to do
whatever it takes.

175
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,666
Feliciano!

176
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,208
Report: female matching
description of one of the

177
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,000
gatecrashers from yesterday, was
clipped by a car on Route 43.

178
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,583
All units proceed to the scene.

179
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,583
It's her.

180
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,958
You're not him.

181
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,500
He tricked me!

182
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,208
Suspects spotted on route 43.

183
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,083
On foot, heading southeast
to the Sichuan District.

184
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:20,916
Kid, wait!

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,125
I'm not going to arrest you!

186
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:22,791
Shut up!

187
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,375
I don't believe you!

188
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,458
Stop it Jambo!

189
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:31,750
Let me go!

190
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,875
What is she thinking leaving
you alone like this?

191
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,125
You're just a helpless kid.

192
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,333
You trying to go back?

193
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,500
To that creepy foster family?

194
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,708
Huh-uh.

195
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,708
Okay, then what?

196
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,291
I was chasing
this guy, Feliciano.

197
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,791
Feliciano?

198
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,125
He's this jerky TV actor.

199
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,458
Supposedly, he ran into
my father not that long ago.

200
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,458
I wanted to find him
and get him to tell Michiko

201
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,541
what he knows about Hiroshi.

202
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,708
I doubt Hiroshi's given us
one thought since he left.

203
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,000
That's just the
kind of guy he is.

204
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,500
But still, I wanted Feliciano
to tell her that Hiroshi

205
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,583
said something nice about her.

206
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,541
Even if it's not true.

207
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,208
She'll be happy again,
back to how she used to be.

208
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,083
He's up there.

209
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,375
Go on.

210
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,416
What?

211
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,291
This should make us even.

212
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,958
Have you not figured out,
I ain't answering?

213
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,291
Look at me!

214
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you recognize this face?

215
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:49,458
You do know you're
wearing a mask?

216
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,958
Don't tell me
you've never seen it!

217
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,750
Or this symbol, either!

218
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,458
Just take my wallet.

219
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,333
Watch the face!

220
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,000
Call the number and read this.

221
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:04,958
All right, that's enough!

222
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,208
Just knock it off!

223
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,291
Do I know you?

224
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,291
--Hiroshi's kid!
--Who the hell is that?

225
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,791
Hiroshi Morenos,
guy who steals junk metal.

226
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,958
Rock Morena,
grows big tomatoes!

227
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,750
You asked him
to be on your show!

228
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,333
Hold on a second,
you gotta slow down there.

229
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,500
Now, you're Hiroshi's
daughter, right?

230
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,875
That's right.

231
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,375
But the dude who steals
junk metal is named Hiroshi,

232
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,541
and the dude with
big tomatoes is Rock?

233
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,166
I'm confused,
who are they to you?

234
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,041
My father!

235
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,000
Which one!

236
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,625
Both of them!

237
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:36,500
So, Rock and Hiroshi
are the same guy.

238
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,666
And you're saying I once offered
him a gig on my show, huh?

239
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,541
Thing is, I've never done
that for anyone before.

240
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,791
But, I could swear you were
that douchey-looking guy

241
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,458
on that popular soap opera.

242
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,500
Well, maybe your Dad
just ran into an actor

243
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,708
from one of the
knock-offs of my show.

244
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:53,833
Knock-off?

245
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,041
What?

246
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,958
Yeah, copycats, fakes.

247
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,500
Look here; change the
channel all you want.

248
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,583
Whole damn line-up's
full of cheap imitations

249
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,000
of my brilliance.

250
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,708
No originality at all.

251
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,250
That's just how show
business is, kiddo.

252
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,500
I guess I was wrong.

253
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,416
Its cool, listen: The
soap I been carrying

254
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,541
on my back is super popular.

255
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,541
But the reasons why go beyond
my good looks and fans.

256
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,583
It's because I push to keep
the stories fresh and awesome.

257
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,333
But, if that's all it took,
those other knock-offs

258
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,166
would be popular, too.

259
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,500
You see.

260
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,500
You also need an actor who
grounds his performance

261
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,416
in truth.

262
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,000
That is what I bring.

263
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,333
I'm able to turn a boring old
love story, into something

264
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:37,500
that will give the audience
an emotional breakdown.

265
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,833
And yet the director can't see
that it's these skills of mine

266
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,583
that keep him employed!

267
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,958
What's wrong with him?

268
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,125
Why is he being such a diva!

269
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,416
I'm sorry, sir.

270
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,083
I'm so sorry for this!

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,541
Go ahead, little one,
cry it all out.

272
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,541
What am I going to
do with this girl?

273
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,333
Dangit!

274
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,291
Ah, is this Michiko?

275
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,833
Who's this?

276
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,583
Great to finally get a hold
of you, my name is Feliciano.

277
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,375
I'm an actor, and I have
some news you might

278
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,791
like to hear about your
old friend, Hiroshi.

279
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,250
Met him in a bar recently.

280
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,416
He was such a charismatic man
I had to go say hello.

281
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,750
I asked him to come on my
TV show and play my rival.

282
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,208
But, much to my chagrin,
he passed on the offer.

283
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,875
I tried to convince him, but
he kept telling me about

284
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,208
the beautiful woman who
meant so much to him.

285
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,916
I used every negotiating trick
in the book, but alas.

286
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,958
Hiroshi refused every time.

287
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,625
Michiko, I know he's still
out there waiting for you.

288
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,875
Don't lose hope;
keep searching!

289
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:59,625
You'll still get your
happy ending, okay?

290
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,666
Um, thank you for doing that.

291
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,500
Don't worry about the mess.

292
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,791
I have people for that.

293
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,291
I am rich, after all.

294
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,166
Yeah, but?

295
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:20,958
Hey!

296
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,083
Dance with me!

297
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,791
Samba Time!

298
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,875
From Goinia, Rock Morena.

299
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,000
Ricardo!

300
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,208
This is where we part ways.

301
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,125
What?

302
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,583
I can't hear you!

303
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,000
No, listen!

304
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,375
No, I'm grateful
for all your help!

305
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,166
I-!

306
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,833
Yeah, you're getting it!

307
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:24,291
I get the feeling; we're going
to end up busting through

308
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,208
another gate tomorrow.
