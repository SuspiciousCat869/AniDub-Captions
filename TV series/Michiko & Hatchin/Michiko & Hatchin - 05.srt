1
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:42,583
Alright!

2
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,791
Alright!

3
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,041
And the Macaco Princeza
is now standing up!

4
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,416
The Macaco Princeza
is coming.

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,375
Now, return the
hidden treasure.

6
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:01,416
I am afraid
I cannot do that.

7
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,958
Oh, Jesus!

8
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,041
It's the end of the world!

9
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:10,166
It is the end of the world!

10
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,666
Yes, the end of the world!

11
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,625
Macaco.

12
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:15,208
Vasily.

13
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,250
Go tell the guys in the plaza to
come inside and eat some lunch.

14
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,958
Sure.

15
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,791
Oh!

16
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,625
Jesus!

17
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:26,041
Somebody's here.

18
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,083
Which one of you's
Kiril Chapek of Fantasma?

19
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,083
Go screw!

20
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,166
The hell you think you are?

21
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:44,041
You Kiril?

22
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,958
How about you return
everyone from Monstro?

23
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,625
We were just
sitting down for abiet.

24
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,791
That means lunch.

25
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,833
Would you care to join us?

26
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,208
Not hungry?

27
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,750
Who's faction are you with?

28
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:01,958
Creasy?

29
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,333
No, I'm bettin' Satoshi.

30
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,958
You are with Monstro?

31
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,333
No, sorry.

32
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,375
I'm not Monstro, but
if you give them back,

33
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,875
everything'll
work out just fine.

34
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:17,541
Granted, we don't take kindly
to Monstro, but still,

35
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,208
we do honor the
cease-fire agreement.

36
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,541
So how can we give 'em back
if we know nothing about it?

37
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,000
M'I right?

38
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,791
Don't play dumb with me,
Mister Handsome Fuzzy-face!

39
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,958
Bitch!

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,041
There is a film crew that
was good enough to come

41
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,916
to Vermelha today.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,083
My lovely Sasha here is making
her debut as an actress.

43
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:52,416
An auspicious day,
to be sure.

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,208
You can stay for abiet,
or you can leave.

45
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,375
But you need
to decide for me.

46
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,750
You really ought to
take some time to stop

47
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,708
and smell the roses.

48
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:18,416
Or all that beauty
will be for nothing.

49
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,875
Nyet!

50
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,625
What are you doing, Kiril?

51
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,625
Stop pawing all over
that woman!

52
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:26,000
If you don't get your hands
off her in five seconds,

53
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,291
I am leaving you!

54
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,125
I mean it!

55
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,625
I'll bite my tongue and die!

56
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,000
Sorry, but you heard the lady.

57
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,625
Down to four seconds.

58
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,291
Go now, or I will
pull the trigger.

59
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,375
It's rainin'.

60
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,750
You can see through those?

61
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,166
Wow.

62
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,166
Go on, say hello, dear.

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,916
Hi, I'm Marisa.

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,250
My!

65
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,666
Oh, for you.

66
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,416
We can't thank you enough.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,541
What are you doing, Joaquim?

68
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,750
Shut up, hag!

69
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,791
Tell me where you sent Marisa!

70
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,625
Somewhere she can be happy.

71
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,666
Liar!

72
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,625
What's wrong?

73
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:49,958
You don't trust me?

74
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,625
Why should I?

75
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,291
Settle down, kiddo.

76
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,125
You're not the first
delinquent we've had here.

77
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,625
Yo!

78
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:20,791
Omigod-Omigod-Omigod, Michiko!

79
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:22,333
How've you been?

80
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,041
All right?

81
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,458
Yeah.

82
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,125
Goodness, I have been
so, so, so worried about you!

83
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,000
So, where did your brother go?

84
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,041
Scooch over a bit,
wouldja darling?

85
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,291
He's there.

86
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,250
Bullfightin'?

87
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,708
Yep.

88
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,541
We do some direct sales at
the fights but my brother's

89
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,625
the one who goes.

90
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,708
It's Marco!

91
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,500
Such a fine man;
I'm going all aquiver!

92
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,375
What's that look?

93
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,791
Marco is our great hope.

94
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,125
Even Romão the Fourth
is nothing to him.

95
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,458
Romão the Fourth?

96
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,000
The be-all-end-all of steers.

97
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,416
So, it's a bull.

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,041
Yeah but look, every matador
who faces him gives up.

99
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:11,541
But Marco is way more brave.

100
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,583
Oh dear.

101
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,583
Now I'm getting all tingly.

102
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,083
Maybe it's your stubble.

103
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:21,666
Oh, no, now I've made
the girl uncomfortable.

104
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,750
Hatchin.

105
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,291
Hiroshi's kid.

106
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,041
Yeah, bu-- wha--?

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,208
I came back to see Satoshi.

108
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,500
Listen, Michiko, everything
has changed since back then.

109
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,000
Monstro is now a
full-fledged crime syndicate.

110
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,833
And Satoshi, you see,
is their leader.

111
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,166
Yeah I know.

112
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,416
Then what good will
seeing him do at this point?

113
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,666
Pretty sure he knows
where Hiroshi is.

114
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,750
Hiroshi?

115
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,625
Sweetie, he's been
dead for years!

116
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,041
He's alive, I'm sure of it!

117
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,208
Didn't you hear?

118
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,625
About the bus incident?

119
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,458
Yeah, it proves my point.

120
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,541
Oh, you silly, busty hot-head.

121
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,833
What are you talking about?

122
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,250
Do you need me to explain
to you what went down next?

123
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,083
After you went all
cray-cray on Fantasma?

124
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,083
Enough, I don't
wanna hear it.

125
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,125
Leggo!

126
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,833
Once Kiril was gone,
you got arrested, right?

127
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,500
Immediately after,
a Monstro body was found,

128
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,583
and it was all-out war.

129
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,666
Lemme be clear,
a lotta people died.

130
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,041
Fantasma, Monstro,
and plenty of innocents.

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,666
Yeah, so what if they did?

132
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,000
You're the one who started
all of it, aren't you?

133
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,708
You can't go and kill
someone like that,

134
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,500
just because
they beat you up!

135
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,291
I didn't--

136
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,166
Didn't what?

137
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,916
Gonna say you didn't kill him?

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,541
Then why did you admit to it?

139
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,958
First, Kiril said he was
going out to meet with you.

140
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,333
Then he doesn't come back,
and they find him dead!

141
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,041
Anyone would think
that you were the one who--

142
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,666
Shut up!

143
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,291
I only ever saw
Kiril that once!

144
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,291
I forgot what he even
looks like, years ago!

145
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,291
Long as I'm at it I'll tell
you this: Satoshi Batista,

146
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,583
he isn't here.

147
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:07,000
The only ones left are Fantasma,
under the control of Monstro.

148
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,541
Where is he then?

149
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,708
Please.

150
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,625
I'll say it again.

151
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,375
Fantasma are
the only ones here.

152
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,833
Whatever story you're stickin'
to these days, Michiko,

153
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,541
everyone else thinks you're
the one who killed Kiril.

154
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,750
And now that you know,
you need to leave.

155
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,750
Otherwise, you're
gonna get killed.

156
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,083
Besides.

157
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,875
I've done all I can.

158
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,333
I can't look at you anymore.

159
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,500
Yeah fine.

160
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,458
Same here.

161
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,750
Come on in.

162
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,625
'Kay.

163
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,083
Sit anywhere.

164
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,541
So, is this--?

165
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,833
Is this the place where
you were born, Michiko?

166
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,875
Dunno if I was born here or not,
but this is where I grew up,

167
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,083
yeah.

168
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,666
It's where I met your old man.

169
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,583
You mean here?

170
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,041
Yeah.

171
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,291
Don't move, Sasha!

172
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:34,000
Try anything and we blast
a hole----right through you?

173
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,333
Beat it.

174
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,083
Go to hell.

175
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,666
They're still wet.

176
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:44,958
Dude!

177
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,250
What choice we got?

178
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:47,625
Take it!

179
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,875
Now just stay put,
and don't look at me.

180
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,166
Do like we tell you,
and we won't have to--

181
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:57,875
'Ey!

182
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,625
Hold on!

183
00:10:58,708 --> 00:10:59,291
Whoa!

184
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,333
Wait!

185
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,208
Damn it!

186
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,208
Next time I load my own gun!

187
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,458
Don't look at
those without askin'.

188
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,166
The other one?

189
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:24,666
So uh, I'm guessin'
that man is Hiroshi.

190
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,458
Isn't it?

191
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,791
Yeah.

192
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,291
Goofy lookin' face.

193
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,708
We're here.

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,083
Yeah, so 'here' would be?

195
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,333
It says "take care of you."

196
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,000
What's that supposed to mean?

197
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,375
It means to look after you.

198
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:02,250
When you get inside,
find an old lady named Zélia.

199
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,625
It's all written down there;
your favorite foods,

200
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,958
personality.

201
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,875
Everythin' about you,
far as I know.

202
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,583
And what do you plan on doing?

203
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,666
I gotta go find
a guy named Satoshi.

204
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,833
He's been hangin' with Hiroshi
ever since they were kids.

205
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,083
He's gotta know
somethin' about 'im.

206
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,041
Then, Hatchin,
I'll come for you.

207
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,458
Take this.

208
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,041
I'm coming, too.

209
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,666
You can't.

210
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,416
Why not?

211
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,250
You just can't.

212
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,416
It's too dangerous.

213
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,833
I can take care of myself!

214
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,833
You'll get in the way!

215
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,875
I didn't--

216
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,208
Then why have you been
dragging me around?

217
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,791
Just so you can dump me off?

218
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,291
Why should I let someone
I don't even know look after me?

219
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,041
Huh?

220
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,250
Tell me!

221
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:01,458
No, hang on--It's
not like that.

222
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,750
Hatchin!

223
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,208
Are you even sure he's alive?

224
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,875
'Cause if he is, then why
the hell has he left

225
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,958
you and me alone all this time?

226
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,916
You don't think he's alive?

227
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,416
No.

228
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,958
Then you don't
believe in me, either?

229
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,666
No!

230
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,666
So you wanna
just part ways here?

231
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,750
Yeah, I do.

232
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,750
I think it's for the best.

233
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,375
How'm I supposed
to get by with no money?

234
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,166
Vasily, sir?

235
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,375
It's Peixe here.

236
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,166
What is it?

237
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,375
I just spotted Michiko Malandro
over on Pintinho Street.

238
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,500
She had a kid with her, who she
just dropped off somewhere.

239
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,791
She's currently on
a bike, heading east.

240
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,958
Michiko Malandro.

241
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,291
So, Kiril, this woman you
let go, she's makin' noise

242
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,541
all over town, asking about
Monstro, kicking up a ruckus

243
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,833
we don't need.

244
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,958
The film crew is starting
to get nervous too,

245
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,583
saying they might even
cancel the Vermelha shoot.

246
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:38,125
This would be quite
a loss, Kiril.

247
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,500
So then, your plan?

248
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,583
It's too late.

249
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,583
You shoulda just
shut the bitch up then.

250
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,541
Once this is all over,
we're gonna ask you

251
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:48,083
to step down as leader.

252
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,708
I know.

253
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,708
Where the hell's Sasha?

254
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,625
I see.

255
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,958
Kiril, I am coming with you!

256
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:08,500
Forget it, Vaseely.

257
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,583
I'll be just fine.

258
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
I have to protect you guys.

259
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,333
Comes with the job.

260
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,250
You taught me well, Kiril.

261
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,041
Now that
responsibility's mine.

262
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:32,666
"I ask on yarrs of frennship
that you tack keer of hor."

263
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,458
What on Earth is this?

264
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:39,416
"Take care of her?"
Um, I guess.

265
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,125
This is not the kind of
letter you give to someone.

266
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,916
Ah, how pathetic.

267
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,083
I did not want her
to grow up like this.

268
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:47,666
So?

269
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,958
What about her?

270
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,916
Where is Michiko now?

271
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,291
She just left.

272
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,625
I'm not sure where.

273
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:59,166
I trust you have money, right?

274
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,791
No.

275
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,708
Alright listen up,
short stuff.

276
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,750
Seems like it's asking an awful
lot to drop you off here

277
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,083
without any money, yes?

278
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,166
What do you expect me
to do with this?

279
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,958
Start a line of credit?

280
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,541
The world simply
does not work that way.

281
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,541
Come back when
you've got some cash.

282
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,708
We'll talk about it then.

283
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,541
Thanks for humiliating me.

284
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,250
And here I thought
she was gonna protect me,

285
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,333
no matter what!

286
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,833
That's right.

287
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:35,208
That is what she said, but--

288
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:38,458
But she slapped me!

289
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,916
She'll pay for that.

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,916
I'll hit her!

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,041
I'll hit her good!

292
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,833
Always acting so cool.

293
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,458
"Get in the way" my butt!

294
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,250
And after she got
all teary-eyed.

295
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,708
I know what's up!

296
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,333
Truth is, she's just lonely,
puttin' up a brave front.

297
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,250
Whatever, I'm still
gonna hit her!

298
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,708
No matter what!

299
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,625
Then maybe we'll talk!

300
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,416
So, to help your pals who
were taken by Fantasma,

301
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
you wanted to grab
this Kiril Capek guy's lady

302
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,000
and take her hostage.

303
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,375
Instead, you found me.

304
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,916
That the gist?

305
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,208
Yeah so um,
she must be pretty hot.

306
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,666
Right?

307
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,708
So, you're still goin, huh?

308
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,291
All alone?

309
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,583
You're not scared?

310
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,166
I mean, you could get killed.

311
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,083
Killed, you say.

312
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:47,666
Hell, if just me dyin' is what
it takes to save the others--

313
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,958
Then fine.

314
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,458
I decided to
do this on my own.

315
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,416
Gotta finish it the same way.

316
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,250
Why not jus' call it off?

317
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,875
Hey, look.

318
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,625
Sun's out.

319
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,000
Hey.

320
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,208
Are you hungry at all?

321
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,291
Let's eat.

322
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:22,375
I decided to come
with you to Kiril's.

323
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,166
It's not like that, Hatchin.

324
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,333
He's a coward.

325
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:43,500
That's why I hafta go to him.

326
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,416
You and I hafta
go and find him.

327
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,541
So, you've got quite a bit
of money saved up, don'tcha?

328
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,083
Sure do, been squirrelin'
away what I can for years now.

329
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,166
Everyone's layin' odds on
what you're gonna use it for.

330
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,875
I'm gonna spend it
all on myself, of course.

331
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,916
I mean, who else is gonna
look after me in the future,

332
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,333
you know?

333
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,208
It's been a lot harder for me
to get around lately.

334
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,583
There are days I'm so
miserable, I just want to cry.

335
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,375
You've still got
the children, though.

336
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,666
None of them give a damn
about poor little old me.

337
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,666
Once they're gone,
they're gone.

338
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,458
No one comes back to visit.

339
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,416
Besides, I never even liked
children all that much

340
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,208
to begin with.

341
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,958
They're so loud,
and dirty, and rude.

342
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,791
I can't stand them.

343
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,916
What have we here?

344
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,416
No!

345
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,083
She is not in here.

346
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,083
Not here, either.

347
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,833
There's just some kid.

348
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,208
Must be the one
who was with Michiko.

349
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:11,916
All right.

350
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,875
Bring her on back here.
