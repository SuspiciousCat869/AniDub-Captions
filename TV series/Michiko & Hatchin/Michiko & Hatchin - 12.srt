1
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:50,791
Are you okay?

2
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:52,250
Michiko?

3
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,375
Yeah, I knew it.

4
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:57,083
Knew what?

5
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,666
That you've got a fever!

6
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,166
I told you we needed
to stop and get some rest!

7
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,375
Why won't you ever
listen to anyone?

8
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,083
You're wrong, Hatchin.

9
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,416
The reason I'm hot--

10
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,208
--is because unlike you,
I'm jus' a hot woman.

11
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,583
There's sump'm
wrong with yer face.

12
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,500
But I'm hot.

13
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,500
Michiko!

14
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:23,000
April Twenty-Eighth.
Michiko has collapsed.

15
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,208
Well hello!

16
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,541
Oh, hello.

17
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,875
You're the young'un next door.

18
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,291
I hear your mom is sick.

19
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,375
Huh?

20
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,333
She is your mom, right?

21
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,416
Yeah, course she is.

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Here, sweetie, have this.

23
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,958
So how old are you?

24
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,083
'Bout ten? Such a lovely age!

25
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,250
After that, they
all just turn rotten.

26
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,625
But you're not that
kinda girl. Your mom's

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,500
one of the lucky ones!

28
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,458
You must be taking a trip, huh?

29
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:03,125
As it happens, I'm a traveler
as well. 'Course, I'm on my own.

30
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,791
It's a lot harder than I
thought, you know what I--?

31
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,458
Oh, right, you wouldn't.
I'm so alone.

32
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,541
But I won't let it get me down!

33
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,458
Also, you shouldn't
leave that running.

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,583
Later! If you need
anything, just holler!

35
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,583
Take care!

36
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,250
I wonder how long
this medicine takes to work.

37
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,958
That hotel bill
is gonna keep growing.

38
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:42,125
If it's too many more days,
we'll have to sneak off

39
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,791
and that's no good.

40
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, yeah, if that's the
direction you're heading--

41
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,958
There's a dormitory where
you can stay for 27 arcas.

42
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,833
I know, right?

43
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:54,875
'Scuse me.

44
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,250
Yes? How can I help?

45
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,958
Do you know of any jobs?
I'm a hard worker,

46
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,541
and I'll do anything
I'm suitable for.

47
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,041
Maybe, can ya start tonight?

48
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,250
Yes.

49
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,000
Give this number a call.
It's real simple work

50
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,500
and the pay's good.

51
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,166
Thank you very much, sir.

52
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,333
Five arcas.

53
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,208
So, um.

54
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,750
I'm also looking for a clinic
where someone without I.D.

55
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:23,083
can go? Cheap, if possible, but
one with a skilled doctor?

56
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,875
Is there anywhere like that?

57
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,708
Michiko, I found a doctor!

58
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,666
Not goin'. No way.

59
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,125
Stop acting like such
a baby. You have to go,

60
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,666
or you'll never get better!

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,250
I am better. Hale an' frickin'
hearty. And I'm not a baby,

62
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,500
I'm a grown-up. You go by
yourself if you wanna, Hatchin.

63
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,250
Like I said. "Baby".

64
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,583
Do you know what
fundamental principle

65
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,458
governs this entire universe?

66
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:09,750
That of causality-- of cause
and effect. And I am the one,

67
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,333
supreme god, who is
able to break it.

68
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:17,125
As such, people
refer to me as "Deus."

69
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:22,875
Bem-vindo à Galáxia! In God's
hands, any and all ailment

70
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,083
is alleviated in an instant.

71
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,791
I want to leave.
But this man--

72
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,500
--is all I have right now.

73
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,875
Gérson.

74
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:37,500
Mm-hm. Prepare to operate.

75
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,625
Operate?

76
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,000
Miracle show time,

77
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,791
satisfaction one-hundred-twenty
percent guaranteed.

78
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,875
I dare you to try stickin'
that thing in my arm!

79
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,416
I'll put you on an
express train to hell!

80
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,250
It's just an anesthetic. 

81
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,916
Gérson, hold her down!

82
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,750
Here is the void.
Nothing but nothingness.

83
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,458
Big bang!

84
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,958
The universe expands! Into the
living darkness of galáxia,

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,166
I call forth
the light of the sun!

86
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,208
I make the
Heaven and the Earth!

87
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,458
The dust begets rain,
which begets the seas!

88
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:27,583
The land grows forth! And flora
and fauna to thrive upon it!

89
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,041
And then, finally,
I created you.

90
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,000
It is a failed creation,
full of defects.

91
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,125
Do you hear that sound?

92
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,333
It is--

93
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,791
The rhythm of life itself.

94
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,708
Rebirth.

95
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,083
Are you okay?

96
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah. I feel better somehow.
That doctor's pretty awesome.

97
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,916
This was the cause
of it all. You can relax now.

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,625
A divine feat. Magic hands.

99
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,541
Her chart and invoice.

100
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,541
Um, this is not what
we had discussed.

101
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,750
Take a look.

102
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,083
"Additional
services cost extra?"

103
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,458
That's right. 

104
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,833
But I don't have that much.
Besides, you didn't--

105
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,541
--tell me any of that!

106
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,041
You've been told now,
haven't you?

107
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,583
I can't. I can't accept this.

108
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:10,083
I am an evangelist of
happiness and you doubt me?

109
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,166
I have never once thought
of myself as being a god!

110
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,500
Not once! I am merely
a humble conduit!

111
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,250
And yet you dare--!

112
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,375
Gérson.

113
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,833
Amigo.

114
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,541
Yes. That's right,
I'm your amigo.

115
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,333
If you do not have faith
in my treatments,

116
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,875
all my sacred efforts
will have been for nothing,

117
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,791
and she will remain
sick forever more.

118
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,125
Naturally.

119
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,958
I have a job. I'll work
to get the money tonight.

120
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,333
I promise I'll
bring it tomorrow.

121
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,208
I see, then you do
believe in Deus?

122
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,458
Sure.

123
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,041
All the same, I'll take
that promise in writing.

124
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,250
Fine.

125
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:59,083
It was like I was all alone
on an express train to Hell.

126
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,791
You try'na getcher
self killed, ya little shit?

127
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:23,625
Look at him eye-ballin' me.
Next time kid.

128
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,500
When those cock-suckin' bandits
show up, you shout good

129
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,500
and loud, got it?
Don't let 'em get away.

130
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,541
Bandits, great.

131
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,583
Um.

132
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,250
Yeah, what?

133
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,083
May I use your phone?

134
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,000
Mister! 

135
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,041
You got even less sense
than the damn dog.

136
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,375
Didn't really earn nothin'.

137
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,833
I ain't gonna pay ya.

138
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,458
Take as much'a this
as you like though.

139
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,875
Let's go, Buddy!

140
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:07,333
I understand what
you're saying. However.

141
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,000
What is this?

142
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,458
Tomorrow.

143
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,750
Tomorrow? Tomorrow doesn't
come the same for everyone.

144
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,250
What's this? "If payment
is not made by the due date,

145
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,291
then for each day overdue,
I agree to pay double

146
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,583
in interest? Hana"?

147
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,583
What the heck is this?

148
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,416
That's not the paper I signed!

149
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,708
Don't be silly,
young lady, of course it is.

150
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,791
My writing is not that sloppy!

151
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:41,291
We can settle it in court,
amigo. I don't mind at all.

152
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,958
You came calling on God. And
I'll bet you have not just one,

153
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,583
but a hundred skeletons
in your closet! Hm?

154
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,208
Michiko!

155
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:07,375
I'm okay. I'm okay.

156
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,916
Fever hasn't gone down at all.

157
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,125
What?

158
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,875
And why are you
drinking this poison?

159
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,291
'Cause I'm in pain.
Makes my throat feel better.

160
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,666
I only had a little.

161
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,125
What? Are you nuts?
You're not getting any better

162
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,333
'cause you're drinking
this and nothing else!

163
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,541
Yeah, I know.

164
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:39,916
No, you don't! You don't
know anything! Argh!

165
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,833
Hatchin.

166
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,250
Shut up!

167
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:47,208
You know I feel like shit.
You could at least be nice.

168
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,958
Well look who's here! 

169
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,416
Please, c'mon in.

170
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,416
Yeah, no. Here.

171
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,541
Oh, thank you, dear.

172
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,791
Little bruised,
but they still look tasty.

173
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,875
Um, I need a favor.

174
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,166
What's that?

175
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,458
I have a good feeling.
Everything will be fine.

176
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,541
Hatchin!

177
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,541
Hiroshi?

178
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,750
It is him. Hatchin!

179
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,583
Who the hell are you?

180
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,625
Shit!

181
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,625
Why, Hiroshi?

182
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,041
The bandits are
coming tonight. No question.

183
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,666
That's what my sharp
sixth sense is telling me.

184
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,166
Um, who're you?

185
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,333
Ah, you're awake. I'm
a friend of your daughter's.

186
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:27,000
There you go, the fragrance
sample you requested from us.

187
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,666
Then, these are--?

188
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,208
Those? Yes, they're mine.

189
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,625
Get out, would you?

190
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,833
Oh, keep it down for a minute.
You know how Feliciano

191
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,291
just got dumped? He's in
a delicate place right now.

192
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:42,875
Feliciano's about to get lucky.
He's gonna do that lady doctor.

193
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,500
Lady doctor?

194
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,208
They have a
fantastic wine list.

195
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,125
Mm-hm.

196
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,458
Do you not like it raw?

197
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,541
I am a bit apprehensive.

198
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,250
Oh, I'm sure you'll
be just captivated.

199
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,375
It's good to be adventurous.

200
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,625
What do you think?

201
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,916
That's something I should
be asking you, isn't it?

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,375
Maybe.

203
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,208
Hey! Hold on!
What're you doing?

204
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:20,541
So, try to guess the color of
the panties I'm wearing today.

205
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,958
I can't stand
to feel constrained.

206
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,833
Kimonos are smooth.
I love the way they feel.

207
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,958
I truly mean that.

208
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,291
See?

209
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,583
I knew from the day we met.

210
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,416
I knew that you were
the one for me.

211
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,916
Free me.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,083
No, Doc, I can't.

213
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,958
Wait, of course I can!

214
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,125
Just sit tight, Hiroshi.

215
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:16,166
I'm comin' to find you,
right now.

216
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,875
Do you not like it raw?

217
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,250
Oh, I'm sure you'll be
just captivated.

218
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,791
Hey Doc.

219
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,041
I'm constrained. Free me.

220
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:48,083
Hiroshi's about to get lucky.
He's gonna do that lady doctor.

221
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,833
Hiroshi!

222
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,875
What the fuck?

223
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,041
This is the void! Nothingness! 

224
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,000
Big bang!

225
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,250
I'm cursed!

226
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,708
These guys.

227
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,625
These guys put a curse on me.

228
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,333
They're here.

229
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,041
Hold it!

230
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,750
It's you!

231
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,708
So now you're gonna
become a bandit, huh?

232
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,083
No!

233
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,166
Buddy!

234
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,916
Don't move!

235
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,125
That's it. Out of options.

236
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,708
Oh hi!

237
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,208
So tell me hon, I thought you
were going to take your mom

238
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,750
to see the doctor.

239
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:16,666
Well, I took her to
a man named Deus. But um--

240
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,708
Oh, no. Not that quack.

241
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,208
Everyone in town
knows his story.

242
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,125
Used to be an unlicensed
general practitioner,

243
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,541
but he was a gambling
addict. He started that

244
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,750
psychic surgery business as
a way to pay back his debts.

245
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,375
"Psychic surgery?"

246
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,166
Yep. He doesn't use
scalpels, he claims he

247
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,875
"extracts the focus of
the disease from the body."

248
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,583
But it's a bunch of hogwash.

249
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:42,625
Third-rate magic trick,
at best.

250
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,708
No different than pullin'
a rabbit from a hat.

251
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,375
And I bet he did his whole,
"Divine feat, magic God hands"

252
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,708
schtick, right?

253
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:51,458
No one ever goes
to him anymore.

254
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,458
I knew it.

255
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,875
I knew it.
I'm an idiot. Total idiot.

256
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,500
Please look after Michiko.

257
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,291
If you're God,
then I'll be the Devil.

258
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,375
Get down on your knees,
Deus! And then we'll talk!

259
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,458
Deus! Get out here!

260
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,625
Where is he?

261
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,666
Ow! Please stop!

262
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,000
Remove the curse
you put on me!

263
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,708
What are you talking ab--ow!

264
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,458
I'm talkin' about the
curse you put on me, jerk!

265
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,583
Don't play dumb with me!

266
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,708
What are you doing?

267
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:56,708
Wait, Hatchin, it's not--. I
get it now. I get everything!

268
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,041
All this?

269
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,916
It's a curse! A curse!

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,750
Why you makin' that face?
I see. You're in on it, too!

271
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,583
What's that for? You gonna hit
me with that pipe, are ya?

272
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,583
Then bring it!

273
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,791
S'right. I ain't
scared of you one bit.

274
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:24,208
The earth is movin'! The
whole damn world is spinnin'!

275
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,958
Michiko?

276
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:41,875
You got it wrong, Hatchin.
Don't get mad, hear me out.

277
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,125
I've been--

278
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,750
--terribly uncivilized.

279
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,041
Hatchin.

280
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,916
I'm not mad.

281
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,125
So let's get you to
a real clinic. The lady in

282
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:09,958
the next room said
she would take us today.

283
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:27,041
But more importantly, we have
to deal with the broken TV.
