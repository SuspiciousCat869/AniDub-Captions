1
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,250
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Inspector.

2
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,625
The verdict is in.

3
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,125
And it looks
like you're in luck.

4
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:52,666
Ilha Azul, the "Blue Island,"
full of wonder and nature.

5
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,208
Not a bad assignment.

6
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,208
Go, Atsuko.

7
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,333
Don't lose heart!

8
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:00,250
This is just a test!

9
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,791
You are the
Queen of the Jungle!

10
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,458
Hey, Atsuko.

11
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,291
What are you still doing here?

12
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,458
You're on cleanup duty around
the ruins this morning,

13
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:50,291
aren't you?

14
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,708
Hop to.

15
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,208
Carelessness can prove
to be quite deadly, you know.

16
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,000
Does it ever not rain here?

17
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,333
Come on, Atsuko.

18
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,083
Everyone back at the
house is all excited,

19
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,833
waiting for their presents.

20
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:22,625
You can't punk out now.

21
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,208
We're the oldest,
it's our responsibility.

22
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,000
You won't get away
that easy, you little thief!

23
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, you're gonna
tell me your name!

24
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,333
You got a name, don't cha?

25
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,708
Huh?

26
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,666
Tell me your damn name
or I'm gonna call the cops!

27
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,541
You ain't gonna
last long in jail.

28
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,583
Yeah, police?

29
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,833
I've got a two-bit,
no-good thief in my--

30
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll be taking these.

31
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,541
Why, you little brat!

32
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,750
Get your ass back here!

33
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,583
Come and get me...

34
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,166
It's clear now.

35
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,458
I've gotta get away from Michiko
or I'll end up just like her:

36
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,000
No good.

37
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,333
Hello?

38
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,625
We got a thief back
at our place!

39
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,750
Right there!

40
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,750
Thanks for comin'.

41
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,250
Caught this one stealin'.

42
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,125
You should go toss her
in the river like a rat,

43
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,000
so she never comes back.

44
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,916
Take your foot off her.

45
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,291
Look at this big ole
caterpillar tryin' to

46
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,208
wriggle her way outta here!

47
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,916
Get off.

48
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,416
I'll send all of y'all
to hell, ya hear me?

49
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,041
Callin' the pigs on my ass?

50
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,583
Not cool!

51
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,041
Bang!

52
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,833
Hey look at me, girl.

53
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,833
I said--look at me.

54
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,416
Here you go, ma'am.

55
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,833
Take it.

56
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,041
You got a name?

57
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,625
Go on.

58
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,333
It's Vanessa Lee.

59
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,250
And where do you live?

60
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,458
Hey! I don't need
your damn handouts!

61
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,583
I ain't even hungry, lady!

62
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,333
She's gone.

63
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:47,083
My poor Marmelada is gone.

64
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,625
Not to worry, young man.

65
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,333
Operation: Marmelada
is well under way.

66
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,375
And no task is impossible
for my Queen of the Jungle!

67
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,416
Now what?

68
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,750
Consider this a trade.

69
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,583
I'm giving you this coconut,
and that's the reason

70
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,416
you bought me that
sandwich yesterday, claro?

71
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,958
It's not like I don't
have money, it's just that

72
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,000
I'd prefer not to use it now.

73
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,208
I don't want you
to think I'm like some kind

74
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,000
of beggar or something.

75
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,041
What'chu doin'
out here, anyway?

76
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,208
This is Operation: Marmelada.

77
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,291
Important mission.

78
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,916
And who is that?

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,375
A monkey who ran away.

80
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,833
You're shittin' me.

81
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,791
A-ha!

82
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,208
Damn it!

83
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,291
Nailed it!

84
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,625
What? Jeez, it'll take more than
that to kill the furball.

85
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,625
He's fine, I didn't
do anything wrong!

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,541
--Hi!
--Hello!

87
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,791
I was thinkin' we oughtta
throw you a welcome party soon.

88
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,541
Something to help you
settle in here.

89
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,750
Make you feel more at home.

90
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,916
Captain.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,708
Sorry, it won't
be monkey duty every day.

92
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,458
No, what's up with
this Vanessa Lee girl?

93
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,500
Vanessa Lee, huh?

94
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,375
Have you had a chance to wander
around the Temanga ruins yet?

95
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,125
No.

96
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,750
Well, there are these stone
reliefs at the entrance, see?

97
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,458
There's a man
sitting in a chair.

98
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,000
That's King Temanga.

99
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,375
And in front of him are a group
of women, arms outstretched,

100
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,958
holding a large pot.

101
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,375
And it shines, which is why
it's called the Golden Pot.

102
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,125
Supposedly, it's buried
somewhere in those ruins.

103
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,041
It's said if you
follow the water channel,

104
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,166
you'll eventually
reach Temanga's chamber,

105
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,208
and that's where
the Golden Pot is.

106
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,083
But nobody's
ever been inside it.

107
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,833
It's been consecrated
as holy ground,

108
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,541
going back to ancient times.

109
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,750
But then, every once
in a while, some outsider

110
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,000
will come along and
violate that tradition.

111
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:33,000
Vanessa's father was one,
and that's what lured him here.

112
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,458
She was still a young girl,
only about fifteen or so,

113
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,000
when he brought her along.

114
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,500
The real rebellious type,
you know,

115
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,291
picking fights with everyone.

116
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,250
She was outta
control back then.

117
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,125
But now, she's settled
down, lives alone,

118
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,833
and works on the
coconut plantation.

119
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,500
What happened to her old man?

120
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,041
Oh, he drowned in the river.

121
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,833
Just about a year ago, now.

122
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:11,166
Damn, you just gonna
walk right on past me?

123
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,416
Well, anyway,
I'm sorry, about the monkey.

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,791
It's not like I hurt the
thing on purpose, you know.

125
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:19,125
Don't even know
why I'm apologizing.

126
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,708
Come on, wait!

127
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,625
Follow me!

128
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:45,541
This is my secret spot.

129
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,875
Gets even more scenic,
if ya believe it.

130
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:52,416
When the skies are clear.

131
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,333
The water's amazing!

132
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,375
I've heard about you.

133
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,958
You're, like, super-famous.

134
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,458
And a crook to boot.

135
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,833
You were playing
both sides, right?

136
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,333
The police and Monstro.

137
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,833
No one could touch you.

138
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,083
Think I got it.

139
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,708
Oh yeah, you had it made!

140
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,291
But you're too hard
on yourself.

141
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,500
If you're gonna be crooked--

142
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,625
You should just own it
and be crooked.

143
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,708
Vanessa.

144
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,250
You need somethin'?

145
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,208
What's your angle?

146
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,916
Why'd you show me this?

147
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:00,916
I know you don't want
to be stuck here forever.

148
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,791
I can see it on your face.

149
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,166
And I might be in
a position to help you out.

150
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,416
That is, if you're
willin' to help me in return.

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,583
Help you how?

152
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,041
Temanga's Golden Pot.

153
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,166
You know about it, right?

154
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,458
I'm gonna bring it out.

155
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,958
And with a discovery like that,

156
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,958
you'll be even more
super-famous.

157
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,416
So what?

158
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,916
Fame is overrated
in my opinion.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,541
Only thing I give
a crap about is the money.

160
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,708
That pot?

161
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,333
Worth a friggin' fortune,
when we find it.

162
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,041
I been waitin'
a long time, ya see.

163
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:32,833
Waitin' for
a partner just like you.

164
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,500
The path can get
a bit slippery here,

165
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,083
so please watch your step.

166
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,333
This is the entrance
to the water channel.

167
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,208
Since it's been
classified as holy ground,

168
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,333
this area is off limits to us.

169
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,375
But feel free to gaze at
these lovely stone reliefs.

170
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,333
Pictured here, you'll see
King Temanga's Golden Pot.

171
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,583
It's because of this relief's
placement that some believe

172
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,208
the king's chamber lies
inside, though we have no way

173
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,375
to know for sure.

174
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,041
'Scuse me--But is
the actual gold pot

175
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,583
on display for us to see?

176
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,416
I wish it were,
but no one's ever found it.

177
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,458
Nowadays, it's commonly
accepted that the legend

178
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,541
of King Temanga
isn't true after all.

179
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,041
But it's a fun story.

180
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,541
Ready?

181
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,708
Tonight's the night.

182
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:56,625
We're going.

183
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,791
Look, Vanessa.

184
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,041
There's no pot
in those ruins, is there?

185
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,833
That's what everyone says.

186
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,916
Yeah, I know.

187
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,125
Further along in the ruins,
it comes to a dead end.

188
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,375
But it's fake.

189
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,750
The stones blocking the
way there don't match

190
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,875
the rest of the ruins;
they look totally different.

191
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,291
Which means there's
still something up ahead.

192
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,750
That's what my dad said,
and I think he was right.

193
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,750
So when they say
the pot isn't in there,

194
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,000
it's only because they don't
know how to get to it.

195
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,375
So then what?

196
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,166
Once you enter that
holy ground and steal the pot,

197
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,416
there's no coming back.

198
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
What, to this shithole?

199
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,166
I got nothing to come
back to, and besides,

200
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,750
I'm more than
ready to move on.

201
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,000
You wanna move on?

202
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:38,875
To where?

203
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,541
To wherever he is.

204
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,750
There's a guy?

205
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah there's a guy.

206
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,500
That so wrong?

207
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,750
He's a fool of a man,
who left with just his guitar

208
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,000
and a dream.

209
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:51,333
Said he was gonna be
a professional musician.

210
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,625
I thought he was kidding.

211
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,916
I mean, that's the dumbest
thing I ever heard.

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,583
But then, off he went.

213
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,333
Tell you the truth, his
music's not really anything

214
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:02,041
people wanna listen to,
but it doesn't totally suck.

215
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,291
Not hard to imagine how
that story ends, is it?

216
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,541
Certainly not
well for him, right?

217
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,083
Which is why I gotta be
there for 'im, you know?

218
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,541
How can you know
so much yet be so dumb?

219
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,291
I don't get you at all.

220
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:22,083
Now let's cut the girl talk
and get this show on the road.

221
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,958
You can back out if you want.

222
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,708
Either way though, I'm going.

223
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,666
And I'll be smiling
in the morning.

224
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,875
That much I can promise you.

225
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,583
"Rock Morena?"

226
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,458
What are you doin'
way out here, Ricardo?

227
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,583
You get the boot, too?

228
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,333
Volunteered for
your surveillance detail.

229
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:59,250
I figure I know you better
than anyone, even yourself.

230
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,500
I know you're bound to come into
contact with Michiko Malandro.

231
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,416
And that you'd be willing
to enlist Monstro's help

232
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,208
in order to make that happen.

233
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,000
Like you've done before.

234
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,333
So what's in it for you?

235
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,416
A promotion?

236
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,583
Yeah.

237
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,291
How many times are you
gonna sell me out?

238
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,250
Anyway I won't live up
to your expectations.

239
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,375
I'm not that stubborn
bitch-on-wheels you think

240
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,916
you know so well.

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,083
I'm actually enjoying it here.

242
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,375
Doing security for tour groups
and patrolling the jungle

243
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,541
for rogue chimps?

244
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,916
Hell yeah.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,750
S'funny, I've been watching
you here for a while,

246
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,083
not once have I seen you smile.

247
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,666
So is that how you
bait me into cooperating?

248
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,250
Listen up, Ricardo.

249
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,500
Monstro will be comin' after me
for the shit that went down.

250
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,958
That's just the
kinda guy Satoshi is.

251
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,333
And there's no chance in
hell of things playing out

252
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,416
the way you expect.

253
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,666
If I leave here to go
chasing after Michiko again,

254
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,416
I'm putting my own
life at risk.

255
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,000
And I've had more than
enough of that.

256
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,750
Weren't you gonna wait for me?

257
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,916
Vanessa.

258
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,041
Yeah, what?

259
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,166
Let's go back.

260
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,583
You nuts?

261
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,000
There's a gas
buildup down here.

262
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,000
Vanessa, hold up!

263
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,541
Let go 'a me!

264
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,958
I can go on without you!

265
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,541
Do you really wanna die here?

266
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,166
If this is where I die, fine.

267
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,083
I've planned this forever,
I can't turn back now.

268
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,541
If I get scared off by this--

269
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,083
Then how can I ever
protect the man I love?

270
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:43,958
Sorry.

271
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,208
No way I'm lettin' you through.

272
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:45,916
Shut up!

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,833
Come with me or get out!

274
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,958
Get off me, you stupid hag!

275
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,458
What are you--?

276
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,250
I can't go any farther.

277
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,250
We tried.

278
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,916
Would ya take a look at that.

279
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,041
It's a beautiful day.

280
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,125
Anyway, I'm going.

281
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,500
Even without the pot.

282
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,750
He's waiting for me.

283
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,083
Hey, you still mad at me?

284
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,250
Huh?

285
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,458
I'll give you
whatever you want.

286
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,708
Here.

287
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,291
Whoa.

288
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,500
Look at that, Atsuko!

289
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,916
Ilha Azul Police Station,
Captain Amado speaking.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,333
Sir!

291
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,458
Yes, sir, Atsuko is
working as hard as usual,

292
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,291
she's a real go-getter.

293
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,958
Yes, sir!

294
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,500
All right, goodbye.

295
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,583
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen her all morning.

296
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,125
Let's go, Ricardo.

297
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,458
Put some pants on, I'm gonna
help get you that promotion.

298
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,000
Come on, get up.

299
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,708
We're on our way
to Tomato Town.
