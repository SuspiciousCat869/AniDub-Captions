1
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,791
Thanks for waiting.

2
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,416
Here you are. Cup of hot milk.

3
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
What are they having?

4
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:54,375
Ah.

5
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,791
Want in on the fun?

6
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,541
That can be arranged.

7
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,583
They call it Yu Ming.

8
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,250
It's the Heike's
chewing tobacco.

9
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,041
One mouthful, and zing!

10
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,291
You're in fucking paradise.

11
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,000
Clearly you
don't know who I am.

12
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,458
Since when has this junk
had a market on my turf?

13
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,458
I thought I left Bonfá
in charge around here.

14
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,791
Call him. Tell him Big Chief
Satoshi wants to see him...

15
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,208
...or I'm going to show
you the shortest path

16
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,291
to fucking paradise.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,833
Well that was fast.

18
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,875
That bastard.

19
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,333
Dosed my drink.

20
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,166
Hiroshi?

21
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,916
Wait!

22
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,083
Come and get me, if you can.

23
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,458
Goddamn Peking ducks!

24
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,541
Nothing found from
the engine to Car Four.

25
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,541
Nothing found in Car Seven.

26
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,000
Now checking
Cars Five and Six.

27
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,333
Ricardo!

28
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,375
Ricardo?

29
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,625
Yeah, what is it?

30
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,875
Uh.

31
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:47,041
We're about to pack up
and head out, I think.

32
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,083
Oh yeah, Chief?

33
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,250
And then what?

34
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,666
Listen good!

35
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,125
I'm not going back
empty-handed.

36
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,166
Michiko Malandro's my
ticket outta here, got it?

37
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,041
Goddamn you, Jambo.

38
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,625
Grateful my left nut!

39
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,500
I'm stuck in hell!

40
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,666
Shit!

41
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,041
Just had an amazing dream.

42
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,291
It starts off with us
arriving in Goinia.

43
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,750
Hiroshi's there.

44
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,416
He sees me and cries
his big dumb heart out.

45
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,291
Runny nose and everything.

46
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,750
Your face is
a sloppy mess, too.

47
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,833
Because you're so happy.

48
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:30,375
So, yeah.

49
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,708
The three of us
live happily ever after.

50
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,708
Day after day, and we
almost never stop laughing.

51
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,541
I mean you stay
a little bit grumpy, of course.

52
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,583
That's just you.

53
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,625
But still, you
loosen up a touch.

54
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,541
All clear in Cars Ten
through Thirteen.

55
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,000
Look closely now.

56
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,416
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,875
I'm looking.

58
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,083
But the more I look,
the less sure I get.

59
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,375
We have a witness who's positive
they boarded this train.

60
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,500
Yeah?

61
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,625
You didn't see them
get off, did you?

62
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:33,833
No.

63
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,541
We're not supposed to
have any passengers.

64
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,458
And I don't have time to check
the cars each time we stop.

65
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,541
Look, I'm late.

66
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,875
Can I go?

67
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,916
We got to cast a wide net; I
need you to order checkpoints

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
on all the roads between here
and where they boarded.

69
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,208
Every single road.

70
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,291
That's some work.

71
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,375
Ah forget it.

72
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,208
I'll do it myself.

73
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,458
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.

74
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,333
I want you to pick
someone up there.

75
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,791
I'll bring her to you.

76
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,250
Hang on?

77
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,625
You'll get the rest then.

78
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,125
I.D. and exit permit, too.

79
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,583
Outsy-daisy.

80
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,625
Tell it to me straight,
and I might let you live.

81
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,083
How'd the Heike get on my turf?

82
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,083
You got a big fucking gun
pointed at you, Irmão.

83
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,833
If I just squeeze my finger!

84
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,958
Whoopsie!

85
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,916
I forget it's got
such a hair trigger.

86
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,875
Please!

87
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,625
I called Bonfá and told him!

88
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,750
I swear!

89
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,333
You telling me
Bonfá betrayed me?

90
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,791
Is that right?

91
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,166
Answer me.

92
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,125
All of Monstro
is like this now!

93
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,833
That Shinsuke guy took over!

94
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,458
He's the boss now, and he
joined up with the Heike!

95
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,041
That's all I know!

96
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,833
Was that so hard?

97
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,375
I ain't unreasonable.

98
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,583
Honestly.

99
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,375
I want to give the guy
a chance, you know?

100
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,708
But come on.

101
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,416
What the hell?

102
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,250
We found the car
Satoshi was driving.

103
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,541
Outside Desfiladeiro.

104
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,833
Desfiladeiro?

105
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,583
He ain't there.

106
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,416
Being a grown up means
being able to stand up

107
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,250
and say you're sorry, right?

108
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,458
Take it easy.

109
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,916
Yeah, you too.

110
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,791
You're the only one who
won't let us down, Chazzo.

111
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,625
You won't let us down.

112
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,833
Right, brother?

113
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,791
Wait hold on!

114
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,416
I got the burps.

115
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,666
Hiroshi.

116
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,708
Heh.

117
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:48,625
Wow.

118
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:50,666
If it isn't Jambo.

119
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,375
She's not here.

120
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,416
Your act's getting tired,
you got to mix things up.

121
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,708
Come mon.

122
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,458
You got to get in
a zinger every now and then.

123
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,291
What was that for?

124
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:27,291
Damn it, this shit
hasn't worn off yet?

125
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,541
I'm telling you now.

126
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,375
I ain't chasing after you.

127
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,000
Fuck all that noise.

128
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,125
You'll have to find me.

129
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:39,375
And I don't want to hear
none of your bullshit either!

130
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,833
Just get the hell out!

131
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,208
Now!

132
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,416
Who are you?

133
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
What's going on?

134
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,375
Eight tonight.

135
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,708
I'll have a truck
waiting for you.

136
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,791
You get into it, and they'll
take you across the border.

137
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,250
You'll be free.

138
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,458
I'll look after the girl.

139
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,291
Fuck you.

140
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,875
I won't do her wrong.

141
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,916
Don't sell me your
bullcrap, I ain't buying!

142
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,708
Don't you get it?

143
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,916
I'm your way out.

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,958
Like hell.

145
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,166
You're scared, aren't you?

146
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,583
Of Hiroshi breaking
your heart again.

147
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,083
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

148
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,750
Where the hell do you
think you can go?

149
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,375
I'm going to kill
that bitch-ass woman!

150
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,208
But for that, I'm going
to kill your ass first!

151
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,750
What did he
leave you behind for?

152
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,666
You must know by now.

153
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,541
No way things will
work out with a man

154
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,208
who doesn't want you around.

155
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,500
Shut up.

156
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,583
Time to face facts.

157
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,041
Shut up!

158
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,666
--Listen--
--Fuck you!

159
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,125
Yeah yeah, fuck me.

160
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,791
And you say I need a new act?

161
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,458
You wouldn't use the girl
to get to him, right?

162
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,000
Stop talking to me
like you know anything!

163
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,416
Hey!

164
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,208
I know you better than anyone
else in the world does!

165
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,958
Whenever you get screwed over,
you fall straight to pieces!

166
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,708
Don't you?

167
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,333
If you know me so well,
then you understand.

168
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,250
I have to try.

169
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,791
I have to.

170
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,458
Look, Michiko.

171
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,666
I'm done.

172
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,125
Stupid damn kid.

173
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,541
Huh?

174
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,416
You're Satoshi, aren't you?

175
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,000
And you run with
Michiko Malandro, right?

176
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,208
She here, too?

177
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,875
You don't have to say where.

178
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,291
She'll run out
of train soon enough.

179
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,208
Hey, whoa.

180
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,708
Easy.

181
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,500
Well I'll be damned.

182
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,208
You really are just like him.

183
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,833
So who brought you
into this world, huh?

184
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,125
Don't tell me that
dumb bitch is your mother!

185
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,125
Now this is your only warning,
don't get in my way!

186
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,083
She's on my
kill-them-when-I-see-them list.

187
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,416
And I can't wait
to pull the trigger!

188
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,416
Even God will
approve of that one.

189
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,458
One less piece of shit
staining His world!

190
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,208
Hiroshi.

191
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,541
I know where he is.

192
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:37,458
I swear.

193
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,791
I'll take you to him.

194
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,375
But you have to promise me
you won't hurt Michiko.

195
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,541
You bargaining with me?

196
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,166
See that's kind of funny.

197
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,208
Because I really
don't want to see him.

198
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,125
He does though.

199
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,375
I know it.

200
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,125
He wanted to see you.

201
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,250
He does, huh?

202
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,041
Why?

203
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:35,625
What the--?

204
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,166
Michiko!

205
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,500
Michiko!

206
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,291
Don't make a sound!

207
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,708
Those bastards.

208
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,041
Okay, brat.

209
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,583
That promise you wanted?

210
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,208
You got it.

211
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,541
Hatchin.

212
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,666
Hatchin!

213
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,166
Michiko!

214
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,625
You promised me!

215
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,208
Bang!

216
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,375
Hatchin!

217
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:30,166
Jump!

218
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,041
Jump!

219
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:33,625
Jump now!

220
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,000
Hatchin!

221
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,666
Hatchin!

222
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,375
Why?

223
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,083
Why are you sticking
your nose in this?

224
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,708
I don't need your help.

225
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,208
I've made it
this far, haven't I?

226
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,875
Him and me,
we're going to be happy.

227
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,458
I guaran-goddamn-tee it.

228
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,708
Going after them?

229
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,416
Of course.

230
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,000
Like always, you don't
care what I think.

231
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,375
If you're going to stand in
my way, give me all you got.

232
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,375
Just look at you.

233
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,625
Know what I wish?

234
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,208
I wish I'd never met you.

235
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:12,833
You like that?

236
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,250
You asked for all I got.

237
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,791
Well this is it!

238
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,916
Forget this shit!

239
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,583
All of it!

240
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,041
Atsuko.

241
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,125
Don't "Atsuko" me.

242
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,500
From now on we're strangers.
