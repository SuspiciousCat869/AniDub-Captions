1
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:16,166
[ORGA] Thanks for all
you've done for us.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,375
And make sure to give my
thanks to Bro, as well.

3
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,875
Feeling's mutual.

4
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,791
Living here was much more
amusing than I thought it'd be.

5
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:25,291
Come to think of it,
I never beat you even once.

6
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,625
But that'll change by the
next time we see each other,

7
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,458
so you had better
stay on your toes!

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,958
[ECO] Aw, we'd miss you too
much if it took that long.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,250
I don't think you realize what
you're getting yourself into,

10
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,708
my friend. It'd take years for
you to be as strong as our ace.

11
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,875
Heck, we might never
see you again.

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,291
That stings.

13
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,875
Hey, have any of you
guys seen Lafter?

14
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:48,458
[AZEE]
Hm? Oh, Lafter's...

15
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:50,708
Ya know, Akihiro,
you really scared me

16
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,625
in that battle we
had a while back.

17
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,666
You were injured, yet you still
plunged headlong into danger

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,833
without a second thought.

19
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,833
That may be, but everything
worked itself out in the end.

20
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,541
That's not the issue, Akihiro!

21
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,958
You have people under you now,

22
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,375
so being that reckless
isn't an option!

23
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,583
That's true...

24
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,541
And you're not gonna
be around anymore.

25
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:11,791
[LAFTER]
Uh?

26
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,083
To be honest, the only
people around this place

27
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:18,750
I could really trust to watch
my back were you and Mikazuki.

28
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:22,750
And you're right, I do need
to think things through.

29
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,083
I suppose...

30
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:28,500
That's good enough for now.

31
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:30,958
[AKIHIRO]
Hm? What is?

32
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:34,375
Here, let's shake on it.

33
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:35,416
[AKIHIRO gasps]

34
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,875
[AKIHIRO exhales]

35
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:45,541
[AKIHIRO] Thanks for all of
your help. Take care, okay?

36
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:47,875
You too, Akihiro.

37
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,333
[IOK]
What do you mean, impossible?

38
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,666
[JASLEY] While I admit it's a
great honor to have the son

39
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,041
of the Kujan family come
directly to us for assistance,

40
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,083
a direct confrontation
with Tekkadan

41
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,166
wouldn't be the wisest
course of action for--

42
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,458
Enough posturing!

43
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,208
I was a fool to rely
on someone like you!

44
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,000
No matter the personal cost,

45
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:40,208
I must have my revenge against
Tekkadan to repay the loyalty

46
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,083
of my subordinates who lost
their lives in that conflict.

47
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,041
[JASLEY] Please don't
misunderstand me, sir.

48
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,416
[gasps]

49
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,291
[JASLEY] I'm simply suggesting
that there might be

50
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,958
a more effective strategy
for us to utilize.

51
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,166
[gasps]

52
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,208
[JASLEY]
Tekkadan is merely an enforcer.

53
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:56,000
The real enemy isn't them,

54
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,833
but rather the ones who
are pulling their strings.

55
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,083
[IOK growls]

56
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,166
Out with it!
Who are these mongrels?!

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,500
[JASLEY]
The Turbines.

58
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,083
Tell me more.

59
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,625
[JASLEY] They're one of Teiwaz's
subsidiaries led by Naze Turbin,

60
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,958
who's like Tekkadan's
older brother.

61
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,708
Truth be told, the only thing

62
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,416
currently allowing Tekkadan
to hold on to their position

63
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,791
is the support they're
getting from the Turbines.

64
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,541
The Turbines, huh?

65
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:23,541
I get it now!
They're the target!

66
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,916
[IOK'S MAN 39A]
Master Iok,

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,208
what are you going to
do with these things?

68
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,041
Their use is prohibited under
the weapons ban treaty.

69
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,833
I'm well aware of that fact,
which is the very reason

70
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,125
why they're crucial to
the success of my plan.

71
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,041
Apologies, but shouldn't we
get Master Rustal's approval

72
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,583
before we begin?

73
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,250
That won't be a problem.

74
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,750
This operation will be for
Master Rustal's benefit

75
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,125
as well as ours.

76
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,625
We'll kill two, no,

77
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,333
make that three birds,
with the proverbial stone.

78
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,458
[IOK'S MAN 39A]
Are you certain things

79
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,958
are going to go your way, sir?

80
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:57,458
[IOK laughs] You couldn't
possibly comprehend this, but...

81
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,250
...this is just the
way politics work.

82
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,083
[IOK'S MAN 39A]
I see...

83
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,708
[JULIETTA]
Master Iok.

84
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,791
Don't try to stop me, Julietta!
I have to do this!

85
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,958
[JULIETTA]
I shall go with you.

86
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,666
The prototype machine has just
completed all of the necessary

87
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,166
bench tests. Now we only
need to try it in the field.

88
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,291
I want an opportunity to
evaluate its full capabilities.

89
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,166
[IOK]
But Julietta--

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,750
Give me this chance.

91
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:26,333
Please, I beg you. I must
become strong as fast as I can.

92
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,583
[gasps]

93
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,708
I understand, Julietta.

94
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,166
Let's defeat the
Turbines together!

95
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,291
I will bear full
responsibility for this!

96
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,750
The only thing I ask is that you
obey my orders no matter what!

97
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,083
[RUSTAL] I don't know
what to do about Iok.

98
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,041
Certainly, there's a right
job for every man,

99
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,750
but my plans for him do not
involve his strength.

100
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,000
[VIDAR]
Then what precisely do you want?

101
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,500
The Kujan family admires Iok.

102
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,250
Any member would gladly
lay down their life for him.

103
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,541
Although, this devotion
isn't purely out of loyalty

104
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,500
for their lord. His passion
have the uncanny ability

105
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:09,083
to motivate people in
ways they never expected.

106
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,708
If you would only remove
that mask of yours,

107
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:15,291
Iok wouldn't have to resort
to such unsavory methods.

108
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,791
[VIDAR] I am indebted to you
for saving my life, however,

109
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,541
until I can ascertain that
man's real intentions--

110
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,541
Of course, I can certainly
understand that.

111
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,375
And yet, comprehending the
depths of another man's mind

112
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,916
is no small task.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,791
Especially of a man like him.

114
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,000
[VIDAR] I believe I have
the right to understand him

115
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,875
better than anyone else.

116
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:39,750
After all, I was killed by him.

117
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:44,708
[MCGILLIS] Iok Kujan is cracking
down on the Turbines, is he?

118
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,250
[ISURUGI] Yes.

119
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,000
He's taken control of every
backdoor route the Turbines use.

120
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,666
Even the Krate Corridor.

121
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,125
So, someone within Teiwaz

122
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,166
leaked that kind of valuable
information, did they?

123
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,708
Anything else to report?

124
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,208
While at headquarters he
stopped at Warehouse Four

125
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:02,375
and took something
upon his departure.

126
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,250
From Four?

127
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,500
Tell me something, do you
remember it, Isurugi...?

128
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,791
The weapon Tekkadan used

129
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,666
to halt the Mobile Armor's
advance on Mars.

130
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,916
Sir?

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,208
Their long-range weapon
that it was a Dáinsleif.

132
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:21,000
Its power is so great it can
even pierce Nano-laminate Armor.

133
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,208
Because of its destructive
faculty, Gjallarhorn has banned

134
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,541
possession and use of
this massive railgun.

135
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,333
But they appeared to use
conventional warheads,

136
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,583
so they're in a grey area

137
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,208
as far as the terms of
the ban are concerned.

138
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,416
[ISURUGI]
So that means Lord Kujan is--

139
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,291
A Mobile Armor, a legacy
of the Calamity War,

140
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,583
has been discovered.

141
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,291
And a Gundam Frame,
piloted by Mikazuki Augus,

142
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,375
has displayed to the world the
power of the demons of old.

143
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,791
The resulting hysteria
and dread will no doubt

144
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,166
drive the people into
a state of frenzy.

145
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,333
Eventually, our entire
era might be engulfed.

146
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,333
Curious...

147
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,000
It feels as though
ancient weapons

148
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,958
are being brought out in droves.

149
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:03,083
However, these events might be
caused by the tide of the times.

150
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,333
[ISURUGI]
Then...

151
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,708
Get in touch with all of
our dedicated comrades.

152
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,125
Inform them that the moment
has come to take action.

153
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,708
Yes, sir!

154
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,500
[footsteps]

155
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,833
[MCGILLIS]
If the person behind that mask

156
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,791
is truly whom I think it is...
then it would mean Rustal Elion

157
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,458
already has his claws
around my throat.

158
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:29,291
And yet, he will never
be able to seize my soul.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,875
[ATRA]
Is floating like that easier?

160
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,916
Uh?

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,875
I brought you something to eat.

162
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:38,958
[MIKAZUKI]
Nice.

163
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,333
[ATRA]
Oh!

164
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,750
Here ya go.

165
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,666
It looks like an umbilical cord.

166
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,208
What does?

167
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,875
Oh! Ms. Azee and Lafter's trip.

168
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,875
They should've made it back home
to the Turbines by now, right?

169
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah.

170
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,625
[ATRA] Things are a little
quieter at Tekkadan

171
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,083
without them.

172
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,291
But I bet the Turbines are
happy they're finally back.

173
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:08,000
Especially the children,
and the little babies, too.

174
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,166
[ATRA]
It's really simple!

175
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,916
I want you to have
a baby with Mikazuki!

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,666
Uh? Uh!

177
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,458
What?!

178
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,541
[ATRA chugging]

179
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,125
[sighs]

180
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,916
Do you feel a bit better now?

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,250
I do...

182
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,000
That's good, but what came
over you so suddenly?

183
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,125
Uh...

184
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,583
[laughs]

185
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,333
[KUDELIA]
Hmm?

186
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,500
[ATRA] I was thinking about
something the shop manager

187
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,875
told me a long time ago.

188
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:44,125
That children are like tethers.

189
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,666
[KUDELIA]
"Tethers"?

190
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,125
[ATRA]
She said that when her husband

191
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,625
wouldn't commit to settling
down, she was able to

192
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,916
convince him to because she
was pregnant with his baby.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,583
Oh... Huh?!

194
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:57,166
Is that why you...?

195
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,625
Yeah...

196
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,708
Mikazuki might be
going far away,

197
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,458
so I was thinking you
could be his tether.

198
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,208
Well, if that's the case,
couldn't you do it Miss Atra?

199
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,875
Uh?! No way, that's impossible!

200
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,750
[ATRA]
I couldn't... because...

201
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,166
...Mikazuki is a really
amazing person.

202
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,625
[KUDELIA gasps]

203
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,958
[ATRA] I'm obviously
nowhere near good enough

204
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,958
for someone like him.

205
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,125
[KUDELIA]
You are also wonderful, Atra.

206
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,708
[ATRA]
Huh?

207
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,541
[KUDELIA] When I look at this
bracelet you gave me,

208
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,541
it makes me feel
connected to you.

209
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,750
And that connection
gives me courage.

210
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,125
Miss Kudelia...

211
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,333
And just think about it,
Mikazuki always wears his.

212
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,666
I'm sure he feels the
same way as I do.

213
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,208
Ya know?

214
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,083
Oh, I see.
Yeah, that makes sense.

215
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,750
Well, then I'll try
my hardest too!

216
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,000
Huh?

217
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:00,458
Let's both promise that we'll
tether Mikazuki to us!

218
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,833
[chuckles nervously]

219
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,833
And regardless of which
one of us manages to do it,

220
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,583
there won't be any hard
feelings, okay?

221
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,375
Huh? I... Wait!

222
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,958
Wh-What?!

223
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,208
Uh?

224
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,375
Uh...

225
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,166
So, about babies!

226
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,750
They sure are...
great, aren't they?!

227
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:23,166
[MIKAZUKI] Yeah, that line
around their wrists is neat.

228
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,333
That's true! Babies're really
cute, don't ya think?!

229
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm-hm.

230
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,333
[MIKAZUKI]
They look like a tasty ham.

231
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,958
[ATRA growls]

232
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,583
What?

233
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,666
No more food for you.

234
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,666
[MIKAZUKI]
I can't reach.

235
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,208
[ATRA]
I said no more.

236
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,208
[MIKAZUKI]
I... I can't... reach it...

237
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,875
What the heck are they
doing down there?


238
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,458
[ECO] All right, girls! I
think that did the trick!

239
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,041
We might've finally gotten
the right settings dialed in!

240
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,958
It's about damn time.

241
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,458
This Hekija is turning out
to be a lot more troublesome

242
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,583
than I thought it would be.

243
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,791
I know, right?

244
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,250
It's as if its lack of
quirks is its quirk.

245
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,916
That's true, but for a ragtag
group like Tekkadan,

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,666
with all sorts of crazy pilots
and intense missions,

247
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,125
this might be the best machine
for them in the long run.

248
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,250
[AZEE]
Hmm?

249
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,875
[LAFTER]
Hm? What?!

250
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,791
Oh, no. It's nothing at all.

251
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,458
[AMIDA] Thanks for your
hard work, girls.

252
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,500
[BOTH gasp]

253
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,125
[LAFTER]
Good to see you!

254
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,250
Sorry to put you
to work so soon.

255
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,166
Hopefully you've had
some time to rest up.

256
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,541
We're doing just fine.

257
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,458
Besides, keeping
busy is a good way

258
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,958
to keep my mind off of things.

259
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,208
[AMIDA]
Hmm?

260
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,791
[ECO]
Hey, Lafter!

261
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:36,750
I've changed the setting the way
you asked me to, so what now?

262
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,291
[LAFTER] We're all set!
I'm going out again!

263
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,041
Seems like a lot
happened out there.

264
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,166
While you were living
with Tekkadan, I mean.

265
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,250
Oh, well...

266
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,041
It's sort of hard to describe.

267
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,708
It's all over your faces.

268
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,708
You're such good honest kids.

269
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:54,500
Don't ever forget that
you're my pride and joy.

270
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,291
We won't, Ma'am.

271
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,250
[NAZE]
Really?

272
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,708
So I guess the time has come

273
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:02,250
for Lafter to be taken
away by another man.

274
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,833
[AMIDA] You almost seem
happy about it, Darling.

275
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,250
Now that you mention it,
I am in a way.

276
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,708
Lafter and the others
aren't just wives to me.

277
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,416
In some respects, they're
like my daughters, too.

278
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,750
And, if one of them
were to select

279
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,500
a boyfriend from Tekkadan,

280
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,416
it would mean that my daughter
had grown into a savvy woman

281
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,625
who knew what to
look for in a man.

282
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,416
Of course I'm happy.

283
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,625
You're really bringing
up Tekkadan, again?

284
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,625
Every other word you say
is about them these days.

285
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,166
Huh? Oh, you're drinking
the cheap stuff again?

286
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,333
[NAZE]
I like it.

287
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,416
It's the drink we had
when we first met.

288
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,166
That brings back memories.

289
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,416
It was a cheap little spaceport
bar on Mars, as I recall.

290
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,750
[AMIDA]
You want me as your bodyguard?

291
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,125
[NAZE]
Will you do it?

292
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,666
There's a big, slightly
dangerous score coming up.

293
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,041
You sure about this?

294
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,125
Many in this line of
work tend to back out

295
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,583
the instant they
learn I'm a woman.

296
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,208
[NAZE]
That's a strange thing to say.

297
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,333
Given a choice between the two,

298
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,625
I'd choose a woman
every day of the week.

299
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,458
[laughs] And you say
I'm the strange one.

300
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,083
[AMIDA]
You were a maverick trafficker,

301
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:13,708
and you hired me, a mercenary,
to stand by your side.

302
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,583
And that's how
our journey began.

303
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,041
[NAZE chuckles]

304
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,625
Man, she sure is somethin'.

305
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,250
[NAZE] I fell hard for you,
both on the job and off.

306
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,583
I pressed you to make our
partnership permanent, but...

307
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,833
I can't do this anymore.

308
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,041
I have an escort job
for the Peinnutz Company.

309
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,916
Wait, are you talking about
that all-girl shipping company?

310
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,916
[AMIDA] The long-distance
freight business was

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,208
where women running away
from various bad situations

312
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,041

[AMIDA] To ensure the

00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,458
you chose to become
a Teiwaz subsidiary

so you'd have a strong supporter

found a way to organize them.

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,375
You built a massive

reaching from Earth to Jupiter.

340
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:20,666
We became a huge organization
with over 50,000 members.

Even Mr. McMurdo acknowledged
your achievements,

and you began to rise up

heard me use the word family.

Can you blame him? I'm sure
he didn't know what family was.

that with me, too.

a family to call their own,

but it could be the old man.

466
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,583
Either way,

467
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,125
it looks like the time has come

468
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,458
to start preparing for
the worst, my dear.

469
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,333
--[ding]
--Huh?

470
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,458
I-It's a QCCS call.

471
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,041
[gasps] From Tekkadan!

472
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,333
[NAZE]
Heh.

473
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,458
Go ahead and put it through.

474
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,625
[CHLOE]
Right away!

475
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,041
Good, I reached you!

476
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Send over the <i>Hammerhead</i> 's
flight path!

477
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,125
We'll head out right now--

478
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,458
[NAZE]
Stay out of this.

479
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,958
[gasps] Bro!

480
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,916
We've become somewhat of
an illegal organization.

481
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,291
If your connection to
us were pointed out,

482
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,333
what do you think would
happen to Tekkadan?

483
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,666
Listen, you're only in this mess
because we used the Flauros to--

484
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,458
That has nothing
to do with this.

485
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,875
The Flauros was only the pretext
they chose to frame us with.

486
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,166
That's all there is to it.

487
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,750
[ORGA gasps]

488
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,208
[NAZE] My guess is whoever put
this into motion is expecting

489
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,791
you guys to get
wrapped up in it.

490
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,500
Doing something rash is the same

491
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,833
as playing their
sick little game.

492
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:49,000
Anyway, this is all a result
of Teiwaz's internal strife.

493
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,833
To be perfectly frank, it has
nothing to do with you guys.

494
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,958
[ORGA]
Hey, we're part of Teiwaz, too!

495
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,750
It has everything to do with us!

496
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,000
No.

497
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,000
It wouldn't matter if
this didn't involve us!

498
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,875
I'd do anything to save you!
Even if I--

499
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,333
[NAZE]
Just hear me out would ya?

500
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,875
It's true that I exchanged the
cup of brotherhood with you.

501
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:11,166
But even so... I'm not
really your family, Orga.

502
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,291
What're you saying?

503
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,333
You can't lose sight
of your objective.

504
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,125
Above all else,
you must remember

505
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,500
what it is you have to protect.

506
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,041
Everything else
takes a back seat.

507
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,083
But, Brother--

508
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,833
[NAZE]
Remember this. It takes more

509
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,166
than just your average resolve
to make your family happy.

510
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,041
You don't have time
to get bogged down

511
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,875
by other people's petty details.

512
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:34,041
Don't forget that becoming
Sovereign of Mars

513
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,916
is to make life easier for the
members of Tekkadan.

514
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Those were your words, right?

515
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,041
[NAZE] So, I want you
to keep looking forward

516
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,666
and protecting your
family, Tekkadan.

517
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,916
Put everything else
out of your mind.

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,875
You got that... Orga Itsuka?

519
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,791
[ORGA]
Brother...

520
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,208
[NAZE]
Next time on

521
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:27,916
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans,</i>

522
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,750
"Lit By A Blazing Sun."

523
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,958
Question: What does a flower
need in order to bloom?

524
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:37,583
Water? That's not wrong, but
the correct answer is the sun.


525
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,916
I love you.
