1
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,416
[MERRIBIT] In the chaotic battle
against the fallen angel,

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,375
it makes no distinction
between enemies of the past

3
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,333
and those of the present.

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,875
Does the dying scream
echoing across the gorge

5
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:27,000
belong to one of us, or to it?

6
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,291
[RIDE]
Mr. Mikazuki...

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,500
I... I did something
I shouldn't've done.

8
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,708
And now it's...!

9
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Ride, can you move?

10
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:42,791
[RIDE] Huh...? Oh, yeah.
I'm not too banged up...

11
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,958
My Shiden's another story.

12
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Hang tight.

13
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,708
Huh? What is this?

14
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,583
[RIDE]
Mr. Mikazuki?

15
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,166
You okay, Barbatos?

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,500
[beeping]

17
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,083
Mr. Mikazuki, watch out!

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,583
[MIKAZUKI gasps]

19
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:12,125
[HUSH] Mr. Mikazuki! We couldn't
find any survivors at the plant.

20
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,833
What should we do next?

21
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,625
Mr. Mikazuki...?

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,000
[MIKAZUKI]
That's weird.

23
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,166
[HUSH]
Huh? What's weird?

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,291
[MCGILLIS]
Hm... Another Gundam Frame.

25
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,375
[ISURUGI] This machine doesn't
correspond to anything

26
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,166
in Gjallarhorn's database.

27
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,833
But according to the frequency
fingerprint I'm reading,

28
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:38,208
its reactor is similar to
those used by Gjallarhorn.

29
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,250
Could it be one of
Rustal's soldiers?

30
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,166
If you would, General,
please stand back.

31
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,708
[ISURUGI]
You there, in the Mobile Suit!

32
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:53,125
State your unit and rank!

33
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:56,375
[VIDAR] To think we'd
meet again on Mars.

34
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,000
But here we are,

35
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:01,541
in the land where all of
your betrayals began.

36
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,791
And yet...

37
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,208
[JULIETTA] Vidar, what
are you doing out there?

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,750
I've already managed to
rendezvous with Master Iok.

39
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,583
Hurry up and join us! Fall in!

40
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,583
[VIDAR]
Understood. I'll be right there.

41
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,708
[ISURUGI] Identify yourself now,
or we will respond with force!

42
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,333
[VIDAR]
Something puzzles me...

43
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,875
[gasps]

44
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,000
[VIDAR] How can you pilot the
same model that Carta Issue

45
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,625
perished in, as she cried
out for your love...?

46
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,333
Do you even care?

47
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,500
[MCGILLIS grunts]

48
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,291
[ISURUGI]
Answer!

49
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,000
If not, we'll have to--

50
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,708
[ISURUGI]
Stop!

51
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,291
[MCGILLIS]
No. Leave him.

52
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,500
[ISURUGI]
What? But General, he...

53
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,708
[AKIHIRO]
What happened to Ride?

54
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,583
[CHAD] Apparently,
Mikazuki headed over,

55
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,458
but it sounds like they
ran into some trouble.

56
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,333
[AKIHIRO]
What?!

57
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,875
I'd like to go help them out,

58
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,166
but we have to make that
thing head towards us.

59
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,708
Damn it! If that's the
case, I'll act as bait!

60
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,250
[CHAD]
Akihiro!

61
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:45,458
[AKIHIRO yells]

62
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,958
[AKIHIRO groans]

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,625
[gasps]

64
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,791
No, Akihiro!

65
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:00,500
[CHAD] What happened?!
Say something, Answer me!

66
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:01,583
[SU MEMBER 37A]
Mr. Chad!

67
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,541
[CHAD]
Report this to the Boss! Hurry!

68
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:04,375
[SU MEMBER 37A]
Roger!

69
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:05,708
[CHAD]
Look after Akihiro.

70
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:06,875
[SU MEMBER 37B]
Yes, sir.

71
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,125
[SU MEMBER 37C]
What about you?

72
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,708
That's simple. I'm gonna
that thing's attention!

73
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,416
[SU MEMBER 37C]
By yourself?! But you can't!

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,125
[CHAD]
Now get moving!

75
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,583
[CHAD]
Eat this!

76
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,041
That's it, come after me!

77
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,500
It's so hot... So, that's
the beam weapon, huh?

78
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,166
Well, at least I finally
got its attention!

79
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,291
[MERRIBIT]
A report from the Second Unit!

80
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,166
They've successfully lured
the Mobile Armor

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,625
back to the planned route.

82
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,833
That's great.

83
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,791
We might be able to
pull this off in time.

84
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,375
Boss, wait. The Gusion
is out of commission.

85
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,291
Barbatos has also
stopped responding

86
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,791
and is standing by
on the sidelines.

87
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,625
[YUKINOJO]
Both Akihiro and Mikazuki?

88
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,708
That's right.

89
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,500
They have no idea
why their machines

90
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:06,958
suddenly stopped working.

91
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,833
The Mobile Armor's our priority.

92
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,291
But without Akihiro and Mika, we
just don't have the firepower.

93
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,166
Let's have the
First Unit head out!

94
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,500
We'll also send
Ms. Lafter and Ms. Azee.

95
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,166
One more thing.
Get in touch with McGillis.

96
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,666
Yes, sir. Understood.

97
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,208
[ORGA] And Tell Eugene to get
the explosives ready ASAP!

98
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,708
[MERRIBIT]
Will do!

99
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,125
[ORGA] Listen... I need you to
check on Mika and Akihiro.

100
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,375
[YUKINOJO]
You got it, boss.

101
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,291
I'll let you know when
I learn something.

102
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,208
[EUGENE] Listen up!
We need to hurry, people!

103
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,416
That Mobile Armor's gonna
be passin' through here

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,541
before we know it!

105
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,208
The plan's success
is in our hands now!

106
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
[JULIETTA]
Is that clear, Master Iok?

107
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,166
We'll move out as soon
as Vidar gets here.

108
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,750
Is your machine still
operational, sir?

109
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,750
[IOK]
Thank you, Julietta.

110
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,708
I had no idea that you
cared so much about me.

111
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,208
Pardon?

112
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,000
[IOK] And yet, I must still go
and fulfill my obligation!

113
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,750
If I don't do this,

114
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,708
I'll never be able to
face my men in Heaven!

115
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,333
Wha--? Oh, you have
got to be kidding me!

116
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,333
I came here to rescue you,
not help you--!

117
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,500
[JULIETTA]
Oh, no!

118
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,291
[IOK] The tears that
were shed by my men--

119
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,375
those tears have now
become my flesh and bone.

120
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,291
Those men died for me,
so it's my duty to show

121
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:28,791
that heartless Mobile Armor just
how precious life really is!

122
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:29,666
[gasps]

123
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,583
[IOK]
Farewell!

124
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,000
[JULIETTA]
Of all the...

125
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,750
I have better things
to do than babysit!

126
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:40,333
Just where the hell
are you, Vidar?!

127
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,916
[YUKINOJO] What's the deal
up there? How's Akihiro?

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,083
[ZACK]
Not good, Pops.

129
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,666
It looks like he's
down for the count.

130
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,125
[YUKINOJO]
Damn, we can't even

131
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,166
take him off the Alaya
Vijnana in that condition.

132
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Hey Pops, where's Ride?

133
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,833
Oh, he was hurt,

134
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,958
so I sent him on back to
headquarters, earlier.

135
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,833
What about you?
How are you holding up?

136
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,583
I'm doin' okay.

137
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,541
Although, ever since
it saw that bird,

138
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,000
Barbatos hasn't been
listening to me, at all.

139
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:12,250
[YUKINOJO] You mean the
Mobile Armor? I wonder why?

140
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,500
[ZACK]
I might know.

141
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:14,833
Huh?

142
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,791
Honestly, I think the
system shut down happened

143
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,583
because of the two different
kinds of limiters.

144
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,833
Where'd you get that info?

145
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,875
Why don't you take
a look at this?

146
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,791
These are the system logs for
the Barbatos and Gusion.

147
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,125
[YUKINOJO]
Hmm?

148
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,500
Well, the Alaya Vijnana
system usually feeds back

149
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,041
lots of data to the pilot.

150
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,833
But in these cases, it's been
excessively restrained.

151
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,750
However, the output limiter on
the machines themselves have

152
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,708
been disengaged.
To put it in layman's terms,

153
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,583
we've got a situation where the
system that protects the pilots

154
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,208
is butting heads with the suits,
who want to go full throttle.

155
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,750
So, if I had to guess,
that's the reason why

156
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,625
neither of the machines
are working properly.

157
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,833
Where in the world did you learn
about all this stuff, Zack?

158
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,500
I used to study this stuff,

159
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,833
but that was before I
joined up with Tekkadan.

160
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,041
I mean, you'd never guess it,
but I was a pretty good student.

161
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,958
Well, then do something,
book worm!

162
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,291
In case you forgot,
we're about to go toe-to-toe

163
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,666
with that Mobile Armor!

164
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,041
[ZACK] Oh, you're right.
That is a problem, isn't it?

165
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:10,875
[YUKINOJO]
Hmm.

166
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,416
[radio static]

167
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,541
[YUKINOJO] Orga, it looks like
we won't be able to send in

168
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,333
Barbatos or Gusion to
fight the Mobile Armor.

169
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,208
[ORGA]
What're you talkin' about?

170
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,583
[YUKINOJO]
From what I understand,

171
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,708
there's some kind of system
in Gundam Frames

172
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,250
that reacts to
the Mobile Armors.

173
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,458
As long as they're
fighting those things,

174
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,958
these symptoms will keep
rearing their ugly heads.

175
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,500
A system, huh?

176
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,375
[YUKINOJO] Yeah. Even if we were
to get them to work somehow,

177
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,958
if we send the Gundams
out there again,

178
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,750
it could end up being
a repeat of Edmonton.

179
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,583
If that's what we're lookin' at,

180
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,375
we can't let Mika and
Akihiro go up against it.

181
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,166
[YUKINOJO] You're right,
as much as I hate to say it.

182
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,583
[MERRIBIT] Hey Boss,
we have a call from Ms. Lafter.

183
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,333
[ORGA gasps]

184
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,500
[LAFTER] Aren't Eugene
and his team ready yet?!

185
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,333
[AZEE] These bastards
are moving a lot faster

186
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,250
than we thought they would!
We can't hold them off for long!

187
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,416
[ORGA]
Eugene, you good?

188
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,208
[EUGENE]
Already?! Crap!

189
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,875
I guess we've got no choice...

190
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,083
Change of plans!
Try to get 'em scattered!

191
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,375
They're almost on top of us!

192
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,750
[CHAD] All right people,
stand your ground!

193
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,250
[LAFTER]
Just a bit more!

194
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,875
We can make this work!
I know it!

195
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,458
Yeah, we might be
able to do this.

196
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,458
[gasps]

197
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,625
What the--?!

198
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,958
No, the Mobile Armor is...

199
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,166
[DANTE]
Hey, guys...

200
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,541
The Mobile Armor along with
its sub units just sped up!

201
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,166
[EUGENE]
Huh?! Why would it do that?

202
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,708
I'm so sorry Eugene.
They got through!

203
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,833
Are you ready, yet?!

204
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:50,791
[MEMBER 37B]
Almost!

205
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,375
[MEMBER 37C]
Who is that?

206
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,125
Is that the one that just fired?

207
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,958
[EUGENE] Wait, is that...
Gjallarhorn?

208
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,916
The barrel has burned out.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,125
That was my last shot.
I'm well beyond my limit.

210
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,250
Did you feel it?

211
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,875
That is the pain of those who
believed in me and died!

212
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,875
This is it for me.
But I regret nothing!

213
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,250
I shall die a magnificent death.
I have done my family proud.

214
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,791
[JULIETTA]
No.

215
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,375
Even in death, there's no
cure for your stupidity.

216
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:25,416
[JULIETTA]
So you might as well live.

217
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,958
[groans]

218
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:34,875
[MEMBER 37B] The target has
passed the ambush point.

219
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,125
[EUGENE growls]

220
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:37,500
[EUGENE]
What the hell?!

221
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,500
[EUGENE] I'm sorry, Orga.
It broke through.

222
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,000
[ORGA]
Are you ok?

223
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,208
[EUGENE]
Yeah.

224
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,916
But I can't believe that
Gjallarhorn idiot...

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,416
What do they think
they're doing?!

226
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,333
I'll come up with our next move.

227
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:55,500
As for you guys, get back to
headquarters and resupply.

228
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,958
Lemme guess, we still can't
get through to McGillis?

229
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:58,958
[MERRIBIT]
No.

230
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,333
Well, keep trying.

231
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,250
[MERRIBIT]
Yes, sir.

232
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,333
If this battle is
Tekkadan's last stand,

233
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,416
then we'd never become
equal to Gjallarhorn.

234
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:11,958
[door creaks]

235
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,791
[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia?

236
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,375
Please try not to worry.

237
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,416
If there's anyone who can
save Chryse, it's Mikazuki.

238
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,833
[KUDELIA]
That is what I asked him to do.

239
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,458
I asked him to,
and yet I'm still...

240
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,708
No, it's because I asked,
that I'm so worried.

241
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,666
[ATRA]
Be honest with me, Miss Kudelia,

242
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,958
you like Mikazuki quite
a bit, don't you?

243
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,500
[gasps]

244
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,458
[KUDELIA]
Uh. Well, I...

245
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,541
Yes. I like him.

246
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,541
[gasps]

247
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,083
Oh, you do?

248
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,291
[KUDELIA]
Of course.

249
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,958
And, I like you as well, Atra.

250
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,750
I like you too, Miss Kudelia.

251
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,541
And I like Mikazuki.

252
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,208
[KUDELIA laughs]

253
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,041
That's great.

254
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:04,000
[ATRA] Everything's going
to be fine. I know it.

255
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,333
Mikazuki always comes back...


256
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,791
[ATRA]
...back to us.


257
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,083
[MERRIBIT] Our plan to
separate the Mobile Armor

258
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,791
and Plumas failed.
Also, the Mobile Suits

259
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,666
took a great deal of damage
trying to hold them off.

260
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,208
Half of them are out of action.

261
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,666
There's absolutely no way
we can throw in the towel.

262
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,375
We're just gonna have
to try it again.

263
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,250
Boss. How can we?

264
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,041
Even if we attempted to
collapse the gorge again,

265
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,625
there's no time to
rig an explosion.

266
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,791
The Mobile Armor is still
on a course for Chryse,

267
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,333
and its speed is accelerating!

268
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,833
[growls]

269
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,250
[MIKAZUKI]
What now?

270
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,166
[MERRIBIT]
Mikazuki?

271
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,250
You want me to go?

272
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,666
Listen, I told you--

273
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,833
For once, I want you to
watch from the sidelines.

274
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,250
Get in touch with
Shino, would you?

275
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,041
[MERRIBIT]
Huh?

276
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,666
[YUKINOJO]
You mean were gonna...?

277
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,291
Yeah.

278
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,750
We're usin' the Flauros.

279
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,833
[gasps]

280
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,250
Ah, I follow you.

281
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,416
[MERRIBIT] Just a second.
You said it's dangerous

282
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,708
for a Gundam Frame to get
close to a Mobile Armor.

283
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,083
Yeah, that may be,

284
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,333
but it's the perfect machine
for this kind of job.

285
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,250
Uh. How do you mean?

286
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,333
And after you split them?

287
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:16,000
We attack the Mobile Armor
with everything we've got left.

288
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,375
Are you sure that'll be
enough to take it out?

289
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,958
[ORGA]
Well...

290
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:20,916
[alarm blares]

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,166
[ORGA, MERRIBIT gasp]

292
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,791
[MERRIBIT]
It's a call from Lord Fareed.

293
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,375
[ORGA]
Finally!

294
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,625
[MCGILLIS]
I see. Roger that.

295
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,625
I'm sure that we'll come
up with something,

296
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,375
in the place of your ace pilot.

297
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,750
[ORGA]
Thanks.

298
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,500
[ISURUGI]
What a disappointment.

299
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,541
No, it's fine.

300
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,458
They're still a necessary
means to achieve my goal.

301
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,916
I have faith in them.

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,833
But to maintain the proper
dynamic in our relationship,

303
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,041
I must make it perfectly clear
to them where we both stand.

304
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,250
So, if I'm to perceive
this correctly,

305
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,416
the honor and glory
must be ours.

306
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,291
Is that what you mean, sir?

307
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,750
Let's get to the mission point.

308
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,708
[ORGA]
It'll work out now.

309
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,208
With those guys on our side,
we'll have enough firepower--

310
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,875
[YUKINOJO]
And you're okay with this?

311
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,625
Correct me if I'm wrong,

312
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,166
but wasn't this supposed to be
our big chance to show them

313
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,833
just how strong
Tekkadan really is?

314
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,500
"Sovereign of Mars"
has a nice ring to it,

315
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,166
but one slip-up and that title

316
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,250
will be more trouble
than it's worth.

317
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,708
Our next move will determine

318
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,791
whether or not we'll
be equals with them,

319
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,666
or just tools to be used
at their convenience.

320
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,500
This is going to
affect the entire

321
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,583
balance of power between us.

322
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,333
We'll just have to deal with it.

323
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,583
There's no way that we're
gonna abandon Chryse.

324
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:35,583
[MIKAZUKI]
I'll go.

325
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,750
[gasps]

326
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
I told you, you're watchin'
from the sidelines.

327
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:43,625
If we're able to split the main
body from the smaller units

328
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,583
then this plan will be
a fair enough success.

329
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:50,791
You don't need to endanger
yourself for us to save face.

330
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,833
And besides, the Shiden
that I got from Teiwaz

331
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:56,541
is bein' delivered as we speak.

332
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:57,666
So, if need be--

333
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,208
[MIKAZUKI]
No.

334
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,583
"No"?

335
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,875
[MIKAZUKI]
I won't let you.

336
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,208
[VIDAR] Sorry for the wait.
I was held up.

337
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,291
[JULIETTA]
Forget it.

338
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,541
But since you're here,

339
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,166
you might as well watch
over Master Iok for me.

340
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,375
Julietta...

341
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,708
[JULIETTA]
I'll handle the Mobile Armor.

342
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,916
[IOK]
I get it!

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,125
You're gonna get revenge
for me, aren't you?!

344
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,125
Incredible!

345
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,291
You're so loyal!

346
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,958
[VIDAR]
If you don't hurry up and leave,

347
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:24,000
Tekkadan and Lord Fareed
will beat you to it.

348
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,083
[IOK]
You shall hold my pride!

349
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,250
[JULIETTA]
Please shut up, Master Iok!

350
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,750
[SHINO] Jeez, the Boss
sure says some crazy stuff!

351
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,291
That's for sure.

352
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,041
But why did you have to pull
me into the cockpit with you?

353
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,833
[SHINO] To be blunt,
I don't know the first thing

354
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,166
about working the new equipment,

355
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,250
so it's not like I had
any other option!

356
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,083
There's no time to lose, so
you're gonna be my manual!

357
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,750
Oh, man!

358
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,583
[SHINO]
But seriously, level with me.

359
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,833
Can this thing actually
get the job done?

360
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,541
[YAMAGI]
Yeah.

361
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,666
The Flauros' cannon will
be able to separate

362
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,666
the Mobile Armor
from the Plumas.

363
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,375
[SHINO] Why don't we fire it at
the Mobile Armor itself, then?

364
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:00,708
[BOTH groan]

365
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,208
[SHINO]
Whoa...!

366
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,625
Unfortunately, since we can't
get into close proximity,

367
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,000
it'll be next to impossible
to land a killing blow

368
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,208
on its nanolaminate armor.

369
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,166
[ORGA] Shino, the Mobile
Armor's almost here!

370
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,375
Get a move on!

371
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,958
[SHINO]
I'm on it!

372
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,000
[MW UNIT MEMBER 37A]
It's here!

373
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,541
[MW UNIT MEMBER 37B]
This is lookout point two!

374
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,916
The Mobile Armor's
passing by as we speak!

375
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,875
[MERRIBIT] Roger that.
Now, clear the area at once.

376
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,666
[LAFTER] Hey, are you positive
it's gonna work this time?

377
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,291
Yeah, we'll just
have to trust them.

378
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,166
I hate having to ask
them for help, though.

379
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,708
Oh, well...

380
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,125
[MERRIBIT] Ten seconds until
the Mobile Armor arrives.

381
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,083
[ORGA]
Did everyone hear that?

382
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,125
We're bringin' it down
right here and now!

383
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,583
No matter what it takes!

384
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,958
[MERRIBIT gasps]
It's here!

385
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,000
[LAFTER] Look at how packed
those things are!

386
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,875
How are supposed to
separate them?!

387
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,416
The walls are closer
together here,

388
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,291
so the Plumas are
huddled even tighter!

389
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,750
[MERRIBIT] Do what you
can to split them up!

390
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,166
[LAFTER] We're throwing
everything we have at them!

391
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,083
[AZEE]
There are just too many!

392
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,541
[SHINO] What do you want
us to do now, Boss?!

393
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,500
We've reached the mission area!

394
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,833
But I can't get eyes on
the target from here!

395
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,000
[growls]

396
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,000
[RIDE]
Leave it to me!

397
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,208
[gasps]

398
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,541
[SHINO]
Huh?!

399
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,125
[SHINO]
Hey, that's...

400
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,625
...that's my Ryusei-go III!

401
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,833
[RIDE yells]

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,375
[RIDE groaning]

403
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:32,041
[RIDE] Catch me if you can,
bird monster!

404
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,125
Way to go Ride, you did it!

405
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,791
[AZEE] Now's our chance
to thin the herd!

406
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,625
All right, let's do this, Shino!

407
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,083
Yeah!

408
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,208
[YAMAGI] This is a
transformation mechanism

409
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:53,083
that neither Barbatos
nor Gusion have.

410
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,833
[YAMAGI] It's some kind of an
electromagnetic launcher...

411
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:07,583
[YAMAGI] ...that uses the
output of two reactors.

412
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,333
Ready when you are!

413
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,000
[ORGA]
You got this!

414
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,333
[SHINO]
Let's hear you roar!

415
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,041
Galaxy Cannon!

416
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,458
Fire!

417
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,916
[LAFTER, AZEE scream]

418
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,125
[SHINO]
Did you see that?!

419
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,583
This here's my
Ryusei-go IV!

420
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,208
And now, the rest
is up to you guys!

421
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,833
[MCGILLIS]
Is that a new Gundam frame?

422
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:50,666
It has astonishing power...

423
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,083
[ISURUGI]
Sir!

424
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,541
[RIDE grunts]

00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,166
[RIDE yells]

426
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,916
[JULIETTA]
Rest assured Master Rustal,

427
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,791
I will deliver the Order
of the Seven Stars.

428
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,500
[ISURUGI]
That's one of the Arianrhod's!

429
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,083
[MCGILLIS]
We can't let them finish it.

430
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,166
[ISURUGI]
Right!

431
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,708
This is for Master Rustal!

432
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,833
[yells]

433
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,458
[grunts]

434
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,916
[MCGILLIS]
Amazing strength!

435
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,166
[MCGILLIS grunts]

436
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,875
The Mobile Armor has broken
through our defensive line!

437
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,458
Hey, Chad!

438
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,000
[CHAD] Sorry, but we
have our hands full!

00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,500
[ORGA grunts]

440
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,583
Boss, where are you--?!

441
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,166
Orga, wait!

442
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,916
[MCGILLIS]
So this is it...

443
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,125
This is the true nature
of the Mobile Armors...

444
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,083
The horrors that nearly
annihilated mankind!

445
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,000
[RIDE groaning]

446
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,541
Damn it.

447
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,875
[RIDE grunting]

00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,708
[JULIETTA grunts]

449
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,625
Wait, is that...?

450
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,333
He's here. But why?

451
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,208
[gasps]

452
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,166
[MIKAZUKI]
I won't let you.

453
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,166
If things are really
that bad, I'll go in.

454
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,291
[ORGA]
Give it a rest, Mika!

455
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,708
Were you not listening
to what Pops said?!

456
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,625
You're not piloting Barbatos!

457
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,041
Don't you get it?!

458
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,875
If it's limiter starts
malfunctioning again, you'll--!

459
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,416
[MIKAZUKI]
It's okay. I've got this.

460
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,791
If I can still pilot Barbatos,

461
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,500
things won't be any worse
than they are now.

462
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:07,541
Mika...

463
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:11,000
[MIKAZUKI] Don't you remember
what you told me, Orga?

464
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,166
We'll take the shortest route.

465
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:18,500
But this is something
else entirely.

466
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:19,875
What if it means...

467
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,500
...you going out there leads
to losing you forever?

468
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,125
What are you even
talking about?

469
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,541
[ORGA]
Huh?

470
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,416
[MIKAZUKI]
The life that I have now

471
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,416
was given to me by you, Orga.

472
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,916
What that means is,

473
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,875
I have to give everything
I have for you.

474
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,125
All right. See that, Barbatos?

475
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:45,083
Your prey is right
in front of us.

476
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:48,375
I'm gonna take these
chains off of you, okay?

477
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:52,458
So, show me everything
you've got.

478
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,958
[MCMURDO]
Next time on

479
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,125
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans,</i>

480
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,708
"Hunter of Angels."

481
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:33,166
Mikazuki. Don't stuff
yourself full of snacks.

482
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,250
I'm gonna prepare a
delicious meal for you.


483
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,875
And just who are you
calling an "old geezer?"
