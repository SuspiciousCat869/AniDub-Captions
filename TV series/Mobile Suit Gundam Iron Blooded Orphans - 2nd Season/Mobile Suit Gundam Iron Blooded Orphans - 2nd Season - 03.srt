00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,625
[SHINO]
Come on, are you kidding me?

157
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,416
What is it?

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,625
[SHINO grunts]

159
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,375
[DANTE] What the hell man?
I thought they said three ships!

160
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,958
Oh, this is bad...

161
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,000
[MERRIBIT]
Impossible!

162
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,375
What's going on?

163
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,375
[SHINO] Orga, there are
ten of 'em! Ten enemy ships!

164
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,583
[ORGA grunts]

165
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:54,875
I'm getting a video feed
from the scout team!

166
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,041
[AZEE] They tricked our
Ahab Wave sensors by using

167
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,541
three of their ships
to tow the others.

168
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,250
So that's how they did it

169
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,708
They managed to pull
one over on us...

170
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,166
[SANDOVAL chuckles]
Hmph.

171
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,500
Picking off your enemy while
they're isolated is warfare 101.

172
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:16,250
Hey Boss, we have an LCS
call from the enemy ship.

173
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,166
Put it through.

174
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,708
[SANDOVAL]
I am Sandoval Reuter,

175
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,708
the boss of the
Dawn Horizon Corps.

176
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,041
With whom am I speaking?

177
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,583
[ORGA]
Orga Itsuka. Tekkadan boss.

178
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,000
As a show of mercy,

179
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,208
I will give you and your
forces the chance to surrender.

180
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,083
Thanks, but I think we'll pass.

181
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,041
You can apologize for starting
this whole mess, though.

182
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,291
[SANDOVAL chuckles]

183
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,000
[SANDOVAL] It sounds to
me like getting in bed

184
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,875
with those Gjallarhorn weaklings
knocked a screw loose.

185
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,958
[ISURUGI'S OPERATOR]
Filthy pirate! How dare you?!

186
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,458
[EUGENE chuckles]

187
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,125
[ORGA] Funny, 'cause I'd say
you're the crazy one if you

188
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,041
think that chump fleet yours
has a chance of beating us.

189
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,083
[growls]

190
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:50,958
[MERRIBIT]
Boss, don't--

191
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,416
[MERRIBIT gasps]

192
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,625
I'll let you run your
mouth for now, but remember,

193
00:08:56,708 --> 00:09:00,333
the more annoying the fly,
the more satisfying the swat.

194
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,750
Hey, Eugene! The fleet is
in your command now. Got it?

195
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,625
Yeah, I read ya loud
and clear, Boss!

196
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,208
[EMBI] Enemy's deploying
to our left and right!

197
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,541
[AZEE] They're trying
a crescent tactic!

198
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,000
[EUGENE] Shino, get your
team back to the ship!

199
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,416
Hurry and send out Mikazuki!
Let's break through their front

200
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,541
before they completely
surround us!

201
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,958
[MIKAZUKI] So I'm distracting
their Mobile Suits then?

202
00:09:28,041 --> 00:09:29,666
[EUGENE]
They're all yours.

203
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,958
[ELGAR] Catapult deployed.
Launch when ready!

204
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,208
Mikazuki Augus.
Gundam Barbatos, launching.

205
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,041
Handing over control of
the <i>Hotarubi</i> to the <i>Isaribi</i> .

206
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,666
If we disengaged
from this right now,

207
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,583
we'd be able to get
away with minimal damage.

208
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:59,958
Maybe, you're right.
But there'd still be casualties.

209
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,791
I won't let any of
our boys die in vain.

210
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,541
If we're risking lives,

211
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,541
let's move forward with
everything we've got.

212
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,125
[MERRIBIT grunts]

213
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,916
[MERRIBIT] What's the
situation with your fleet?

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,750
[ISURUGI] My main force
is already on its way.

215
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,583
If we can hold out,
we'll catch the enemy off guard.

216
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,291
[HIRUME] Enemy Mobile
Suits are heading this way!

217
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,125
We'll have to
continue this later!

218
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,125
[ORGA chuckles]

219
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,458
Get Akihiro's team
launched ASAP!

220
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,750
[SANDOVAL'S OPERATOR A]
Enemy ships are charging

00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,166
in close formation!

222
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,000
So they're trying a desperate
frontal breakthrough.

223
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,750
Concentrate all of our
fire on the lead ship!

224
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,625
Let's make it clear how
outgunned they really are!

The rest of you, destroy their
ships as planned!

heading your way.

I see 'em. Leave it to me.

to protect the ships!

The new and improved Gusion
is lookin' pretty sweet.

You can't just rush in
by yourself, Captain!

you've got my six!

Hey! Thanks for the save!

But, I gotta say,
it feels kinda weird.

[AZEE]
You've got guts.

311
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,750
That was some good
work out there, Ride.

312
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,416
[RIDE] Well Akihiro did say
whatever it takes...

313
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,541
[LAFTER] Yeah, but I wish you
wouldn't take everything he says

314
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,708
so literally.

[AKIHIRO shouts]

316
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
Of all the times to

He's out of amo and helpless!

321
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,833
[AKIHIRO] Who do you think
you're calling helpless, huh?!

322
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,041
Wh-What is that?!

[ENEMY SOLDIER D screams]

324
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,500
Nice to know this
thing works!

--[AKIHIRO grunts]

326
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,208
[AKIHIRO]
A surrender signal?

327
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,333
[AKIHIRO]
Tch! This crap again?

328
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,458
We don't need the pilot.

329
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,500
Just take the suit
and set him adrift.

330
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,666
After you do, go back
and get resupplied.

331
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,416
[AKIHIRO]
No need, I'm fine.

332
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,125
[LAFTER] But Ride's almost
burned out. You're his C.O.

333
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,166
Head back and leave
this area to us.

334
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,166
[AKIHIRO]
Roger.

335
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,583
Defenses on the boss's ship
are tougher than I thought.

336
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,000
I guess I ll have to I'll
pick 'em off one by one.

337
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,791
[YOUNG ENEMY SOLDIER A]
I'm not done yet!

338
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,000
[SANDOVAL] Our human
debris work even harder

339
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,333
than the rest of the men.

340
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,625
Because we don't
allow them to surrender.

341
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,166
And if they lose,
they have no home to go to.

342
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,250
Which is why they fight
like cornered animals.

343
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,916
[SANDOVAL] They certainly
are a convenient lot.

344
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,791
But we won't make any
headway like this.

345
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,708
Go out there and show them what
real pirates are capable of.

346
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,833
[TWINS]
Hmph! Roger that.

347
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Oops, no ammo.

348

[SHINO] Mikazuki! Head back
and get resupplied!

Fall back and regroup!

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,125
[YUKINOJO] Top off their
propellant and ammo!

364
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,333
If an armor plate is
damaged in any way,

365
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,625
swap out the
whole thing!

Yes, sir!

[MIKAZUKI]
I'm starving...

369

[ATRA chuckles]
I knew you'd say that.

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,500
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

Oh, yeah! Tons more!
Eat as much as you want!

[CREW A]
Oil check, done!

381
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,708
He moved around more than
anyone else out there

382
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,958
but somehow he still managed
to use the least propellant.

383
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,625
Is it...? Dammit.

384
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,666
[YUKINOJO] We're all done here,
Mikazuki. Atra, come on out.

Coming!

A hot meal would be nice...
for next time.

[ATRA chuckles] In that case,
I'll have lots waiting for you!

[YUKINOJO]
Get a move on!

Make some room, Lafter's
Shiden is coming in next.

00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,458
[ZACH]
There's more?!

391
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,916
[YUKINOJO] We shouldn't prolong
this battle for too much longer,

[YAMAGI]
Boss!

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,416
We just need a little more
time to patch up the Gusion!

395
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,333
Its loadout is pretty complex.

396
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,416
[ECO] Ride's in no condition
to go out, either!

397
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,541
All right, but you're gonna
have to make it quick!

398
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,666
We need as many out
there as we can get.

399
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,791
Victory's within our reach!

400
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:53,333

and then we've got 'em!

them on the port side.

Sir, Its Gjallarhorn!

What?!

407
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,333
It's Isurugi's main force!

00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:08,625
[ISURUGI] No... it's the...
Arianrhod Fleet.

409
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,875
[IOK'S OPERATOR A] Sir, I'm
showing a Halfbeak-class ship

410
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,583
belonging to the Outer Earth
Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet

411
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,333
and two civilian ships.

412
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,625
Civilian?

413
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:17,875
Who are these people?

414
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,583
How should I know?

415
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,541
[RUSTAL'S MAN A] We have
confirmation that Master Iok's

416
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,583
Second Fleet has
engaged the enemy.

417
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,125
I see.

418
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,000
[RUSTAL'S MAN A] We've also
detected vessels belonging to a

419

civilian organization
in the same sector.

420
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,500
Civilian, you say?

421
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,166
[RUSTAL'S MAN A]
"Tekkadan," I believe.

422
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,166
[RUSTAL] They were involved in
the Arbrau incident, right?

423
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,416
It would appear the rumors
that they have ties to

424
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,708
McGillis were actually true.

425

[RUSTAL'S MAN A grunts]

426
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,000
[RUSTAL]
Tekkadan and McGillis.

00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,791
You can't help but get worked
up at the sound of those names.

I'm coming for you...

What the hell?!

Aren't these guys sopposed
to be on our side?!

Derma, are you okay?!

433
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,500
Damn it all!
What's going on, Orga?

434
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,958
[ORGA]
Who are those guys?!

435
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,250
[ISURUGI] The Outer Lunar
Orbit Joint Fleet.

436
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:16,000
Rustal Elion is their commander.

437
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,208
[MERRIBIT] In other words, they
belong to an entirely different

438
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,791
chain of command from you.

439
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:20,625
[ISURUGI]
Yes.

440
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,125
[MERRIBIT grunts]

441
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:25,416
Tch. So that's why he
was in such a big hurry.

442
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,208
[ISURUGI] It's imperative
that we capture Sandoval.

443
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,458
Right about that!

444
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,458
All Mobile Suits, listen up!

445
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,833
Avoid fighting the Gjallarhorn
forces that just showed up!

446
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,000
Focus on the enemy boss!

447
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:41,875
[SANDOVAL]
Unforgivable Tekkadan!

448
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:44,375
You would stoop so low as
to suck up to Gjallarhorn

449
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,875
and call in reinforcements?!

450
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,250
[SANDOVAL'S OPERATOR A]
Sir, if this keeps up,

451
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,166
there's no way we'll--

452
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,625
[SANDOVAL]
Sound the retreat!

453
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,500
Set a course for
the debris zone!

454
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,833
[SANDOVAL'S OPERATOR B]
What about you sir?

455
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,208
I'll draw them away from us!

456
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,083
[grunts]
Give a message to the men!

457
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,125
Tell them Sandoval is launching!

458
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,666
[IOK'S MAN A]
Please wait, Master Iok!

459
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,541
You should really
let us handle this!

460
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,583
There's no need for you
to sully your hands

461
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:06,625
with these thugs, Sir.

462
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,291
Lowly pirates they may be,

463
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:11,708
but it is the creed of the Kujan
