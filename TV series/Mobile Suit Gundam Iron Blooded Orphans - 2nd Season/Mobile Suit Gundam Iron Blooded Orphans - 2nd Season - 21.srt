00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,208
[ELGAR] Transmission from
one of the halfbeaks!

162
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,583
What do they want?

163
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,833
Now that we're out of danger,

164
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,833
their leader wants to
discuss our next move.

165
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,458
[EUGENE]
Well, you heard him.

166
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:03,583
[ORGA]
Our next move... Right.

167
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,958
[YUKINOJO]
Yamagi.

168
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,500
[sighs]

169
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,250
About Shino... Here's the thing.

170
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,916
He kept Tekkadan alive
so that we'd have the chance

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,666
to fight another day.

172
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,625
He did it for us,
so you don't have to--

173
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,208
[YAMAGI]
I never asked for that.

174
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,750
[YUKINOJO]
Yamagi.

175
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,875
[YAMAGI] What good is
living on without Shino?

176
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,666
They said we'd be done
with all of this this

177
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,791
if we fought one last battle.

178
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:37,625
So, regardless of what happened,
isn't it already over for us?

179
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,708
Well?

180
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,875
[HUSH]
The enemy is still out there.

181
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,500
You'd have to be out
of your mind to say

182
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,833
we're done with this fight.

183
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,125
[ZACK] No, you're the one
who's out of his mind!

184
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,208
Or have you forgotten that
half of our Mobile Suits

185
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,583
just got destroyed?

186
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,541
And the rest are in tatters!

187
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:54,875
Seriously, maybe it's
time to call it quits.

188
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,125
We could even leave
Tekkadan all together.

189
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,000
And where exactly
would we be running to?

190
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,166
Isn't it obvious?
We would just go back home.

191
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,291
And once we get to Mars--

192
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,083
[DANE]
We're not like you.

193
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,333
Huh?

194
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,416
You need to
understand something.

195
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,000
Not everybody here has a place
to go home to like you do.

196
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,666
And we're not educated
like you are, either.

197
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,041
Yeah, maybe that's true,

198
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,041
but you could still
find jobs somewhere!

199
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,958
I highly doubt that
there are places on Mars

200
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,416
that would hire people like us.

201
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,750
But think about it!

202
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,791
If we keep going down the
same path we have been,

203
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,083
someday it'll be over for us
in the worst way possible!

204
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,041
Hey, nothing's over yet!

205
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,750
[ZACK]
Right, sorry sir!

206
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,541
How's it going?
Is the launch ready yet?

207
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,125
[YUKINOJO]
Sure is! Just give the word!

208
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,125
[EUGENE]
Great!

209
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,833
Move it over to
the airlock then.

210
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,083
[YUKINOJO]
Will do!

211
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,791
[ATRA]
How do you feel?

212
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,541
Are the painkillers
working okay?

213
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,083
[DERMA]
Yeah...

214
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:47,916
I'll be all right.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,541
[WOUNDED MEMBERS]

216
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,583
Sorry about this.

217
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,000
All the beds are
full at the moment.

218
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,583
It's okay.

219
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,458
Everybody else is in
way worse shape than I am.

220
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,833
Besides...

221
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,541
Even if I recover,
what's the point?

222
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,041
Derma...

223
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,041
[gasps]

224
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,708
Oh, hi, guys.

225
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,125
Derma.

226
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,000
Given the damage
to your machine,

227
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,083
you're lucky your arm injury
was all you had out there.

228
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,791
[DERMA] I wish the blast
would've killed me.

229
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,916
[BOTH gasp]

230
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,166
Derma, don't say that.

231
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,541
[DERMA]
It's just...

232
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,916
I'm no use to anybody anymore.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,041
Not with a missing arm.

234
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,708
[AKIHIRO sighs]

235
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,125
[DERMA]
But here I am.

236
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,416
[AKIHIRO]
Thank you.

237
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,583
I'm glad that I'm still

238
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,375
able to sit and talk
to you like this.

239
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,291
[AKIHIRO]
You came back alive.

240
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,791
Thanks for that,

241
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,833
Derma Altland.

242
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,083
[DERMA]
Yeah.

243
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,375
[MCGILLIS] Fortunately,
we still have the forces

244
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,666
from the Mars Branch.

245
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,708
In total, there are
ten halfbeaks

246
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,875
and about 40 Mobile Suits.

247
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,375
That's nowhere near enough
to go toe-to-toe with them!

248
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,333
We just fought them
with twice that many,

249
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,333
and we got our asses kicked!

250
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,541
That's not very Tekkadan-like.

251
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,875
In past battles,
even when the odds

252
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,125
were hopelessly
stacked against you,

253
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,791
you somehow found the
strength to make it out alive.

254
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,458
But that's not the point.

255
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,166
Our next battle will take
place on your home field.

256
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
If we engage the enemy,
after joining with

257
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:33,750
the Mars Branch forces, it'll
open up several possibilities.

258
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,208
[EUGENE] If we fight them
in the Mars Sphere,

259
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,916
then it'll be that much
harder for them to resupply.

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,708
I must admit, we've done things
in a roundabout manner,

261
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:44,375
but surely, demonstrating your
strength in the skies of Mars

262
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,833
will carry some significance.

263
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,916
Nothing's more significant
than the lives of our friends.

264
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,250
Always remember that.

265
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,041
Orga...

266
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,041
So long as you know
we're long past

267
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,791
the point of no return.

268
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,583
We must shoulder
the hopes and dreams

269
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,500
of our fallen comrades
and soldier on.

270
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:04,333
We mustn't let their
deaths be in vain.

271
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,000
General, repairs to the
second propulsion unit

272
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
have just been completed, sir.

273
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,333
[MCGILLIS]
Then accelerate immediately.

274
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,375
[OPERATOR 46D]
Yes, sir.

275
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,333
There's time before
we reach Mars.

276
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,208
Let's pick up this
conversation another day.

277
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,041
[HUSH] Oh, there you
are, Mr. Mikazuki.

278
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,583
Hmm?

279
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,750
[HUSH]
Mr. Mikazuki?

280
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,166
Miss Atra.

281
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,583
Sorry, but,

282
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,250
would you mind leaving
him be for a little while?

283
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,666
[gasps]

284
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Miss Atra.

285
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,541
[ATRA]
Hmm?

286
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,291
Something seems
different about you.

287
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:45,916
Huh?

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,833
Uh-- Nevermind.

289
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,500
Huh?

290
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,375
[GAELIO] They told me
that you'd woken up.

291
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:01,291
Yeah, well that's news
from over half a day ago.

292
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,833
You certainly took your
time in coming to visit.

293
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,375
My apologies.

294
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,375
I didn't think you'd
be waiting for me.

295
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,708
To be honest, I was afraid.

296
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,583
I'm no stranger when it
comes to fearing for my life,

297
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,208
that's for sure.

298
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,458
But this time, it was different.

299
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,208
I felt something cold,

300
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,250
as if a devil were
gripping my soul.

301
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,208
I thought that if such
a thing were possible...

302
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,875
...I would exchange my life
to gain that kind of power.

303
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,000
Julietta, what're you...?

304
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,375
[JULIETTA]
I think I now understand

305
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:41,166
what you were trying to tell me.

306
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,375
I used to believe

307
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,416
that I'd do almost anything
to get stronger.

308
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,125
But I don't believe
that anymore.

309
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,875
From now on,
I'll become stronger

310
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,916
as a human. As myself.

311
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,208
[GAELIO]
Glad to hear it.

312
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,958
We were only able to recover
half of our casualties.

313
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,625
Yeah.

314
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,416
Damnit. I wanted
to create a place

315
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,583
where they could belong.

316
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,625
Orga...

317
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,666
Somewhere they could lead
lives free of bloodshed.

318
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,750
A place where they
could make a living.

319
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,958
Where they could
have warm homes.

320
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,000
But just look.

321
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:20,791
I made them fight
to obtain that goal,

322
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,333
and all they got
was a cold morgue.

323
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:24,208
[YAMAGI]
You're whining?

324
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,916
[gasps]

325
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,208
[ORGA]
Yamagi...

326
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,750
Our friends...

327
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,875
...raced off to their deaths
because they believed in you!

328
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,291
How dare you act
like such a coward

329
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,750
after what they sacrificed?!

330
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,875
[gasps]

331
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,291
Yamagi!

332
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,208
[EUGENE]
Yamagi.

333
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,083
[YAMAGI] Sorry... There's
something wrong with me.

334
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:59,708
No there isn't,
I wanted to thank you.

335
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,875
I didn't have the guts
to tell 'im that.

336
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,666
Because I understand
how he feels.

337
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,458
[YAMAGI]
I don't get it at all.

338
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,500
I don't get how the Boss
feels, or how Shino felt.

339
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,500
I don't understand any of it.

340
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,333
[EUGENE]
Shino once confided in me.

341
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,000
[gasps]

342
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,791
[SHINO]
Hey, can we talk about Yamagi?

343
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,541
Do you think he...
likes me or somethin'?

344
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,041
Huh? You're just now
figurin' that out?

345
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,000
What, are you blind?

346
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,791
Wait, so he does?

347
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,333
I kinda thought so, but...

348
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,208
Well, we're a family, aren't we?

349
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,791
I just don't see how
that kinda thing

350
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,208
could happen between relatives.

351
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,916
[EUGENE]
That's what weirds you out?

352
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,333
Oh, man, there're
so many different

353
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,333
kinds of guys here--it's insane.

354
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,625
Huh?

355
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,458
There's a boss who gets
way too worked up

356
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,375
about things and a deputy boss

357
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,000
who can't shake off
being a loser.

358
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,166
[EUGENE]
Hey!

359
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,791
We've also got a mad dog
who's hard to read

360
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:58,166
and a muscle-bound moron
with bushy eyebrows!

361
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,333
And to top it off,
there's an oddball

362
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,375
who would fall
for a guy like me.

363
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,416
Uh...

364
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,958
[SHINO]
We have all sorts of people!

365
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,666
And man do I love it!

366
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,125
As long as I live,
I wanna protect Tekkadan!

367
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,083
Shino...

368
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,166
I wanted to die standing
right by his side,

369
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,291
rather than ever
live without him.

370
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:29,125
But if Shino heard me say that,
I bet he'd get pretty mad.

371
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,041
Yamagi...

372
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,541
[YAMAGI]
Eugene...

373
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,583
Do you think I can
protect Tekkadan, like him?

374
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:38,458
[EUGENE]
Yeah, we're all countin' on ya.

375
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,333
[RUSTAL]
Scurry all you want, McGillis.

376
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,083
You and your pack of space rats.

377
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,916
You haven't realized it yet,

378
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,291
but you're already in my trap.

379
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,166
[ORGA] All this time,
I've been talkin' a big game.

380
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,041
I said we'd gain everything
once we won this battle.

381
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,750
That money and status
would all be ours.

382
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,791
Well, we've got
the money, at least.

383
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:05,208
Dunno about the
status part, though.

384
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,875
[ORGA]
After all that big talk...

385
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:13,000
All I really did
was tell a huge lie.

386
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:16,375
[MIKAZUKI] But I'm the one
who made a liar out of you.

387
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,916
Mika...

388
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,916
[MIKAZUKI] If I'd taken out
everyone who stood in our way,

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,041
like I said I would, your words
wouldn't have been a lie.

390
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,541
But when it came down to it,
I failed the mission.

391
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,708
Oh, I get it now.

392
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

393
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:37,291
That's how it's been for you
from the very beginning.

394
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:38,500
Orga?

395
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:42,291
But things have always
been like that.

396
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,166
I was worried that
I'd brought my friends

397
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,291
to the wrong place...

398
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,666
...but that fear

399
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,666
was just my pride talking.

400
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,291
You're the one who
really brought us here.

401
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:57,916
Everyone brought us here.

402
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,333
To make my words a reality.

403
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:03,208
To support them.

404
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,125
[ORGA]
It was you guys.

405
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:13,458
[ORGA] And now, the only thing
I can do for you is...

406
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,291
...never doubt myself.

407
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,500
Gimme everything you've got.

408
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,750
I want it all.

409
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,416
You've always had that, Orga.

410
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,958
Yeah, you're right.

411
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:00,083
[MCGILLIS]
What's the meaning of this?

412
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:02,708
Why won't you give us
clearance to dock at Ares?

413
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,541
You do realize who
you're talking to,

414
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:07,708
don't you, Chief Arae?

415
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,333
Oh, I'm well aware.

416
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:12,791
However, it's you who doesn't
understand your position.

417
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,625
You have been stripped of
your rank within Gallerhorn

418
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:18,791
as well as all rights and
privileges that came with it.

419
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,125
McGillis Fareed.

420
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,875
Former Brigadier General.

421
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,583
[MCGILLIS]
Next time on

422
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,541
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans</i> ,

423
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,916
"Scapegoat."

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's not as easy to
obtain as I thought.


425
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:37,458
Was it this difficult
for you, Agnika Kaieru?
