enemies for themselves.

[ISURUGI]
Major Proto Arae,

163
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,375
from this moment, you are hereby
relieved of your position as

164
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,458
Acting Chief of
the Mars Branch.

165
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,291
You are now the official
Chief of the Mars Branch.

166
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,958
I humbly accept this honor, sir.

167
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,666
You should know
Brigadier General Fareed

168
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,375
is currently en route to Mars.

169
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,750
The general himself?
What a great honor, sir!

170
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,875
I'll finally be able to
thank him for his support

171
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,083
of the Mars Branch after
the loss of Major Coral.

172
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,625
But before his arrival,
there is a minor issue

173
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,708
I would like for you
to take care of.

174
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,041
Understood.

175

As per my directive,

176
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:52,083
I've ordered my subordinates
to cooperate with Tekkadan.

177
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:04,875
[MIKAZUKI]
That was good.

178

[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

179
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,750
Do you have a minute to talk?

180
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,458
I'm goin' ahead.

183
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,041
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm-hm.

184
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,291
What's up?

185
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,000
I wanna pilot a
Mobile Suit, too.

186
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,625
C'mon. Give it a rest, man!

187
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:24,500
The success of a battle
depends on Mobile Suits.

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,916
You know damn well that we can't
just hand one over to a rookie.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,958
Mikazuki... could you
ask the boss for me?

190
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,333
What did I--?!

191
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,333
Oh, lighten up! This oughta
be good, don'tcha think?

192
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,875
This isn't a damn joke!

193

How come?

194
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,041
Because, when it comes
to piloting mobile suits,

195
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,958
you're the very best
that we have.

196
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,291
[MIKAZUKI]
That's not what I meant.

197
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,833
Why do you want to be a pilot?

198
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,791
To become even
tougher than you are.

199
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,000
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm...

200
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Okay. I'll tell Orga.

201
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:54,750
[EUGENE]
Wait, are you serious?!

202
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:58,458
If Mikazuki's gonna look
after him, then why not?

203
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,083
I'd say it's about damn
time he had a subordinate.

204
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,041
Yeah, right. Don't say
I didn't warn you.

205
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,208
[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia!

206
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,958
[KUDELIA]
Oh, Miss Atra.

207
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,625
Welcome back.

208
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,291
[KUDELIA] Uh... So, uh...
is anyone else with you?

209
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,583
Mikazuki and the others still
have a bit of work left to do.

210
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,625
[KUDELIA]
Oh, I see.

211
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,416
[NOBLISS' SECRETARY]
Mr. Nobliss is busy,

212
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,625
and cannot answer
your call today either.

213

Of course, I understand
that but...

00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,500
... I've received word
that Miss Kudelia's life

215
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,958
is in danger, and it's
imperative that I discuss

216
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,125
potential threats with
Mr. Nobliss as soon as possi--

217
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,583
[NOBLISS' SECRETARY]
I know you've called many times,

and I'm sorry
for the delay.

219
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,833
I'm begging you here. Even just
a few minutes would do.

220
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,125
[NOBLISS' SECRETARY] I'll be
sure to pass along the message.

221

[ALLIUM] Thank you,
please do everything you can.

222

[NOBLISS] Yet another

223
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,375
Yes, sri.

[NOBLISS] Persistent flies
are so annoying.

225
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,541
There must be a way to persuade
Nobliss to convince Kudelia

226
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,000
that we're innocent--

227
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,916
No, she only needs to
believe that I am innocent.

228

From what I hear, Sir,

229
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,083
Tekkadan has already
made it back to Mars!

[ALLIUM]
I know that!

There's no telling how these
people might retaliate.

232
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,166

We need to have a little chat.


241
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:45,166
[ALLIUM] So then, to what do I
owe this unexpected audience

242
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,458
with the brilliant leader
of the illustrious Tekkadan?

243
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,250
[ORGA] We're here to
address the recent attack

244
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,666
on the Admoss Company's
half-metal mine.

245
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,416
The assassination attempt
on Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

246
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,166
And last but not least,
the fight you picked with us

247
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,708
using the Dawn Horizon
Corps as your pawns.

248

Come now, I'm sure I don't
know what you're--

249
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,916
[ORGA] The only thing
I want to hear...

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,833
...is how you're going
to settle these affairs.

251
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,333
Let's not be hasty!

252
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,208
Word of the attack at the mine
has reached our ears, too.

253
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,041
And I'm deeply disturbed
that Miss Kudelia

254
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,708
was a primary target.

255
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,625
We were so relieved to hear
no harm had come to her.

256
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,125
It's risky to stand
up for one's rights.

257
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,208
An occupational hazard
for activists like

258
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,208
Miss Kudelia and myself.

259
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,875
However, we mustn't allow
the threats of deplorables

260
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,916
to deter us from speaking up.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,458
Rather, we must act now,

262
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,375
while the incident is
still fresh and visceral.

263
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,000
At this very moment,
we're planning something huge!

264
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,041
I would consider it a
great honor if you could

265
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,291
ask Miss Kudelia to
take part, as well.

266
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,458
Kudelia told me a while ago
that she had already turned down

267
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,000
all such requests from you.

268
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,208
The only reason she said
that was out of fear

269
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,625
for my people's safety!

270
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,125
I'm almost positive
Miss Kudelia already knew

271
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,458
she was being targeted
by those lawless thugs

272
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:55,958
of the Dawn Horizon Corps.

273
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,291
That's just the kind
of person she is.

274
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,833

supposed to mean?

00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,500
"deal with us yourselves"?

315
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,041
Eyes front. Stay on guard.

316
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,125
[HUSH gasps]
Yes, sir.

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,708
[ORGA] This incident
cost us several lives.

318
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,583
So if you can't
afford to pay it,

319
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,333
Then you'll have to
take it up with them...

320
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,250
...in the afterlife.

321
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,083
[ALLIUM]
Let's just calm down...

322
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,000
[ALLIUM gasps]

323
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,000
[ALLIUM]
Wait--!

324
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:43,541
[thudding]

325
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:53,166
[ORGA]
That's that. Let's go.

326
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Right.

327
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,250
[door clatters]

328
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,791
[ATRA]
Having trouble sleeping?

329
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,291
Oh no, I'm just not really
in the mood to sleep yet.

330
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,500
[ATRA]
That's right.

331
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,750
You're going home
tomorrow, aren't you?

332
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,041
[KUDELIA]
It's not actually "home",

333
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,750
so much as my office.

334
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:13,958
[ATRA]
You mean you haven't gone back

335
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,083
to visit your mother and father?

336
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,250
Well, um... I just have a
lot of things on my plate

337
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,166
at the moment.

338
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,083
But thanks to Mikazuki
and the others,

339
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,208
the most pressing threat
has been eliminated.

340
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,041
It's time to get back to work.

341
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,375
[ATRA]
Just like Mikazuki.

342
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,958
[KUDELIA]
Huh?

343
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:33,708
Over the past year, he learned
everything he possibly could

344
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,208
about this farm.

345
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:37,166
[KUDELIA]
I don't doubt it.

346
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,000
He read up on all
sorts of things

347
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,333
and even took a stab at
trying out new cultivation

348
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,708
methods while he
planted fresh seeds.

349
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:47,750
I heard about that.
And how they wither and die.

350
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,583
What about reading and writing?

351
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,250
[ATRA]
Hmm. Kinda iffy.

352
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,375
He works hard on
things that interest him,

353
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,916
but he tends to slack
off on everything else.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,666
[KUDELIA]
He's the same as always.

355
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,541
It seems like it's always
all-or-nothing with him.

356
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,375
But that's kinda what I like
the most about Mikazuki.

357
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,125
As it stands,
Embi and the others

358
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,416
are a bit better at
reading and writing.

359
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,708
That sure does bring
back memories.

360
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,250
All of us studying together.

361
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,250
We're really grateful for
everything you did for us.

362
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,500
You taught us the
letters we use to read.

363
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,541
And when you can read, a world
of opportunity opens up.

364
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,500
You're absolutely right.

365
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,208
I'll make this a world where
hard work like that pays off.

366
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,000
Miss Kudelia?

367
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:33,250
And to accomplish that, there's
a lot more I have to learn.

368
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,541
If only I had built a better
relationship with Allium,

369
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,375
none of this madness
would've ever happened

370
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,916
in the first place.

371
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,125
You didn't do anything wrong,
Miss Kudelia!

372
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,208
They're the ones who started
this by sending pirates

373
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,666
after us!

374
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,458
[KUDELIA] But if I'm really
being honest with myself,

375
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,250
I'm the one who
drove them to it.

376
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,166
In hindsight, there must
have been a better way

377
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,958
to solve this conflict.

378
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,750
[ATRA gasps]

379
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,875
[KUDELIA] We always use violence
to solve our problems.

380
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,416
But continuing down that path,

381
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,625
will only create more like
Tekkadan and Mikazuki.

382
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,750
I want to break this cycle.

383
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,416
Well, when that day gets here...

384
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,958
... I think you should
come join us

385
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,458
and help us work the
farm with Mikazuki!

386
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,375
[KUDELIA]
Hm?

387
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,791
Because, when it
finally arrives,

388
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:19,791
it'll mean your job has
come to an end, right?

389
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,208
You know what? You're right,
that's a lovely idea.

390
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,041
Can you confirm, without a
shadow of a doubt,

391
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,666
that Allium has been killed?

392
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,166
I sent over one of our people
to check out his offices.

393
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,541
He verified that Allium
Gyojan was indeed dead,

394
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,666
and all the Terra
Liberionis members

395
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,583
had been detained by Gallarhorn.

396
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,375
Once again I've stained their
hands with spilled blood.

397
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,875
You did nothing wrong,
Madam President.

398
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,125
That may be true but
I still have to change

399
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,750
all of this someday.

400
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,958
After all I swore a vow
to make them happy.

401
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,375
[RIDE] This place sure
ain't the wonderland

402
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,375
they made it out to be.
There's nothing out here yet!

403
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,250
But, that's what's
great about it.

404
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,500
And hey, look at the
bright side, kiddo.

405
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,000
If you start mining
right now,

406
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,666
you'll be raking in huge
profits for five years,

407
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,375
ten years, hell, maybe
even decades to come.

408
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,250
This is a real treasure trove.
Just give it a chance.

409
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,375
If you ask me, it was
pretty generous of him

410
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,416
to give us something
so valuable.

411
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
But think about it.
Who knows what'll happen

412
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,666
decades down the road?

413
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,791
I might be an old man by then.

414
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,083
Yeah, I can hardly
picture it, either.

415
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,125
Well that means that we'll
just have to start puttin'

416
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,458
a little more thought
into the future, won't we?

417
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,208
We'll also need more
manpower to run this place.

418
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,583
And we'll have to learn
new skill sets, too.

419
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,083
Aw, look at our Deputy Boss!
All grown up!

420
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,333
Oh, shut up! You'll be
doin this, too!

421
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,875
We're not gonna make Orga
do everything for us!

422
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,541
[RIDE gasps]
Where is the boss, anyway?

423
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,083
I'd say he's in the
skies about now.

424
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,583
He's been invited to Ares,
which is amazing

425
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,750
given the fact that it's
Gallarhorn's Mars base.

426
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:07,375
Pretty soon, Tekkadan's gonna
be greater than ever before!

427
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,625
[DEXTER]
Oh, thank goodness!

428
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,625
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

429
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,208
[YUKINOJO]
What's going on?

430
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,875
Apparently, there's something
at the mine that requires your

431
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,375
immediate attention.

432
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:17,958
[All]
Huh?

433
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,208
[DEXTER]
This is it.

434
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:24,625
[YAMAGI] Hang on,
isn't this is a mobile suit?

435
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,458
Though, the frame
seems a little...

436
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,958
Yeah, it's got a loadout
I've never seen before.

437
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:33,250
But it sure looks like
a Gundam Frame to me.

438
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,500
A Gundam Frame...

439
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,583
[YAMAGI gasps]

440
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:38,291
[DEXTER] There's another
one further in.

441
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,666
But, from what I can tell,
it's too large to be

442
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,458
an actual mobile suit.

443
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,333
[ISURUGI] I'm here with
our guests, Brigadier General.

444
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,750
This is the first time I've
seen you without the mask.

445
00:20:55,833 --> 00:21:00,125
As I recall it, I've only met
you and the boy in the hat.

446
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,166
I've heard about
you from Isurugi.

447
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,750
I'm glad to see you're well.

448
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,208
You seem to be looking
rather worn out.

449
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,916
Mikazuki!

450
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,666
It must be the travelling.

451
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,708
I set out for Earth
again tomorrow,

452
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,416
though I can't say I'm
looking forward to it.

453
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,291
So then...

454
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,458
First, I wanna say thank you.

455
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,250
Cleaning up the Terra Liberionis
mess was a big help.

456
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,125
That was an insignificant
compensation compared to your

457
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,041
capturing Sandoval for us.

458
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,833
So If there is anything else
I can do, just say the word.

459
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,583
We've already been paid
for carryin' out the job.

460
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,500
However, why don't you tell
us what's so important that

461
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,750
you'd meet us without
your mask on.

462
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,916
Believe me, it's really
not as important as

463
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,375
you're making it out to be.

464
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,708
I'd just like to maintain
a cordial relationship

465
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,833
with Tekkadan.

466
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,833
I sure wish you would
lighten up a little bit.

[ORGA] This incident
has made it clear

468
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,250
that Gjallarhorn has
its own inner factions.

469
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,875
Are you referring to
the Arianrhod Fleet?

470
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:56,041
What exactly are
you looking for?

471
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,166
As I've already told you,

472
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,083
I want to reform this
corrupted Gjallarhorn.

473
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,500
But, to accomplish this,

474
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:05,833
I must secure a position
with more power.

475
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:07,750
My objective for
the time being,

476
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,500
is to acquire more
prominence than Rustal Elion.

477
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,916
He's the supreme commander
of the Arianrhod Fleet.

478
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,791
As well as a member of the
Seven Stars, just like you.

479
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,625
As it stands, it would
prove troublesome to go

480
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:23,416
head-to-head with the
man without any backup.

481
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,916
I feel the need to have an
ally who will stand by my side.

482
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,750
Have you lost your mind?

483
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,000
That's not something you ask
a small group like ours to do.

484
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,500
Please understand that I have no
interest in selling you short.

485
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:38,375
I truly believe that
joining forces with me

486
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,625
will prove equally
beneficial to you.

487
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:44,416
But it also means your enemies
will become our enemies.

488
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,458
What do you plan
to do about that?

489
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Well that's quite
simple, really.

490
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,416
I just need to make the
pros outweigh the cons.

491
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:00,208
All right. From now on,
Tekkadan's your ally.
