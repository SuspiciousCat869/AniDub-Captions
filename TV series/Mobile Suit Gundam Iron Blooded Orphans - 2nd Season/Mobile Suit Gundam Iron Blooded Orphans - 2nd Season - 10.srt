1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,333
[MERRIBIT] Teiwaz and
Gjallarhorn's Rustal faction

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,833
have been roused by the actions
of McGillis and Tekkadan.

3
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:21,625
Neither will take it lying down.

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:23,750
Amidst the
never-ending scheming,

5
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:27,125
it quietly awaits the
time of its revival.

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,666
[JASLEY'S MAN A]
Here's the report we got

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,541
from the guys watchin' Ares.

8
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,458
The Arbrau Mars Branch chief,

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,916
representatives of
Mars' economic blocs,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,583
and the Outer Sphere
Development Corporation head.

11
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,333
It seems as though
Lord Fareed is the one

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,208
who set up the meetings.

13
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,458
[growls]

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,541
[JASLEY'S MAN B]
Are they layin' the groundwork

15
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,916
for some big move?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,541
Those punks are playin'
politics and gettin' cocky.

17
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,500
[JASLEY'S MAN C] I can't
believe a Teiwaz subsidiary

18
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,708
is teaming up with a
Seven Stars member.

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,375
[JASLEY'S MAN B]
I'd bet my ass that Naze

20
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,375
is pullin' the strings.

21
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,708
[JASLEY] Looks like the old
man has lost his edge.

22
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,708
In his senility,
I think he's developed

23
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,000
somethin' of a soft spot for
those hot-headed punks.

24
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,416
I couldn't agree more.

25
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,916
But are we just gonna stand by

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,625
and let Naze and Tekkadan
do what they want?!

27
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,291
[JASLEY]
No, of course we're not!

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,583
Why do you think I'm
spending a small fortune

29
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,208
to have somebody keep
tabs on those rats?

30
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,500
Now the real game begins.

31
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,083
Real game?

32
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,708
They haven't realized it yet,
but they're not the only ones

33
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:28,166
who have connections
within the Seven Stars.

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,166
I just need a gift for them.

35
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,791
In order to negotiate on
an even playing field

36
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:37,458
with those stubborn Seven Stars
bastards, I need one more thing.

37
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:41,375
I have to get my hands
on some juicy intel.

38
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,375
[ECO] We're done overhauling
the driving gears

39
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,458
and doing the electrical
system checks.

40
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,208
Although, since we're
behind schedule

41
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,208
with tuning up the
special equipment,

42
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,583
the Flauros delivery
will be a little late.

43
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,500
That's good to know.
I'll be sure to tell the boss.

44
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,875
But I have to say, I sure
wasn't expecting these colors.

45
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,166
[YAMAGI] It's all right,
I got the boss's permission.

46
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,666
Apparently, he can't get worked
up if it's not this color.

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,666
And I bet, knowing Shino,

48
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,375
he's gonna be even
more reckless now.

49
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
Yeah, that sounds like him.

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,375
Oh, hey, Chief, have
you been able to acquire

51
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,333
any more information
about that one?

52
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,875
Nothing. Not a damn thing.

53
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,958
It sort of looks like
a Mobile Worker,

54
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,000
but it's chock-full of parts
I've never seen before.

55
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,333
And there's not even
a cockpit anywhere.

56
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,875
Wait, there's no cockpit?

57
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,083
In all my years, I've never
seen a system control protocol

58
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,750
quite like this one.

59
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,500
I've no clue what this
machine even does.

60
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, then why don't you just
ask somebody who does know?

61
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:12,708
--Hm?
--[YAMAGI] Huh?

62
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,416
Like Gjallarhorn.

63
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,416
I mean, it is from the
Calamity War, isn't it?

64
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,791
I would think they'd be the ones

65
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,125
who would know
the most about it.

66
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
You may be right.

67
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,750
If we're lucky, they might
have some information

68
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,166
about this particular
machine in their database.

69
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,833
Can we even do that?

70
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,166
I would hope so,

71
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,208
given Tekkadan and
Gjallarhorn's recent team up!

72
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,666
What's the harm?

73
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,583
Well, the boss should still
be on Ares, so I guess...

74
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,541
[ECO] Wait a minute, that's
Gjallarhorn's Mars base, right?

75
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,416
Then it's perfect.

76
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,458
[YAMAGI] All right then, I'll
get in touch with him and ask.

77
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,000
[ECO]
Tell me what he says!

78
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:52,500
But still... that's
one weird face.

79
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,583
[EUGENE] Next month, we've got
three more Sheedins comin' in,

80
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,125
and then that Gundam Frame
we sent up to the Saisei

81
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,750
is gonna be delivered here.

82
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,916
However, before they get here,

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,041
we need to finish the
reassignment training

84
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,041
and get each of our Mobile
Suit's functionality

85
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,875
to at least 90%.

86
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:10,916
Those are orders straight
from the boss. Any questions?

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,166
Nope, no questions here.
It's gonna be a piece of cake!

88
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,083
That's true.

89
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,458
Since everyone's
doing their part

90
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,625
and putting in such good
work, from the looks of it,

91
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,666
it'll be a pretty easy
schedule to keep.

92
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,375
Also, let's not forget
that payday is coming up.

93
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,583
We should let everyone
unwind a bit.

94
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,750
I still can't believe it.

95
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,333
Oh, it's nothing.
Forget about it.

96
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,333
Oh, yeah, where is Orga, anyway?

97
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,458
He's takin' his sweet
time gettin' back.

98
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,583
Apparently, he's
still stuck on Ares.

99
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,541
Between the Mars
staff of Gjallarhorn

100
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,500
and the bigwigs of Chyrse,
he says he has a lot of those

101
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,333
meet and greet things to go to.

102
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:48,708
Oh, man, bet it sucks to be him.

103
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:49,791
[EXECUTIVE A]
I look forward to

104
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,166
a mutually beneficial
relationship.

105
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,041
[ARAE]
Long day?

106
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,333
I've been through firefights

107
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,250
that are much easier
than these meetings.

108
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,375
Yeah, that sounds about right.

109
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,958
Oh, and by the way,
these are the materials

110
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,458
that Tekkadan requested
from Gjallarhorn.

111
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,291
So this explains that thing?

112
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,625
That Mobile Worker we
sent to the Saisei?

113
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,583
You should also know
that Lord Fareed

114
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,708
would like to speak to you
directly about this matter.

115
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,916
[ORGA]
Huh?

116
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:23,250
[MCGILLIS] First, let me
ask you a few questions.

117
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,250
Did you find anything else
of note at the plant

118
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,916
where you found this?

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,125
[ORGA] We turned up a few
things that looked similar,

120
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,125
along with a Gundam Frame.

121
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,500
We also found somethin'
huge in the back,

122
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,625
but we have no idea what
it could possibly be.

123
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,208
Oh?

124
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,166
Is the excavation work
still underway?

125
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,583
I believe so.

126
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,000
[MCGILLIS] I want you to
stop it, immediately.

127
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,416
[ORGA]
Huh?

128
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,166
You were entirely right
to inform us of this matter.

129
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,000
It was a good decision
on your part.

130
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,041
I appreciate this, Orga. Truly.

131
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,458
Only Gjallarhorn knows the
power of these machines.

132
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,958
Are these machines
really that dangerous?

133
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,250
[MCGILLIS] Yes, which is why
I decided it would be wise

134
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,416
to tell you about
them personally.

135
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,125
It's a Mobile Armor.

136
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,708
Huh?

137
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,708
Forbidden machines that were at
the heart of the Calamity War.

138
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,583
They were massive units that
killed hundreds of millions

139
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,625
and crumbled civilization.

140
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,500
So these are weapons then.

141
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,958
[MCGILLIS]
What you asked us to research

142
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,125
was merely an accessory
to the Mobile Armor.

143
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,750
As for the Mobile
Armor itself...

144
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,416
...well, that was probably
the huge object

145
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,083
that you found at the plant.

146
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,375
[ORGA] And that's the reason you
want me to stop the excavation?

147
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,708
[MCGILLIS] Indeed. We'll set
out for Mars right away.

148
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,500
[JASLEY]
Lord Fareed's going to Mars?

149
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,000
[JASLEY'S MAN A] Yeah, and
from the sound of things,

150
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,208
he's doin' it without
Gjallarhorn's knowledge.

151
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,708
[JASLEY'S MAN B]
Think it's for Tekkadan?

152
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,625
They've got one of the Seven
Stars going there directly.

153
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,125
Those cocky punks.

154
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,000
If we play our cards
right, perhaps...

155
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,416
[JASLEY'S MAN B]
What is it?

156
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,833
[JASLEY] A secret mission
by the Fareed patriarch...

157
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,583
This'll be a fine gift.

158
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,458
[JASLEY'S MAN A]
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

159
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:03,291
Apparently, Tekkadan asked
Lord Fareed to I.D. the thing

160
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,875
they found in the mine.

161
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,708
Did they?

162
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,541
This is good, just put it
all together in a report.

163
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,125
I'm not exactly sure
what he wants on Mars,

164
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:15,916
but the more gifts we
have to offer, the better.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
[IOK'S MAN A]
Young Lord.

166
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,291
A transmission from home.

167
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,916
The message was addressed
directly to you, my lord.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,291
To me?

169
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,541
[JULIETTA]
Lord Fareed is going to Mars?

170
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,125
[IOK]
Why would he take off for Mars

171
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,583
when the disorder in the Earth
Sphere hasn't yet been resolved?

172
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,125
And in secret, too.

173
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,041
What in the world could that
deviant possibly be thinking?

174
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,916
Where did you obtain that intel?

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,375
[IOK]
From the JPT Trust,

176
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,666
a trading company my late
father had connections with.

177
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,625
They also sent various
reports along with it.

178
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,583
[RUSTAL]
Hmm?

179
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,583
How'd they acquire this?

180
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,333
Is it something you recognize?

181
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,458
A Pluma.

182
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,666
It's an unmanned drone

183
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,291
used in conjunction with
a Mobile Armor unit.

184
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,250
[IOK]
What is a Mobile Armor unit?

185
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,291
They're the massive weapons
that caused the Calamity War.

186
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,625
Are you serious?!

187
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,791
Why are you so
surprised by that?

188
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,000
You are a Gjallarhorn
solider, aren't you?

189
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,791
That info should be
common knowledge.

190
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,291
Yes, I'm well aware of it.

191
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,500
[RUSTAL] It was difficult, but
the Calamity War concluded

192
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,625
once Agnika Kaieru and the
ancestors of the Seven Stars

193
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,000
destroyed all the Mobile Armors.

194
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,458
I never imagined there would
be remnants of one on Mars.

195
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,916
Forgive me, but it's
a 300-year-old relic,

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,333
why would Lord Fareed
travel all the way to Mars

197
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:29,833
for such a thing?

198
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,833
[VIDAR]
This is merely speculation,

199
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,333
but if he's getting involved,

200
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:37,291
it could mean the main body of
a Mobile Armor is on Mars.

201
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:40,125
If that's the case, we can
assume that what he's after

202
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,250
is the Order of the Seven Stars.

203
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,333
[RUSTAL]
Hmm.

204
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,916
The Order... of the Seven Stars?

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
[VIDAR]
It's the highest honor,

206
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,708
awarded only to those who've
defeated a Mobile Armor.

207
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,916
Seniority within the Seven
Stars was decided by those

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,416
who had the most of such orders.

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,125
That's Interesting.
You're well-informed.

210
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,291
[VIDAR] The highest-ranking
family, the Issues,

211
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,000
are without a patriarch.

212
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,166
If Lord Fareed obtains an
Order of the Seven Stars,

213
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,833
the seniority could change for
the first time in 300 years.

214
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,666
After all this time, an
Order of the Seven Stars,

215
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,500
and ending the post-war regime.

216
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,375
So this is what he
meant by "reform."

217
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:24,083
[IOK] No! We must not allow such
an vile plot to be realized!

218
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,541
Well then, you must allow
me to hunt down McGillis!

219
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,666
[MCGILLIS] I can tell there's
something on your mind.

220
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,333
Is it really wise to
travel to Mars in person,

221
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,416
given the instability

222
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,291
of Gjallarhorn's
political situation?

223
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,708
in the coming days,

224
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,375
our ties to Tekkadan will
become even more crucial.

225
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,125
Relationships can be deepened

226
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,125
by putting in personal
appearances.

227
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,291
Yes, sir, but be
that as it may...

228
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,541
[MCGILLIS] What a strange
twist of fate this is.

229
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,041
[ISURUGI]
Hmm?

230
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,000
[MCGILLIS] Memories of the
Calamity War had been wiped out.

231
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,125
Yet, on that red planet,

232
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:58,875
the world which Tekkadan calls
home, they managed to persist.

233
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,625
It seems my
suspicions were right.

234
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:04,041
Their destiny will make
the winds of those times

235
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,833
howl once more.

236
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,041
[JULIETTA]
The JPT Trust, sir?

237
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
[RUSTAL] A group led
by Jasley Donomikols.

238
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,500
I believe he's second
in command of Teiwaz.

239
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,791
Isn't Teiwaz the parent
organization of Tekkadan?

240
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,291
Why would they
supply us with intel

241
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,708
regarding the plans
of Lord Fareed?

242
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:26,250
Some in Teiwaz probably consider
their actions to be a nuisance.

243
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,166
Especially since they've
teamed up with McGillis.

244
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,208
So they leaked info to his
political enemy to spite them?

245
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:38,500
It's Jasley Donomikols,
let's remember that.

246
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,833
[MECHANIC A] The Flauros
is ready for transfer!

247
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,375
Good work, now go ahead
and take it to Deck Three.

248
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,500
So I guess even Yamagi is
going back to Mars, huh?

249
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,500
Sure will be quiet around here.

250
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,000
I guess all that's
left is this guy.

251
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,125
[MECHANIC B]
Hey, Chief, we're ready to go!

252
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,083
Okay, let's start it then.

253
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,958
[YAMAGI] Chief, I just got an
emergency call from the boss!

254
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,125
What are you doing?

255
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,666
It hit me that we might
be able to uncover

256
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,916
some new information if
we turned this thing on.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,291
No, you can't! Don't
mess around with it!

258
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,083
[ECO]
Jeez. What's gotten into you?

259
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,458
[ZACK]
Wh-What the heck?!

260
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,083
I... got a huge raise!

261
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,083
Is this real?!

262
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,250
[DANE] I can really
keep all this money?

263
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:30,083
[MERRIBIT] You've been a part of
Tekkadan for six months now.

264
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,041
When a family member puts their
life on the line in a fight,

265
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,875
it's only right that
they're paid accordingly

266
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,375
for their hard work
and bravery.

267
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,500
That's how the boss
wants to run things.

268
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,500
Hey, guys whaddya say
we go out tonight,

269
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,375
get some girls and
have some fun?

270
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,708
Nah, think I'll pass.

00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,208
Huh? You are such a drag.

272
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,125
No, I just realized something.

273
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,750
[SHINO]
What?

274
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,916
Money's not gonna
buy you true love.

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,208
Huh?

276
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,833
[CHAD]
Ms. Merribit, is that true?

277
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,708
[MERRIBIT] Well... yes,
I suppose it is true.

278
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,041
Then I'm staying, too.

279
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,416
I'm not, you can count me in!

280
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,958
All right, that's what
I'm talkin' about!

281
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,625
Why don't we go to
the Bird House?

282
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,875
[ZACK] Nah, that place
has gone to the dogs.

283
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,625
Lemme tell you about
one that's even better.

284
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,416
[SHINO] How would you
know about one of those?

285
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,416
[ZACK] You want me to call
and make a reservation?

286
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,416
I think I have their number.

287
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,291
All right then, shall we go?

288
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,291
[bang]

289
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,541
So where are the
two of you going?

290
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,083
We're gonna visit Miss
Kudelia's office.

291
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,791
Why're you going there?

292
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,458
Whaddya mean, "why"?

293
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,166
Things have been so
crazy around here,

294
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,041
we haven't had a
chance to visit.

295
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,583
Neither of us have seen her.

296
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,208
Sounds good to me.

297
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,416
[ATRA]
Huh?

298
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,958
If Mr. Mikazuki is going
there, then so am I.

299
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,458
Say what?

300
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,083
What a pest.

301
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,791
[ATRA]
Wow! What a fancy office!

302
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,666
Come right this way, please.

303
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,750
[ATRA]
Ooh!

304
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,916
It's a picture of the plant!


305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,833
Oh, and a picture of
the orphanage, too!


306
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,458
[CUCUBITA] These are all
pictures of projects we run.

307
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,625
[ATRA] Amazing! Oh.
Is this one here a school?

308
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,541
[MIKAZUKI] Fumitan Admoss
Elementary School.

309
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:08,541
[ATRA]
Huh?

310
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,208
Hang on a second,
you can read?

311
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,375
It's simple enough
to read a name.

312
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,000
Hey, you're right.

313
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,875
It was the name of
a treasured friend.

314
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:22,458
[CUCUBITA] Miss Kudelia made it
so all tuitions for the school

315
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,000
would be free of charge.

316
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,791
It even provides meals.

317
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,041
[ATRA]
It serves food?!

318
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,541
[CUCUBITA]
Yes, indeed.

319
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:32,541
By serving meals, the school
ensures that fewer children

320
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,416
have to work to provide
food for themselves.

321
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,125
Children like you, who
had to become soldiers

322
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,916
to put food in your bellies.

323
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,333
Wow!

324
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,875
We're hopin' beyond hope,

325
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,875
that if there's a place where
children of all backgrounds

326
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,250
and creeds can come
together to learn equally,

327
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,875
we might be
able to find a way

328
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,291
to eventually put
an end to all wars.

329
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,041
I don't really get
any of that stuff,

330
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,375
but Miss Kudelia
sure is amazing.

331
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,708
Right, Mikazuki?

332
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,958
If that ends up happening,

333
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,916
then what am I supposed
to do for a living?

334
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,583
[KUDELIA]
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,666
You came all this way and all
I've done is make you wait.

336
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,625
Hi, Miss Kudelia!

337
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,833
[KUDELIA]
Mikazuki.

338
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,583
Here's your payment from
Tekkadan for this month.

339
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,333
Make sure you check it
for yourself later, okay?

340
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,000
All right. Sure.

341
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,750
What's she talking about?

342
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,000
My monthly salary.

343
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,375
Huh? So it's that kind
of relationship.

344
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,083
[KUDELIA gasps]

345
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,250
No, nothing like that.

346
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,708
You have Miss Kudelia look after

347
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,958
all of your money for you,
don't you, Mikazuki?

348
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,250
She knows all about
handling money.

349
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,666
[KUDELIA] Mikazuki,
you don't have to make...

350
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,583
She also takes care of whatever
money I have left over

351
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,500
after I send some to the manager
who runs the general store.

352
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:41,416
I think Mr. Akihiro and
Ride do the same thing.

353
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,291
[HUSH]
Hmm?

354
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,625
You savin' up for somethin' big?

355
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,458
Well, nothing like
that. Not really.

356
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,416
I just don't use it
that much right now.

357
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,125
[HUSH]
You don't spend money, at all?

358
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,958
Not a lot. It's good to
save some too it, isn't it?

359
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,791
[HUSH] And there's
nothing you wanna buy?

360
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:58,000
Not now, which is why she's
keeping an eye on it.

361
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,541
Oh, I see.

362
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,208
Well, I suppose we do have
food and a place to stay

363
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,541
as long as we're
at headquarters.

364
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,541
You should let her manage
your money, Hush!

365
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,291
[HUSH]
Maybe... I guess.

366
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:10,875
[CUCUBITA]
It's not like those children

367
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,125
are above having
worldy possessions,

368
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:17,000
but they don't know the first
thing about usin' money, at all.

369
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,541
They're exactly as you
described them, ma'am.

370
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,958
At this point, they know much
too little about the real world.

371
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:26,583
And that very reason is why
they need a place to learn.

372
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,500
Yes, that's what I
believe too, Cucubita.

373
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,583
But I...

374
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,041
[CUCUBITA]
Madam?

375
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,875
[KUDELIA]
Nothing...

376
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,458
[SHINO]
Hey, Zack! Take this!

377
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,250
I mean...

378
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,125
Sure thing.

379
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,416
Thanks a lot, man.

380
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,833
Don't sweat it, I'm happy to.

381
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,083
Hey, somethin's going
on between you two.

382
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,666
What's that about?

383
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,833
Well, there was this lady last
night, and the funniest thing--

384
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,250
[SHINO]
Please, don't do it!

385
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,500
You can never, ever tell
anyone about what happened!

386
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,583
Hey, listen up!

387
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:07,666
Mikazuki, Shino, Akihiro, Chad,
Hush, and Zack, this is for you.

388
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,958
Starting tomorrow,
I'm gonna need you guys

389
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,833
to provide security for
the boss and his guest.

390
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,416
His guest?

391
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:19,125
[MCGILLIS] Sorry to keep
you waiting, Mr. Orga.

392
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,916
Pleasure's mine.

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,125
Thank you for coming
all the way out here.

394
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm thrilled to get to meet
the members of Tekkadan.

395
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,875
Right back at'cha.

396
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,833
We last saw each other
on earth, Mikazuki Augus.

397
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,166
Yeah.

398
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,375
[ORGA]
It still doesn't make any sense.

399
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,666
How is it that something
from 300 years ago

400
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,958
remained undiscovered
all this time?

401
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,333
As I'm sure you know,

402
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,666
Martian half-metal
is a special substance

403
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,166
utilized in electronic equipment
aboard Mobile Suits and warships

404
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,041
to deal with the radiation
of Ahab Reactors.

405
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,458
If a reactor were within
a vein of that ore,

406
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,791
you would be shielded,

407
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,791
but wouldn't be able to
detect the reactor itself.

408
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
[CHAD]
Um...

409
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,875
This is a really
dangerous weapon, right?

410
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,041
Don't you think we
should've brought

411
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,583
some Mobile Suits along with us?

412
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,166
[MCGILLIS]
No, it's better this way.

413
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,375
[CHAD]
Uh?

414
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,458
If we brought along
the Mobile Suits,

415
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,750
there's a chance their
presence could awaken it.

416
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,458
Wait, what the hell are
you talkin' about?

417
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,791
That was their original purpose.

418
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,250
Mobile Suits were developed
specifically to battle

419
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,000
and destroy Mobile Armors.

420
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:42,833
[ORGA]
Huh?

421
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,041
To put it another way,

422
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,541
you could say
they're archenemies.

423
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,833
Your Gundam Frame,
if my suspicion is correct,

424
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:53,625
it fought a Mobile
Armor 300 years ago.

425
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,958
Really?

426
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,500
The Barbatos?

427
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,500
So Mobile Suits were
made just for the purpose

428
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,250
of fighting Mobile Armors?

429
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,541
What're we up against here?

430
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,958
In the end, it's just a
machine though, right?

431
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,791
These things can't really
be much of a threat

432
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,666
without a pilot.

433
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,000
You're wrong.

434
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:11,375
Mobile Armors do not require
a pilot to function.

435
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,333
It's an autonomous machine
that fights on its own.

436
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,625
[AKIHIRO]
Fights on its own?

437
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,291
You're kidding me!

438
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,458
How is such a
thing even possible?

439
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
[MCGILLIS] This is precisely
what enables these machines

440
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,166
to decimate cities
and slaughter humans

441
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,458
without a moment's hesitation.

442
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,250
There it is.

443
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,750
[grunts]

444
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

445
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:59,041
What's wrong, Mika?

446
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,791
[MIKAZUKI]
What are those?

447
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,166
[ORGA]
The hell...?

448
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,833
[ORGA]
Gjallarhorn?

449
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,750
Hey, these guys aren't
with you, are they?

450
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,083
[MCGILLIS]
No... They're not...

451
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,458
[IOK] Stay right where
you are, McGillis Fareed!

452
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,041
It's that Mobile Suit.
The one from before.

453
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,291
Look, General--

454
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,500
I know.

455
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,208
It would seem as though
someone leaked intel

456
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,208
regarding my movements.

457
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,583
Lord Kujan. What business
do you have here?

458
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,625
[IOK] We received word that you
intended to start a rebellion,

459
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,958
thus I pursued you
all the way to Mars!

460
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:58,916
Rebellion?

461
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,916
[IOK]
Don't play innocent!

462
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,916
You wanna win an Order
of the Seven Stars

463
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,833
by destroying that, right?

464
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:06,500
I know that all you
truly care about

465
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,041
is securing the top rank
of the Seven Stars.

466
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,000
The Order, you say?

467
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,250
Oh, I get it. So that's
how you misread all this.

468
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,791
[IOK]
Just save it!

469
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,750
The Fareed Family concealing
the existence of a Mobile Armor

470
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,708
and acting on its own is
all the proof we need!

471
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:26,125
McGillis Fareed, for your
crimes you are under arrest!

472
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,708
What should we do?

473
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:31,208
There's not a damn thing we can
do against those Mobile Suits.

474
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,916
Chad! Contact
Eugene back at HQ!

475
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,583
Have him send in
our Mobile Suits!

476
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,750
It's no use! We're too far
out of range to use the LCS!

477
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,208
Eugene!

478
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,083
[EUGENE]
Yeah?

479
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,583
An urgent call from the Saisei!

480
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,166
[CHIEF MECHANIC] The damn
thing just went berserk

481
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,291
the very instant
we turned it on.

482
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,541
We managed to get
it under control,

483
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,000
but we're pretty banged up.

484
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:55,208
We've only recently gotten
the communication lines

485
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,666
back up and running.

486
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,041
That thing is dangerous,
just like the boss said!

487
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,750
You guys should be careful, too!

488
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,791
The boss is over there now.

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,875
[IOK]
McGillis Fareed... it's over!

490
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,666
Stop moving, Iok!

491
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,833
[MCGILLIS] Don't bring
your Mobile Suits any closer

492
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:20,416
than they are now!

493
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,750
[IOK]
Save your breath, would you?!

494
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:28,750
[gasps]

495
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,625
[RIDE]
Next time on

496
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,541
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded</i>
<i>Orphans</i> , "Stained Wings."

497
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,875
I'm finally piloting
a Mobile Suit!

498
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,166
I'm gonna train hard

499
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,833
and be more like Mr.
Mikazuki and Mr. Akihiro!


500
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,750
I wanna protect Tekkadan
and everyone in it!
