00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,875
[MERRIBIT] Still unable
to contact Tekkadan HQ,

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,375
the Earth Branch
is caught in a war

3
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,041
between the SAU and Arbrau.

4
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:22,375
Left in the dark,
the boys cry out,

5
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:26,000
but unfortunately for them,
no one is around to hear.

00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:30,625
[TAKAKI]
Balfour Plain,

7
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:33,250
the border region where
the SAU and Arbrau forces

8
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,000
are deadlocked.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,750
[TAKAKI] The conflict...
was started by a freak accident.

10
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:47,208
[TAKAKI] An SAU plane
was on a recon mission.

11
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,166
But crashed when its
systems were disrupted

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,916
by Mobile Suit Ahab reactors.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,833
The SAU didn't
think the situation


14
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,166
warranted the use
of Mobile Suits,


15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,583
so they were caught unprepared.


16
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,750
[TAKAKI] The SAU's troops
consist of their own

17
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:05,000
inexperienced defense force,

18
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,750
as well as Gjallarhorn's
SAU garrison force.

19
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,666
To compensate for this,
they're reinforced by troops

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,125
from the Outer Earth Orbit
Regulatory Joint Fleet.

21
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,333
[TAKAKI] On the opposing
side of the battlefield

22
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,208
are the inexperienced
defense force of Arbrau

23
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,875
and Tekkadan.

24
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,458
Our ragtag army also
includes a Mobile Suit team

25
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:34,000
belonging to Mr. Galan, who
joined as our staff officer.

26
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,291
Sporadic outbreaks
of attrition-warfare

27
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,833
have been going on
across the plain

28
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,458
for the past two weeks now.

29
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:45,625
All in all... we're just
being swept along.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,833
Move out!

31
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:56,583
[TAKAKI]
No. Something's not right.

32
00:01:56,666 --> 00:02:00,541
At this point, we've fought more
battles than I can count.

33
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,083
But this isn't like any of them!

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,625
There! An opening!
All right, let's break through!

[MCGILLIS]
Will this conflict never end?

38
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,250
Sir, originally, our plan was
to intervene with the troops

39
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,125
and force an end
to the situation.

40
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,250
However, we never imagined this.

41
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,833
Who would've thought
soldiers from Arbrau

42
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:13,333
would fight back
with such ferocity?

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,083
[MCGILLIS' MAN C]
General.

44
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,666
Please correct me if I'm wrong,

45
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,208
but wouldn't it be
better to resolve this

46
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,041
through official
diplomatic channels?

47
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,875
Don't be absurd. We lost
that option a while ago.

48
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,791
Otherwise there'd be no need
for us to be on the battlefield.

49
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,458
[MCGILLIS' MAN A] Arbrau's
prime minister, Makanai,

50
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,250
is still unconscious.

51
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,000
Even if we wanted
to try diplomacy,

52
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,583
the channels have been cut off.

53
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:38,416
And Gjallarhorn's garrison force
in Arbrau can't move, either.

54
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Isn't it obvious?

55
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,125
That's exactly why the SAU came
to us to mediate the situation.

56
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,958
But at this rate, the
conflict will go on forever!

57
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,333
Sir, there's something
strange about this war.

58
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,375
Surely one side
should've won by now.

59
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:56,500
I have to say, their
tactics are astonishing.

60
00:04:56,583 --> 00:05:00,125
They avoid large-scale battles
in favor of small skirmishes.

61
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,458
I sense a sort of genius
behind the timing

62
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,208
of their scattered deployments
and well-executed retreats.

63
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:11,291
Especially...

64
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,000
...the way this person
is capitalizing

65
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,791
on Tekkadan's lack
of leadership,

66
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,625
yet excellent mobility.

67
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,208
They're being strung along
like puppets on a string.

68
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,458
All right then, I think
that's all of 'em.

Shut the hell up,
you little punk!

If we don't finish this,
they'll just kill us later!

[MCGILLIS]
This person has taken advantage

87
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,375
of the unclear
reasons for this war

88
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,125
and has used them to create
the perfect stalemate.

89
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,166
I have to wonder...
is that their objective?

90
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,500
This one makes 12 we've lost.

91
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,875
[GALAN] I'd like to pay
my respects, as well.

[TAKAKI]
Mr. Galan?

93

To this young, valiant
solider of Tekkadan.

00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,166
Uh, no thanks.

97

[GALAN]
I know it's tough.

98
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,541
But now, it's time
for us to knuckle down.

99
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,666
Tekkadan is doing fine work.

100
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,500
Especially you two.
You're exceptional soldiers.

101
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:48,916
Without the pair of you, things
could've been far worse.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,333
All things considered,

103
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:53,666
you're practically the captains
of the working units.

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,666
It must be degrating to have to
fight with those greenhorns

Take care.

Since you're young,
some food and rest

Exactly how much longer
is this gonna go on?

[TEKKADAN MEMBER E]
And are we winning or losing?

124

We need to know.

00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,458
According to Mr. Galan,
we have the upper hand for now.

Mr. Radice also said the boss
was happy with our work.

Can I ask you something?
What's this war about?

128
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,125
Both sides have battalions,

129
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,625
which is well over a
thousand soldiers each,

130
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,416
but we only attack
in small numbers,

131
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,166
then retreat just
when things get good.

132
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,291
I just don't see the point...

133
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,541
Well, I guess...

134
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,666
The point is none of
your goddamn business.

135
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,125
For now, just worry about
eating and sleeping

when you get a chance.

Y-Yeah...

138

I know, right?

141
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,875
[TAKAKI] Sometimes, I feel
doubtful about this war too.

142
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,416
It feels like we've been on
the battlefield for years now.

143

Not too long ago, you and
I were eating dinner with Fuka

back in our little apartment.

145
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,666

I haven't been able to
shake that feeling lately.

My head understands
why we're doing this.

154

Although, now and then,
I feel like I lose my way,

00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,291
[TEKKADAN MEMBER G]
Marching orders!

160
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,291
Report to the command cen--

161
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:08,500
Again?! But we can't!

162
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,000
We've been fighting
since last night

163
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,625
and everyone's still exhausted!

164
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,041
This is a direct order
from Captain Galan!

165
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:16,875
[TAKAKI]
Captain? No!

166
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,750
Since when is Mr. Galan
in charge of Tekkadan?

167
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,750
[TEKKADAN MEMBER G]
Well... I mean...

168
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,041
It's just that he seems to
be the one in command

169
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,750
of all of our
missions these days,

170
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,041
so it made sense to call him--

171
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,666
[TAKAKI]
Understood.

172
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Sorry. I'll be right there.

173
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,333
[TEKKADAN MEMBER G]
Thank you, sir!

174
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,458
[ASTON]
Takaki.

175
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,875
[JULIETA] You're quite the
workaholic, aren't you?

176
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,041
Do you ever stop tinkering
with your favorite little toy?

177
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,791
For your sake, I hope it's
gonna be ready for combat soon.

178
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,000
[VIDAR]
Patience.

179
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,708
This machine has a
rather unique system.

180
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,333
Unique system?

181
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,166
[VIDAR] I hear the Outer Earth
Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet

182
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,833
has run into a bit of trouble.

183
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,375
[JULIETA]
Of course they have!

184
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,458
After all, that gentleman with
the beard is in command now.

185
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,208
[VIDAR]
Beard?

186
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,791
Yep.

187
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,791
He's a seasoned tactician whom
Master Rustal trusts completely.

188
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,708
When it comes to organized
battle, there's no one better.

189
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,708
[VIDAR]
Perhaps.

190
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,083
They're up against
the new commander

191
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,791
of the Regulatory Joint Fleet.

192
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,416
It sounds as though you've
met Lord Fareed before.

193
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,750
[VIDAR]
Perhaps.

194
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:34,291
[JULIETA] Tell me...
who's underneath that mask?

195
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,083
[VIDAR]
Hmm.

196
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,416
I'm not sure myself.

197
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,875
[IOK] That McGillis
fellow was pretty cocky

198
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,083
when he started
the mediation job.

199
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,291
Although, he's not
making much headway.

200
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,500
[RUSTAL] It must be
weighing heavily on him.

201
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,125
After all, it's the
first armed clash

202
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,916
between the economic blocs.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,250
The entire world is awaiting the
outcome with baited breath.

204
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,416
[IOK] The best part is, the
longer this war drags on,

205
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,625
the more his hard-earned
reputation will suffer.

206
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,541
Ha! I can almost see his tears.

207
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,291
And it's all thanks to your
clever planning, Master Rustal.

208
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:13,458
Your man is quite the operative.

209
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,958
That's true.

210
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,750
He does make it interesting

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,666
[TAKAKI]
The enemy is up ahead.

212
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,416
I know we're gonna defeat them.

213
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,291
After that... what'll
be waiting for us?

214
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,208
[ASTON]
Don't worry.

215
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,375
[gasps]

216
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:38,208
I'll always be here to
protect you... and Tekkadan.

217
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,958
[TAKAKI]
What's gotten into me?

218
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,333
As long as Mr. Chad
is in the hospital,

219
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,916
I have to be strong
for everyone!

220
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,750
[ASTON]
There they are.

221
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,958
Mobile Suit squad, with me!

222
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,166
I'll open up a path for you!

223
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,416
[ASTON] I wonder if
Mr. Chad has woken up yet.

224
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,666
He's always so reckless!

225
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,500
[EUGENE]
Yeah, the same as before.

226
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,833
We're tryin' everything,

227
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,208
but still can't get through
to the Earth Branch.

228
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,166
What's the point of
having the Ariadne

229
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,500
if they don't even
respond to us?

230
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,125
I hear ya.

231
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,583
I'll let you know as soon as I
get any new intel from Isurugi.

232
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:24,375
Got it?

233
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,666
[EUGENE]
Roger that.

234
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,833
[MERRIBIT] Our info comes
only from the news.

235
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,250
It's frustrating.

236
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,750
We have no insider intel,

237
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,333
and we still don't know
the status of our people.

238
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,875
And at this rate...

239
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,791
The Earth Branch and the guys
that I just sent over there,

240
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,583
I'm positive they're
up to the task.

241
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,500
Even if they don't hear
anything from me,

242
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,458
they've already prepared
themselves for the worst.

243
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,333
[LAFTER]
Talk about dedicated.

244
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,000
You do this every day.

245
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,541
Seriously,

246
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,208
is there any point to getting
bigger than you already are?

247
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,375
Leave me alone.

248
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,708
It's my hobby, okay?

249
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,166
I kinda get how
you feel, though.

250
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,458
Hell, to be perfectly honest,
I like that about you.

251
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:16,833
Well, just don't pull a muscle.

252
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,583
[ZACK]
Come on...

253
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,416
How are we supposed
to sit around eating

254
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,208
like nothing's
going on out there?

255
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,458
I know, it's weird.

256
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,958
If you ask me, this trip
is taking way too long.

257
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,666
I know what you mean.
Three weeks from Mars to Earth?

258
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,541
[ZACK sighs]

259
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,500
Something just feels off to me.

260
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,708
You must be worried about
Old Man Makanai, huh?

261
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,833
[KUDELIA]
I am.

262
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,458
But I get updates from the news.

263
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,416
I wonder if Chad's even alive.

264
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,625
Hard to say, given
our lack of info.

265
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,833
[EUGENE sighs]

266
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,875
We'll find out more
when we get to Earth.

267
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,166
No use worryin' about it now.

268
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,416
Yeah, that's a good point.

269
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,083
[HUSH]
Mikazuki.

270
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm all done with the
Shiden simulation.

271
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Right.

272
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,875
Is there anything
else need to be done?

273
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,625
[MIKAZUKI] You can do
maintenance on your Shiden.

274
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,958
I already did the maintenance.

275
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,166
Then go work out.

276
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,291
[HUSH]
I did that, too.

277
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,250
Then get some rest.

278
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,666
Rest? Hey!

279
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,333
When we get to Earth,
I'm gonna be looking

280
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,458
at my first ever
Mobile Suit battle!

281
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:15,500
Shouldn't I be doing everything
I possibly can to prepare?!

282
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,458
There's no ti--!

283
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,541
[MIKAZUKI]
You need to rest up.

284
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,291
Huh?!

285
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,625
Now's your chance.

286
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,916
'Cause once we get there,
you won't be able to.

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,083
[EUGENE]
Take Mikazuki's advice.

288
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,416
Listen up!

289
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
Instead of worrying about
things you can't change,

290
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,333
you should be getting some rest.

291
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,416
Don't stress over a
tomorrow you can't see.

292
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,750
And even if Hell
is waiting for us,

293
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,041
we'll use every ounce of our
strength to get through it

294
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,541
and make it back alive!

295
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,333
That is the Tekkadan way!

[TEKKADAN MEMBERS mumbling]

297
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,666
That was quite the rousing
speech, Deputy Boss.

298
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,416
He's only imitating
what Orga does.

Shut your trap, Mikazuki!

Oh, it's you again.

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,583
Earth regeneration units take
longer to heal someone.

316
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:52,000
But the up-side is, once it's
done, he'll be a lot better.

317
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,375
[FUKA]
Is this right?

318
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,083
Should I really be doing this?

319
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,875
[FUKA]
Takaki... I hope you're okay.

320
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,375
[ARBRAU SOLDIER B]
They got Itagami!

321
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,958
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B]
Keep moving, or you'll--

322
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,958
No, Tori!

323
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,333
Takaki's what?!

324
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,041
You sure?!

325
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:38,625
I am!

326
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,958
The enemy faked them out, and
now Mobile Suits are attacking!

327
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,708
Get all the Mobile Suits
up and running!

328
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,750
Come on, we have to
hurry! Let's move!

329
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,458
What?

330
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,500
[TEKKADAN MEMBER H]
Who's that?!

331
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:52,875
[TEKKADAN MEMBER I]
They're fast!

332
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,750
[TEKKADAN MEMBER J]
Isn't that Mr. Galan's Geirail?

333
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,625
[TEKKADAN MEMBER K]
Oh, no! They found us!

334
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,083
[TAKAKI]
We can't give up now!

335
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,750
[TEKKADAN MEMBER K]
But what else can we do?!

336
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,166
[TAKAKI]
Fuka...

337
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,083
[gasps]

338
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,083
Wow. That's amazing.

339
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,083
[GALAN]
Glad I made it in time.

340
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:32,166
If we lost you, Arbrau's entire
military would fall apart.

341
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,125
Thank you for
saving me, Mr. Galan.

342
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,958
I'm sorry I have to put
you through all this,

343
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,916
but we have to double down
and work even harder.

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,666
Our victory is at hand!

345
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,083
And then, you'll
be heading home!

346
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,958
So be patient and hang in there.

347
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,583
The tough calls will
end soon enough.

348
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,833
[TAKAKI]
Yes, sir!

349
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,416
[TAKAKI] What am I
even doing right now?

350
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,875
[NEW TEKKADAN MEMBER D]
We're finally here!


351
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,083
[NEW TEKKADAN MEMBER E]
Awesome!

352
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,833
Oh, wow! So this is Earth.

353
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,250
[DANE]
Man, it sure is beautiful.

354
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,041
[HUSH]
Yeah.

355
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,291
It's right there.

356
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:12,625
Why are we standin' around

357
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,416
when it's so close
we could touch it?

358
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,541
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm...

359
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,583
Something here
doesn't feel right.

360
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,500
Why the hell won't you give our
shuttle landing clearance?!

361
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,750
You better start
explaining, right now!

362
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:24,958
[CONTROLLER]
As it stands,

363
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,000
R-brau has declared
a state of emergency.

364
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,250
Landing clearances to
all shuttle spaceports

365
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,500
have been suspended.

366
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,416
[EUGENE] How many times
do I have to tell you?

367
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,291
We're Tekkadan!

368
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,083
You need us as military advisors

369
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,750
and backup for the
border conflict!

370
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,958
[CONTROLLER] I'm sorry, but we
cannot allow any exceptions.

371
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,708
[EUGENE] Don't you hang up!
I'm not done talkin' yet!

372
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:44,958
Well, that sucks.

373
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,041
And right when we were
about to arrive, too.

374
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,541
What do we do now, Deputy Boss?

375
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,166
[EUGENE]
Isn't it obvious?

376
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,333
We're not that
little gang anymore.

377
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,791
We'll find our own way through!

378
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:00,125
[RADICE] A report came in
from the Arbrau Spaceport.

379
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,583
The Hotarubi has departed
from the orbital station

380
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:03,916
and has left the area.

381
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,791
Everything's going swimmingly.

382
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,916
Having more kids here would
just complicate things.

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,250
Some of them might even be able
to put two and two together.

384
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,291
[RADICE]
Ha. I highly doubt that.

385
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,083
I must say, I am quite
impressed with your work.

386
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,750
Taming those irksome brats
is no small order.

387
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,000
[GALAN]
It's like you said,

388
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,875
those kids are
nothing but animals.

389
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,541
No different from dogs.

390
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,625
If you feed them and give
them a pat on the head

391
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,541
every once in a while,
they'll roll over

392
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,208
and obey their master
without a second thought.

393
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,958
Especially Aston.

394
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,208
That one's particularly fun.

395
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,666
Now I get it now.

396
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,541
Apparently, that's just the
way all Human Debris are.

397
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,041
Can't sleep, either?

398
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:50,000
I wasn't expecting to.

399
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,791
Lately, I've been thinking.

400
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:57,125
You said this was different from
other battles we've been in.

401
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:59,541
I think I know why that is.

402
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,916
This is all new.

403
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,625
It's our first time
fighting under someone

404
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,250
other than the boss.

405
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,000
That must be why.

406
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,916
Or maybe not...

407
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
Thanks, Aston.

408
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:14,500
I think you're right. That does
make things feel a bit weird.

409
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:16,375
[ASTON]
But is that so bad?

410
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,166
I don't really care who
I get my orders from.

411
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,416
[TAKAKI]
Huh?

412
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,125
[ASTON] The job of
Human Debris is to fight.

413
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,458
[gasps]

414
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,291
Don't talk like that!

415
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,083
[ASTON]
Hm?

416
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,750
This isn't like before!

417
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,333
It's not about orders!

418
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,875
We're allowed to
fight for ourselves

419
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,541
and nothing's gonna change that!

420
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:35,666
Takaki.

421
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,250
Look, I don't bring it up,

422
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,375
but I get scared
watching you out there.

423
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,125
Working in Tekkadan
means risking our lives.

424
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,333
I know that better than anyone.

425
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,000
I also know that
there's no guarantee

426
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,375
that we'll even live
to see tomorrow.

427
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,041
But I... I just don't wanna
see you accepting death

428
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,583
right from the outset.

429
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,916
Whaddya mean?

430
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,208
Mr. Galan is incredible.

431
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,875
Somehow he's able to see the
big picture of this entire war.

432
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:06,833
If we follow him,
we'll win, I know it.

433
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:10,416
He even said we'll be
home before too long.

434
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,250
Let's live through this and
go home together, Aston.

435
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,375
Whaddya say?

436
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,875
[ASTON]
Sounds good.

437
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,250
[MCGILLIS' MAN A] Please,
sir, you must reconsider!

438
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,291
This has gone on for
a month. Enough is enough.

439
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,208
If we let this stalemate
drag on any longer,

440
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,250
it'll cause problems
for us down the road.

441
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,458
[MCGILLIS' MAN A]
But, sir,

442
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,625
surely you don't need
to go in yourself--

443
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,958
There is no need to worry.
I'll be careful.

444
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:43,375
[GALAN]
What?

445
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,958
McGillis has gone in?

446
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,916
Yes! The recon squad
just reported it, sir.

447
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,583
Interesting. He's grown
tired of waiting.

448
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,666
[GALAN'S MAN A]
What should we do?

449
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,708
This is quite unexpected.

450
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,916
I planned on toying
with him for years,

451
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,916
until every remnant
of his status

452
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,416
and reputation was ruined.

453
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,000
I want you to prepare my Geirail

454
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,500
and your Scharfrichters for
battle, on the double.

455
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:08,208
And one more thing! Get those
Tekkadan kids out of bed!

456
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,666
[TEKKADAN MEMBER L]
Move your ass!

457
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,000
[TEKKADAN MEMBER M] Get the
Landman Rodis ready first!

458
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,166
[GALAN] Attention! This will
be the final battle!

459
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,541
All right, troops,

460
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,250
let's take their boss's head
and bask in our victory!

Takaki.

462
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,000
[TAKAKI] If this is
really the last battle,

463
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't need to be in command.

464
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,875
So then I'll go.

465
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,500
I'll see you later, Takaki.

466
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,500
[chuckles]

467
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,208
[TAKAKI]
I'm... just being swept along.
