1
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:17,333
[GAELIO] I, Gaelio Bauduin,
declare here and now.

2
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,000
I will kill...

3
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,083
...the traitor of Gjallarhorn.

4
00:00:22,458 --> 00:00:23,833
McGillis!

5
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,333
[MCGILLIS] Rustal Elion put
you up to this, no doubt.

6
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,833
Very well. Challenge accepted.

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,750
[RUSTAL]
This is Rustal Elion,

8
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,541
commander of the
Arianrhod Fleet.

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,041
Our Fleet has been
keeping Gaelio Bauduin

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,666
under our protection
for quite some time.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,375
He informed us about
McGillis Fareed's offenses

12
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:47,208
and exposed him for
the criminal he is.

13
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,916
In one of these heinous acts,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
Fareed plotted to gain control

15
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,291
of the Outer Earth Orbit
Regulatory Joint Fleet.

16
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:57,000
And in doing so, he caused the
death of Commander Carta Issue.

17
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:58,041
What?!

18
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,625
[RUSTAL]
He also took over his family

19
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:03,583
from his adoptive father,
Iznario Fareed,

20
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,750
McGillis also conspired
to take possession

21
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:08,625
of the Bauduin family
by killing Gaelio Bauduin

22
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:10,625
and making Almiria
Bauduin his wife.

23
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,000
[gasps]

24
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,708
It's okay, Miss Almiria.

25
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:16,833
[RUSTAL] If that wasn't enough,
his current actions

26
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,958
have brought dishonor
upon Gundam Bael,

27
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,000
which is the very
symbol of Gjallarhorn.

28
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,375
In it sleeps the soul of
our founder, Agnika Kaieru.

29
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,375
McGillis Fareed tainted
it with his myopic

30
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:27,125
and treasonous ambitions.

31
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,416
[ORGA]
This isn't good.

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,416
Are things still going
according to plan?

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,541
Uh--

34
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,083
Yes, they are, without a doubt.

35
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,416
The old men of the Seven
Stars will have no choice...

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,833
[RUSTAL] Even if we must
break Gjallarhorn's laws,

37
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:41,041
we will not rest until the
traitor, McGillis Fareed,

38
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,666
is brought to justice!

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,666
Huh. You sure about that?

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,083
There's no need to worry!

41
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,250
Gjallarhorn has rules that
you would only understand

42
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,791
if you were an actual member.

43
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:51,541
We'll discuss everything
in more detail

44
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,291
once we've met up
with the General.

45
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:55,916
Now, if you'll
excuse me, comrades.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,875
Who's he callin' his comrades?

47
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,416
Hey, Boss, what did he mean

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,916
by rules only
Gjallarhorn understands?

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,875
Our hands are tied.

50
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,916
That is, till Mika comes back.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,666
We'll have to wait.

52
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,208
[MCGILLIS]
Sorry to keep you.

53
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,750
Once the shuttle arrives,
why don't you head back, first?

54
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,833
We'll be right behind you.

55
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,750
Hey, you had the
surgery, didn't you?

56
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,000
I thought it didn't
work for adults.

57
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:28,125
Tell me. The black Graze
you fought at Edmonton.

58
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:31,041
Exactly how well do you
remember that fight?

59
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,166
Well, I wouldn't say
that I remember it,

60
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,583
but it popped into
my head, earlier.

61
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,916
[MCGILLIS]
A Gjallarhorn soldier

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,500
was connected to
that Mobile Suit.

63
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:44,166
It was all part of a
series of experiments.

64
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,833
Experiments that would
lead up to the day

65
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,083
I'd be able to pilot Bael.

66
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:53,166
So that... the Alaya-Vijnana
surgery could be performed

67
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,750
on an adult, like myself.

68
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,833
The Alaya-Vijnana
System was originally

69
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:01,000
developed by what
is now Gjallarhorn.

70
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,625
They came to view body
modifications as taboo

71
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,750
and prohibited them
within Gjallarhorn,

72
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,791
yet they failed to recognize
one important fact.

73
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,083
Something they had
completely forgotten.

74
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:15,083
The legendary Mobile Suit
required the Alaya-Vinjana.

75
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:16,916
Now, whether they
know it or not,

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,208
their selective amnesia
and self-preservation

77
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,791
is what will make my ascent
as Gjallarhorn's leader

78
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,291
that much easier.

79
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,583
[ISURUGI]
General, we should be going.

80
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,791
[MCGILLIS]
Right.

81
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,833
We'll meet again,
Mikazuki Augus.

82
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,833
[SOLDIER 44A] So General Fareed
was really accepted by Bael?

83
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,708
[SOLDIER 44B]
I thought it was just legend.

84
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,250
[SOLDIER 44A]
Apparently, only those chosen

85
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,500
by Agnika Kaieru's
soul can pilot it.

86
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:12,291
[SOLDIER 44B] Are you saying
Lord Fareed was selected?

87
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,041
Whether you choose
to believe it or not,

88
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,166
Agnika's soul selected me.

89
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,458
You must accept that I'm now the
official leader of Gjallarhorn.

90
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,166
Wait, but that's...

91
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,500
That's nothing but a
self-indulgent fairytale!

92
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,791
[MCGILLIS]
And yet...

93
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,625
Many in Gjallarhorn have
tried to activate Bael,

94
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,125
but throughout its long history,
not one has succeeded

95
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,083
in accomplishing this task.

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,083
You can't deny that fact.

97
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,291
Bael has permitted
me alone to sit

98
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,916
atop its prestigious throne.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,166
This, too, is an
indisputable fact.

100
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,083
You all have no choice
but to obey me from now on.

101
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,416
Disobeying me means
disobeying Agnika Kaieru,

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,416
or even worse denying the very
existence of Gjallarhorn itself.

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,250
B-But Lord Elion's
broadcast earlier presents

104
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,583
a major problem that
cannot be ignored.

105
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,916
[GALLUS]
Exactly!

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,333
Was Lord Elion speaking
the truth, McGillis?!

107
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,125
Did you try to kill Gaelio?!

108
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,500
My dear father.

109

[growls]

110
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,833
You have nothing to fear.

111
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,333
Now that I have been
chosen to pilot Bael,

112
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,375
all these trivial accusations

113
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,875
are nothing more
than a nuisance.

114
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,583
Trivial accusations?!

115
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,916
How dare you say that
after trying to kill my son!

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,375
Have you forgotten
that I'm also your son?

117
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,708
[gasps]

118
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,625
[MCGILLIS] Everything I've
done has been to protect

119
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,958
the reputation of
the Bauduin family

120
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,208
and the name of Gjallarhorn.

121
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,041
[GALLUS]
You're not making any sense!

122
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:38,083
Unfortunately, there's no need
for you to understand this,

123
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,916
or for us to speak
to each other at all.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,958
My words are now the
words of Agnika Kaieru.

125
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,041
As members of Gjallarhorn,
you have but one duty

126
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,208
at this point.
Obey me without question.

127

[BAKLAZAN, FAROOQ gasp]

128
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,458
So let's begin.

00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,541
All ground forces under

[gasps]

[MCGILLIS] Gjallarhorn
will be united as one.

133
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,708
And our first mission will
be removing the traitor,

Your face looks more
determined than before.

It took a while
to decide. I'm sorry.

Bael is in his hands
now because of me.

Every large organization
has hidden, pus-filled wounds.

141
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,041
It comes with the system itself.

This uprising coming from

From time to time,
the pus must be drawn out.

a massive battle.

00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,875
Many of your subordinates died

because of your
careless judgement.

160

But, in spite of that,

00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,000
your men still look up
to you with reverence.

162

And do you know why?

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,833
Because of history.

[IOK]
History?

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,958
Your father,
the late Lord Kujan,

166
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,416
was an incredible man.

167
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
The subordinates who
admired him in the old days

168
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:38,958
hope to catch a
glimmer of him in you.

They've been with you
since your youth.

Even if you were to
continue going about things

they've seen how you love

with blatant honesty.

McGillis boasted that he'd
reform the obsolete ways

174
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,541
of the organization,
but despite his claims,

175
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,125
he still relies on an
old Gjallarhorn legend.

are alike, but different.

It's true that Gjallarhorn
began its existence

00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,333
with Agnika Kaieru.

180
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,625
But the history of
our great organization

181
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,625
was built without
the help of Agnika.

All this is possible because
we're an organization.

Master Rustal...

186

If he valued this,
he could've proven it

187
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,666
by respecting history
and denying Agnika.

318
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,333
I see that you've decided
to stay on with Tekkadan, too.

319
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,500
Yes, well, it's not like
I have anywhere else

320
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,208
to work at the moment.

321
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,000
And besides...

322
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,375
I wasn't able to do anything
to help those kids

323
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,166
when they were being
abused by the adults

324
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,833
during the days of the CGS.

325
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,375
Back then, I thought there
was nothing I could do,

326
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,166
so I just blamed
it on the times.

327
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,041
But despite their
horrid treatment,

328
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,875
they kept fighting with
all their strength.

329
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,000
I felt like such a coward.

330
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,541
So I decided to stay here,
hoping to be of use,

331
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,708
if even in a small way.

332
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,750
That's very noble of you.

333
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,416
But I still wonder if there's
anything I can do to help them.

334
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,000
Those kids are the ones
who're doing the fighting.

335
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,333
As for me, the only thing I
can do is sit here and watch.

336
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,333
I feel like there's something
we should be doing for them.

337
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,000
There has to be
at least one thing

338
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,583
we can offer them as adults.

339
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,083
[DEXTER]
Hmm?

340
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
But, whenever I go to them,

341
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:11,083
they're so earnest
and intense...

342
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,083
It feels like whatever
I was going to say

343
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,541
would be a lie.

344
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,458
Oh, Ms. Merribit.

345
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:20,583
So, at the very least,
I wanna stand by their side.

346
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,125
I believe he stays
with Tekkadan

347
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,750
because he feels
the same as I do.

348
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,666
[YUKINOJO]
Hey! Watch it over there.

349
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,708
[MEMBER 44A]
Yes, sir!

350
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,458
And be sure to check
all the bolts!

351
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,958
We've gotta move quickly,
but thoroughly!

352
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,541
[ZACK] What do you
think about all this?!

353
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,458
They're crazy, right?
Like, totally insane!

354
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,291
I mean, the enemy
has twice as many

355
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,791
freakin' ships as we do!

356
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,333
You know as well as me,
we're not gonna win this thing!

357
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,583
So why's everybody so gung-ho?!

358
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,125
We don't have another
alternative, so the only choice

359
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,000
is to work harder.

360
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,208
That's what I'm sayin'!

361
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:51,916
Thinking we can win this
by playin' it by ear

362
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,916
is the stupidest
thing I've ever--

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,791
[BOTH gasp]

364
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,333
[ZACK gasps]

365
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,875
Sorry about that!

366
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,541
I'm beggin' you, please don't
tell the Boss what I was--!

367
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,833
[YUKINOJO] Man, if there were
more guys like you in Tekkadan,

368
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:08,333
I bet it would've made Orga's
life a helluva lot easier.

369
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,250
So, no matter what you do,
never stop thinkin'.

370
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,125
[ZACK]
Huh?

371
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,541
O... kay...

372
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,833
[JULIETTA] I must say,
your face is more handsom

373
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,083
than I'd imagined.

374
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,416
[GAELIO]
Really?

375
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,750
Why, thank you.

376
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,083
[JULIETTA]
You're like me.

377
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,958
Someone who is in search
of greater strength.

378
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,208
Alaya-Vijnana Type E.

379
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,083
It looks like you've
found your strength

380
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,583
in the form of inhuman powers.

381
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,875
[GAELIO] The only thing
that can draw out

382
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,375
the true power of this
Mobile Suit is a human.

383
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,666
[gasps]

384
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,000
Remember what I told
you a while back?

385
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:49,291
The soldier who had a lot
in common with you?

386
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,625
It's my belief that the passions
and emotions we all exhibit...

387
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:55,208
Show us that we're human.

388
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,666
Why are you t...?

389
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,500
[GAELIO]
Don't deny yourself.

390
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,083
And never forget there's someone
you trust and respect.

391
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,750
And your wanting
to better yourself

392
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,333
for his benefit...

393
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,875
...is the right thing.

394
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,875
[SHINO]
Right, King of Mars, my ass.

395
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,166
Hasn't he heard that,
if something sounds

396
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,458
too good to be true,
then it most likely is?

397
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,416
Yeah, but we're probably
the ones who made

398
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,166
Orga go down this path.

399
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,416
[SHINO]
Hmm?

400
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,916
[EUGENE] We've made him
decide every last detail

401
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,166
about Tekkadan's future
all by himself.

402
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,083
Not to mention we've
hustled him around

403
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,375
and egged him on.

404
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,291
All our worries and stress
got dumped onto him.

405
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,125
So what if we make
trouble for him?

406
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,083
Orga's job is to take care
of things, isn't it?

407
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,208
Yeah, but...!

408
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,666
And because of all
of Orga's hard work,

409
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,041
our job is easy.

410
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,750
When Orga tells us
not to worry,

411
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,333
we throw away our doubts and
do what's right for Tekkadan!

412
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,083
[EUGENE]
You're right.

413
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:51,208
[MCGILLIS] The plan is to engage
Rustal Elion in Earth's orbit.

414
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:55,291
Of course, I'll need Tekkadan
to join us in the battle line.

415
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,041
[ORGA]
Yeah, got it.

416
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,541
But here's the thing gets me.
From what you're saying,

417
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,000
wouldn't this have turned into
a fight with the Arianrhod,

418
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,125
no matter what?

419
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:08,000
I admit, it was
always a possibility.

420
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,625
Rustal Elion and the
Arianrhod Fleet he commands

421
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,750
have established something
of a unique position

422
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,333
within the ranks of Gjallarhorn.

423
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,458
However, I thought,
with the combined forces

424
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,500
of all the families behind me,

425
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,333
they wouldn't be such
a tough opponent.

426
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,333
After all, we still have
you and your people.

427
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,416
There may be casualties--

428
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,083
General!

429
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,083
[ORGA]
"Casualties"?

430
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,166
Every man, woman,
and child in Tekkadan

431
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,666
is a member of our
family, understand?!

432
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,541
Don't just write them off
as faceless nobodies!

433
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,000
What do you think
you're doing, you--

434
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,416
[ORGA] Listen to me.
Tekkadan won't betray someone

435
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,875
we've joined up with.

436
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,000
That was just to make it clear.

437
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,208
[ORGA] But we're not gonna
risk our lives on something

438
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,375
that doesn't make sense to us.

439
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,125
So why don't you cut
the crap, already?

440
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,250
Sure.

441
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,208
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga?

442
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,458
Just one more battle.

443

Hmm.

It's actually happening.

448

[RIDE] Yeah, but this
is the final battle.

449
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,041
Just one more to go.

00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,583
One more.

done, go to the Hotarubi.

This is the final battle!

454

I'm finished.

Hmm?

00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,708
You're not gonna eat that?

458
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,333
I've been so busy working
that I've lost my appetite.

459
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,666
Come on! You'll never
last if you don't eat!

460
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,416
This is our last
battle, you know!

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,958
Listen up, people!

463
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,083
One more fight and
we'll get to our goal!

00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,208
Give it your all, got it?

[MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

466
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,625
[ATRA] They keep saying
it's the last battle,

467
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,708
and hearing them talk like
that kind of scares me.

468
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,250
I'm sorry for calling you
out of the blue like this.

[KUDELIA]
It's okay.

471

I can't stop Mikazuki
from leaving us behind.

00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,458
It's like I thought.

473
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm not good enough
to keep him here.

474
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,333
[KUDELIA] No, more so
than me or anything else,

475
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,375
the only one who can keep him
there is you, Miss Atra.

476
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,791
Huh?

477
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,083
[KUDELIA] My dream is to
make a world where children

478
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,875
like Mikazuki never
have to exist.

479
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:17,750
I've always worked towards that.

480
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:18,750
But...

481
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:19,750
...for a while now,

482
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,500
I've been sensing
a contradiction.

483
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,500
The strong bond that
holds them together

484
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,791
could only have come about
under these harsh conditions.

485
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,083
And I've even longed
for a family like that.

486
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,125
But, Kudelia, you're
part of our family, too.

487
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,416
[gasps]

488
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,625
[KUDELIA chuckles]

489
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,875
[KUDELIA]
Thank you, Miss Atra.

490
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:46,041
Of course I feel like
part of the family.

491
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,416
I'll keep walking along
the path I believe is right.

492
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,208
And, in the end, that will be
what's best for my family.

493
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:55,833
And I believe that feeling
will never change.

494
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,541
Which is why...

495
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,375
...the only one who can be
by Mikazuki's side right now

496
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,750
is you, Miss Atra.

497
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,875
Seriously?

498
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,375
Me?

499
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm?

500
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,833
Were you asleep?

501
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Nah.

502
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:16,875
[ATRA chuckles]

503
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,125
[MIKAZUKI]
What is it?

504
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,958
Oh, nothing, it's just
really quiet in here.

505
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,333
[MIKAZUKI] Yeah, they all
went to the Hotarubi.

506
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,833
[ATRA]
Oh... That explains it.

507
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,250
Are you okay?

508
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,750
[ATRA] So, is this really
the last battle?

509
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah.

510
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,916
[ATRA] And it's gonna
be a tough one, huh?

511
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Well, if I had to say,

512
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,416
it's a little easier for me.

513
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,583
[gasps]

514
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,208
As long as I'm in Barbatos,

515
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,458
my body can move normally,
and I don't have to think

516
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,125
about anything like-- 

517
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,291
[ATRA]
It's easy?

518
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,875
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

519
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,041
[ATRA] While you're out there
putting your life on the line,

520
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:52,291
all I can do is wait here.

521
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,541
If it's easier on you
to fight, does that mean...

522
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,958
...that I haven't been able
to do anything for you

523
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,291
in all this time?

524
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:03,708
[ATRA]
I...

525
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,625
I love you, Mikazuki.

526
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:08,291
I-I love the Mikazuki
that's here,

527
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,541
right in front of me!

528
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,500
You don't have to do this.

529
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,875
I might've told you to hug
girls when they're crying,

530
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,625
but now isn't the time
to do it, if you don't--

531
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,541
[MIKAZUKI]
That's part of it.

532
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:22,416
But also, I've realized just
how precious you are to me.

533
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,083
Do you mean it?

534
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,541
[MIKAZUKI] I don't know
of a world for myself

535
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:28,291
that doesn't involve fighting.

536
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:32,625
All I've known are the
battlefields that I've chosen,

537
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,875
and the ones chosen for me.

538
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,583
That's all.

539
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,416
What about now?

540
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,458
[MIKAZUKI] I'm fighting
so you can stop crying.

541
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,041
[KUDELIA]
I love him.

542
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:48,291
Mikazuki... but not
only Mikazuki.

543
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:52,333
Miss Atra, and everyone
else in Tekkadan, too.

544
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,416
They're my family.

545
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,875
If it's true,

546
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:59,958
and this battle is really
going to be the final one...

547
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,333
[RUSTAL] Starting now,
we, the Arianrhod Fleet,

548
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:07,125
will work toward defeating
the traitor, McGillis Fareed.

549
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:10,125
And reclaim Bael!

550
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,500
[KUDELIA]
...then may this ending

551
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,875
also be a beginning...

552
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:15,875
...to their future.

553
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,958
[EUGENE]
Next time on

554
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,625
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans</i> ,

555
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,250
"If This Is The End."

556
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,208
I know they say
money can't buy love,

557
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:34,500
but I'd sure love to visit
the ladies one last time!


558
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:36,541
Hey, Shino, when all
of this is over,


559
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,833
be a pal and take me there!
