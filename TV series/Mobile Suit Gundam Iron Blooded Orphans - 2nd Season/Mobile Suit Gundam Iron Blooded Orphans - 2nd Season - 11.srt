1
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,791
[MERRIBIT]
Mobile Armor,

2
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:19,458
a silent angel that has awoken
from its 300-year slumber.

3
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:23,958
It's merciless wings solely
crave the slaughter of humanity.

4
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:27,458
Only something inhuman
will be able to stop it.

5
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,416
[MCGILLIS]
That fool!

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,375
He has awoken the monster.

7
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,916
[IOK] Wh-What in the
world is that thing?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,666
Whoa.

9
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,125
[gasps]

10
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:55,666
[IOK'S MAN B]
Master Iok!

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,833
[IOK'S MAN B yells]

12
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:12,541
[IOK gasps]

13
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,250
So that's it...

14
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,125
[IOK]
A Mobile Armor!

15
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,833
[ORGA]
Damn it!

16
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,458
What the hell are we
up against here?!

17
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,958
[MCGILLIS]
Let's leave while we still can.

18
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,958
Wait a sec!

19
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,083
If we don't do something,

20
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,916
the mine's gonna be
ripped to pieces!

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,375
I've called HQ for back-up!
Once they get here--

22
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,833
It's no use.

23
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:15,125
It's not going to be that
easy to defeat this.

24
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,000
[ORGA]
Then how do we stop it?

25
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,458
[MCGILLIS] Our only recourse
is to destroy it completely.

26
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:23,916
That is, if we can.

27
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,500
And after all the
precautions I took

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,208
to ensure that this very
thing wouldn't happen.

29
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:35,375
Iok Kujan. How
foolish can you get?

30
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,125
I don't care if it
is a Mobile Armor!

31
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,708
It's just scrap metal
from 300 years ago!

32
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,458
I'm not afraid of it!

33
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,625
[IOK'S MAN F] Don't be
so reckless, Master Iok!

34
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,708
We need to fall back
and regroup!

35
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:53,416
[IOK yelling]

36
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:53,875
What the...?

37
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,750
[beeping]

Master Iok!

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,708
[IOK'S MAN C]
Damn it! Over here!

40
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,833
[IOK'S MAN A yells]

41
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,208
[IOK'S MAN A]
I've got 'im!

42
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,916
Damn you!

43
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:19,166
These things, what are they?!

44
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,041
There's a ton of them!

45
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,041
[ORGA]
What the hell are those?

46
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,000
[MCGILLIS] They're sub-units
of the Mobile Armor.

47
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,083
They're called Plumas.

48
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,791
Though, I didn't think
there'd be so many.

49
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,625
[ZACK]
Hey, Boss!

50
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,000
We're all set!

51
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,833
We just finished rounding up
the rest of our members!

52
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:40,333
[ORGA] All right!
Let's get out of here!

53
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,416
[IOK'S MAN A]
Please fall back, Master Iok!

54
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,250
Your machine's too
damaged to fight!

55
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,083
I can still do this!
The right side works!

56
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:52,916
[IOK'S MAN A] They can't be
beaten with spirit alone, sir!

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,875
Please, sir, you have to retreat
while we hold them off!

58
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,583
[IOK]
Nonsense.

59
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:01,291
Are-Are you telling
me to abandon you?

60
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,833
[IOK'S MAN A] Consider the
Kujan family's future!

61
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,958
I'm sorry, sir, but
I'm afraid your life

62
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,250
doesn't just belong to you!

63
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,750
[IOK]
Men... Forgive me!

64
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:21,500
Just know that I'll avenge you!

65
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:26,083
On my family's honor...
I swear it!

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,083
[ZACK]
Huh?

67
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,625
What're they...?

68
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,458
[HUSH]
Zack, stay on watch.

69
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,083
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching, okay?

70
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,333
[RUSTAL] We've lost all contact
with Iok's advance team.

71
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,833
[JULIETTA] Do you think...
that they've been wiped out?

72
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,958
Not sure.

73
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,708
But I do know that
the Mars Branch

74
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,041
has no idea what's
going on, either.

75
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,708
This is such a mess.

76
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,958
[VIDAR] Still, I think it's
premature to assume

77
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,333
they've all been annihilated.

78
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,625
The Mars Branch is under
Lord Fareed's command.

79
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,250
It could be false information.

80
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,500
[RUSTAL]
Hmm.

81
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,000
[JULIETTA]
Just great!

82
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,666
I was hoping that we'd have
some peace with him away,

83
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,416
but now he's gone and
caused even more trouble.

84
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,833
Whatever the case,

85
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,833
we need to investigate
this Mobile Armor

86
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,458
as well as the status
of Iok's team.

87
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,708
Reliable intel is
a must. Got it?

88
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,250
Understood, sir!

89
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,250
[RUSTAL]
Don't fail me.

90
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,125
[CREW A] We're entering
Mars' gravitational field.

91
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,625
[VIDAR]
Captain...

92
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,333
[JULIETTA] This could
also be my big change.

93
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,625
If I'm able to defeat this
Mobile Armor contraption,

94
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,833
it might just be my ticket
to securing an Order

95
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:40,375
of the Seven Stars
for Master Rustal.

96
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:42,625
[CAPTAIN A] What about
our resupplying, sir?

97
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,916
[VIDAR]
You won't be waiting long.

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,375
[SHINO]
Hey, Boss, it's me.

99
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,083
I just got to the mining plant.

100
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,916
How's it lookin' there?

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,833
[SHINO] Well... it seems like
that Mobile Armor thing

102
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,500
is long gone.

103
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,541
Want me to look for it?

104
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,041
No, don't.

105
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,166
Head back over here
and meet up with us.

106
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,458
[SHINO]
Roger!

107
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,750
[DANTE] All that was left
at the mining plant

108
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,333
was the wreckage of those
Gjallarhorn machines.

109
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:11,916
Not a single survivor.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,916
[ORGA]
No one made it out of there?

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,083
And you checked it all?

112
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,125
We didn't have to.

113
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,625
Every cockpit was crushed,

114
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:20,375
as if those things were making
sure the pilots were dead.

115
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,041
[MCGILLIS]
I knew it.

116
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,750
[ALL]
Huh?

117
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,250
[ORGA]
Knew what?

118
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,833
Mobile Armors are programmed
for thorough extermination.

119
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:27,916
[SHINO]
Huh?

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,083
[MCGILLIS]
And what was your opinion

121
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:33,125
about this deadly machine,
Mikazuki Augus?

122
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,083
It was pretty amazing.

123
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,458
And it was quite beautiful too.

124
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,208
Like one of those
birds I saw on Earth.

125
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,958
[MCGILLIS]
It's no bird.

126
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,666
But more like... an angel.

127
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,000
A humanity killing
machine known as "angel."

128
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,083
Long ago, these monsters
went on a rampage

129
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,500
and managed to slaughter a
fourth of the human population.

130
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,166
[ORGA]
Unbelievable...

131
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,541
[MCGILLIS]
It's true.

132
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,125
As I said before,

133
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,166
the Mobile Armors' sole priority
was the destruction of humanity.

134
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,958
They were specifically
designed for that task.

135
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,208
Those machines are
the enemy of mankind

136
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,250
that Agnika Kaieru,
the founder of Gjallarhorn,

137
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,083
fought 300 years ago.

138
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,333
The catastrophic event
known as the Calamity War

139
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,375
was brought about by those
monstrous Mobile Armors

140
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,125
and their destructive actions.

141
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,666
What's the Calamity War?

142
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,166
You don't know?

143
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,000
[MCGILLIS] Mobile Armors.
Angels that hunt humans.

144
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,500
And in order to hunt
down those angels,

145
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,750
demons were created.

146
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,208
Mobile Suits.

147
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:41,958
And the Alaya-Vijnana System
was made to control them.

148
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,125
[ORGA]
Anything else?

149
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,250
Oh, yeah, the warehouse
that was holding

150
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,625
all the fuel and materials
was completely destroyed.

151
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,416
And you didn't see
any people there?

152
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,333
[DANTE]
No, no one.

153
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
[ZACK]
Oh, right.

154
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,625
I saw that place, too.

155
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,583
These little machines
were running around,

156
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,625
ransacking everything in sight.

157
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,333
Why would they do that?

158
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,541
[MCGILLIS]
To resupply.

159
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,083
[ORGA]
Huh?

160
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,625
[MCGILLIS]
Unlike Ahab Reactors,

161
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,291
which are able to
run indefinitely,

162
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,458
propellant and fuel can
only last for so long.

163
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,958
[ORGA]
I get it.

164
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,875
Even if it's a monster, in
the end, it's just a machine.

165
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,833
And that means Tekkadan
can eliminate it. Right?

166
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,666
if that's what you
want me to do,

167
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,916
then I'll take it out for you.

168
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,458
You're absolutely correct.

169
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,791
Agnika Kaieru, too, managed to
put an end to the Mobile Armors

170
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,041
and went on to
found Gjallarhorn.

171
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,541
[ISURUGI]
General.

172
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,125
We've just now gotten word
from Chief Arae up in orbit.

173
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,875
It would appear that
the Third Ground-Base

174
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,666
has come under attack
by the Mobile Armor.

175
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,875
[ORGA]
And where's that?

176
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,250
[MCGILLIS]
Where we just were.

177
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,375
I'm sure it's objective

178
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,333
was to take all of
the resources there.

179
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,125
It must've topped
off its supplies

180
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,958
given the size of the base.

181
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,500
Also, a Halfbeak-class
ship from the <i>Arianrhod</i>

182
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,500
is headed this way.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,750
[SHINO] So? Whadda we
do at this point?

184
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,416
Are we gonna go
and back 'em up?

185
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,416
[MCGILLIS]
No need.

186
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,125
We'd never make
it there in time.

187
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,916
And besides, that's a flat
area with an open view.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,083
Hardly an ideal location
to ambush the enemy.

189
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,333
So that's your plan? An ambush?

190
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,958
It's our plan.

191
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,041
You will help, won't you?

192
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,583
Awakening that horror
from its slumber

193
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,500
is a blunder directly
caused by Gjallarhorn.

194
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,416
As such, it's up to me
to make this right.

195
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,250
That said, the ones who
unearthed it in the first place

196
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,625
were you, Tekkadan.

197
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,916
Yeah, I know. We're
not gonna run from this.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,791
[MCGILLIS]
Then you'll help.

199
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,833
We have no choice here.

200
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,791
Listen up! Bring me
a map of this area!

201
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,708
[ZACK, HUSH]
Yes, sir!

202
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,250
[ORGA]
Also, get confimation

203
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,083
on the Mobile Armor's
current location!

204
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,166
Send Akihiro's team to do recon!

205
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,916
[SHINO]
Roger!

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,708
General.

207
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,458
We've laid the foundation
for our plans on Mars.

208
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,750
We mustn't let go of that.

209
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,166
And then there's the matter

210
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,791
of the Order of the Seven
Stars Iok Kujan mentioned.

211
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,875
I think I want one.

212
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,000
[ISURUGI]
The most dangerous aspect

213
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,125
of Mobile Armors are the Plumas,

214
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,500
the swarm of smaller
units that accompany them.

215
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,833
In addition to offense,

216
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,541
the Plumas have another
important function.

217
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,916
They can repair the main body.

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,416
How so?

219
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,791
[MCGILLIS] They're able to
mend it without external help.

220
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,166
Huh? You're kidding me.

221
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,708
And that's not all.

222
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,458
The main body can
manufacture new Plumas.

223
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,541
Given enough time and materials,

224
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,916
Plumas can multiply
indefinitely.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,708
Man, that's a scary thought.

226
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:41,958
Yeah.

227
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,166
[MCGILLIS] That's how
they were able to keep

228
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,500
killing people without end.

229
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,083
So then, to beat it,

230
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,250
we have to separate it
from its pack, correct?

231
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,916
That's right.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,875
Once repairs are completed,

233
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,375
it will head for a more
populated area.

234
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,458
To seek out and destroy humans.

235
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:01,833
That is the most basic
protocol for Mobile Armors.

236
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,000
Their instinct, you could say.

237
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,416
Instead of chasing
after it directly,

238
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
setting a trap along its path

239
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,458
would prove more effective
in terms of an ambush.

240
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,333
But where's the nearest
populated area?

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
Oh!

242
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,291
There's only one place around
here that's populated!


243
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,208
It's heading for Chryse!


244
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,958
[ORGA]
We're movin' out for Chryse!

245
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,125
[MIKAZUKI] Can you take
Barbatos there for me?

246
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,666
[TEKKADAN MEMBER A]
Yes, sir!

247
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,791
We'll have our Mobile Suits

248
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,625
brought down from
orbit, as well.

249
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,500
Let's meet up again
in three hours.

250
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:36,458
Got it.

251
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,958
When the Second Unit gets here,

252
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,791
tell 'em to keep an eye on those
things, from a distance.

253
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,583
And while they're at it,
find an ambush point!

254
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,583
I want the First Unit
to go back and resupply!

255
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,583
My Ryusei-Go has enough
juice to run for a while!

256
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,458
Do you want me to go on ahead
and wait for the Second Unit?

257
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,666
No, wait. I've got another
job in mind for you.

258
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,833
Huh?

259
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,416
Here's the plan.

260
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,291
We'll start the search at
Master Iok's landing point

261
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,083
and work outwards from there.

262
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,333
[VIDAR] Let's split up. It'll
be more efficient that way.

263
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,708
[JULIETTA]
Sounds good.

264
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,416
[KUDELIA]
A Mobile Armor?

265
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,791
[HUSH]
Apparently, it's a monster

266
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:20,666
that killed a lot of people
in the Calamity War.

267
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,333
And they say it's
on its way here.

268
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,458
Orga's explaining it
to the city leaders.

269
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,416
He wants 'em to evacuate
all the residents.

270
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,458
You guys should leave, too.

271
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,541
Yeah, but... if we did,
where would we go?

272
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,791
I] I heard that
there's a shelter

273
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,666
not too far from the
outskirts of the city.

274
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,666
You're right, there
was one constructed

275
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,208
back when this area was
first being settled.

276
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,041
But even so, it's not
large enough to house

277
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,166
the entire city's population.

278
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,625
Well, in that case, you
really need to get moving!

279
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,833
[KUDELIA]
No.

280
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,750
I won't evacuate.

281
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,333
Miss Kudelia?

282
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:56,750
If I were to leave,

283
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,666
people who are less
fortunate than myself

284
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,500
would surely be left out.

285
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,250
I originally founded
the Admoss Company

286
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,833
as a way to help
those very people.

287
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,083
If I were the first to run away,

288
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:11,041
I doubt anyone would
trust me again.

289
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,333
Just as you and the others

290
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,000
always risk your
lives, Mikazuki,

291
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:20,083
I want to risk mine in order
to do my job properly.

292
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,916
In that case, I'm
not leaving either.

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,791
After all, the shop manager
and her family are here.

294
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,916
I can't just leave
you all and run.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,083
[KUDELIA]
Miss Atra...

296
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,583
But... Mr. Mikazuki!

297
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,583
All right, then.

298
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,000
[HUSH]
Huh?!

299
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,166
[ORGA]
What?

300
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,708
So then they're not gonna leave?

301
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,083
[MIKAZUKI]
Nope.

302
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:42,000
She said she's not evacuating
unless everyone can.

303
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,541
[ORGA]
Damn it.

304
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,583
Have they decided where
we're gonna ambush that bird?

305
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,375
[ORGA]
Yeah.

306
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,208
If it's comin' for Chryse,

307
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,583
then it'll have to
pass through here.

308
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,666
We'll attack it in this gorge.

309
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,458
[YUKINOJO] Hey, sorry to
keep you boys waiting!

310
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:03,250
Mr. Mikazuki! The Barbatos
Lupus, it's here!

311
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,458
Don't worry.
I'll stop that thing.

312
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,708
Countin' on ya,
Commando Unit Leader.

313
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,333
[YUKINOJO]
Okay, raise it up!

314
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,625
[MERRIBIT]
Boss.

315
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
This is yours.

316
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,083
Have we received any word
from Akihiro's group yet?

317
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,500
Make sure that he
keeps callin' out

318
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:30,291
that Mobile Armor's position!

319
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,125
As well as how the
plan is progressing!

320
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,666
[TEKKADAN MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

321
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,333
[MCGILLIS]
Well, well,

322
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,375
I never expected to
have to use this here.

323
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:41,208
The upgraded version
of the Grimgerde.

324
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,958
The Helmwige Reincar.

325
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:46,375
It wouldn't be wise for me
to pilot this machine,

326
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,208
given my sordid history with it.

327
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,916
Master it well.

328
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,958
[ISURUGI]
Sir!

329
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:55,458
[YAMAGI]
Wait a sec.

330
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,000
Those machines...

331
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,291
[ECO]
Huh?

332
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,875
[ECO]
Gjallarhorn's Mobile Suits?

333
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:04,708
[YAMAGI] Why are they at
a civilian spaceport?

334
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,000
[WORKER A] You guys are carryin'
around some scary cargo, too.

335
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,125
You're not attempting to start
a war or anything, are you?

336
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,000
[RIDE]
Whoa, look at all of 'em!

337
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,625
Is that the thing we're after?

338
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,291
[AKIHIRO] That's it, all right.
Don't get too close.

339
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,708
We're dead meat if it
detects our reactors.

340
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,708
[RIDE]
Huh...

341
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,500
It's moving slower
than I expected.

342
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,916
[AKIHIRO]
Yeah...

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Maybe it's tryin' to keep
pace with those sub units.

344
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,666
Send this data to HQ.

345
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,750
[RIDE]
Roger!

346
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,291
How nice.

347
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,458
This means we'll have plenty of
time to set up for the plan.

348
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,958
[beeping]

349
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,833
[AKIHIRO]
An attack?

350
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:42,916
[RIDE gasps]

351
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,166
[RIDE]
The Mobile Armor changed course!

352
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,208
[AKIHIRO]
Son of a--!

353
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,916
Who the hell is that
freakin' moron?!

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,625
Did you see?! That was
a blow for justice!

355
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,083
[ORGA] Even if everything
goes well in the gorge,

356
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,375
we're cutting it close on time.

357
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,041
I know McGillis is sending
in his Mobile Suits,

358
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,583
but how much good is
it really gonna do

359
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,375
against something
like that monster?

360
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,958
[MERRIBIT]
Boss!

361
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,375
We have a problem. The Mobile
Armor has changed its course.

362
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,791
It did what?

363
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,750
Apparently, someone has attacked
it from the southeast.

364
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,125
It's begun moving
in that direction!

365
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,625
From the southeast?

366
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,166
That means...

367
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,000
[gasps]

368
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,625
[ORGA] It's headed for
the agricultural plant.

369
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,000
Ride, wait!

370
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,375
[RIDE]
I'll get ahead of it

371
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,291
and try to make the workers
at the plant evacuate!

372
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,583
Got no choice.

373
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,875
We're gonna back him up!

374
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,125
[TEKKADAN MEMBERS]
Roger!

375
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,750
[MIKAZUKI]
It changed course?

376
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,041
[HUSH]
That's what they say.

377
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,166
The Second Unit is
responding as we speak.

378
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,541
Barbatos, heading out.

379
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,458
[HUSH]
Hey!

380
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:44,458
Don't you need
to tell the boss

381
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,833
before you take
action like that?!

382
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,500
[YUKINOJO]
It's fine.

383
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,625
He is the leader of the
Commando Unit, ya know.

384
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:57,041
[IOK laughing]

385
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,125
[IOK]
I did it... I actually did it!

386
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,416
It was an offering
to my men.

387
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,875
Because of their
steadfast loyalty,

388
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:10,250
I delivered a decisive blow
against that Mobile Armor.

389
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,750
[JULIETTA] Was that attack just
now from you, Master Iok?

390
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,458
[IOK]
J-Julietta?!

391
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,291
Did you see what I did?!

392
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,291
I retaliated against that beast!

393
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,291
Are you that much
of an idiot, sir?

394
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,000
From that range you wouldn't
have even made a scratch on it.

395
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,750
No! You're wrong!

396
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,958
That was the Reginlaze's
maximum power output!

397
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,208
[JULIETTA] If something like
that were enough to do the job,

398
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,541
Mobile Armors wouldn't be known

399
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,250
as the most savage
weapons of all time.

400
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,500
[JULIETTA]
What are you doing?

401
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,333
Go away!

402
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,833
My men laid down their lives

403
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,333
to provide me with
this opportunity!

404
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:50,125
You can't ask me to turn tail
and run without avenging them!

405
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,666
Oh, give it a rest already,

406
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,250
and just do what you're
told for once in your life!

407
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,541
[RIDE] Do we know how many
people are living at that plant?

408
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,125
[TEKKADAN MEMBER E]
According to the data, not many,

409
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,375
but none have evacuated yet.

410
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,333
[RIDE]
Understood!

411
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,666
[AKIHIRO] All right,
let's cover Ride's back!

412
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,125
Do whatever it takes
to make it focus on us!

413
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,958
[MEMBERS]
Yes, sir!

414
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,083
There's an update!

415
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,875
The Second Unit is
defending the plant!

416
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,916
[ORGA]
Tch!

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,333
Hey, Mika!

418
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,250
[MIKAZUKI]
I heard.

419
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,666
[ORGA] It's too late to change
the ambush point now.

420
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,708
You're gonna have
to do something

421
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,166
to get it back on
its old course.

422
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Got it.

423
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,875
[CHAD] Damn it! That thing
is completely ignoring us!

424
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,041
It's headed straight for the
area where there's more people!

425
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,416
My god... what is--?

426
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,125
Don't you even try it!

427
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,666
[RIDE]
Huh?!

428
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,750
What the heck's going on?!

429
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,375
[CHAD]
It's got...

430
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:12,541
...a beam weapon?

431
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,583
[AKIHIRO]
A what?!

432
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,166
Hey, is Ride gonna be okay?!

433
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,750
[CHAD]
It's an ancient weapon.

434
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,916
I'm sure the Mobile Suit's
Nanolaminate Armor

435
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,458
can handle it.

436
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:31,041

that thing just hit me with?

438
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,708
Huh?

439
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,458
[RIDE]
It can't be...

440
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,833
I tried to... protect them...

441

[AKIHIRO]
Hey, Ride!

442
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,333
You okay? Answer me!

00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,500

And why'd you have
to show up now?!

Mr. Mikazuki!

454
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,875
[MCGILLIS]
An unexpected change of course.

455
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,416
If we've learned
anything from this,

456
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,625
it's that things don't always
work out according to plan.

457
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,916
[ISURUGI]
I have to say,

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,166
it sounds like you're
having fun, sir.

[MCGILLIS]
Does it?

460
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,375
Even so, I can't say that
I'm particularly happy.

Unexpected pawn movements

462
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,583

Sorry to bust in
on you like this,

474
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,000
but I need your help!

475
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:35,791
I'll keep you safe and sound,
so hold on to something!


476
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,500
Or should I carry you in
my arms like a princess?
