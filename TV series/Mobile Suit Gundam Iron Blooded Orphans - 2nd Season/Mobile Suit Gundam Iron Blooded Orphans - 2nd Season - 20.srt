We've wandered pretty far
from the front lines.

Let's head to the Isaribi!

5
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,791
[DANTE]
I wonder how the battle's going.

[CHAD]
Not well, obviously!

Enemy fire is being focused

and trying to divide it.

15

It's the obvious strategy,

16
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,541
as we have them outnumbered.

Just disregard
the cannon fodder.

Our only target
here is Tekkadan!

We just have to
finish this fight!

with this cutthroat world!

After that, you can have girls,
money, or anything else!

We've divided the enemy fleet!

[RUSTAL] Continue concentrating
fire on the Revolutionary Fleet.

44
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,125
We can leave Tekkadan
to Julietta and her team.

You should get ready to fight
'cause I'm your opponent!

You know better than anyone

how strong that machine is.

After all, you saw how it
defeated the Mobile Armor.

And that's precisely
why I'm asking you.

161
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:20,750
[EUGENE]
Roger that!

162
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,500
We need to get movin', too!

163
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,625
Control the damage on
the ship and prepare

164
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,333
to resupply the Mobile Suits!

165
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,583
Everyone else,

166
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,291
get ready to receive the
crew from the Hotarubi!

167
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,583
[ORGA]
Don't stop moving now, guys.

168
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,291
This battle isn't over yet.

169
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:39,000
[RUSTAL] Dáinsleif team,
stand by in firing position.

170
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,875
[RUSTAL]
Tell me something, Iok.

171
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,250
Do you have any idea why I don't
attack the Outer Earth Orbit

172
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,500
Regulatory Joint Fleet?

173
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,291
No, sir.

174
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,125
[RUSTAL] While it's true they're
acting under McGillis' orders,

175
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,875
they are not
revolutionary soldiers.

176
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,083
If we're able to
decimate Tekkadan,

177
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,000
the Revolutionary Fleet,
and McGillis himself--

178
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,041
they would revert back
to being obedient sheep

179
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,583
before you could blink.

180
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,708
What kind of a fool would I be

181
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,291
to waste potential
military assets?

182
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,500
Wow, he's thinking about
what happens after the battle!

183
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:15,458
[RUSTAL] So, what's your
next move, McGillis Fareed?

184
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,875
If you had any brains
you would consider

185
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,166
surrendering immediately.

186
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,958
[RUSTAL]
However... If you are a fool...


187
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,541
[ATRA]
Don't panic!

188
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,125
If you're injured,
please let someone know!

189
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,041
Any who are able,
man the same station

190
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,958
you would on the Hotarubi!

191
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,083
[EUGENE]
Bunch of idiots...

192
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,291
Checking out this close to end.

193
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,333
[CHAD] Sorry, guys,
but this is the best

194
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,458
that we can do
for ya right now.

195
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,958
We will avenge you.

196
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,375
That's right. Count on it.

197
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,166
[YUKINOJO]
It's full over here!

198
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,750
You can resupply at
Gjallerhorn's ships, too!

199
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,708
If you're in a rush, your
best bet is to head there!

200
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:00,833
Shino!

201
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,833
[gasps]

202
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:04,166
[YAMAGI]
No...

203
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,750
Shino? Shino!

204
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:10,083
[screams] Yamagi, my arm
is broken right there!

205
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
Thank goodness.
I thought you were...

206
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,166
[SHINO] Hey, man, don't
write me off just yet!

207
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,125
But you have got
some good timing.

208
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,708
Yamagi, that thing
I asked you for,

209
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,125
did you bring it with you?

210
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,375
Uh...

211
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,666
Are you out of your mind?!

212
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,166
You can't even move your arm!

213
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,625
Besides that,
Flauros is already--

214
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,166
It's Ryusei-Go.

215
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,500
If we back down, then we're
throwing away everything.

216
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,333
Everything we've gone through
and everything Orga's told us.

217
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:40,333
I'm begging you, Yamagi.

218
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:43,208
This is something that
only you can do for me.

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,291
Have you heard anything
from the engine room?

220
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,750
[ORGA] Done transferring
the crew from the Hotarubi?

221
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,083
[EUGENE] Yeah, we were the
last ones to get outa there.

222
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,083
And the Hotarubi?

223
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,875
The weapons control is done for.

224
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,583
Propulsion's at 70 percent.

225
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:56,958
If we flew it remotely,

226
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,250
it could be a shield
for the Isaribi.

227
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,291
All right, well what
do we do now, Orga?

228
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,875
Well, I still haven't heard
anything from McGillis, yet,

229
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,208
and our forces have
been ripped to shreds.

230
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,125
We should probably fall back
for now and try again--

231
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,250
[EUGENE]
Where exactly would we go?

232
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,125
[gasps]

233
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,833
Unless we win this here and now,

234
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,375
there won't be anywhere
for us to go back to, right?

235
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,916
That's true.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,583
If this is our last battle,
let's see it through to the end.

237
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:21,333
Listen, guys.

238
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:22,458
[door hums]

239
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,333
[SHINO]
They're right.

240
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:26,125
[ORGA]
Shino, your arm!

241
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,750
Nothin' to worry about.

242
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,041
I'm not backin' down until
I give those bastards

243
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,250
a taste of their own medicine!

244
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,458
What do you mean?

245
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,625
I mean my Super Galaxy Cannon

246
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,750
is finally gonna
see some action!

247
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,333
[ORGA, EUGENE, CHAD, DANTE]
Super Galaxy?!

248
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,750
[YAMAGI]
Listen, Shino. Flauros is--

249
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,583
[SHINO]
Ryusei-Go!

250
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,458
[YAMAGI] They took the
Mobile Suit frame materials

251
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,333
that are used at
Teiwaz and built this

252
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,875
according to the data
I found in Ryusei-Go.

253
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,375
It's a genuine Dáinsleif.

254
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,375
And by the way,
you only get one shot.

255
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:05,833
Even so, with this and
Ryuwei-Go's reactor output,

256
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,125
you can punch through
a warship's armored hull.

257
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,708
That's totally awesome, Yamagi.

258
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:13,083
Once all of this is over,
I'll take you to a place

259
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:14,666
with lots of pretty girls.

260
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,708
And it's on me!

261
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,708
[YAMAGI]
You should go by yourself.

262
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,625
Now, don't be like that.

263
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,375
You're so uptight
sometimes, you know?

264
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,291
Fine.

265
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,958
Then how about we stay up
and drink the night away?

266
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,375
[gasps]

267
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,291
[YAMAGI]
This isn't a joke.

268
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,291
I'm worried about you.

269
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,750
[YAMAGI]
Why would you...?

270
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,791
[ORGA] You're gonna
charge the enemy fleet?

271
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,416
Have you gone insane?

272
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,750
[SHINO]
Sure have!

273
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,541
It's time to end the show
you've put on for us.

274
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,625
And I'll be the one to
bring down the curtain.

275
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,625
Just take out the enemy's
boss, and run like hell.

276
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,041
If you can do that,
this fight'll be over.

277
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,041
Sounds short, sweet,
and to the point.

278
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,458
That's our kind of plan.

279
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,166
You sure about this?

280
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,458
[SHINO]
Hey, Boss.

281
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,791
No, Orga.

282
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,333
The finish line of
the path you've been

283
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,041
leading us down all this time

284
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,333
is closer than
ever before, right?

285
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,708
We just need to finally see it.

286
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,791
We can do this if we
just stick together.

287
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,083
[ORGA]
Yeah. You're right.

288
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,416
Couldn't have said
it better myself.

289
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,916
We're almost at the finish line.

290
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,291
So let's do it.

291
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,500
Let's get there together!

292
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,541
[MIKAZUKI] We're charging
the enemy fleet then?

293
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,750
[ORGA]
Yeah.

294
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,166
Would you mind clearing
a path for us, Mika?

295
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,541
Will do.

296
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,333
If you give the order,
then consider it done!

297
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,708
[ORGA]
This'll be my last request.

298
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,208
[ZACK] Have you guys
heard what's going on?!

299
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,458
This ship's gonna charge
into the enemy fleet!

300
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,833
I guess, it's finally time.

301
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,750
They must wanna finish
this in one go.

302
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,958
You idiots!

303
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't you realize if
we do that we'll die?!

304
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,000
What the hell are the Boss

305
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,958
and those other
maniacs thinking?!

306
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,083
[YUKINOJO] Once they set
their minds on something,

307
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,333
nothing in the world
can stop 'em.

308
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:10,791
Whaddya say we give
'em the support

309
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,833
they need and hope it
all turns out all right.

310
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,333
[HUSH]
Okay, let's get to work!

311
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,833
[DANE]
Right.

312
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,291
[ATRA yelps]

313
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,875
[ATRA]
Mikazuki...

314
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,583
[REVOLUTION SOLDIER 45A]
Liza was killed in action?

315
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,583
[REVOLUTION SOLDIER 45B] So
what's gonna happen to us now?

316

You must never allow the flame

319
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,333
of your noble ideals
to be extinguished!

320

Always remember one thing.

321
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:41,583
The will of Agnika
Kaieru is with us!

322
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,500
We will have the truth
of Gjallarhorn on our side.

323
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:49,583
Now, men...

324
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,375
...rally around Bael!

325
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,458
Look, it's Bael!

326
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,875
It houses the soul
of Awgnika Kaieru!

[REVOLUTION SOLDIER 45E]
He's right...

[REVOLUTION SOLDIERS cheer]

All right, that's more like it.

332
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:10,041
[GAELIO] Even though you're
losing this battle,

333
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:12,333
you're still playing
the Pied Piper,

334

This Ahab Wave...

337
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,500
Your true Kimaris?

338
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,791
[GAELIO] I honestly pity
those young officers.

339
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:33,416
It's almost like seeing
reflections of my former self.

340
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,000
[MCGILLIS]
Hmph.

341
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,041
We'll hold him off, sir.

342
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,041
Please, General, go and gather
our remaining forces.

343
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,708
[MCGILLIS]
He's all yours.

344
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,000
[GAELIO] Why are you
so loyal to McGillis?

345
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,833
That man doesn't
think of you as friend

346
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,333
or even a comrade.

347
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,083
That's fine, as I
don't want such

348
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:59,291
a sentimental relationship
with the General!

349
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,375
He's a man who would use

350
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,291
even a woman who
loved him as a tool!

351
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,500
There is only one
thing that I wish for!

352
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,833
To see the kind of future
the General will create!

353
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,375
And if my life can help
lay its foundation,

354
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,333
I could wish for
no greater honor!

355
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,250
To think humans are
capable of such folly!

356
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,166
[MCGILLIS]
Listen up!

357
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,625
Gather as many remaining
soldiers as you can

358
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,250
and rendezvous at my ship!

359

[MCGILLIS gasps]

362

[RUSTAL]
Since you've proven yourself

363
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,125
to be a fool who
won't surrender...

Keep them in check.

[SOLDIER 45D] Commander, it
looks like Tekkadan's ship

So, this is the
illustrious Tekkadan?

374
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,750
The cornered rat bites the cat.

375
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,750
And these space rats are
about to get their due.

376
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,958
I want all ships
to fire on Tekkadan!

you're talkin' to?

I mean, compared to
what you're saying,

the Arianrhod fleet
isn't that scary at all.
