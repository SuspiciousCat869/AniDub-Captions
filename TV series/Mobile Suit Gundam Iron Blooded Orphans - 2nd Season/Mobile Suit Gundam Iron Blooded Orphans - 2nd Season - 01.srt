[ORGA] Yeah... It's almost
time to leave for Saisei.

3
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,500
Once we drink to pledge our
loyalty to Teiwaz at the

4
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:33,833
sakazuki ceremony, we'll be
on equal footing with Naze.

5
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,083
A Teiwaz subsidiary.

6
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,833
[ORGA] A farm this size
won't be able to pull in

7
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:43,125

[ORGA] Eventually... we'll go
completely legit.

10
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:56,416
But Until that day...
we go all-in.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll take the shortest route
possible to make that dream

12
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,083
a reality.

13
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,166
There's no time to hesitate.

14
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,250
[ORGA] Do you think...
that Biscuit have stopped me?

15
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,375
[MIKAZUKI]
I honestly don't know.

16
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:13,583
[ORGA]
Hm.

17
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,250
[MIKAZUKI]
That being said...

18
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:18,250
if you're not stopping,
then neither am I.

[ORGA]
Sun's up.

22
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,500
[ATRA] Mr. Makanai had become
Prime Minister of Arbrau,

23
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,333
and thanks to Gjallarhorn's
corruption being exposed,

24
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,291
the world had finally changed.

25
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,000
It was slow, but progress
was happening.

26
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,166
[ATRA]
Tekkadan.

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,458
They were thrust into the
spotlight during the fighting

28
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,916
surrounding the prime
minister election,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,375
And after offering half-metal
mining rights as a gift,

30
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:03,166
they became a direct
Teiwaz subsidiary.

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,416
In order to strengthen Arbrau's
defenses that had been dependent

32
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,708
on Gjallarhorn, Tekkadan was
made an official military

33
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:12,166
advisor with a branch on Earth.

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,625
Their heroic deeds during
the turmoil were recognized,

35
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,500
and they became a
promising company,

36
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,583
with a slew of envious rivals.

37
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,625
Their biggest ally,
Miss Kudelia,

38
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:25,958
partnered with Teiwaz to
establish the Admoss Company.

39
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,791
Its purpose was
to mine, process,

40
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,666
and ship the half-metal
of Arbrau's colonies.

41
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,333
In addition to that,
she also worked closely with

42
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:38,125
Tekkadan to open an orphanage
at the Sakura Farm.

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,291
Miss Kudelia has done
everything in her power

44
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,541
to help the socially vulnerable

45
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:45,416
and realize Mars'
economic independence.

46
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,500
[ATRA]
In contrast,

47
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,583
Gjallarhorn lost
the public's trust,

48
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,000
which resulted in even
further deterioration of

49
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:58,208
law and order around the world.

50
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,875
And, unfortunately,
during the conflict,

51
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,958
Tekkadan proved the
value of child soldiers.

52
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:06,666
Masses of children
have been sent to war

53
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,250
and the number of
Human Debris has grown.

54
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,791
And Mobile Suits were
once again recognized

55
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,083
for their military value.

56
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,166
Every country has begun to
restore and upgrade Suits

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,916
from the Calamity War.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,208
The number of Mobile Suits
has since rapidly increased.

[MIKAZUKI grunts]

60
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,750

children are exploited...

has to take that risk.

156
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,791
[ZACK]
Ah...

157
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,166
[SHINO chuckles]

158
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,625
Okay then, I hope you
slackers are all rested up,

159
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,750
because I think another
ten-lap run is in order!

160
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,958
Huh?!

161
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,500
[SHINO]
All right, men, get going!

162
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:28,250
[NEW MEMBER B]
Ten laps?

163
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,625
[SHINO]
Gotta say...

164
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,750
...that was a real nice
speech you gave, Deputy Boss.

165
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,125
So about Orga...

166
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,375
[SHINO]
Hm?

167
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,458
The boss is doin' work
that's not fit for him,

168
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,083
so I have to do my
part to help out.

169
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,458
[SHINO]
I know what you mean.

170
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,291
[ORGA]
Hey, I hate to break it to you,

171
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,791
but these numbers aren't right.

172
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,750
[NEW Member C]
Oh, uh, sorry, Sir.

173
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,666
[ORGA]
The other two are good to go.

174
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,625
[DEXTER]
Yes. Thank you sir.

175
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,833
You have a call from
Mr. Naze on the QCCS--

176
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,583
[ORGA] Brother?!
Thanks for, uh, tellin' me.

177
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,125
I'll take it in the other room.

178
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:02,041
[MERRIBIT]
Sure.

179
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,625
[ORGA]
Oh, and one more thing.

180
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,791
Don't forget to send flowers
to the Eizen Company

181
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,041
for their new office.

182
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,291
[NEW MEMBER C]
Will do, sir!

183
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,583
The boss sure is working
really hard, isn't he?

184
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,375
It wasn't too long
ago that he hated

185
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,291
sitting behind a desk all day.

186
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,250
Indeed. Times have changed.

187
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,041
[NAZE]
So, Orga... how's it going?

188
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,750
[ORGA]
It's goin alright, I guess.

189
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,375
[NAZE]
Oh, come now.

190
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,291
You're the hero that brought
half-metal to Teiwaz.

191
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,291
A very lucrative deal.

192
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,416
Though, I suppose, some might
view that with a bit more envy.

193
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,833
[ORGA]
Right.

194
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:34,333
We're in the same boat.

195
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:37,000
See, everyone hates
young upstarts,

196
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,333
no matter who they are.

197
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,541
[ORGA] Our rank is way
below the Turbines,

198
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,541
which control Teiwaz's
entire transport network.

199
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,916
We're only recognized for
our strength.

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,291
If we hadn't
overpowered Gjallarhorn.,

201
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,583
we wouldn't get the time of day.

202
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,416
Ya not satisfied?

203
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,458
[ORGA] No, you guys know
I'm grateful beyond words.

204
00:08:56,541 --> 00:09:00,125
You got us Teiwaz's latest
Mobile Suits at a bargain.

205
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,333
And besides that, you're working
on our two Gundam Frames,

206
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,916
Barbatos and Gusion, for free.

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,833
Honestly, grateful is
an understatement.

208
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,666
That being so... we have no
intention of stopping just yet.

209
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,333
[NAZE chuckles]
Cheers then.

210
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:19,125
I'm looking forward to what you
have planned, Blood Brother.

211
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,458
[ALLIUM] You, my dear,
have made us very proud.

212
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,416
You've no idea how glad I am
that I granted you time to

213
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,458
speak at the
Naochis July Assembly

214
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,958
when you were still an unknown.

215
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,333
Kudelia Aina Bernstein,
Maiden of the Revolution.

216
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,208
Thank you for allowing me
to speak to the assembly,

217
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,041
Mr. Gyojan.

218
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,458
Not a problem.

219
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,333
Now, we have a lot of work
to do, so let's get to it.

220
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,375
The first order of
business involves another

221
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,750
mass meeting that I'm
holding next month.

222
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,625
The location will be Chryse.

223
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,000
I'd love for you
to give a ta--

224
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:52,958
Forgive me, Mr. Gyojan,
but for the time being,

225
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm refraining from
speaking publicly.

226
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,416
[ALLIUM]
Hm...

227
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,958
I understand.
For the time being.

228
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,208
[KUDELIA gasps]

229
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,958
[ALLIUM] Correct me if
I'm wrong, Miss Kudelia,

230
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,958
but I've heard you're
going to invite people

231
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,750
from other colonies
to tour around

232
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,791
your half-metal mines
at the end of this month.

233
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,333
Where did you
hear about that--?

234
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,791
[ALLIUM] I'll assist you.
After all, your tour could

235
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:18,708
benefit from the help of a
noted intellectual from Chryse.

236
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,125
[KUDELIA]
Sorry?

237
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,166
[ALLIUM] Well, it's clear that
your original philosophy

238
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,083
was greatly influenced by mine.

239
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,333
Naturally, if I
stood by your side,

240
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:29,458
I'd be able to offer
some assistance.

241
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,708

--[knocking]
--[CUCUBITA] Excuse me.

243
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,041

your next appointment,

244
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,416

[ALLIUM] How dare you?
We're in the middle of a--!

246
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,166
[KUDELIA] Thank you, Cucubita.

[KUDELIA]
Mr. Gyojan...

249
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,291
Respectfully,
I decline your offer.

250
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,875
[ALLIUM gasps]

251
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,791
[KUDELIA] My current activities
don't require anything as lofty

252
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:50,375
as philosophy.

253
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,833
Nowadays, as sad as it is,
words will get you nowhere.

254
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,416
[ALLIUM grunts]

255
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,833
[CUCUBITA] At this point, his
organization, Terra Liberionis,

256
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,541
is virtually hanging
on by a thread.

257
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,791
It seems he wanted one
last shot at the limelight

258
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,125
by using your fame. Ha, ha.

259
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:12,708
like there's a chance
in hell of that working.

260
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,083
Even so... He knew all
about the mine tour.

261
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,166
[CUCUBITA]
Huh?

262
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,666
[KUDELIA] We shouldn't take him
lightly.

263
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,333
[DRIVER]
How did she react?

264
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,083
[ALLIUM] 
Unacceptably.

265
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,333
[DRIVER]
Then...

266
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,416
Get in touch with
you-know-who immediately.

267
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,416
We need to reach out
to Tekkadan, right away.

268
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,750
[CLASSMATE A]
Seriously?

269
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,333
Tekkadan is actually coming
here to pick you up?

270
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,500
Yeah, probably.

271
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,958
Definitely!

272
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,166
I'm sure they're coming,
especially since their brother

273
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,416
was one of Tekkadan's
bravest soldiers

274
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,708
and died a heroic
death for Mars!

275
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,833
[CLASSMATE C]
He was so brave!

276
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,041
[CLASSMATE D]
So cool!

277
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,583
[CLASSMATE C] I wish
I could join Tekkadan.

So tell me,

00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,041
have you gotten used
to the new dorm, yet?

They're all rich kids, from
what everyone tells me.

288
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,625
Do they bully you?

No, not at all.

I can read harder books
than you now, Mikazuki.

310
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,125
[MIKAZUKI sighs]

311
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,583
[BYSTANDER A]
Another terrorist attack?

312
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,625
[BYSTANDER B]
Why isn't Gjallarhorn

313
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,291
doing something about it?

314
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:09,833
[ORGA]
How were the twins?

315
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,416
[MIKAZUKI]
They're doing real good.

316
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,541
[ORGA]
Glad to hear it.

317
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,666
[MIKAZUKI]
So...?

318
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,125
[ORGA]
First thing tomorrow,

319
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,666
I want you and Pops
to go get the Barbatos.

320
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,916
Roger that.

321
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,291
Is that it.
Not gonna ask me why?

322
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,458
[MIKAZUKI]
Work, right?

323
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,291
[ORGA chuckles]

324
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,000
[ORGA] It's for Kudelia's
job in two weeks.

325
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,708
Something's fishy about it.

326
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,625
I'm not sure it'll
be on time, but...

327
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,000
[MIKAZUKI]
Leave it to me.

328
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:35,916
[ORGA]
Hm?

329
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,458
Don't worry I'll make it.

330
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,833
Anything that you
order me to, Orga.

331
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,750
[ORGA] Right. Then I'm
countin on you,

332
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,750
Commando Unit Leader.


333
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,708
[ORGA]
All right, listen up, everyone.

334
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,458
Next weekend, Admoss Company is
holding a tour of the mines.

335
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,875
And so...

336
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,083
[EUGENE] So that means
our next mission is gonna be

337
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,041
escorting the visitors
during the tour.

338
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,583
[ZACK] W-Wait, you mean,
with the princess?

339
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,625
[SHINO]
Huh? Who's the princess?

340
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,375
Miss Kudelia, of course.
Doesn't everyone know that?

341
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,041
[SHINO]
Huh?

342
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,500
[EUGENE]
Listen up.

343
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,416
This'll be your first
time on the battlefield.

344
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,833
[ALL gasp]

345
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,750
[HUSH]
My first time out...

346
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,458
All of you will be joining
Akihiro's Second Unit

347
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,666
and piloting Mobile Workers.

348
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,083
[AKIHIRO]
Hm. Uh... Listen--

349
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,083
Listen up, maggots!
This isn't training!

350
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,625
So look alive out there!

351
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,666
The Second Unit is
not for pushovers!

352
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,708
[NEW MEMBERS]
Yes sir!

353
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,041
[HUSH]
Finally...

354
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,375
[GALLUS] You've done a
great job reorganizing the

355
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,041
Outer Earth Orbit
Regulatory Joint Fleet,

356
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,583
and regrouping our Earth
activities that were made

357
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,625
difficult after the
Arbrau incident.

358
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,916
What's more, you've also
built new ties


359
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,500
with each economic bloc.
Brilliant work, McGillis Fareed,


360
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,125
new fleet commander and
Fareed family patriarch.

361
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,875
No, no, any success on my part
was due to the help of everyone.


362
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:55,416
[ELEK]
Oh, pish posh...


363
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,583
because of you The Outer Earth
Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet


364
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,541
won't just be a piece of
ceremonial decoration.


365
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,458
You're giving me far more
credit than I deserve.


366
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,208
I'm merely following in the
footsteps of my predecessor,


367
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,208
Carta Issue.


368
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:13,541
Morever, I carry a tremendous
burden from my past.


369
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,708
[IOK gasps]


370
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,125
[IOK]
Burden?

371
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,791
And as you may know, while in
the Inspection Bureau,

372
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,333
I directly exposed a
great deal of corruption

373
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,041
within the Mars Branch.

374
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,458
But as a result, the Mars
Branch was weakened.

375
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,458
It's regrettable to say,
but that area has now become

376
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,541
lawless and pirates have
begun to dominate the region.

377
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,833
Although it was my aim
with the Mars Branch to

378
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,583
carry out justice, I'm the one
who caused this problem.

379
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,708
As such, I would like your
permission to resolve this

380
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,041
matter personally.

381
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,625
That being said I request
that you authorize my

382
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:48,375
Outer Earth Orbit Regulatory
Joint Fleet to intervene

383
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,833
within Mars territory,
in order--

384
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,458
Impossible! That would
be trampling on the

385
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,958
responsibilities of
Lord Elion's Fleet.

386
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,333
[GALLUS]
Please, Lord Kujan!

387
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,333
[IOK] Is it not our duty to
maintain law and order

388
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,500
in the outer spheres?

389
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,375
You must maintain composure.

390
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,083
[RUSTAL laughs]

391
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,333
[RUSTAL] I think it's a
fine thing to see a youth

392
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,458
with such passion in his heart!

393
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,541
Master Rust--Apologies,
I mean Lord Elion...

394
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,291
[RUSTAL] Lord Kujan,
the reason for Gjallarhorn's

395
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,125
very existence is to
maintain order in the world.

396
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,583
To be perfectly frank with you,

397
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:21,666
who ends up doing that job
is of little consequence.

398
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,500
What is most important is
that we continue to have

399
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,333
the power necessary to
maintain peace and order.

400
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,000
[JULIETTA]
Master Rustal.

401
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,208
[RUSTAL]
Hm?

402
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,750
There you are.

403
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,875
Sorry to keep you, Julieta.

404
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,375
So how did it go?

405
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,791
Actually...

406
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,666
[JULIETTA grunts]

407
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,750
[JULIETTA] ...that's something
of a silly question.

408
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,750
Master Iok's face tells me
everything that I need to know.

409
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,500
[IOK grunts] What's that
supposed to mean--

410
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:50,708
It was very interesting.
McGillis was looking for

411
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,708
an opportunity to let the Outer
Earth Orbit Regulatory Joint

412
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:56,083
Fleet operate in
the Outer Spheres.

413
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,125
It would appear he's
set on using Mars

414
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,750
as a starting base
to attain that goal.

415
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,625
Master Rustal, if you understood
so much of his plan, why didn--

416
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,041
[RUSTAL] Have you forgotten?
I'm the commander of

417
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,458
Gjallarhorn's strongest Fleet,
the great Arianrhod,

418
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,500
Outer Lunar Orbit Joint Fleet.

419
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,416
If it's a challenge he wants,
then I'll accept it head on.

420
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,875
[IOK chuckles nervously]

421
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,125
[RUSTAL]
Who wants some meat?

422
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,083
[JULIETTA]
Meat? That's my favorite!

423
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,750
[IOK gasps]
Mine too!

424
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,208
[ISURUGI] How do you
think Mars will respond?

425
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,458
[MCGILLIS]
Don't worry.

426
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,458
The provisional commander
of the Mars Branch

427
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:30,583
is a man I nominated while
at the Inspection Bureau.

428
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,125
[ISURUGI]
I see.

429
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,708
[MCGILLIS] Also, I have
an associate on Mars

430
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:37,166
whom I trust implicitly.

431
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,291
A friend, I take it, sir?

432
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,541
[MCGILLIS] Isurugi you
should know by now.

433
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,625
I no longer have friends.

434
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:50,000
[HUSH] I thought we came out
here to fight a real battle.

435
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,583
I know, right?

436
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,291
We've already been here for a
week and all we've done so far,

437
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,500
is escort some VIPs during
the day and take turns

438
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,333
patrolling the area at night.

439
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,833
[MAIL] We're gonna have
to go home tomorrow

440
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,833
without seeing any action.

441
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,750
[ZACK] But the princess
sure was pretty, though.

442
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,500
[HUSH]
Huh?

443
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,833
[MAIL]
Yeah, she was.

444
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,958
[ZACK gasps]

445
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,541
All right, man your positions,
on the double!

446
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,583
[ZACK]
Huh?

447
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:15,166
[RIDE] We got a
call from the Boss.

448
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,541
What did he say to you?

449
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,250
The enemy's coming. Let's move!

450
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,708
[HUSH chuckles]

451
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,291
[KUDELIA] It's awfully late,
isn't it? What's going on?

452
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,416
[ORGA]
Where are your guests?

453
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,750
[KUDELIA gasps]

454
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,708
They're having a meeting
about tomorrow' last tour.

455
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,375
[ORGA] Sorry, but we're
gonna have to cancel that.

456
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,791
[KUDELIA gasps]

457
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,125
Right now, we're focusing
on the Dawn Horizon Corps.

458
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,833
It seems they landed on
Mars three days ago.

459
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,875
Dawn Horizon?

460
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,250
Yeah, they're pirates.

461
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,208
They have ten ships and
twenty-five hundred members.

462
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,458
They're a massive group that
even Teiwaz has trouble with.

463
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,000
