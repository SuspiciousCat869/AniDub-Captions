It doesn't matter.

In order to reestablish peace

00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,625
in the Earth Sphere, we
of the Arianrhod Fleet


26
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:11,208
are announcing that we will
launch a mop-up operation


27
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:13,916
against both the traitor,
McGillis Fareed,

who took up arms
against the Seven Stars,

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,208
and Tekkadan, the armed
organization that's aiding him.

30
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,916
We've already surrounded
Tekkadan's headquarters on Mars

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,041
and have issued
calls for their surrender,

but they have yet to respond.

Whatever it is
Orga decides to do,

00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,583
is what I want to do.

52
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,083
[CHAD] All our communication
cables have been cut.

53
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,666
And they shoot down
our LCS drones

as soon as we launch them.

If we can't use the QCCS either,

56
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,500
it'll be impossible to get any
information from the outside

much less contact Mr. Makanai.

Gjallarhorn might be sittin'
tight for the time being,

but they could attack us
any minute now.

go after them first, then?

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,208
Our only option
is to run, so we run.

67
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,041
Haven't you heard
anything we've said?

68
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,291
Even if we managed
to get away from them

69
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,750
we'd be on the run
till the day we died.

70

[ORGA] As long as we make it
out of here, we win.

71
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,291
After that,
we'll destroy this place

72
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,375

we were wiped out.

Yeah. All we gotta do is
make them believe that we died.

We'll call Old Makanai after
that so he can help us out.

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,083
Good idea. That way,
they won't keep looking for us.

--Let's do it.
--[EUGENE] That's impossible.

a way to do just that.

81
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,375
If I'm remembering correctly,

82
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,375
there were old power cables
running under the base

83
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,083
that date back all the way
to the Calamity War.

84
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,083
So, if those tunnels
are still down there,

85
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,708
we could use them to make
our escape to Chryse.

Do you think
that's even possible?

is what's gonna beat them.

Yeah, that's true.
But he is starting to act

102
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,666
like the old Orga again.

103
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,041

I thought so, too.

104

for some reason.

[AKIHIRO]
Hm.

106
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,541
[EUGENE] You know, I said
something to Orga once.

107
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,666
That nobody here seriously
thought doing what he said

108
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,500
was gonna be a sure thing.

109
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,583
I meant it, but it was
only half true.

110
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,833
[CHAD]
Huh?

111
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:05,458
'Cause you can't help

Right.

117
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,958
[MCGILLIS]
I see. So you're making the call

118
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,250
to sneak away from here.

119
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,750
The Tekkadan I know
would never back down.

120
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,125
You would just
fight without giving it

121
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,041
so much as a second thought.

122
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,125
[ORGA]
We're not dumb enough

123
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,375
to get into a conflict
we can't win.

124
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,541
We have a different
battle to fight.

125
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,833
A different battle, you say?

126
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,500
And what exactly is it
that you're hoping

127
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,666
to get out of that battle?

128
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,166
[ORGA]
The only thing I want

129
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,083
is for all of us to be alive
at the end of it.

130
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,875
We'd use whatever
was at our disposal.

131
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,458
And put our heads together
to figure out

132
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,208
what our next move should be.

133
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,208
That's how we always managed it.

134
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,166
I'm not sure when,
but I lost sight of that.

135
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,083
A rather pointless realization,
don't you think?

136
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,208
[ORGA] You can call it
whatever you want.

137
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,708
It's not pointless, though...
if I'm with my buddies.

Hey Orga, we found the tunnel!

140
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,708
Are you serious?!

141
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,583
[YUKINOJO] Yeah, but I gotta
say it's seen better days.

142
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,625
We can't just haul off
and blast it.

143
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,208
We're gonna have to dig
through this mess by hand.

144
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,208
Fine, grab anyone who's free
and get to work right away.

145

[YUKINOJO]
Got it. Oh, and one more thing.

146
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,250
Some of these cables still
seem to be in working order.

147
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,833
If the terminal on
the Chryse side is functional,

148
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:31,833
it should be possible to get
a call through to the outside.

149
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,916
Understood. All right.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,375
Let's start by clearing out
that tunnel A-SAP.

--[YUKINOJO] Roger that.
--[radio clicks]

152

If it turns out we can't
leave anytime soon,

153
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:43,125
then I'd like to at least
try and get the word out

154
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:46,416
to Old Man Makanai so he has an
idea of what we're planning.

155
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,375
You're saying you want
to contact Earth?

156
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,458
[ORGA] Yeah. And if we
could make it to Chryse,

157
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,958
there's also
Kudelia's Admoss Company.

158
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,291
We could make things
work over there.

159
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:59,041
But... with us
surrounded like this...

160
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,166
If it were just a few men,
you might actually have a shot

161
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,458
at temporarily breaking
through their blockade.

162
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:05,666
[ORGA]
Huh?

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,083
[MCGILLIS] I'm heading out.
I'll find a way

164
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,750
to break through Gjallarhorn's
blockade on my own.

165
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,791
What?

166
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,125
[MCGILLIS]
By going out there,

167
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,791
it'll focus all of
their attention on me.

168
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,125
While they're distracted,

169
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,458
it should be possible
for you to escape.

170
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,125
You'd actually do that for us?

171
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,958
[MCGILLIS]
Don't misunderstand.

172
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,625
I'm just taking
the necessary steps

173
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:27,458
to ensure my objective
is realized.

174
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,708
Whether you use that
to your advantage or not

175
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,791
is of no concern to me.

176
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:32,916
But you'll--

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,750
As a matter of fact,
your strategy is

178
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,208
quite beneficial
to my goal, as well.

179
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,375
By making it appear
as though you're still here,

180
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,333
we'll have a chance to lure
Rustal Elion into a trap.

181
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:47,916
You see, I plan on
using <i>you</i> to destroy <i>him</i> .

182
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,083
--[computer beeping]
--[ORGA] Listen, Chad.

183
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,125
Have Ride get a car
prepared for us.

184
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:58,125
We're heading to
the Admoss Company.

185
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,500
[CHAD]
What? But how?

186
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,000
[ORGA]
We have a way to get through.

187
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,291
We're taking Kudelia
and Atra along with us.

188
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,791
Go get them right away.

189
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,166
There's not much time,
so do it now!

190
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,833
[ATRA]
I'm not going with you.

191
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,083
[KUDELIA]
Miss Atra...

192
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:13,291
[CHAD] This will be
a battleground soon.

193
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,875
Trust me when I say
it's safer for you

194
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,333
to leave with Miss Kudelia.

195
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,291
[ATRA] But I... I don't want
to leave Mikazuki

196
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,250
and everyone else behind.

197
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,625
There's no time
to debate this, Atra.

198
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,583
[ATRA]
I know, but I...

199
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,375
Come on, Miss Atra.

200
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,958
[KUDELIA]
Let's go. Together.

201
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,333
After all, I made
a promise to Mikazuki

202
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,208
to watch over you
and your child.

203
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,875
--[CHAD] Uh.
--Wait, Atra's pregnant?

204
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,875
[KUDELIA]
So please, Miss Atra.

205
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,041
Help me keep the promise
that I made to Mikazuki.

206
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,750
My promise to the man I love.

207
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,333
[ATRA gasps]

208
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,791
[ATRA]
Okay...

209
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,041
You should probably go pack
and get ready, then.

210
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,583
[KUDELIA]
What about you, Ms. Merribit?

211
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,250
I still have quite
a bit of work to do,

212
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,666
so I'll be staying here.

213
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,958
[KUDELIA]
But you...

214
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:07,250
Please don't worry.
I'm sure we'll meet again.

215
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:08,958
The iron flower
known as Tekkadan

216
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,416
won't wither and die
that easily.

217
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,708
[MCGILLIS]
Barbatos Lupus Rex.

218
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,750
The king of the wolves.
What a valiant name.

219
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,583
Why are you dressed like that?

220
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,791
Going somewhere?

221
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,958
I am.

222
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:28,291
Mikazuki Augus, how would
you feel about joining me?

223
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,541
[MIKAZUKI]
Why?

224
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,208
Oh, right. I understand.

225
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,916
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,958
[MCGILLIS] I thought the way
you fought was beautiful.

227
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,625
Power that I saw as my ideal.

228
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,541
Power with which I could
secure a bright future.

229
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:49,166
You and your gang don't know
how to make use of that power.

230
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,166
So I thought that
I could lead you.

231
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,625
I believed that
I could guide you

232
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,208
toward our common goal.

233
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,625
However, I was mistaken.

234
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,916
Tekkadan's brilliance
has no ideals.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,833
They lack a true
sense of purpose.

236
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,916
And they have no destination.
This fleeting nature...

237
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,750
[MIKAZUKI] You talk
too much, ya know that?

238
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,458
Every one of us
is gonna make it there.

239
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,791
Make it where?

240
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,583
[ORGA]
Hey. You know better than to

241
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,000
try and poach
one of our members.

242
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,166
Yes, indeed. My apologies.

243
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,958
Well then,
I think I'll be going.

244
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,416
[MIKAZUKI] Orga, do you
need me to go out, too?

245
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,083
It's not time for that yet.

246
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,833
There's another job that I need
you to take care of for me.

247
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:31,375
Yeah, okay.

248
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:36,375
Kings of Mars we said.
So much for that.

249
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,541
[MIKAZUKI] Was that it?
The place we belonged?

250
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:45,041
Well, that's what I always
told myself anyway.

251
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:49,083
We'll just have to
start lookin' again.

252
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,625
And I'm gonna
make sure that happens

253
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,333
by heading over
to Chryse with Kudelia,

254
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,791
and making arrangements
with Old Man Makanai.

255
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,250
That worries me a little.

256
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,583
[ORGA]
Hm?

257
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,625
If I'm not right there with you,

258
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,500
there's no telling
how you'll mess up.

259
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,416
Hey, watch it.

260
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,958
It ain't like you can
go charging into

261
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,791
the city in Barbatos.

262
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,500
Yeah, but still...

263
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,875
[ORGA] So, whaddya say
you just let me borrow

264
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,958
your gun instead, then?

265
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,333
[MIKAZUKI]
This?

266
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,208
[ORGA]
Yeah.

267
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,083
[ORGA]
Brings back memories.

268
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,458
That day, I'm not gonna lie,

269
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:29,000
I was absolutely
terrified of you.

270
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,958
But I thought:

271
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,958
As long as I have
this guy by my side,

272
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:37,750
there's nobody in the entire
world who can beat me.

273
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,083
Even now?

274
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,083
Yeah.

275
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,500
Same as always.

276
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,708
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga.

277
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,125
Make sure that you
bring that back.

278
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,708
I plan to, Mika.

279
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,500
You don't have to worry.


280
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,791
[ATRA] Okay, I'll be
going now, Mikazuki.

281
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm.

282
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,250
Make sure
you're careful, Mikazuki.

283
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,208
I don't think I should
be lookin' at this.

284
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,666
[HUSH]
Are you done yet?

285
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,750
[ORGA] All right, guys,
Bael is heading out!

286
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,833
We need to go!

287
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,250
[SOLDIER 48A]
We've detected an Ahab Wave

288
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,833
from the enemy base!

289
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,166
--[COMMANDER 48A] The pattern?
--[SOLDIER 48A] Bael!

290
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,000
There you are, McGillis.

291
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,041
[COMMANDER 48A] All forces,
stay put! Don't move!

292
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,458
[IOK'S SUBORDINATE 48A]
Master Iok!

293
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,333
We have our orders, men!
We have to obey the commander!

294
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,375
[IOK'S SUBORDINATE 48A]
But, sir!

295
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,250
[IOK]
Mars' media is watching us!

296
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,041
It's Master Rustal's order!

297
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,791
We're not to move
until the enemy attacks!

298
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,041
[IOK'S SUBORDINATE 48A]
So we're just supposed to watch

299
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,791
as our comrades get taken out?!

300
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:41,958
[IOK grunts]

301
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,500
Exactly! You mustn't
take any action!

302
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,708
[IOK'S SUBORDINATE 48A]
Master Iok!

303
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,250
[COMMANDER 48A]
Lord Kujan, what are you doing?

304
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,083
[IOK]
Please forgive me, Commander!

305
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:55,583
But, if blood must first
be shed by someone...

306
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,416
[MCGILLIS]
He disarmed?

307
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,458
I see. You're trying
to force me into

308
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,583
drawing first blood, aren't you?

309
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,166
[IOK'S SUBORDINATE 48A]
Master Iok, retreat!

310
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,583
[IOK]
Don't interfere!

311
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,458
My men have saved me
from the jaws of death

312
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,500
more times than I can count!

313
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,041
And if not for the noble
sacrifices of those men,

314
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,916
I wouldn't be alive today!

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,291
And that's why...

316
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,541
...the time has come
for me to lay down my life

317
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,666
in order to ensure
the safety of yours!

318
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,750
Quite the commendable
sentiment, Iok Kujan.

319
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:27,916
However, my purpose here is to
cause a fair bit of commotion.

320
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're trying to bait me...

321
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
[yells]

322
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,375
[MCGILLIS]
...so I may as well bite!

323
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,666
[IOK yells]

324
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,416
Dammit! Where is he?!

325
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
[gasps]
McGillis!

326
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,125
[IOK'S SUBORDINATE 48A]
Master Iok!

327
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,291
Now, Commander! Give the order!

328
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,541
[COMMANDER 48A]
Understood, Lord Kujan.

329
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,125
[COMMANDER 48A] All squads!
Commence counterattack!

330
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:58,083
[MCGILLIS] I'm in a rather
foul mood at the moment.

331
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:01,458
So, if you don't mind, I believe
I'll take it out on you.

332
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,750
[MCGILLIS]
Lupus Rex.

333
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,916
The king of the wolves.

334
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,000
[MCGILLIS]
That's right.

335
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,208
Wolves move in packs.

336
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,958
But that way of life
isn't for me.

337
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,125
[beeping]

338
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,916
[MCGILLIS]
Mission accomplished.

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,375
Time to part ways, Tekkadan.

340
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:45,625
[clanging]

341
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,958
[DANE]
Zack?

342
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:48,875
Wow, I never thought I'd
see you back here, again.

343
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,458
Like I had a freakin' choice.

344
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,083
I'll do whatever it takes
to stay alive.

345
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,083
Now hurry up and get to work!

346
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,250
[EUGENE] After you take over
for the guys working below,

347
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,958
--make sure that you keep--
--[ELGAR] Deputy Boss!

348
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,541
[ELGAR] The boss and the

349
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,958
--the enemy blockade!
--That's great!

350
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,416
Okay guys,
let's get to work!

351
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,083
[TEKKADAN MEMBERS]
Yeah!

--[door knob clicks]
--[CUCUBITA] Madam President!

Thank goodness
you made it out okay!

354
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,458
Oh, I thought I'd
never see you again!

355
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,125
Come now, you're overreacting.

356
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,125
[CUCUBITA]
Can you blame me?!

357
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,416
Gjallarhorn said Tekkadan was

358
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,166
refusing their order
to surrender!

359
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,166
They're planning an all-out
attack on them tomorrow at noon!

360
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,750
[ORGA]
They said what?!

361
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,625
[RUSTAL]
That's McGillis for you.

362
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,583
Acting before all
our pieces were in place.

363
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,416
[NOBLISS]
You're not concerned by this?

364
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,833
It's nothing but
a single Mobile Suit.

365
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,958
You just stay focused on
controlling the civilian media.

366
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,625
Trust me, sir, I am.

367
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,333
Even with this latest incident,

368
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,541
they're eating out of
the palm of my hand.

369
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,750
I'm quite certain
Gjallarhorn will never lose

370
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,500
its moral high ground.

371
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,375
<i>I</i> shall be waiting for you
here on Mars, then.

372
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,875
[beep]

373
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,125
[GAELIO] Is this wise? Letting
McGillis do as he pleases?

374
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,666
Mars is a big place.

375
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,708
Though the Mars Branch's
negligence is an issue.

376
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,500
If he were the kind of man
who would simply run away,

377
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,916
we wouldn't have
been faced with

378
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,083
a situation like this
to begin with.

379
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:12,416
He'll come.
We just have to be patient.

380
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,375
Then it'll be up to you.

381
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,416
Yes.

382
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,416
That is the only thing
I have to live for.

383
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,083
[RIDE] Those bastards never
gave us any calls to surrender!

384
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,875
[CUCUBITA] But that's what
the news keeps saying.

385
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:27,041
So <i>that's</i> the reason they cut
off all communications from HQ.

386
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,291
[ATRA]
What does that mean?

387
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,500
It means they don't plan
on letting us surrender.

388
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,375
Looks like they
intend to kill us all.

389
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,833
Oh, no...

390
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,875
But there's still time
to prevent that.

391
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,708
So let's get started!

392
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,583
[MAKANAI] How can you ask me
to do such a thing?!

393
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,916
Deliberate tampering
with personal information

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,541
is a serious offense!

395
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,958
I understand that.

396
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,625
But I'm not seeing
any other way out for us.

397
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,416
I'll do anything
to protect them.

398
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,041
I'll give my life to
save them! I'm begging you!

399
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,791
[MAKANAI] It's difficult
to turn down a request

400
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,750
from a man you owe your life to.

401
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,458
Mr. Makanai, are you...?

402
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,750
So, you'll help?

403
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,250
[MAKANAI]
Before I can do anything,

404
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,416
you must come to Earth to
finalize the formal paperwork.

405
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,625
Go back to Earth?

406
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,500
I understand.
We'll make it there.

407
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,875
[MAKANAI]
But be quick about it.

408
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,750
There's someone here
who is so worried about you

409
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,791
that he can't
do his job properly.

410
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,916
It's caused me to
fall behind in my own work.

411
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,541
[TAKAKI]
Don't say that, Mr. Makanai.

412
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:21,416
Wait, that voice!
Am I hearing, Takaki?!

413
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,250
Ride? Is that you?

414
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,291
What the heck are
you doin' over there?!

415
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,583
[TAKAKI chuckles]
Oh, I managed to get a job

416
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,333
at Mr. Makanai's office.

417
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,708
Are you serious?

418
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,000
[TAKAKI] And it's all
thanks to you, Boss.

419
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,541
Me and Fuka
owe everything to you.

420
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:39,875
And so I wanna do
what I can to repay you.

421
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,666
[ORGA]
Takaki...

422
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,708
[ATRA] So, if we can just make
it to Earth, we'll all be saved?

423
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,291
Yes.

424
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,541
[CHAD] You say that as if it's
going to be a walk in the park.

425
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,500
But I bet Gjallarhorn
will be watching the Isaribi.

426
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,125
Oh, that's right.
I completely forgot.

427
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,333
I received an email addressed
to Tekkadan while you were away.

428
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,750
It came for us?

429
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,666
[ORGA]
This... is from Miss Azee?

430
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,583
[AZEE] Since we can't
get hold of you guys,

431
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:09,375
we're sending a message
via Kudelia Aina Bernstein.

432
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,583
We saw what's happening
on the news.

433
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,416
If there's anything
we can do to help,

434
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,291
go to Teiwaz's office on Mars.

435
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,458
We can smuggle
anything, anywhere.

436
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,416
We already have
Mr. McMurdo's consent on this.

437
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,625
We'll be waiting for your reply.

438
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,750
[ECO]
Listen! You guys can't die!

439
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,041
You need to survive
for those we lost,

440
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,416
like Darling, Ma'am, Lafter,
and everyone else!

441
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,166
We'll be waiting!

442
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:38,875
You okay?

443
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,375
So what does Miss Azee say?

444
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,833
--[ORGA] We're all set.
--[CHAD, RIDE] Huh?

445
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,583
[ORGA]
It's gonna work out.

446
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,791
The road's opened up.

447
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,958
We just have to move forward!

448
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:53,708
First, we need to find out
where that tunnel comes out!

449
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,708
We'll use that cable
to let everyone know...

450
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,916
...we now have a plan
that'll save us all!

451
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,208
[BOTH]
Yeah.

452
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,333
[ORGA] Chad, Ride,
bring the car around back!

453
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,833
[CHAD, RIDE]
Yes, sir!

454
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,000
[ORGA]
Are you sure about this, Atra?

455
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,416
[ATRA] Yes. I'm going to
hide out at Miss Kudelia's

456
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,166
until this all blows over.

457
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,750
I'll keep her safe and sound.

458
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,500
It's what Mikazuki
asked me to do.

459
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:18,583
He did? I see...

460
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,458
Well then, I guess
this is goodbye for a while.

461
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,833
Guess so. And please,
take care of Mikazuki for us.

462
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,333
Sure.

463
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,375
[ORGA]
Now that I think about it,

464
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:34,000
Tekkadan really began when we
were hired to take you to Earth.

465
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,083
You deliberately chose us
for the job, didn't you?

466
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,666
Yes. I wanted to work
alongside children

467
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,625
who were around my age
and less fortunate than I was.

468
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,708
So I could somehow
share in their pain.

469
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:52,541
[KUDELIA, ORGA laughing]

470
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,041
Boy, what an arrogant
notion that was.

471
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,625
No, I'm grateful that you did.

472
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,875
So make your dreams come true.

473
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,208
I will.

474
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,791
[RIDE]
Boss!

475
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,250
The car's ready
whenever you are!

476
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,166
[ORGA]
Right!

477
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,333
We're off.

478
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:11,375
Okay. Please be careful.

479
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,625
[RIDE]
It almost seems too quiet.

480
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,000
There aren't any Gjallarhorn
soldiers in the city,

481
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,750
unlike our headquarters.

482
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,291
[ORGA] Yeah. They probably
sent every last soldier

483
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,375
they had over there.

484
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,666
[RIDE] Well, that doesn't
matter anymore now, does it?

485
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,958
[ORGA]
You're in a good mood.

486
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,791
[RIDE]
Of course I am!

487
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,625
Everyone's gonna be saved
and Takaki's hard at work!

488
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,916
So I gotta work hard, too!

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Yeah.

490
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,791
[ORGA]
You're absolutely right.

491
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:42,083
Everything that we've built up
wasn't for nothing.

492
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,375
And from now on,
as long as we don't stop,

493
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,000
the road will continue.

How 'bout that?

502
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,750
I'm a pretty good shot.
[chuckles]

Hey...

Boss, are you...?

[RIDE whimpering]

506
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:28,541
[ORGA] Hey now, Ride,
what's with the whimpering?

507
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,125
[RIDE]
But... But you're...!

508
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:36,250
[ORGA] I'm the...
boss of Tekkadan, aren't I?

509
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,833
Orga Itsuka.

510
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:43,458
Dammit. This is nothing
but a scratch.

511
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,083
But why did you...?

512
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,416
You shouldn't
have done that for me.

513
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,375
[ORGA]
Protecting you is my job.

[ORGA]
Everyone's... waiting for us.

517
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,458
And besides...

518
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:06,583
[ORGA]
Mika, I finally get it.

519
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:09,875
We don't need
any goal to reach.

520
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:14,833
As long as we keep moving
forward and never stop,

521
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:18,291
the road will continue.

522
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,958
[MIKAZUKI]
I'm not gonna let you be sorry.

523
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,958
[ORGA]
Yeah. I know.

524
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,041
Believe me,
I'm never gonna quit.

525
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:32,208
So as long as you all
keep moving,

526
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,291
I'll be at the end
waiting for you!

527
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,291
[ORGA]
So listen up.

528
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,125
Don't you ever stop.

think of a name for the baby.

What do you think it should be?


535
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,875
Oh, right. I'll ask Orga
when he gets back.
