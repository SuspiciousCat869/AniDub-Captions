[ALMIRIA]
Macky...

00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,708
[GAELIO grunts]

312
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,041
[MCGILLIS grunts]

313
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,666
[GAELIO] Don't die yet.
Look at me, McGillis!

314
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,625
Gaelio...?

315
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,125
[GAELIO]
Look!

316
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,416
I am the man you killed.

317
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,208
And I am also
the man that killed you!

318
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,375
So look me in the eyes!

319
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:54,208
I thought you were my friend,
but my feelings were betrayed.

320
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,958
And I was robbed of all
the friends I put my trust in!

321
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,500
[MCGILLIS exhales]

322
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,291
I see you well enough
without your prodding.

323
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:10,291
I have... pretended not to
see you all this time.

324
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,458
[gasps]
But why, McGillis?

325
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:17,791
[MCGILLIS] If I hadn't
rejected you and the others...

326
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:23,625
...I could never
have moved forward.

327
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,125
Whenever I found
myself around you,

328
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:29,208
all of the ambitions
that I'd harbored

329
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:33,458
my whole life seemed to waver.

330
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
So I looked away.

331
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,458
[grunts]

332
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:42,083
I even promised
that I'd make Almiria happy

333
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,666
no matter what the cost.

334
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:50,000
[GAELIO] Such happiness
is nothing but a delusion!

335
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,375
But does it matter?
Are there really such things

336
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,458
as true and fake happiness?

337
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,125
[GAELIO] How can you
not understand that?!

338
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,083
Why are you crying?

339
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,916
[gasps]

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,125
[MCGILLIS] Gaelio...
To me, you have always been--

341
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,583
Don't say it!
Shut your mouth!

342
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,708
'Cause if the words
you're about to say

343
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,458
are the words
that I think they are...

344
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,583
If you say them... then I...

345
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,000
...then I might actually
have to forgive you!

346
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:26,916
So please, don't say them.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,791
For Carta.

348
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,375
And for Ein.

349
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,625
I...

350
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,083
I have to!

351
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,083
[sniffing]

352
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,416
I have to!

353
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:51,041
[GAELIO]
Farewell... McGillis.

354
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,416
[RUSTAL]
McGillis Fareed.

355
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,416
I have little doubt
that your death will hold

356
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,291
a great deal of significance
in the history to come...

357
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,958
...as the foolish end of a man

358
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:11,083
who was obsessed with
his desire for power.

359
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,625
Where's Julietta?

360
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,333
On her way down right now.

361
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,541
We've also launched
all those special troops.

362
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,291
[RUSTAL]
Good.

363
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,458
Then we shall
put an end to this.

364
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:23,250
Let's draw the final curtain.

365
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,875
[EUGENE]
Damn you, Orga,

366
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:30,083
for forcing us all
into a crap job like this!

367
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,375
But he's always been that way!

368
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,791
Strutting around
like some bigshot leader!

369
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,041
I'd planned on getting
back at him someday

370
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,750
for being such a show off.

371
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,291
But if this is how things
are gonna be now,

372
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,583
then let's carry out
his final order,

373
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,541
and give that jerk
a piece of our minds

374
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,625
when we see him in Heaven!

375
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,166
[ALL]
Yeah!

376
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,125
We're gonna make it there
no matter what.

377
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,958
The place Orga was
taking us... will be ours.

378
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,583
[ATRA, KUDELIA]

"Their Place."

382
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,416
You got your bracelet
dirty again.

383
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,291
Miss Atra's going to be angry.


384
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:36,375
We can apologize
to her together.


385
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,875
So let's go back to our home.
