[MERRIBIT] Conspiracy has taken
the lives of a man and a woman.

00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:20,416
The couple died a beautiful
death in the name of love.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,083
However, to the ones
they leave behind,

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:27,375
their deaths are as cold and
heavy as a cross made of lead.

[SHINO]
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,166
Gjallarhorn took Naze's body,

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,041
and it was impossible to take
back the <i>Hammerhead</i> from them.

8

Same with Ma'am's Hyakurin.

Are you crazy, Old Man?

16
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,125
Why would you hold Naze's
funeral aboard the Saisei?

17
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:08,416
[MCMURDO]
I believe I own this place.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,875
Which means I can do
whatever I please.

19
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,083
It'll only be a small ceremony.

20
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,416
I'm not expecting
many people to--

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,375
That's not the point
and you know it!

22
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:21,375
First of all, Naze returned his
Sakazuki cup to you, didn't he?

23
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,708
He did.

24
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,375
Which means the
funeral I'm holding

25
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,833
has nothing to do with Teiwaz.

26
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:29,708
I'm simply mourning a
friend at my own home.

27
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,333
Or don't I have
the right to do so?

28
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,625
Old Man, in case it's
slipped your mind,

29
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:37,083
Naze was a criminal
wanted by Gjallarhorn.

30
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:39,291
Holding a funeral for him would
send the wrong message--

31
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,125
[MCMURDO] Once we die,
the slate is wiped clean.

Besides, if I'm being honest,

something about this case
doesn't sit right with me.

Naze's out of the picture now,
and I'm the one still living.

As the head of Teiwaz,

00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:02,041
he needs to think about
what's best for the company.

41
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,208
It's obvious he should
be siding with me.

What's the latest with Kujan?

Get this, he sent us a
handwritten letter of thanks.

00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,791
[ORGA] Besides, the Turbine
girls that were left behind

157
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,458
have to keep working
within Teiwaz's factions.

158
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,208
If we act out, it'll
cause trouble for them.

159
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,125
[SHINO, EUGENE exhale]

160
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,250
We can't endanger those girls.

161
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,791
Bro and Ms. Amida sacrificed
everything for them.

162
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,208
I have to make sure we
respect their dying wish.

163
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,958
I agree with you, but--

164
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:53,041
[SHINO growls] Dammit.
This all just feels so...

165
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,666
Excuse me. Uh, Mr. Akihiro.

166
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,875
Ms. Lafter's here.

167
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,750
Uh?

168
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,333
[SHINO, EUGENE]
Huh?!

169
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,041
[LAFTER]
So... the way I hear it,

170
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,583
you guys are gonna be heading
out first thing tomorrow.

171
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:12,041
That's right, since the repairs
on Barbatos are done and all.

172
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,875
If you'd like, we could go out
for some drinks or something?

173
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,375
[SHINO, EUGENE gasp]

174
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:20,916
You mean right this minute? Hmm.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
--All right.
--[gasps] Great--

176
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541
[AKIHIRO] I'll be right back,
I'm gonna grab the others.

177
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,833
Uh. Oh... Right.

178
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,416
What are you doing?!

179
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,333
You heard? So then, how
about it? Do you want--

180
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,958
Would you please
use your brain?!

181
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,041
You have to go out
with her alone!

182
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,833
Do you not understand
what this is?!

183
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,625
No. Why should I go alone?

184
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,083
'Cause of love my friend.

185
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,208
More specifically,
I'm talkin' the kind of love

186
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,666
you can't buy with money.

187
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,416
--[AKIHIRO] Love?
--[SHINO] Oh, forget it!

188
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,083
Go! We're too busy
to come, anyway.

189
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,208
You're gonna go alone.
You'll represent Tekkadan.

190
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,125
Those are the Deputy
Boss' orders!

191
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,875
[EUGENE]
Hey, that's my call!

192
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,375
But he's right.
Deputy Boss's orders.

193
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,375
Yeah, right

194
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,416
[LAFTER]
This is such a fancy place!

195
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,958
I'm impressed, Akihiro!

196
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,541
You know, the last time
we were aboard the Saisei,

197
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,916
we were with the
whole Tekkadan crew.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,541
Mmm.

199
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,375
I, uh... feel strange inside.

200
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,791
[AKIHIRO]
Hm?

201
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,125
[LAFTER]
It's like somebody invaded me,

202
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,833
and they took all I had in here.

203
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,083
[AKIHIRO]
I see.

204
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,041
[LAFTER] I'd been doing
work on outlaw ships

205
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,500
ever since I was a little girl.

206
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,125
For the most part, all of
my crew mates were women,

207
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:35,041
but the owner was
a brute of a man.

208
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,041
We were gloomy all the time
and hardly ever talked.

209
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,000
I just figured that
was the norm.

210
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,333
[LAFTER]
But one day, Darling and Ma'am

211
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,666
saved us from that life.

212
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,833
Up till then, I didn't
really know anything

213
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,083
about how the world worked.

214
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,958
Not just reading and writing,

215
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,041
but things like happiness,
joy, and warmth.

216
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,708
Things that come
naturally to humans.

217
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,250
Like how it feels
to love someone.

218
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,750
And having something to protect.

219
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,166
I learned all of that after
I joined the Turbines.

220
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,125
It was Darling, and Ma'am, too.

221
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,916
They built me from the ground up
into the person I am today.

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,916
[AKIHIRO]
It was the same with me.

223
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,416
[LAFTER]
Huh?

224
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,125
[AKIHIRO]
I'm startin' to realize,

225
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,458
that I only discovered
the person I really was

226
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,083
inside after I joined Tekkadan.

227
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,250
What kind of person
were you before that?

228
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,416
Uh!

229
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,583
[AKIHIRO]
It's... kinda hard

230
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,625
to put it into words
when somebody asks.

231
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,958
You're kind, Akihiro.

232
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,416
[AKIHIRO grunts]

233
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,375
[LAFTER] I thought you were
just a muscle-bound idiot,

234
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,583
but you're more
considerate than anyone.

235
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,750
You think about other's troubles
as if they were your own.

236
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,833
Awkward a bit,

237
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:59,041
but you're always there
to comfort your friends

238
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,375
without ever having
to utter a single word.

239
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,166
That's just you.

240
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,166
Lafter...

241
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,291
[LAFTER laughs]

242
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,250
Huh?

243
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,291
Oh, but here's the thing.

244
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,958
They get a little suffocated
with you being so close,

245
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:14,541
so they have no choice

246
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:18,916
but to force themselves to cheer
up and get back on their feet!

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,416
You're makin' fun of me.

248
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,250
No I'm not silly,
I'm praising you.

249
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,250
Those qualities.

250
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,125
They were what made me fall...

251
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,041
I've decided to
stay behind here.

252
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,250
[AKIHIRO]
Hm?

253
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,916
Mr. McMurdo promised
he'd do what he could

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,250
to look out for us. But we
can't rely on him forever.

255
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,541
Also...

256
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,291
The legacy that Darling
and Ma'am taught us,

257
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,125
I wanna pass it on.

258
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,500
[AKIHIRO]
I see.

259
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,416
So...

260
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,166
[AKIHIRO]
I respect you, Lafter.

261
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,500
[gasps]

262
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,041
[AKIHIRO] You see your
duties through to the end,

263
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,208
and you look after those you
cherish with all of your heart.

264
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,333
It's an honest life.

265
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,166
Ya see,

266
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,166
I wanna live life like you do.

267
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,708
[gasps]

268
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,250
Yeah.

269
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,791
[LAFTER] I guess this
is really goodbye, huh?

270
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,458
I'm sure we'll meet again
while we're on the job.

271
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,375
I'll be counting
on you when we do.

272
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,291
Yeah, you're right.

273
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,500
[LAFTER]
Oh, I almost forgot!

274
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,708
[AKIHIRO]
Hmm?

275
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,666
[gasps]

276
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:38,083
[LAFTER]
Squeeze!

277
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,916
[LAFTER laughs] Come on,
it's just a hug! No big deal!

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,916
Why are you blushing like that?

279
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
[grunts]

280
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,875
See ya'round.

281
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,875
[LAFTER] I love being part
of the Turbine family.

282
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:06,500
And I'll always love Darling
and Ma'am, no matter what.

283
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:10,041
But somehow, this is different.

284
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:13,833
I don't think I've ever
felt this way before.

285
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,750
Akihiro...

286
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,000
[LAFTER]
Goodbye.


287
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,875
[ORGA]
Brother...

288
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,083
[NAZE]
Remember this.

289
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,333
It takes more than just
your average resolve

290
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,166
to make your family happy.

291
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,041
You don't have time
to get bogged down

292
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,041
by other people's petty details.

293
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,166
Don't forget that becoming
Sovereign of Mars

294
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,000
is to make life easier for
the members of Tekkadan.

295
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,166
Those were your words, right?

296
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,041
[NAZE] So, I want you to
keep looking forward

297
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,625
and protecting your
family, Tekkadan.

298
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:55,000
Put everything else
out of your mind.

299
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,333
You got that, Orga Itsuka?

300
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,333
[ORGA whimpers]

301
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,750
[ORGA]
Bro...

302
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,333
You taught me everything I know.

303
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,958
I've only made it this far
because I followed you.

304
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,916
[NAZE] But there's something
you should know.

305
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,916
As I sit here,
looking into your eyes

306
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,750
I see someone who isn't quite
sure where he's headed.

307
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,000
You want to get to your goal

308
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,583
as soon as possible
and take it easy, right?

309
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,166
[ORGA]
I have a family backing me up.

310
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,125
[ORGA]
Still, I...

311
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,958
[MIKAZUKI] The baby at the
Turbines looked just like Naze.

312

00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,500
Take it to the end.

469
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,916
I don't give a damn about
our past ties with them.

470
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,416
Just remember we're Tekkadan.

471
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,958
If all of us are headed
the same direction,

472
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:56,083
then we don't need
another reason.

473
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,708
Crush them all. Do it until
there's nothing left but dust.

474
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:03,541
[MIKAZUKI]
Got it.

475
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,125
[JASLEY]
Next time on

476
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,416
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans,</i>

477
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,583
"Settlement."

478
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,458
I'll exterminate
those space rats

479
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:34,208
and the senile old geezer
all in one go.


480
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:38,041
Naze's waiting for you
on the other side.
