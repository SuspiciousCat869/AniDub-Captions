[MERRIBIT]
Jasley Donomikols.

2
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,458
Have you finished
saying your prayers?

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:21,833
Tekkadan will never forgive you,
and they will never let you go.

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,041
So, the time has arrived to
scatter your red flowers

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,000
upon the graves of the fallen.

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,833
[KUDELIA]
Did I hear you correctly?

7
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:33,125
Tekkadan is cutting ties
with the Admoss Company?

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,625
That would mean relinquishing
all jointly-owned assets

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,291
on Mars, as well as
dissolving the affiliations

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,083
with the security and
shipping businesses.

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,833
I've tried calling Teiwaz
for an explanation,

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,125
but I'm not getting any answers.

13
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:50,125
What in the world is going
on with Tekkadan right now?

14
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,416
Is it possible to view Earth
Sphere broadcasts from here?

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,708
Huh?

16
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,833
Uh?

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,541
[KUDELIA]
What is this?

18
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,333
[OPERATOR 42B] Hugo's One, Two,
and Three have been hit!


19
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,166
They're withdrawing
from the front lines!


20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,833
[OPERATOR 42A]
Not good! More troops lost!

21
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,583
We're down by almost 15%!

22
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:42,791
[JASLEY growls]

23
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,625
These punks are really
pushin' their luck!

24
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,875
Filthy space rats!

25
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,916
[OPERATOR 42A] Hugo Eight
and Nine have been destroyed,

26
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and our forces are
rapidly decreasing!

27
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,166
At this rate,
they'll break through

28
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,583
our first line of defense!

29
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,333
[JASLEY growls]
I get it!

30
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,708
They finished repairing
that machine!

31
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,000
[JASLEY growls]

32
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,583
Hey! Where is Iok Kujan?

33
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,291
[JASLEY'S MAN 35A] Uh, there's
been no word from him, sir.

34
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,916
That little bastard.

35
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,458
He was supposed to be here,
helping us, ages ago.

36
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,750
Of course, I've taken care
of all the preparations.

37
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,500
Now that I've lit a fire
under those little rats,

38
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,583
they'll be sure to come
after us, guns a blazin'.

39
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,125
And once those punks
come scurrying out...

40
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,916
[IOK] ...it will be my job to
exterminate them from behind,

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,333
thus completing my
quest for revenge.

42
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,958
Exactly right.

43
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,875
And then, I'll take you to the
Saisei, just as we discussed.

44
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,791
[IOK]
Yes, I understand.

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:45,333
The plan is for me to arrest
McMurdo Barriston, right?

46
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,875
It is indeed.

47
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,208
That geezer has plenty of
skeletons in his closet.

48
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,291
You'll be able to pin him
with any number of crimes.

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,500
[IOK]
Got it. Leave everything to me.

50
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,375
[JASLEY]
Heh.

51
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,125
This'll get rid of all
the thorns in my side!

52
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,958
And all in one fell swoop!

53
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:08,375
I was supposed to become the big
boss of Teiwaz using his help!

54
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,541
That spoiled, little brat.

55
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,291
Mobile Suit teams,
do you read me?

56
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,541
Lord Kujan's backup will come.

57
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,291
Remember, we have more
Mobile Suits than the enemy,

58
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,708
so hold out until they arrive!

59
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,125
He's latched onto me?!

60
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,083
I've got you now!

61
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,000
[MCGILLIS] it looks to me
as if their battle has begun.

62
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,708
[ISURUGI] But if we're looking
at sheer numbers, sir,

63
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,625
the JPT Trust has the advantage.

64
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:06,208
[MCGILLIS] They're a ragtag
group of mercenaries.

65
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,708
They'll never be able
to stop Tekkadan.

66
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,000
Now then, it's time
for us to get going.

67
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,750
[SOLDIER 42C groans]

68
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,625

said anything about this!

think you're go--

79

[HUSH]
So this is a Hekija.

80
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,500
It reacts much faster
than a Shiden...

81
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,250
...and so easy to control!

82
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,833
[DANTE] That machine is a
keepsake from the Turbines.

83

[HUSH]
Oh, right.

If you don't do it justice,
you'll regret it.

pay these idiots?!

The good news is it only
needs the units replaced.

No, we need it in 10!

Drink up.

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,041
The enemy's movements
have changed a lot.

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,625
That mobility...

127
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,250
From the looks of it, they've
brought out the Human Debris.

128

Wait, hang on.

129

You're gonna go up
against those guys?

Even though you know
what they are?

131
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,250
Of course.

But weren't you and
Mr. Chad, I mean...

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,208
Ya think we're not gonna
fight those guys

135
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,708
'cause we were
once like them?

136

[ZACK]
Well...

137
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,166
That stuff doesn't
mean anything.

138
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,666
Their standings and
backgrounds don't matter.

139
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,041
If they pick up a weapon,
they're all the same.

140
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,000
And we're gonna crush them.

How are they so cool-headed
about killing people?

are still human.

Aren't they?

have I had to let go of
someone I cared about?

[GALAN] Having something to
protect--that's admirable!

As is taking revenge when
it's been taken from you!

[JULIETTA] What do you
suppose I was lacking?

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,291
[YAMAZIN]
Mmm?

179
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,000
[JULIETTA]
Julia is a powerful machine.

180
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,625
I trained three times
harder than any other pilot

181
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:26,416
to unlock the full
extent of that power.

182
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
And yet...

183
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,125
...I was no match.

184
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,125
Hey, you and Julia came
back in one piece, right?

185
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,750
But, your opponent
wasn't so lucky.

186
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,625
Based on that alone,
I'd say you're plenty strong.

187
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,125
[JULIETTA]
You're missing the point!

188
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,208
My skills and strength
were no match for hers!

189
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,000
If I don't find a way
to become stronger,

190
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,916
there will be no reason
for me to exist!

191

If you wanna get even
stronger than you are now,

192
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,625
then you might have to
give up being human.

[YAMAZIN] The human body
is unreliable, parts-wise.

195
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,750
You'd have to remove the
shackles of flesh and blood.

[JULIETTA] The very
thought of that is taboo!

As a member of Gjallarhorn,

198
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,666
I cannot approve of such
repugnant thinking!

199
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,708
[YAMAZIN] I guess it all
depends on how you look at it.

make a deal with the devil

[CREW gasps]

315
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,625
[JASLEY]
Uh!

316
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,416
What should I do now, Orga?

317
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,583
Finish them.

318
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,000
[gasping]

319
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,666
Let's not be too hasty!
If it's not money, then what?!

320
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,250
An apology?! I'll cut
off all my fingers!

321
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:12,666
And all my toes, if you want!
Please, don't do this!

322
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,750

[exhales]

324
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:42,916
[BAKLAZAN]
Lord Fareed, isn't it curious

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,500
that Lord Elion and Lord
Kujan aren't present?

326
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:50,250
It's not a problem.
We can begin without them.

327
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,791
Can we?

328
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:55,458
This meeting needs the unanimous
decision of all seven lords.

329
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,666
[ORGA]
You did good out there.

330
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,583
Now we finally have something to
offer, to the Turbines who died.

331
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,916
But there's no way of tellin'
if this made them happy, though.

332
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,958
[ORGA]
Yeah.

333
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,500
But still,

334
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:14,125
I think we honored the fallen
only as Tekkadan could.

335
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,875
And as a result,

336
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,000
we're now an organization
cut off from Teiwaz.

337
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,458
That's just how it is.

338
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,625
We don't have anyone
to back us up anymore.

339
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,375
[CHAD]
Forgive me if I'm wrong,

340
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:27,791
but, aren't we teaming up with
that McGillis Fareed guy?

341
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,625
Eugene. It's almost time.

342
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,916
[CHAD]
For what?

343
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,791
The time has come
for us to rise up!

344
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,250
[ALL]
Huh?

345
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,958
A revolution's coming
comrades! The fight has begun!

346
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,208
We shall stir up a new wind
and blow away the rot

347
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,041
that has consumed Gjallarhorn.

348
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,125
The time has arrived to reform
a world that has become rife

349
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,375
with treacherous lies, and take
it back with our own hands.

350
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,833
[gasps]

351
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,166
Gjallarhorn was known as the
keeper of peace and order.

352
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,708
However, that notion was nothing
but convenient self-serving,

353
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:03,458
prattling used by the Seven
Stars for personal gain!

354
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,083
The border dispute on Earth
between Arbrau and the SAU,

355
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,958
our investigations have
revealed that Gahlen Mossa,

356
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,375
the mercenary believed to have
engineered the entire situation,

357
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,583
was actually working in
league with Rustal Elion!

358
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,208
Which brings me to this.

359
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,708
Lord Iok Kujan
set up the Turbines,

360
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,041
a civilian company to be
an illegal organization.

361
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,250
And after conducting
a warrantless raid,

362
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,583
he used the banned
Dáinsleif to butcher

363
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,208
multiple non-combatant workers.

364
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,166
These men only focus on
petty political squabbles...

365
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:39,083
[VIDAR] I take it this is your
answer, McGillis Fareed.

366
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,500
In that case, I know what to do.

367
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,583
[LIZA] Gjallarhorn was known the
keeper of peace and order.

368
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:50,041
However, that notion was nothing
but a convenient excuse

369
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,208
used by the Seven Stars
for personal gain!

370
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,375
I implore you to open your eyes!

371
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,958
Let us rise up
together, comrades!

372
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,583
So it begins.

373
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,833
[KUDELIA] Tekkadan is going to
take part in this revolution.

374
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:06,458
And in doing so, they're cutting
ties with us and Teiwaz,

375
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,750
and joining Lord Fareed.

376
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,041
Ms. Merribit.

377
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,500
I know they're doing this,
but what about you?

378
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,625
You're a Teiwaz
employee, aren't you?

379
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:18,041
[MERRIBIT] Actually, I've
already resigned from Teiwaz.

380
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,583
Sometimes, when I'm
with those kids,

381
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,541
I realize how truly
powerless I am.

382
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,000
And yet, I would
really like to think

383
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,541
that there's something I can
do for them as an adult.

384
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,708
And besides, there's someone
dear to me in Tekkadan, too.

385
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,875
[gasps]

386
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,000
[MERRIBIT]
Wherever those children go,

387
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,000
I'll be right there with them.

388
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,125
[CUCUBITA]
President...

389
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,000
[KUDELIA] There's also someone
very dear to me in Tekkadan.

390
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,583
[CUCUBITA]
Huh?

391
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:53,375
I thought I was part
of Tekkadan's family, too.

392
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,666
[CUCUBITA] Families come
in many different forms,

393
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,083
Madam President.

394
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,500
[SHINO] We're supposed to help
them change the world?

395
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,083
Do you really think
we can do that?

396
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,916
[EUGENE] Hey Orga, you mind
if I ask you somethin'?

397
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,958
[ORGA]
Hm?

398
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,708
The thing these guys
are organizing.

399
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,458
Are you positive it
meshes with your plan?

400
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,750
[EUGENE] Sometimes it
seems too complicated

401
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,541
and goes over our heads.

402
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,041
So tell us, the objective
they have on this,

403
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:24,958
is it the same as what
we're aimin' for?

404
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,541
It is.

405
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,458
In order for us to survive,

406
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,500
and also to become
sovereign of Mars,

407
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,500
we're gonna head for
the same place as them.

408
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,666
It's the only choice.

409
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,583
That's true.

410
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,791
All right! Let's do this!
Are ya ready boys?!

411
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,791
[EUGENE]
Yeah!

412
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,875
[SHINO]
Come on, I can't hear ya!

413
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,291
[CHAD]
Yeah.

414
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,791
Hey, Mika.

415
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,500
How'd this guy feel out there?

416
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,125
[MIKAZUKI]
It was great.

417
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,083
Kinda strange, though.

418
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,791
I'm so used to having
this tail now,

419
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,208
it's hard to believe I
didn't have one before.

420
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,458
I see.

421
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,583
I wonder what
Brother would say?

422
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,625
He'd be mad.

423
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,125
[ORGA]
Probably.

424
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,083
I wanna laugh.

425
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,916
King of Mars, or whatever.

426
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,333
I don't care about the title.

427
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,916
All I want is to laugh
when I get there.

428
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,833
Together.

429
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,666
With everyone.

430
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,791
Sounds good. Yeah.

431
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:48,041
[KUDELIA]
And with that,

432
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,833
Tekkadan set out
on their new road.

433
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:54,208
One that would lead them
to that fateful day.
