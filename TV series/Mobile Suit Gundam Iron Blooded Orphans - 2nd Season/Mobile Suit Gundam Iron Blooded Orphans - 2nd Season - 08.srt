00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,208
[IOK] Let's discuss the
war between the SAU

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,250
and the Arbrau Defense Force.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,583
It's plain as day!

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,958
All responsibility lies
with the Outer Earth

5
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,250
Orbit Regulatory Joint Fleet!

6
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:24,625
Thanks to this incident,

7
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,916
lingering tensions
between economic blocs

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
will surely break out
into open conflicts.

9
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,250
In its current state, what
could Gjallarhorn possibly do

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,416
to deter the fighting?

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,791
Lord Kujan, calm yourself!

12
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:38,333
Try looking at the
situation from this angle.

13
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,250
Collateral damage was
kept to a minimum

14
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,791
thanks to Lord Fareed.

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,833
However, given the number of
issues Earth currently faces,

16
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,333
I'm not sure if it's wise

17
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:49,125
for the Outer Earth Orbit
Regulatory Joint Fleet

18
00:00:49,208 --> 00:00:51,083
to spread its reach to Mars.

19
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,750
Yes, now that you mention it,

20
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:57,000
perhaps that is a decision
that we ought to reconsider.

21
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,416
Even more troubling is
the man who they say

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,166
led the Arbrau Defense Force.

23
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,541
[IOK]
We've investigated!

24
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,666
There's not a single record
of the man in question

25
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,583
in any of the
databases on Earth.

26
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,208
Well, if you ask me,

27
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,791
I doubt such a man
existed at all.

28
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,791
It's more likely that Arbrau
concocted this fabrication

29
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:15,750
to cover their blunder.

30
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,375
[BAKLAZAN]
You have a point.

31
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:18,875
[GALLUS]
But according to the testimonies

32
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:21,625
of several witnesses,
someone was at the scene.

33
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,208
[FALK]
But we can trust the credibility

34
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,291
of these witnesses?

35
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,250
[GALLUS]
Well, it's all we've got.

36
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,333
That was quite the
ordeal you went through.

37
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,250
Still, it's just as
Lord Bauduin said.

38
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,500
Out of everyone,
you're the only one

39
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,708
who could've extinguished
the brushfire.

40
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,166
No.

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,333
Thank you, but this conflict
never should've happened.

42
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,708
It was my blunder.

43
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,291
I'll be. You've
matured quite a bit.

44
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,875
[RUSTAL]
Lord Fareed is here?

45
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:24,916
[RUSTAL'S MAN A]
Yes.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,291
Apparently, he wants
to introduce us

47
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,000
to his newly-appointed heir.

48
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,583
Oh, that child his
mistress bore him.

49
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,166
Well, sir, rumor has it

50
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,875
that he and the child aren't
really related by blood.

51
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,541
[RUSTAL]
Are you serious?

52
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,041
If that's true, then why
would he choose him?

53
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,375
I've no clue.

54
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,625
Speak of the devil.

55
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,000
[RUSTAL]
Hello, boy.

56
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,541
How adorable, a physical book.

57
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:50,250
What are you reading?

58
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,291
Say, following your dad
everywhere must get boring.

59
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,666
Why don't I have someone
bring you something?

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,166
Is there anything you want?
Toys or snacks?

61
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,250
Just Bael.

62
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,583
[RUSTAL] Never in a million
years did I imagine

63
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,750
I'd hear a child say that name.

64
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:19,375
Still, you continue to surprise
me even to this day.

65
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,708
Especially with the way
you expertly handled

66
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,333
Iznario Fareed's downfall.

67
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,625
I haven't a clue what
you're talking about.

68
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:27,958
My apologies.

69
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,416
[RUSTAL] If you wanna
play dumb, so be it.

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,541
I have no intention of
denouncing you over that.

71
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,791
That said, there's something
I can't wrap my head around.

72
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,541
I was always under
the impression

73
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:41,833
that you were motivated
by a personal grudge.

74
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,625
But now that Iznario
is out of the picture,

75
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:49,250
what exactly are you planning
to accomplish with Gjallarhorn?

76
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,041
Well, I bet I'll find
out soon enough.

77
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,750
Although, when that day arrives,

78
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,208
something tells me that
our circumstances

79
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,458
will be vastly different.

80
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,083
And so, General?

81
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,833
[MCGILLIS] What did our
internal investigation

82
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,416
into Galan Mossa reveal?

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,166
As was expected, we
couldn't identify him, sir.

84
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,041
Taking a man and concealing
his actual identity...

85
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:16,041
That's not beyond the
scope of the Elion family.

86
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,958
Those were my
thoughts as well.

87
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,750
But what other tricks does
Rustal Elion have up his sleeve?

88
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,291
[MAKANAI]
I have to say,

89
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,750
I feel like Rip Van Winkle.

90
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,958
I woke up to find that a war
had started and ended.

91
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
It's more than a little jarring.

92
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,666
Both the SAU and
Arbrau Defense Force

93
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,041
have agreed to a peace treaty.

94
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,041
Tekkadan is going to
withdraw from Earth.

95
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,833
And Orga's here,
finalizing the paperwork.

96
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,083
[MAKANAI]
Hmm.

97
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:45,833
On a more uplifting note,

98
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,000
Chad Chadan is out
of the hospital.

99
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,791
Yes, he's already
gone back to work.

100
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,791
That's good. And
quite a relief too.

101
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,541
I couldn't rest in the afterlife

102
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,875
if a young man died
saving a geezer like me.

103
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,875
I always thought you were
more... cold-hearted th--

104
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,750
Wh-What I mean to say is,

105
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,333
you've always come
across as someone

106
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,291
who was level-headed
and impassive.

107
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,458
[MAKANAI chuckles]

108
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,458
A product of getting
older, most likely.

109
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,125
Well, it's wonderful to see.

110
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,458
[MAKANAI]
No.

111
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,916
At this age, change
doesn't really feel like

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,791
a positive improvement.

113
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:23,291
By some miracle, I got lucky
and survived this one,

114
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,000
but I can see now that
my time is limited.

115
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,750
Mr. Makanai...

116
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,875
[MAKANAI] But if I could
pass on the connections

117
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,125
I've built up over my lifetime,

118
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:36,333
I'd give them to those who still
have their lives ahead of them.

119
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,833
So, Kudelia Aina Bernstein...

120
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,083
...what do you say?

121
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,583
Could I talk you into
staying here on Earth?

122
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,083
[gasps]

123
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,458
[TEKKADAN MEMBER A]
Those aren't strapped down yet!

124
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,875
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B]
Anybody know where my stuff is?!

125
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,000
[TEKKADAN MEMBER C]
The mobile workers need their

126
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,375
fuel drained first!

127
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:51,208
[TEKKADAN MEMBER D]
There are live rounds in there!

128
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,500
Be careful!

[CHAD]
Hmm...

130
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,500
[AKIHIRO]
The list of casualties?

131
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,041
[CHAD]
Yeah...

132
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,625
Every one of these people died
because of my shortcomings.

133
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,625
[AKIHIRO]
You can't blame yourself.

134
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,708
[CHAD sighs]

135
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,708
[CHAD] This must be how the
boss feels all the time.

136
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,458
Oh, Chad...

137
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,291
[CHAD] Every second I'm
alive is agonizing...

138
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,916
I can't stand it.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,125
It would've been much
better to step forward

140
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,416
and take the hit myself.

141
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,708
[LAFTER]
I didn't know you and Aston

142
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,208
had the same last name, Akihiro.

143
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
He was Aston Altland.

144
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:34,500
Yeah. Many Brewer boy
soldiers had no surname.

145
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,500
They were just Human Debris.

146
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:37,791
[LAFTER]
Uh, then...

147
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,583
[AKIHIRO]
My brother, Masahiro,

148
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,458
they were the ones that looked
after him when he was alive.

149
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,250
[LAFTER]
I see.

150
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,000
I should've talked to him
a lot more than I did.

151
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,250
[LAFTER]
With Aston?

152
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,583
Yeah.

153
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,000
It's too late after
they're gone.

154
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,125
[ORGA]
Hey, Takaki.

155
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,000
What's the story behind
these accounts?

156
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,416
[TAKAKI]
I'm not really sure.

157
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
I'm sorry, but Mr. Radice
handled those himself.

158
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,041
What about these?

159
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,500
[TAKAKI] Oh, those accounts
were his responsibility, too.

160
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,708
Well, that's a bust!

161
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,000
Radice was more clever
than I thought.

162
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:11,583
Even before the war,

163
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,750
the bastard had the Earth
Branch under his thumb.

164
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,791
[ORGA]
It couldn't be helped.

165
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,250
It's our fault.

166
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,041
We always let him
handle the office work.

167
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,166
[TAKAKI] I'm really sorry
for all of this, Boss.

168
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,791
You and Ms. Merribit were forced
to come to Earth because of me.

169
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,333
But now everything's so--

170
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,708
Hey, don't sweat it.

171
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:33,500
Ms. Merribit, can you check
these payment vouchers?

172
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:35,666
Will do.

173
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,708
I'll be going, then.

174
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,416
Poor Takaki, he's takin'
this pretty hard.

175
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
He lost a lot of his
comrades out there.

176
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,041
I don't blame him.

177
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,666
[MIKAZUKI]
What's wrong?

178
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,458
[MIKAZUKI]
You seem like your kinda down.

179
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,291
[TAKAKI] I don't...
deserve to be in Tekkadan.

180
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,208
I bought all of
Mr. Radice's lies

181
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:11,583
and blindly followed the
orders of a total stranger.

182
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,250
Even though I knew

183
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:18,333
the boss's orders were
the most important, I...

184
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,208
[MIKAZUKI] The only thing you
did was carry out the work

185
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,208
that was assigned to you.

186
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,458
B-But I--

187
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,708
You obeyed those orders

188
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,041
because you thought they
came from Orga, right?

189
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,166
Yeah, but that's
still no excuse.

190
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,666
Besides, you settled it
with your own hands.

191
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,250
Are Orga and the
guys still at it?

192
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,125
Yeah, they are.

193
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,625
All right then.

194
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,833
[KUDELIA]
Takaki.

195
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,166
[TAKAKI]
Mr. Mikazuki is amazing.

196
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,583
[KUDELIA]
Uh?

197
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,166
Back then, we were still
in the Third Group of the CGS.

198
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,750
And one day, Mr. Mikazuki
shot the First Corps guys.

199
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:01,416
Everything changed
for us that day.

200
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,666
I did the same thing
that he did,

201
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,333
but nothing's
gonna change for me.

202
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:10,041
[KUDELIA] It might not be
my place to say this,

203
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,041
but hear me out.

204
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,166
I think all of you still
have a lot more to learn.

205
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
Really?

206
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,708
Yes, really.

207
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,250
For example, you may think
your choices are limited,

208
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,500
but actually, you have
a number of options,

209
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,916
though you can only choose one.

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,500
[TAKAKI] I don't think I could
ever make a decision like that.

211
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,958
[KUDELIA]
You know, making the right call

212
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,000
is difficult for everyone.

213
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,416
However, the more
you experience,

214
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,208
the more knowledge
you'll acquire.

215
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,250
And the more sensible
you become,

216
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,416
the easier it'll be to decide.

217
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,750
And you'll do it
all on your own.

218
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,416
[JULIETTA]
No good!

219
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,041
Work up a new simulation
that's actually a challenge!

220
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,458
This is useless for training!

221
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,250
[WORKER A]
Y-Yes, ma'am!

222
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,833
[VIDAR] A simulator?
Aren't you the workaholic.

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,083
[JULIETTA]
That may be,

224
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:06,208
but if Master Rustal
thought I was ready,

225
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,625
then surely he
would've allowed me

226
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,875
to join the front lines by now.

227
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,666
If only I would've been there,

228
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,666
we wouldn't have lost
the bearded gentleman.

229
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,166
[VIDAR]
You think your presence there

230
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,875
would've shifted
the tide of battle?

231
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,250
Of course I do!

232
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,208
[VIDAR] Do you realize
that saying such a thing,

233
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,291
in essence, is making
a mockery of the dead?

234
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,375
[gasps]

235
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,791
[grunts]

236
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,833
[JULIETTA]
The bearded gentleman taught me

237
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:32,041
every single thing
I know about combat.

238
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,458
He's the one who recommended
me to Master Rustal,

239
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,791
even though I had no family.

240
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,166
And therefore, I have to
stay at the top of my game

241
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,541
if I'm to repay
these two great men.

242
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:48,250
[VIDAR] You remind me of
someone I used to know.

243
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,708
Ever grateful for being
plucked out of the void

244
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,875
by a respected senior officer,

245
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,625
he fought out of pride for
the one who rescued him.

246
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,375
Where is that person now?

247
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:01,291
[VIDAR]
At the moment... rather close.

248
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,750
[JULIETTA]
Close, huh?

249
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,000
I see.

250
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,791
If you're really friends
with such a fine person,

251
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,000
then perhaps you might
be more of a decent man

252
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,041
than I originally
thought you were.

253
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,000
[VIDAR]
And if that's your criterion,

254
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,583
then perhaps you have a
simpler mind than I thought.

255
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:20,333
Was that... you
giving me a compliment?

256
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,833
[VIDAR]
Of course.

257
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,000
[chuckles]

258
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,375
[JULIETTA]
Thank you.


259
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,291
Hey there, how's
it goin', boys?

260
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,833
I heard that a bunch of your
guys bit the big one again.

261
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:36,208
As your big brother, I thought
I'd swing by and cheer ya up.

262
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,208
Big brother?

263
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,041
You're just some old geezer.

264
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,791
[TODO]
Ah, screw you guys!

265
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:45,333
Hurry up and show us in!
We are guests, ya know!

266
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,000
[MCGILLIS] I received word
that you'd arrived on Earth.

267
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,416
I thought I owed Tekkadan
a personal thank you

268
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,958
for saving us from that
horrid predicament.

269
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,250
[ORGA]
No.

270
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,166
Unfortunately,
our internal affairs

271
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,500
were partly to blame for this.

272
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,416
And some mystery man
used it to his advantage.

273
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,041
Galan Mossa.

274
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:06,500
And it's safe to assume that he
was working under Rustal Elion.

275
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,375
We're dealing with
that guy again?

276
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,208
We must deal with his faction.

277
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,750
Otherwise, we can't
reform Gjallarhorn.

278
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,333
Given the fact that they've
made the first move,

279
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,083
an all-out war with
them isn't far off.

280
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,166
An all-out war, huh?

281
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,958
[MCGILLIS] We will continue
to need your assistance

282
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,333
in this conflict.

283
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,208
Tekkadan's already
promised you our support.

284
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,166
We stand behind
that... like always.

285
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,750
Something the matter?

286
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,375
Returns not worth the risk?

287
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,625
[ORGA]
It's not that.

288
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,041
I've asked before,

289
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,625
but why the hell do you think
so highly of Tekkadan?

290
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,833
If there was a
Gjallarhorn civil war,

291
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:42,791
I honestly doubt that
we'd be much help to you.

292
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,041
I've been impressed with you

293
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,875
ever since the first time I saw
your people fighting on Mars.

294
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,250
Why?

295
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,125
[MCGILLIS]
Seeing the actions of young men

296
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,208
piloting Gundam Frames and
fighting with so much vitality,

297
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:01,208
I saw the likeness of Agnika
Kaieru in your group.

298
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,291
[ORGA]
Agnika?

299
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,916
There's something
I'm quite certain of.

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,791
Provided I can secure the
assistance of Tekkadan,

301
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:10,541
I know beyond a doubt
that I can attain

302
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,000
the highest position
in Gjallarhorn.

303
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,875
And when that day
finally arrives,

304
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:18,875
all authority over the
Gjallarhorn Mars Branch

305
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,708
will be transferred to Tekkadan.

306
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,041
What?

307
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,375
Mars has been colonized
by all the economic blocs.

308
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,041
However, it is Gjallarhorn
who actually coordinates

309
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,125
and governs those colonies.

310
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,500
And if Tekkadan were ever
to obtain that power,

311
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:37,000
well, my friend, such an
event would allow you

312
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,500
to control all of Mars.

313
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,583
We'd rule over Mars, huh?

314
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,916
Yes, that's right.

315
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,291
Your people will become
the sovereign of Mars.

316
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,583
The sovereign of... Mars...

317
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,583
[TAKAKI] C'mon Fuka,
you need to eat something.

318
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,500
Hey, Takaki.

319
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:00,416
The day that we took this
picture, do you remember it?

320
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,458
[TAKAKI] It was the day we
decided on as Aston's birthday.

321
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,125
I remember you making
him a massive feast.

322
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:10,375
And if recall, Aston opened
up a little that day.

323
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:15,041
[ASTON]
I honestly wish... that I'd...

324
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:19,208
...never met any of you guys...

325
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,791
Because...

326
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,875
Takaki?

327
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,250
Do you think...

328
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,250
...it would have been better
if we weren't friends?

329
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,625
[FUKA]
Huh?

330
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,333
It's just that I...

331
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,375
I wanted more good
times together...

332
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,625
And yet, because we
had those times,

333
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:43,750
I made Aston suffer
in his last moments...

334
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:44,666
Because of me...

335
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,875
[FUKA]
Don't talk like that!

336
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,208
I had so much fun when the
three of us were together.

337
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,916
Just you, me, and Aston.

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,791
I never wanna
forget those times.

339
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,500
[TAKAKI]
Fuka...

340
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,333
[FUKA]
So please,

341
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,333
you have to promise
not to leave me behind

342
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,500
with all of those memories.

343
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,916
[ZACK]
Jeez, this was so boring!

344
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,125
Our first time on Earth,
and now we're heading home

345
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,666
without having
done anything fun.

346
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,875
Hey! Stop acting like Akihiro.

347
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,791
What's gotten into you?
Are trying to bulk up?

348
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:26,916
Shut up!

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,291
I have to give my
training 110%,

350
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,750
or else I'll get in
Mr. Mikazuki's way.

351
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,583
Oh, so it's "Mr.
Mikazuki" now, huh?

352
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,916
[HUSH]
You got a problem with that?

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,416
[ZACK]
Nope, no problems here.

354
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,541
I think it's important to
respect the chain of command.

355
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:46,666
[HUSH yelps]

356
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,250
Here.

357
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,083
Since you're workin' so hard,
I thought I would help you out.

358
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:55,000
[HUSH] Thanks, man...
but I think I got it.

359
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,500
[EUGENE] Sovereign of Mars?
What does that mean?

360
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,208
[CHAD] Well, a sovereign is
a real bigshot, isn't it?

361
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,416
Why transfer the powers of
the Gjallarhorn Mars Branch?

362
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,333
Hold on, guys. Jeez,
my brain can't keep up.

363
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,250
So whaddya wanna do, Orga?

364
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,833
To be completely honest,

365
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,958
I may take him up
on it to accept.

366
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,416
But, Boss!

367
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,625
[ORGA] Considering your goal
about Mars's independence,

368
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,208
it's probably the best shot
we're ever gonna get.

369
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,958
Yes, but...

370
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,125
[MERRIBIT]
Wait.

371
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,500
But how would that
effect us and Teiwaz?

372
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,166
[ORGA]
Would that cause a problem?

373
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,541
Yes, a big one!

374
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,208
If Tekkadan grows too
large too quickly,

375
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,708
it might cause outsiders
to see us as the top group.

376
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,083
You're right.

377
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,958
I'll see what Naze
has to say about it.

378
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,750
Then I'll decide what
needs to be done.

379
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:46,083
But right now, I just have
one thing on my mind.

380
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:49,083
We've always been looked down
upon, treated like garbage,

381
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,833
and taken advantage
of our entire lives.

382
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,750
But now we can be kings.

383
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,833
It can all be ours.
Power and reputation.

384
00:17:57,916 --> 00:18:00,458
Come on, can't you all see it?

385
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,125
The ultimate finish for us.

386
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,791
[ORGA]
So whaddya think?

387
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,541
If that's what you want.

388
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,000
Mikazuki!

389
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,041
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

390
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,458
Yeah, uh... I don't
get any of this,

391
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:18,291
but as Deputy Boss,
I'll follow the boss's orders.

392
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,875
Same goes for me.

393
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,583
Maybe you should
think this through.

394
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,833
I'm sorry, but
I can't go with you.

395
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,416
What is that supposed to mean?

396
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,166
It means... that I'm
going to quit Tekkadan.

397
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,083
You sayin' that you won't be
joining us on this, Takaki?

398
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,750
Sovereign of Mars...

399
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,583
I'm not sure what
the job would entail,

400
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,916
but it's safe to say more people
would end up dying, right?

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,791
[EUGENE] Hey, don't
start with that again.

402
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,791
[TAKAKI] I totally understand
that the only reason

403
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,291
Boss is going
through all of this

404
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,791
is because he wants to
give us a better future.

405
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,041
But... I...

406
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,166
I don't wanna make Fuka cry.

407
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,916
Being sovereign of Mars

408
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,875
might mean we'd attain
some great happiness,

409
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,875
but that would mean
throwing away the happiness

410
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,083
we already have
right here and now.

411
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:14,291
And I... I just can't
bring myself to do that.

412
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,000
Takaki...

413
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,125
I understand.

414
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:19,916
What?

415
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,083
But, Boss, we can't just--

416
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,291
[ORGA] What right do
I have to stop him?

417
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,083
Thanks for all
you've done for us.

418
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,000
And for stickin' with
Tekkadan this long, Takaki.

419
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,750
Boss, I don't...

420
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,875
[TAKAKI]
Thank you... for everything.

421
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,625
[CHAD] The boss said
he's gonna ask around

422
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,125
and find you a good job
right here on Earth.

423
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,541
Sorry about this. I just--

424
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,041
[CHAD]
Don't be.

425
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:51,791
The Earth Branch was saved
thanks to all of your hard work.

426
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,708
We're family and we're
always gonna be that way

427
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:56,375
[MIKAZUKI]
No, we aren't.

428
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,875
The only family that you need
to worry about is Fuka.

429
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,916
We can take care of
ourselves without you.

430
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,000
[AKIHIRO]
Don't mind him.

431
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,250
[CHAD]
Yeah...

432
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:14,583
For him, that's just his
way of showing kindness.

433
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,125
From now on, don't
think about Tekkadan.

434
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,250
Just treasure your life
with your sister.

435
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,333
Also...

436
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,916
...you were a good
friend to Aston.

437
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,500
Thanks for that.

438
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,125
[KUDELIA] I'm heading
back home to Mars.

439
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,125
[sighs]

440
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,333
[MAKANAI]
I understand.

441
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,958
Without the proper knowledge,

442
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,125
we can't make
the right decisions.

443
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,250
I wish we had more time because
there are so many things

444
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,250
I wanna learn from
you, Mr. Makanai.

445
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,083
However, even if my
lack of knowledge

446
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,916
leads me to the
wrong conclusions,

447
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,750
the time has already come for
us to make some hard choices.

448
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,958
For both me and Tekkadan.

449
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,250
[MAKANAI]
That young lady has become

450
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,541
quite the force of nature.

451
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,583
Even so, when all
is said and done,

452
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,416
I can't guarantee that you
and your friends will like

453
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,791
what awaits you down the
path you have chosen.

454
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,208
[AKIHIRO]
This everything?

455
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:18,583
[CHAD] Yeah, these are
all the personal effects

456
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,958
of the dead Earth
Branch members.

457
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,625
I'll leave the rest to Takaki.

458
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,500
At this point, it feels
like Earth has become

459
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:29,875
something of a
second home to us.

460
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,416
[CHAD]
It's strange.

461
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,041
When I was Human Debris,

462
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,833
I never thought I'd ever find a
place where I truly belonged.

463
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,541
[AKIHIRO]
Yeah, I hear ya.

464
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:46,625
[AZEE]
Hmm?

465
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,541
[AZEE]
Where's Akihiro?

466
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,166
[LAFTER]
Hmm...

467
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,500
Hey, is everything okay?

468
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,708
He thought of Aston
as his little brother,

469
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,125
so I guess it's
still tough for him.

470
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,833
But he's okay.

471
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,000
No, not him. How're you?

472
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,250
Huh?

473
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,541
Don't worry about it.
I won't tell Naze.

474
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,875
[LAFTER grunts]

475
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:12,083
[LAFTER] It's not like that!
We're just... uh...

476
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,708
For now, whaddya say we keep
this between you and me?

477
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,541
[AZEE]
Heh. Sure.

478
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,250
[ORGA]
Once we're on Mars,

479
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,750
I'll be back to
business meetings

480
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,958
with those stuffy execs, again.

481
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,375
I see.

482
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,291
[MIKAZUKI]
When Takaki quit...

483
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,958
Huh? What about it?

484
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:36,541
[MIKAZUKI] I'm not sure why...
but I was kind of...

485
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,083
...relieved in a way.

486
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,750
[gasps]

487
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,750
Which I don't understand.
Do you know why?

488
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,416
That's because...

489
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,541
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

490
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,458
Uhh... Forget it.

491
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:53,041
We'll find out the answers
to everything soon enough.

492
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:57,833
I know it. We just have
to get to our goal, okay?

493
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,791
Seems a lot farther
than I thought.

494
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,333
Sorry.

495
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:06,666
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

496
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,625
You don't need to apologize.

497
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,916
Right.

498
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,750
Hey there, big brother!

499
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,208
Hey, Fuka.

500
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:13,166
I figured you'd come home
soon, so I waited for you.

501
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,583
How was work, today?

502
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,250
Uh. Well...

503
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,916
[TAKAKI]
Come on.

504
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,541
Let's go home.

505
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,583
[CHAD]
Next time on

506
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:30,416
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded</i>
<i>Orphans</i> , "Vidar Rising."

507
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,166
To protect the place I belong,

508
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,083
I have to start training again
as soon as we get back to Mars.

509
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:37,916
Akihiro, let me do
sit-ups with you!
