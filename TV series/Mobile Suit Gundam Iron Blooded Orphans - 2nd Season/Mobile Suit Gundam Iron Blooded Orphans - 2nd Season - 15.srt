1
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,208
[MERRIBIT] For possessing
a banned weapon,

2
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,291
the Turbines have been branded
an illegal organization.

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:21,333
Naze firmly tells Orga
to "Stay out of it."

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:23,625
The battle of a man
striving to protect

5
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:26,375
his treasured family
begins here.

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:33,291
[MCMURDO] How many times
do I have to repeat myself?

7
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:35,000
Gjallarhorn has
labeled the Turbines

8
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,333
as an illegal organization.

9
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,541
If we do anything
to assist them,

10
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,208
we'll all be caught in the
crossfire and crushed.

11
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,083
Tell that to Orga Itsuka!

12
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,208
--Hang on!
--We understand. I'll tell him.

13
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,125
Uh?!

14
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,375
Mr. Mikazuki!

15
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,583
I didn't expect you
to give in so easily.

16
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,791
Well, I can see it in your eyes.

17
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,375
Nothin's gonna change your mind.

18
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:57,541
[MCMURDO]
Hm...

19
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,375
[MCMURDO]
It's inevitable, I'm afraid.

20
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:04,916
When organizations grow,
rifts are bound to happen.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,125
Thus, the same holds true
for Gjallarhorn and Teiwaz.

22
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,500
So, what do you want?

23
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:17,625
Old Man, I want to return
my Sakazuki cup.

24
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,416
[MCMURDO]
Hmm...

25
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,250
[NAZE]
I'm disbanding the Turbines,

26
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,833
and I need to ask one last
favor of you before it's--

27
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,541
[MCMURDO] You want me to look
after your girls, right?

28
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:30,041
I'll make sure they can join
groups directly under me.

29
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,416
Though, I can't promise you

30
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,583
they'll all end up
on the same team.

31
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,750
I am in your debt.

32
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,750
[MCMURDO]
Ha! Do you have any idea

33
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:42,083
how many times I've stomached
your selfish requests?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,083
[NAZE]
This will be my last.

35
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,500
[ORGA]
Damn it!

36
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:22,666
We all know that Naze
is being framed,

37
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,208
but instead of helping,

38
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,625
the old man chose to act like
he's not even a part of it!

39
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,708
The Arianrhod Fleet is
breathing down his neck!

40
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,250
I've got no choice!

41
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,416
Boss, please...

42
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,625
If you do anything
to help the Turbines,

43
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,833
Tekkadan will also be seen
as a criminal group.

44
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:39,708
Mr. Naze was well aware of that,

45
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,083
which is why he told
you to leave it be.

46
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,208
Don't you think I
already know that?!

47
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,041
But I can't just stand
here and do nothing!

48
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,958
Your actions might
crush Tekkadan.

49
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,208
[ORGA growls]

50
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,166
Can you blame me?

51
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,291
Am I wrong for doing what I
can to try an' save him?

52
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,750
I just...!

53
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,500
[SHINO]
This isn't like you, Orga.

54
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,083
We're supposed to
keep movin' forward

55
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,500
no matter what, aren't we?

56
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,291
[ORGA]
Yes, that's true... but...

57
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,375
Where are the Turbines
right now?

58
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,833
At a relay station outside
the range of Ariadne.

59
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,583
He's probably planning to let
the non-combatants escape

60
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,958
while they can.

61
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,041
However, Gjallarhorn's
fleet is closing in on them.

62
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,208
[SHINO] In that case,
I guess it's a job for us.

63
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,083
[gasps]

64
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,625
Wait, what're you...?

65
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,916
We'll use my Ryusei Team, along
with Akihiro's Muscle team,

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,208
and take those escaped girls
into protective custody.

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,666
Hey, Shino. What do you
mean by "Muscle Team"?

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,875
It's a helluva lot better
than a lame ass name like

69
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,208
Second Unit, right?

70
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,833
[MERRIBIT] Do you understand
what you're saying?

71
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,416
If Tekkadan were to
take any action--

72
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,166
[SHINO] We'll be okay as long as
we avoid fighting them directly.

73
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,333
Huh?

74
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,541
[AKIHIRO]
We'd just be helping civilians.

75
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,458
I cannot consent to that.

76
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,000
It's imperative that Gjallarhorn

77
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,791
not find a trace of Tekkadan
there. You can't take the ship.

78
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,416
We figured you'd say that.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,416
We'll take my Ryusei-Go,
Akihiro's Guision,

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,833
and Ride's Riden-Go,
and head in first.

81
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:05,791
[MERRIBIT]
"First"?

82
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,083
[SHINO]
That's right.

83
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,458
We'll carry Ryusei-Go and
Raiden-Go on a Kutan

84
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,458
with a rocket booster.

85
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,375
While we're at it,
we'll equip Gusion

86
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,291
with the latest booster pack.

87
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,375
Yamagi and the others are
working on it as we speak.

88
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,583
Put the Kutan controller
on Riden-Go!

89
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,583
And don't forget to put
that sub on Ryusei-Go!

90
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,416
You sure about this?

91
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,458
[SHINO] We're just doing
an operational test.

92
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,625
One that takes place near
a certain relay station.

93
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,625
And if we happen to
pick up non-combatants

94
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,166
escaping a conflict,
then so be it.

95
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,583
This way we won't be disobeying
Naze's orders. Whaddya think?

96
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,125
Please, Boss, let us do this.

97
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:47,166
All of us owe the Turbines big
time. We're in this together.

time for Iok Kujan's fleet

to commence their operation.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,250
Unfortunately, there's nothing
we can do about the matter.

104
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,166
Tell me, did you contact
our comrades?

105

Everything is going as planned.

[MCGILLIS]
Glad to hear it.

Now, let's get started on
what we should be doing.

[ISURUGI]
Yes, sir.

calculated the trajectory,

If you guys are done we
should really get going.

the cargo ships.

156
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,000
Leave the Arianrhod to me.

157
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,541
But Naze!

158
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,500
We still have a bit of time
before the fleet arrives here.

159
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,958
As soon as I see you guys have
reached a safe distance

160
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,166
away from the danger,
I'll turn and run, too.

161
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,250
[AMIDA]
Even so, this is far too much

162
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,625
for me to let you take
on by yourself.

163
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,458
I'll just have to back you up.

164
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,416
Amida...

165
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,208
But, Ma'am...

166
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:33,083
Azee and Lafter, you'll be in
charge of protecting the family.

167
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,833
It's true Mobile
Suits are fast,

168
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,958
but their firearms can't
penetrate a ship's armor.

169
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:41,375

evacuate without any panic.

[BOTH gasp]

171
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,625
Let's get behind
the transport ships.

172
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,875
Huh?

173
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,041
Lafter?

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,375
It'll be okay.
I'll protect my family.

175
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,958
I'll keep them safe
no matter what!

176
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,041

Good girls.

177
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:13,750
Keep moving forward,
and don't look back.

178
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,416
Let's head out, Amida!

179
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,708
[AMIDA]
Got it.

180
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,750
[AMIDA]
Why is it that women can

181
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,750
see through a man's
lies so easily?

182
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,791
It's funny how men
can be so obvious

183
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,291
when they're telling lies.

184
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,250
[NAZE] Then why do women fall
for the lies of these men?

185
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,708
Because they aren't
genuinely in love with them.

186
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:44,333
You're planning to take sole
responsibility, aren't you?

187
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,208
You were going to
say you transported

188
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,375
the illegal weapon by yourself.

189
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,500
And then, you were planning
to surrender to Gjallarhorn

190
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,958
and sacrifice your life
to save everyone else.

191
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:58,666
Then your precious Tekkadan
would be saved as well.

192
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,416
But if you go alone, you'd just
be surrounded by Mobile Suits

193
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,333
and beaten to a pulp.

194
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,291
I'll be your vanguard.

195
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,416
So she sees through
everything, does she?

196
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,083
It looks like I really am loved.

197
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:18,041
[CHIEF MECHANIC] Seems as though
that Arianrhod task force

198
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,458
is advancing on
the Turbines' base.

199
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,791
This is really about to happen.

200
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,416
[ATRA]
I wonder if Lafter and Azee

201
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,583
are gonna be okay out there.

202

No way to know for sure. But...

But, what?

204
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,916
Orga won't just stand
back and do nothing.

205

[ORGA]
I've never hated the vastness

206

[SOLDIER 40C] Confirming
the Ahab Wave frequency.

It's the Turbines'
armored assault ship.

So, they're fighting back.

Their bravery is commendable,
I'll give them that.

A signal flare from

It's a cease-fire!

is settled!

00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,583
Out of ammo? Already?

312
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:58,750
[beeping]

313
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,291
Lafter!

314
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,541
[LAFTER gasping]

315
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,666
[gasps]

316
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,041
[LAFTER] Akihiro?!
What are you doing here?!

317
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,583
Do I need a reason?

318
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,833
Now get going. We'll buy
you the time you need.

319
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,291
[Lafter]
"We"?

320
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,000
You heard him, he said "we"!

321
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,666
Shino?

322
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,750
[RIDE] I'm glad we made
it in time, Ms. Azee!

323
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,041
[AZEE]
Ride!

324
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,750
[SHINO] Get out of here!
We'll handle these guys!

325
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,750
[yelling]

326
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,833
Your skills have improved.

327
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,291
You can chalk it up to me
having a great teacher!

328
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,375
[gasps]

329
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,916
[SHINO]
Stay on guard, Ride!

330
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,083
[RIDE]
You just ruined my moment!

331
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:57,666
[AKIHIRO] We've got this,
protect your family!

332
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,833
But you--!

333
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,625
I have your back--trust me.

334
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,208
[gasps] Akihiro...

335
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,083
[AZEE]
Lafter! Let's go!

336
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:07,916
[LAFTER]
Akihiro!

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
Huh?

338
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:14,375
I'm gonna squeeze you real hard
the next time I see you, okay?!

339
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,875
What the hell did I do to
make her wanna strangle me?

340
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:21,708
[NAZE] Damn it, Orga... I told
you to stay out of this one.

341
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,083
Heh.

342
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,291
[AMIDA] I can almost see you
smiling in there, Naze.

343
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,458
[JULIETTA]
You better pay attention!

344
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,166
[JULIETTA]
How did she counter those?!

345
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,458
[JULIETTA]
Is that...?

346
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,291
She's already hit me five times!
How can that even be?

347
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,083
You're a tough one!

348
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,916
[JULIETTA gasping]

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,833
[AMIDA]
You have nice moves...

350
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,291
...but they're becoming
a bit predictable!

351
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,958
[NAZE] I won't let any
more people get killed.

352
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:02,333
I refuse, even if it means
us all getting arrested!

353
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,333
[SOLDIER 40E] The enemy ship
has emerged from the smoke!

354
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,750
[SOLDIER 40D]
Signal spotted!

355
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,166
They're surrendering, sir!

356
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,416
Sorry, but I can't
agree to that.

357
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,083
To stand shoulder to shoulder
with Master Rustal,

358
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:16,416
I must have the resolve to
make ruthless decisions

359
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,041
and see them through!

360
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,000
All ships, open fire on
the enemy vessel!

361
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,583
They attacked?

362
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,916
So, you won't even let
us surrender, huh?

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,375
Well, then, I'll just have to
crush the head of the snake!

364
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,000
I am the sword of Master Rustal!

365
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,333
To be of use to him,

366
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,583
I can't allow myself to fall
behind anyone else!

367
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,458
[AMIDA]
That's it?

368
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,958
That's the extent
of your resolve?

369
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,875
[gasping]

370
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,333
As long as you rely on
someone else's support,

371
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,041
you'll never be able
to reach the top!

372
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,500
[AMIDA]
Ha, ha!

373
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,708
It's not over yet!

374
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,375
[JULIETTA]
Why won't she stop?!

375
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,416
Why can't I stop her?!

376
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,041
What's this difference
between us?!

377
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,875
What is she motivated by
that makes her so good?

378
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,500
Isn't it obvious?!

379
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,041
[AMIDA]
To shine brilliantly!

380
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,541
[AMIDA]
Naze...

381
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:42,583
I hate to say it, Darling, but
you can't blossom without us.

382
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,750
Which is why I'm going to...

383
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,500
I am not going to give up!

384
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,833
[SOLDIER 40B] There's still
an enemy Mobile Suit

385
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,125
on a collision course
with our ship!

386
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,583
[OPERATOR 40A]
Where are the escort Suits?!

387
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,833
[IOK]
Is it... planning to ram us?

388
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,125
[grunts] Dáinsleif team!

389
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,041
Julietta's in the line of fire!

390
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,333
She can dodge it
in that machine.

391
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,708
Now fire!

392
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,416
Did... we do it?

393
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,625
We did!

394
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,125
[JULIETTA groans]
Dammit, Master Iok!

395
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,666
The hell were you thinking?!

396
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,208
[gasps]

397
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,250
[JULIETTA]
I... feel relieved...

398
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,083
That can't be.

399
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,791
[AMIDA]
Naze...

400
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,208
I'll show you...

401
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:38,083
...the most brilliant
light you've even seen.

402
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,958
That's dealt with, so let's
focus on that assault ship.

403
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,375
[OPERATOR 40B]
Master Iok!

404
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,000
[CREW groaning]

405
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,958
[NAZE whimpers]

406
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,625
I see you, Amida.

407
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:55,583
[NAZE]
I won't let you go alone.

408
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,500
Understand, Amida?

409
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:04,458
[NAZE]
Women are the sun, you know.

410
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,541
And if the sun doesn't
keep shining its light,

411
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,916
we men will wither and die.

412
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,625
[NAZE]
Always smile for me, Amida.

413
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,750
Strongly, boldly.

414
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,250
Flash your brilliant smile...

415
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,750
[NAZE] If you can do that
for me, I promise you,

416
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:32,166
I'll be able to keep
my head up at all times.

417
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,500
As long as I bask
in your sunlight...

418
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,208
[NAZE]
...I can...

419
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:07,125
[inaudible]

420
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,541
[ORGA]
Brother...

421
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,625
[LAFTER]
Next time on

422
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,541
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans,</i>

423
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,708
"Natural For a Human."

424
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,833
Darling and Ma'am never got
a chance to tell me what


425
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,708
the color of this
feeling was. [laughs]


426
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:38,250
I'm gonna squeeze you real hard!
