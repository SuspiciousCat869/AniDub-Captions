1
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,333
[HUSH] All right, as soon
as we drop these guys off,

2
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,250
I'll come right back
to pick you up.

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,416
No need. Atra's
comin' by later.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,625
[HUSH]
But I was--

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,583
Don't you have some
training to do, Hush?

6
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:23,458
Uh.

7
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,750
Yes, sir!

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,625
[SAKURA] Are you positive that
you didn't need to go with him?

9
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,541
There's nothing I can
do over there, yet.

10
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:40,125
Honestly, I wish I could
keep you here forever.

11
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,833
[RUSTAL] I'm told that
you've finally finished

12
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,291
regulating the system that
was giving you trouble.

13
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,750
That's good.

14
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,500
Because I have a
mission for you.

15
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:55,208
Ever since the Dort incident,

16
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,333
colony independence
uprisings have intensified.

17
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,291
We thought allowing them
to have defense forces

18
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,666
would bring them down,
but now it's up to us.

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,958
There's someone funneling money
and arms to the activists.

20
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,291
And as long as--

21
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,083
[VIDAR] It doesn't matter
who's behind the scenes.

22
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,416
There are armed parties out
there disturbing the peace.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,958
Tell me, what other reason
does Gjallarhorn need

24
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,416
to bear down its
might upon them?

25
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,791
You're certainly chatty today.

26
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,750
[VIDAR] I suppose I'm
just in high spirits.

27
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:30,166
My friend and I finally
get to fight together.

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,791
[YUKINOJO]
That's it! Nice and easy!

29
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,541
[DERMA] Have they decided
who's gonna pilot these?

30
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,416
[YUKINOJO] Of the three
suits that came back,

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,916
Chad's supposed to
be the pilot of one.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,875
I don't know about
the other two.

33
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,833
Then let me pilot one of them.

34
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,083
Huh?

35
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,208
It's a Man Rodi we
snagged from the Brewers,

36
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,750
that group you were workin' for.

37
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,958
Wouldn't it bring up
bad memories?

38
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,250
For those of us
called Human Debris,

39
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,125
these were pretty
much our coffins.

40
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,083
But if Aston piloted
one of them, so can I.

41
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,000
[DANTE]
Akihiro figured you'd say that,

42
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,875
so he's already made
the arrangements.

43
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,375
[DERMA]
Mr. Dante?

44
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,500
I'll be piloting the other one.

45
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,625
Whaddya say we show 'em

46
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,791
what former Human
Debris are made of?

47
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,916
Yeah.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,625
[ZACK] Man! There's just no
end to all of this work!

49
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:51,666
This is Hell for mechanics...

50
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,250
I think it's fun.

51
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,208
Then you're a weirdo.
I've had it up to here with--

52
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,333
All right, Dane,
enough slacking off!

53
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,333
Get back to work, wouldja?!

54
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,541
[EUGENE]
Hey!

55
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,833
Have you finished tuning
up those Sheedins

56
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,458
that came in the other day?

57
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,750
Yeah, finishing up as we speak!

58
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,458
[EUGENE] Good, we'll be gettin'
more from Teiwaz tomorrow.

59
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,416
Huh?! We're getting more?!

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,333
[EUGENE] That's right, so we've
got no time to sit around!

61
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:14,875
[DANE]
Right.

62
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,208
Yes, sir...

63
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,375
[SHINO] Hey, Deputy Boss,
got some news for ya.

64
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,291
The guys are back from the farm.

65
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,916
So this is the king's throne
I've heard so much about.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,416
[EUGENE]
Yeah.

67
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Well, no turnin' back now.

68
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,916
[EUGENE] You were
thinkin' of turning back?

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,875
Nah, I was just
babblin' to myself!

70
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,666
We don't know how Orga's
meeting on the Saisei will go,

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,458
so all we can do
is wait for now.

72
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:46,833
Well, in the meantime,

73
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,041
let's make sure to
whip these grunts

74
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,125
into proper fighting shape.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,458
[grunts]

76
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,583
It's fast for something so big!

77
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,291
I'm just getting started!

78
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,333
Chad sure is pretty amped up.

79
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:09,041
He had a pretty rough time
of it back on Earth.

80
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,625
Though the same could be
said for that rookie.

81
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,875
He went straight into training

82
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,458
the moment they all
got back from the farm.

83
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,916
But it looks like he's
shaping up nicely.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,208
At the rate they're going,

85
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,750
they'll master their
training with the Shidens

86
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,333
in no time flat.

87
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:25,250
[AZEE] Once that happens, our
mission here will be complete.

88
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,666
[LAFTER]
Yeah.

89
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,583
[MERRIBIT] Here's the a list of
all the equipment we recovered

90
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,083
from the Earth Branch.

91
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,166
[YUKINOJO]
Much appreciated.

92
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,833
We don't have many
people who can handle

93
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,250
this kind of
detail-oriented work.

94
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,541
I wonder how many more
arms we'll have to add.

95
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,750
[YUKINOJO] If my hunch
is right, enough to win.

96
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Though, I can understand
why you're worried.

97
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,666
But think of it this way, with
all of the firepower we have,

98
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,958
no one's gonna mess
with Tekkadan now.

99
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,583
By the way, have you
heard from Yamagi?

100
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,625
[MERRIBIT] Yes, they arrived
at the Saisei a while ago.

101
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,625
I wanted to ask you more
about the Mobile Suit

102
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,291
we found at the mine.

103
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,916
It's another Gundam
Frame, isn't it?

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,166
Yeah?

105
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,625
That makes three,
with Barbatos and Gusion.

106
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,208
Mobile Suits named after demons

107
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,875
keep finding their
way to Tekkadan.

108
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,125
I have a bad feeling about this.

109
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,125
[gasps]

110
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,416
There ya go
overthinking things.

111
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,083
Oh, stop!

112
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,625
[ECO]
Chief!

113
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,166
[CHIEF MECHANIC]
Hey, you're here!

114
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,666
[YAMAGI]
It's been a while.

115
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,333
[CHIEF MECHANIC] How are the
Lupus and Full City doing?

116
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,000
[YAMAGI]
They seem to be doing fine.

117
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,125
Though, we don't
really call them

118
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,958
by those names much anymore.

119
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,500
Any luck with this one?

120
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,541
We tried everything
we possibly could,

121
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,666
but we just couldn't
get it to work.

122
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,041
The frame of a Mobile Suit

123
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,833
wouldn't degrade in
a mere 300 years.

124
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,250
Their reactors last
even a bit longer.

125
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,750
The reason you
couldn't get it to work

126
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,625
was because the reactor
was in sleep mode.

127
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:59,333
We're running it through its
startup sequence right now.

128
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,458
Oh, right.

129
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,125
About that mobile
worker-like thing

130
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,875
you sent up along with this.

131
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:07,375
there wasn't anything in the
Teiwaz database that matched it.

132
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,208
Oh, is that so?

133
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,750
[MECHANIC A]
Chief!

134
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,458
We are now connected to the
reactor's controls. Booting up.

135
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,875
And here we go!

136
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:20,333
Fantastic. I've got the
frequency of the Ahab Wave.

137
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,875
And its name appears to be...

138
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,166
Gundam Flauros.

139
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,708
[MCMURDO]
So he's signing over the power

140
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,083
to govern Mars to them.

141
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,541
This is another huge deal
you've landed for us.

142
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:38,833
[NAZE] Apparently, McGillis
Fareed and Tekkadan

143
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,625
made this secret
agreement while on Earth.

144
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:42,916
[EXECUTIVE A]
Hey,

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,875
is Gjallarhorn as a whole
on board with this?

146
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:47,083
[EXECUTIVE B] The last thing we
wanna do is get tangled up

147
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,791
in their internal affairs.

148
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,750
And not to mention,
until recently,

149
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,208
we hadn't even heard
of this McGillis cha--

150
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,000
[JASLEY]
Hold it.

151
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
Come on, gentlemen, let's
not get ahead of ourselves.

152
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:57,666
We all know that we have

153
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,875
far more pressing
matters to discuss.

154
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,750
Such as, saving face.

155
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,458
Hate to break it to you,
but Tekkadan's nothin' more

156
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,541
than a charity case
for the old man.

157
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,166
Those kids had the audacity
to negotiate a deal

158
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,000
with Gjallarhorn and accept
it without consulting us.

159
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,500
Listen well, Naze.

160
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,000
There's a procedure to
these kinds of things.

161
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,041
Are you just gonna keep ignoring
protocol for these little punks

162
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,250
and allow them to
embarrass the old man?

163
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,375
Well?

164
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,583
That's not--

165
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,916
[MCMURDO] Jasley makes
a valid point, Naze.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,125
I don't like trouble
dropping in my lap.

167
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,416
Especially when it's a problem

168
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,958
I wasn't previously
consulted about.

169
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,750
But we can benefit from this.

170
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,791
If this arrangement
lets us take a cut

171
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,458
of all business done on Mars,

172
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:42,166
it'll be a huge
moneymaker for Teiwaz.

173
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,916
But, Old Man!

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,833
[NAZE]
You've my word.

175
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,250
Should the affair with Tekkadan

176
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,625
cause you even the
slightest bit of grief,

177
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,291
you can cut them off
without any resistance.

178
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,541
That's how committed Orga is.

179
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,708
Who cares about that jackass?!

180
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,791
We're talking about you!

181
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:02,375
[NAZE] Should that happen,
I will pay with my life.

182
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,666
Don't worry, Old Man,

183
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,291
I'll protect Teiwaz's
interests in my own way.

184
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,291
[MCMURDO] Yes, take any measures
you see fit to prepare us

185
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,166
for a possible fallout.

186
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,250
Just like always.

187
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,041
[AMIDA] Judging from that
sinister grin of yours,

188
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,208
I assume that you
had a good day?

189
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,208
[JASLEY] It's rare for you to
start a conversation with me.

190
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,333
What, did you get tired
of that loser Naze

191
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,125
and wanna be my pet now?

192
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,708
Oh, you wish. Don't
even joke about that.

193
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,041
[JASLEY]
What do you see in a playboy

194
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,208
who uses women and kids
to climb to the top?

195
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,791
Someone who only sees
women as things to be used

196
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,958
wouldn't understand.

197
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,625
I assure you Naze
isn't using us.

198
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:53,000
If anything, he's our home.

199
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,250
If you ask me, that sure
sounds like somethin'

200
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,791
a woman would say.

201
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,708
And you sound like
a typical man.

202
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,833
We Turbine girls were once
used by men like you.

203
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,833
We were forced to
do dangerous work

204
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,833
and the risk was hardly worth
the pay we were getting.

205
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:10,000
We Turbins are a group
of girls Naze took in

206
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,083
out of the goodness
of his heart.

207
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:16,750
Though, I suppose a man like you
wouldn't know about that at all.

208
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,041
You're absolutely right.

209
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,041
I'm not the kind of man
that makes his girl

210
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,666
fight in a Mobile Suit.

211
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,666
There, you see? I told
you you wouldn't get it.

212
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,541
[NAZE]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

213
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,708
[AMIDA chuckles]

214
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,041
[AMIDA]
Oh, darling,

215
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,250
waiting for you is just
one of my many pleasures.

216
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:33,666
[JASLEY grumbles]

217
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,833
Where's Orga?

218
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,125
Patiently waiting for you.

219
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,500
[door opens]

220
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,125
Hey, brother.

221
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,083
[NAZE] There's certainly never
a dull moment with you around.

222
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,458
[ORGA]
Please forgive me.

223
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,583
Why are you apologizing?

224
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,375
You made that decision for
your family, didn't you?

225
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,541
That's not the point!
I caused trouble for--

226
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,583
You've caused trouble for me
more times than I can count.

227
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,458
Don't start the
goody-goody act now.

228
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,041
But you--

229
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,375
[AMIDA] You need to watch your
back from here on out. Got it?

230
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:06,916
Yeah.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,083
Not all of Teiwaz's top dogs
are as enlightened as others.

232
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,666
It's safe to assume there'll
be some kinda move against us.

233
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,833
Orga.

234
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:19,208
This is the last time I laugh
it off and forgive you.

235
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,750
I can't betray the old man.

236
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,500
Right.

237
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,541
[IOK] Have you finished
loading your machine?

238
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,791
[VIDAR]
Yes.

239
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,333
[JULIETTA] This will be
our first opportunity

240
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,333
to see what you're capable of.

241
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,958
For your sake, I hope
that fancy mask of yours

242
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,125
isn't just for show.

243
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,250
Hmm?

244
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,750
Which reminds me of
something you said earlier.

245
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:45,083
You mentioned you had
a friend who fought for pride.

246
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,916
So what is that
you fight for then?

247
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,333
[VIDAR]
Revenge.

248
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,250
This is a crucial
mission entrusted to us

249
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:56,583
by Master Rustal!

250
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,708
Enough with the small talk!

251
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,666
Now... to battle!

252
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,000
[CHAD]
Oh, hey, Pops!

253
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,250
[YUKINOJO]
Hmm?

254
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,625
Ah, Chad, I see
you're feeling better.

255
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:09,875
And from what I hear,

256
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,541
you've upped your game
since being on Earth.

257
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, it's all thanks
to your maintenance.

258
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,791
That Landman Rodi handled
really well out there.

259
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,791
Heh. Come on, none of that.

260
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,916
We'll be counting
on you, ya hear?

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
[CHAD]
Hmm?

262
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,375
[CHAD]
Hmm?

263
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,916
Finally, we're done
dealing with the contracts

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,291
concerning the transfer
of the farm business.

265
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,125
I apologize again for dumping
everything on you like this.

266
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,708
Miss Sakura is there,
so we'll make do somehow.

267
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,166
And the children
from the orphanage

268
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,291
are helpin' us out, too.

269
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,750
It's a shame, though.

270
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,208
Huh?

271
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,666
Miss Kudelia loved spending
time there with the kids.

272
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,791
It's too bad that she won't
be able to anymore.

273
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,958
We'll do everything
we possibly can

274
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,708
to resume our work on the farm.

275
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,541
Hopefully, it'll be soon.

276
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,500
[CUCUBITA]
You'll be in my prayers.

277
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,375
[ATRA]
Here you go, Miss Kudelia.

278
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,500
Thanks a lot, Atra.

279
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,750
I'm sorry, I know you're busy.

280
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,125
Don't worry about it.

281
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,833
You're the busy one, dealing
with all that paperwork.

282
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,083
Just thinking about it
makes my head spin.

283
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:17,583
[HUSH]
Mr. Mikazuki!

284
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,166
Would you like some more food?

285
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,041
Not really, no.

286
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,375
But you--

287
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,541
[ATRA] The two of you have
been joined at the hip

288
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,750
ever since you made
it back from Earth.

289
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,291
Did something happen there?

290
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,500
Yeah. I've been studying
under Mr. Mikazuki.

291
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,041
And it's really annoying me.

292
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,500
Just pretend I'm not here.

293
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,625
--[MIKAZUKI] I said I do--
--[HUSH] I'll get some tea.

294
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,125
Oh, the tea's in the back...

295
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:39,458
He's certainly become
attached to you.

296
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,250
He's becoming a real pest.

297
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,875
[chuckles]

298
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,458
About this plan...

299
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,750
Huh?

300
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,375
Life on the farm,
that's your dream, isn't it?

301
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Mh-hm.

302
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,500
Then...

303
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,750
No.

304
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

305
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,583
[KUDELIA]
Okay then.

306
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,750
I promise to you to keep
your dream safe and sound.

307
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Thanks, I guess.

308
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,500
That's true, Mikazuki,

309
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,041
you'll have to come back
someday and get it.

310
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,625
Miss Atra.

311
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,500
What is going on with you two?

312
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,666
[CHAD]
Hey, guys, it's Pops.

313
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,750
Something's not right.

314
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,958
Whaddya mean?

315
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,416
Well, he doesn't stink anymore.

316
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,750
[KUDELIA] Yeah, that
certainly was a problem.

317
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,416
[ATRA]
It made our eyes water!

318
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,375
He's been a new man since he
started dating Ms. Merribit.

319
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,000
[ATRA]
Yeah.

320
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:27,791
[CHAD]
Huh?

321
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,250
[OTHERS]
Hmm?

322
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,875
You're saying that Ms.
Merribit and Pops are...?

323
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,666
[HUSH] Mr. Mikazuki,
I brought your tea--

324
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,625
--[CHAD] What?
--[HUSH] Whoa!

325
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,333
Don't push yourself too hard.

326
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,250
Mr. Akihiro.

327
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,291
You should also eat
before you start training.

328
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:01,291
Yeah, I would've, but they're
serving bean stew for dinner.

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,041
Besides, now's the time to
push myself to the limit.

330
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,208
Huh?

331
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,791
I'm the one leading
the Youth Corps now.

332
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,916
I'll give it my all for them.

333
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,166
And rise above Takaki,
who stayed on Earth.

334
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,333
[AKIHIRO]
Hmph.

335
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,125
All the more reason
to eat something.

336
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:22,208
Picky eaters don't
become big and strong.

337
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:22,916
Right!

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,916
[CHAD]
Akihiro!

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,250
You're never gonna believe this,

340
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:28,250
but Pops and Ms.
Merribit are dating!

341
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,166
What, you didn't know that?

342
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,750
Oh, I guess it started while
you were still on Earth.

343
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,375
Wait a minute!
You all knew about it?

344
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,458
Why didn't you
tell me anything?!

345
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,333
[AKIHIRO] I really didn't
think we needed to.

346
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,458
[CHAD] I'm still one
of the guys, right?

347
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,166
[ISURUGI] How'd the talks
on the Saisei go?

348
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,708
[ORGA]
Well...

349
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:55,375
I know I won't be causing any
trouble for your people.

350
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,458
[ISURUGI]
Orders from the General.

351
00:15:57,541 --> 00:16:01,250
As of now, you'll have full
access to the Second Pier.

352
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,291
Wait, are you serious?

353
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,958
We don't have nearly enough
ships to fill it up.

354
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,333
[ISURUGI] He must be preparing
you for the future.

355
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,291
There he goes
overestimating us again.

356
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:17,583
That's not what he's doing.
He has high hopes for you.

357
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:20,625
We'll start with an introduction
to Chief Proto Arae.

358
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,041
He is the man in charge of Ares.

359
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,416
And after that,

360
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,541
you'll meet with the
representatives from the blocs.

361
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,083
Then a meeting with
the head of the

362
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,916
Outer Sphere
Development Corporation.

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,541
I'm doin' an entire
week of this?

364
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,625
Is it possible to squeeze in
a quick trip back to Mars?

365
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,958
Maybe later.

366
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,750
For now, we must focus on
defeating Rustal Elion.

367
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,458
Please, bear this in mind:

368
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,708
Everything fails
unless you succeed.

369
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,375
Understood.

370
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,375
Reformations are underway.

371
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:53,041
We've now passed the
point of no return.

372
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,625
I never planned to
turn back anyway.

373
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,166
[KUDELIA] I apologize
for this blunt request,

374
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,708
but is it possible for you to
provide additional funding

375
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,333
for the Admoss Company?

376
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,208
[NOBLISS]
I've been hearing rumors.

377
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,541
Tell me, Kudelia Aina Bernstein,

378
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,708
is it true that you've
managed to secure

379
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,583
safe and reliable
distribution channels?

380
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:13,708
Yes.

381
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,833
I'm planning on
expanding the business,

382
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,791
and I'm moving up my
timeline significantly.

383
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,291
[NOBLISS] Then I'd be more than
happy to lend you my support.

384
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,500
Thank you, Mr. Nobliss.
This means a lo--

385
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,791
Please, you're the Maiden
of Revolution, aren't you?

386
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:32,541
Right now, the SAU and
Oceanian Federation colonies

387
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,791
are seeking freedom.

388
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,000
To that end, vigorous
independence movements

389
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,708
have broken out.

390
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,375
Once the combatants catch
wind of your exploits,

391
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,500
it'll serve to embolden them.

392
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,833
When that happens,
those in my line of work

393
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,166
can provide them
with our services.

394
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,916
Yes, I can assure you
the pleasure is mine.

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,750
Well then, thank you
for financing us.

[CUCUBITA] This is why I despise
those who profit off war.

399
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,875
They're such vile people.

400
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,708
And yet, I still
go to them for money.

401
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,333
Which is far more
vile than they are.

Take your punishment!

Oh? So you dodged, it.

00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm impressed!

405
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,916
Are they really on par with me?!

406
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,583
Don't get in my way, Julietta!

407
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,041
You're the one who's in my
way, sir. Please fall back.

408
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,208
I was just about
to beat those guys!

[IOK'S MAN B]
Please withdraw, Master Iok!

412
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,916
That machine is...

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,333
A friendly IFF... Is that...?

414
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,041
[VIDAR] Look, the battlefield
you were yearning for.

415
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,458
His machine's name is
Vidar. The same as him.

416
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,125
Does that mean he's taken
his Mobile Suit's name,

417
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,458
and completely cast
away his own identity,

418
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,375
all for revenge?

419
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,000
[VIDAR]
Hmm?

420
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,583
Beautiful.

00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,041

[JULIETTA]
I see that mask of yours

425
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,250
wasn't just for show, after all.

426
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,000
[VIDAR]
Thank you.

427
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,666
By its very nature,

428
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,708
revenge is a dark and
repulsive emotion.

429
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,875
However, having seen
you fight just now,

430
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:45,583
your moves don't seem to be
fueled by revenge, at all.

431
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,166
They were powerful...
and beautiful.

432
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,291
[VIDAR]
Is that so?

433
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,416
I'd forgotten.

434
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,333
[JULIETTA]
Uh?

435
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,416
[VIDAR]
I'd forgotten all about that,

436
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,625
and was enjoying fighting
in this machine.

437

You're a strange man,
you know that?

[VIDAR]
Am I?

439
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,333
Just so you're aware,
I still don't trust you.

440
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,916
Or your motives.

441
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,916
But at least I've put to
bed any reservations

442
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,041
about fighting alongside you.

443
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,208
Oh, were you reading
that old book again?

444
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,791
[MCGILLIS]
Yes.

445
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,500
This book saved me.

446
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:48,708
Agnika Kaieru's principles
made me the man I am.

447
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,833
In order to build a world

448
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:52,208
where humans could
live like humans,

449

he created the
organization Gjallarhorn.

450
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:59,291
I wasn't born into the Fareed
family, do you remember?

451
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,583
Oh, that's right.

452
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:03,500
You were adopted by
Master Iznario as a child.

453
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,791
Back then, I was
looked down upon

454
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,250
for being a child of low birth.

455
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,833
No matter where I looked, there
was no happiness to be found.

456
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,458
I cursed this world,

457
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,125
and at times, considered
taking my own life.

458
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,625
Macky...

459
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,000
[MCGILLIS] But this book
prevented me from doing so.

460
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,958
Agnika had a dream
he wanted to realize.

461
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,416
A world where humans
could compete fairly,

462
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,208
regardless of background.

463
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:31,666
In his world, anything
would be possible.

464
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,791
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

465
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,958
I'm sorry, but I'm not
sure I fully understand.

466
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,250
And for us, it would mean
a world free of judgment.

467
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,625
We could love each other
without anyone objecting to it.

468
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,333
Macky...

469
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,625
If we lived in that world,
do you think people

470
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,416
would stop laughing at me
and saying I'm a child?

471
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,750
Yes.

472
00:22:57,833 --> 00:22:59,750
And nobody would
make fun of you

473
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,958
for having a child as a fiancée?

474
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,208
Of course not.

475
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:07,000
Then that settles it!
I wanna go there!

476
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,875
Sure. I'll take you
there, Almiria.

477
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,708
That I promise.

478
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,000
[MCGILLIS] The time has come
for me to pry open the door

479
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:18,166
to that world with
my own two hands.

480
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,000
[YAMAGI]
Next time on

481
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,041
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans</i> ,

482
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,875
"Awakening Calamity."

483
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:32,833
[YAMAGI sighs]

484
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:34,041
[YAMAGI]
I swear,

485
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,500
Shino is always pulling
these crazy stunts.


486
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:38,666
Moron.
