[MIKAZUKI]
You too, Eugene.

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,041
[EUGENE] Mikazuki?
What are you talking about?!

--[EUGENE] I can still--
--I just got word from Pops.

clearing out the tunnel,

17
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:07,083
and everyone's starting
to move through.

18
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,875
The first ones in
are about to reach Chryse.

19
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,416
Really? Then we'll
make one last push--

[MIKAZUKI]
Not "we."

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,791
This isn't gonna end
just because

22
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,666
they've all reached Chryse.

23
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,625

do your job, Deputy Boss.

[AKIHIRO] How can you help
with an armless Mobile Suit?

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,583
Just leave everything
to the Muscle Team.

29
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,458

I'm glad you're back!

[EUGENE]
What's the situation?

36
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,125
Everybody's gone into
the tunnel except for us.

37
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,500
We just need to
rig this place to blow.

38
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:10,083
I'm finished on my end.

39
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,458
Well then, I say we should
all get the hell outta here.

40
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,916
But Mikazuki and the others
are still out there.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,791
[DANTE] Don't worry about them,
they'll catch up with us later.

42
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:19,666
They still have some work
that they need to take care of

43
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,166
out on the battlefield.

44
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,666
And while they do,
we'll take care of our business.

45
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,083
We can't stop moving. Not until
we carry out Orga's orders.

46
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:33,083
[EUGENE]
Right, Mikazuki?

47
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,625
You can go, too, Akihiro.

48
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,083
[AKIHIRO]
Yeah, right.

49
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,375
Like I could take off
with you still here.

50
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Fine. Just don't get in my way.

carrying you out of here

These two are like
monsters or something!

63
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,333
It looks like they're
beginning to back down.

[AKIHIRO]
No surprise there.

65
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,708
From where those guys
are sitting,

66
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,916
the two of us are
the last men left standing.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,208
They think they've already won.

68
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,166
And nobody wants to die in a
battle that's already been won.

Oh, is that why?

Just what do you think
you're doing, Master Iok?!

Stand down, Master Iok.

The fighting sounds.
They've stopped.

[RUSTAL] A monster that can
overcome a Mobile Armor

103

single-handedly can hardly
be called human anymore.

104

But there are appropriate
ways of putting down

Is it Gjallarhorn?

109
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,333
Is this from the explosives
we set in headquarters?

110
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,166
[MERRIBIT] They would've
given us a warning.

111
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,833
Plus, that blast is far too big.

112
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,583
[CHAD]
They wouldn't!

I noticed that the news reports
from the site stopped today.

The series of events known as

"the McGillis Fareed Incident"

203
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,541
ended with the death
of McGillis Fareed himself.

204
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,708
Gjallarhorn, which was
once on the verge

00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,625
of losing the public's trust,

206

demonstrated its
power to the world

00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:15,125
by resolving the conflict
before it could get any worse.

208
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,375
What's more,
with Gjallarhorn having lost

209
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,375
the Issue, Kujan,
and Fareed families,

210
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:24,416
they did away with the
Seven Stars council system.

211
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,291
It was restructured into
a more democratic organization,

212
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,250
and Rustal Elion was
sworn in as its first leader.

213
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,458
In the wake of the incident,

214
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,875
Elion scaled back
Gjallarhorn's Mars Branch.

215
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,458
And In response, the various
Earth economic blocs

216
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,750
that had practically let
Gjallarhorn govern the planet,

217
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,625
relinquished their
control of Mars.

Once free of the
economic blocs' rule,

219

the cities of Mars
founded the Martian Union.

Kudelia Aina Bernstine took
office as the Union Chairperson.

221
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,166
It's said that this was not
only because of her popularity,

222
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,791
but also due to
heavy support from Teiwaz,

223
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,958
which had grown even more
powerful after making

a secret deal with Rustal Elion
over the Turbines incident.

equally bestowed upon everyone.

strove for is about to be

brought to fruition
by the hands of Rustal Elion.

After that, people will
begin to forget.

No one will remember that
the incidents set in motion

to become the

If Teiwaz was involved
behind the scenes in some way,

276
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,958
surely they would've
consulted Master Rustal

You said something to me once.

I must remain human.

00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,291
I've realized that...

292
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,916
...the members of Tekkadan
weren't demons after all.

293
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,666
They were more human
than anyone.

294
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,958
The only place they belonged
was on the battlefield fighting.

295
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,041
Not to achieve
some ambition or goal,

296
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:38,333
but to live on as human beings.

297
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,541
They fought just to survive.

[GAELIO]
You're right.

299
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,000
That's the reason they elicited
so much fear from us.

300
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,583
Because if you can understand
the enemy's purpose,

00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,708
you're closer to
finding their limits.

was more to your liking?

312
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,625
Let's go eat some meat.

313
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,916
That's a terrific idea!
I actually prefer women

314
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,833
with a little more
meat on their bo--

315
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,458
Whoa, slow down, would ya?

316
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,875
Come on, at least
try to be careful!

317
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,333
[ALESI] I am positive that
Mr. Makanai would have been

318
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,416
brimming with pride
if he could've seen you

319
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,750
at the ceremony today.

320
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,583
[KUDELIA] I owed so much to him,
right up until the very end.

321
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,583
And thank you, Mr. Alesi.

322
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,291
Or rather, thank you for your

323
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,458
continued support,
Mr. Prime Minister.

324
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,708
You too, Takaki. Thank you.

325
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,916
Well, I haven't really
done anything.

326
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,375
Hey, Takaki. You better not be
making trouble for Mr. Alesi.

327
00:18:58,458 --> 00:18:59,958
Back at you, Deputy Boss.

328
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:02,041
<i>You'd</i> better not be making
trouble for Miss Kudelia.

329
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,375
[EUGENE] How many times
do I have to tell you

330
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,708
not to call me that?!

331
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,333
Who knows who might
be listening?

332
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,791
[ALESI]
To be perfectly honest,

333
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,625
Takaki is doing a
great job as my secretary.

334
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,833
I'm even hoping that one day
he'll take over my constituency.

335
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,833
[EUGENE]
This guy? A Parliament member?

336
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,500
[TAKAKI] I remember something
you told me, Miss Kudelia.

337
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,625
You said the more I experienced,
the more knowledge I'd acquire.

338
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,708
And with knowledge,
I'd have more opportunities.

339
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,166
I think I understand
what you meant now.

340
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,916
Takaki.

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,750
[TAKAKI] I'll keeping trying
to find things that I can do

342
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,416
for the children of Mars,
and for children everywhere,

343
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,333
so that I can work side by side
with you someday, Miss Kudelia.

344
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,166
[KUDELIA]
Okay. I'll be waiting.

345
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,333
[CHAD]
Welcome back, Miss.

346
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:53,166
I watched the live broadcast
of the signing ceremony.

347
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,541
[KUDELIA]
Thank you.

348
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,791
How's the company? Anything new?

349
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,416
[CHAD]
Ms. Cucubita and Mr. Dexter

350
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,166
have kept the business
running without a hitch.

351
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,833
No problems
at the mines, either.

352
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,166
What about the school?

353
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,750
[CHAD]
All is fine.

354
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,125
Though, the orphanage is
asking for more staff members

355
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,458
as they're shorthanded.

356
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,750
Come on, Dante? Not again.

357
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,875
[KUDELIA]
He's doing a great job.

358
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,000
When the treaty takes effect,
there are going to be

359
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,583
many more children
with nowhere else to go.

360
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,416
Let's do what we can to help.

361

[EUGENE sighs]

362
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,833
[CHAD] And concerning
Ride and the other guys...

363
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,166
Did you locate them?

364
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,708
[CHAD] No. Ever since
we received the intel

365
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,208
that Nobliss Gordon
had returned to Mars,

366
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,583
it's like they've been
deliberately avoiding us.

367
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,375
He still hasn't
gotten over what happened.

368
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,833
I'd like you to keep looking
for him for the time being.

369
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,000
For now, let's just have faith.

370
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,458
After all, we're still a family.

we've wrapped
things up on our end.

All right. I'm done here, too.

No matter how far we are,

even if we never
see each other again,

every one of us
is walking forward

trying to reach the light.

391
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,583
We must keep walking.

In my heart I believe
that is our duty.

For the family members
who gave their lives,
