[ARAE] Your recent defeat

the nature of the relationship

Yes, and the Mars Branch isn't

And our Mobile Suits
are in bad shape.

We need to fix them
as soon as we get to HQ.

that last battle.

the money again. huh?

[MCGILLIS]
I admit, this situation

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,416
doesn't warrant optimism.

40
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,208
But you and your people know
Mars better than anyone else,

41
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,750
so we should still be able--

42
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,833
How're we supposed to follow
your orders after what happened?

I thought we had joined

Well, we sure as hell
aren't equal anymore.

With your money and resources,
we thought we at least

That's why we put

Of course. As you wish.

I like the way that you think.

And your methods
may prove to be beneficial.

55
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,291
You trust in nothing
but your strength,

56
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,791
and you throw yourselves at
the enemy with reckless abandon.

57
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:09,791
We didn't have enemies
when this thing started.

58
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,375
[MCGILLIS] So, you're saying
you feel no hatred

59

killed your friends?

I wanna kill all of 'em
in the most brutal way I can.

that made them

into our enemies
in the first place.

64

Whether you sought them out
or vice versa,

And our enemy has
given us nowhere to run.

Fighting is our only hope
if we want to secure a future.

[ORGA] Yeah. I'm beginning
to wonder about that myself.

So, where'd our "friend" go?

00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,833
He said there was
something that he had to

72
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,791
check on personally,
then he left in a hurry.

That guy is like a loose
cannon waitin' to blow.

74

He's crazy if he thinks we can
still fight the Arianrhod

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,250
in the shape we're in.

76
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,833
So then, what would happen

77
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,583
if we just handed him and Bile
over to Gjallarhorn?

would never be okay

Even if they've taken refuge
at Tekkadan's home base,

We should probably
get back to HQ.

[ORGA]

188

[KUDELIA] Nobliss Gordon has
cut off all of the funding

189
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,708

to the Admoss Company.

[NOBLISS] If I continued giving
money to the Admoss Company,

191
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,458
I have no doubt it would
end up in Tekkadan's pockets.

192
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,833
And given the sensitive
nature of our merchandise,

193
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,833
it would be foolhardy
to openly aid

194
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,083

criminal activity.

I'm saying this
for your own good.

You need to sever all
your ties with Tekkadan.

Do that, and I'll happily
resume your funding.

Or are you willing
to cast aside your ideals

Whaddya mean?

465
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,083
We would if it were possible.

466
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,458
But there's no way
we'd be able to pull that off.

467
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:02,083
It might be impossible
to do on Mars,

468
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,208
but it could work on Earth.

469
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,750
--[CHAD] Oh yeah!
--[ORGA] Huh?

470
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,208
We've got Mr. Makanai!

471
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:08,708
That's right!

472
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,333
And Chryse is still a part
of Arbrau's colonies.

473
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:13,291
If nothing's changed,
your ID records

474
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,958
are still managed
by Arbrau on Earth.

475
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,416
If we can just find a way
to doctor those files...

476
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,291
We could get ourselves
off the list of scapegoats.

477
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,333
[MERRIBIT gasps]
There you are, Boss!

478
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,541
[DEXTER] We have
great news for everyone!

479
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,791
[ORGA]
What is it?

480
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,416
I'm pleased to say
we were able to get access

481
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,041
to a portion of our funds!

482
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,583
How did you...?

483
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:34,250
[DEXTER] I kept part of our
funds in a different account,

484
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,708
just in case we came
across any problems!

485
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:40,333
Admittedly, it's only about
a fifth of what we had before.

486
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,708
It took a bit of time
to finish the paperwork,

487
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,541
but we're good to go.

488
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,416
[ORGA]
Ms. Merribit. Mr. Dexter.

489
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,666
Thank you. I'm in your debt.

490
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,458
--Oh, my.
--Come on, Boss, cut it out.

491
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,708
We might be able
to make it now.

492
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,625
If we use that money and
manage to get to Earth somehow,

493
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,583
we can get our IDs changed and
get ourselves out of this mess.

494
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,000
[DANTE]
Hang on.

495
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,416
If we do that, then what's
gonna happen to Tekkadan?

496
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,666
Good point.

497
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,083
It's not like I have
anywhere else to go.

498
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,583
You mean the answer
isn't obvious to you?

499
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:20,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Wherever Orga ends up,

500
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,791
that's where we all belong.

501
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,916
[EUGENE]
Damn straight.

502
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,458
[DANTE]
Yeah, you're right, Mikazuki.

503
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,916
Even if we go by
different names,

504
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,416
who we are isn't gonna change.

505
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,666
[ORGA]
Okay, then. We have a plan!

506
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,500
Let's get in touch
with Mr. Makanai!

507
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,875
Right.

508
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,750
Miss Kudelia, there's a
terminal back here

509
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,125
if you need to use it!

510
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,125
[KUDELIA]
Thanks, Miss Atra!

511
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,333
[KUDELIA]
Huh?

512
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,625
[ORGA]
What's wrong?

513
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,500
There doesn't seem
to be any connection

514
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,666
[EUGENE]
Huh?

515
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,125
[beeping]

516
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,291
[EUGENE]
She's right.

517
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:51,000
All outgoing lines
have been cut off.

518
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,375
--[door clangs]
--[RIDE] Boss!

519
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,375
[ORGA]
Ride, Akihiro?

520
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,875
We're in big trouble!
It's Gjallarhorn!

521
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,708
[AKIHIRO] They've already got
the whole area surrounded!

522
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,500
[ORGA]
So... they've arrived.

523
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,666
[ORGA]
Next time on

524
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,916
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans,</i>

525
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,375
"Promise."

526
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,833
We're going to a place
that's anywhere but here.


527
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,416
All of us, together!
