1
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,291
[VIDAR] It would appear
as though McGillis has called

2
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,666
for a meeting of
the Seven Stars.

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,041
Probably over what
to do about Iok,

4
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,041
given the fact that he helped
himself to the Dáinsleifs.

5
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,041
But I've settled the
matter with Teiwaz,

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,458
so we'll be fine.

7
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,291
We can bounce back from anything
they try to throw at us.

8
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,416
[VIDAR]
So you're not going to Earth?

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,500
If I showed up out of
the blue to a meeting

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,041
I wasn't invited to,
they'd laugh at me

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,875
for having too much
time on my hands.

12
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,583
[VIDAR]
I see.

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,958
Is this troubling you?

14
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,500
[VIDAR]
Can you give me some time?

15
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,041
You think he'd make
a move, perhaps?

16
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,416
[VIDAR]
I've always wanted to uncover

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
what his true intentions were.

18
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:57,041
I think I might have an answer,
though it's tenuous at best.

19
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,958
But if I'm right, he will.

20
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:02,375
All right, then.

21
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,208
Be sure to take your
Mobile Suit along with you.

22
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,583
It's time that we settle this.

23
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:09,958
[VIDAR]
Thank you, sir.

24
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,166
They focus on petty
squabbles and think

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,208
absolutely nothing of

26
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,875
slaughtering innocent
civilians...

27
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,041
Everything is going
as you predicted.

28
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,500
[LIZA]
...the rot within Gjallarhorn!

29
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:22,958
Put out a call for the entire
Arianrhod Fleet to assemble!

30
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,208
[ISURUGI] At this time,
ground forces have suppressed

31
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,208
70 percent of headquarters.

32
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,250
And the members of the Seven
Stars have been detained.

33
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,750
We control
communications, as well.

34
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,083
Liza's speech is currently
in the process

35
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:16,541
of being broadcast
to the entire world.

36
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,916
[MCGILLIS]
What about the Mobile Suits?

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,416
[ISURUGI] As it stands,
the Mobile Suits at headquarters

38
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,625
have been disabled.

39
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,458
Those at the various
branch bases appear

40
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,166
to be holding
for the time being.

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,291
[MCGILLIS]
Very good. And in space?

42
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,375
[ISURUGI]
After issuing his proclamation,

43
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,916
Liza Enza began building a
defense network in Earth's orbit

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,958
against the Arianrhod Fleet.

45
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,708
[MCGILLIS] I suppose there's
no turning back now.

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,291
[ISURUGI]
Of course, sir.

47
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,916
[MCGILLIS]
Well then...

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,916
The time's come for me
to carry out my role, too.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,708
I'm leaving the rest
to you, Isurugi.

50
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,708
Yes, sir.

51
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,708
[GALLUS] Tell me where
the other members are!

52
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,375
I demand that you
let me talk to McGillis!

53
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,083
[GALLUS]
McGillis!

54
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,333
You needn't worry about a
thing, Lord Gallus Bauduin.

55
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,583
Or rather, dear Father.

56
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,125
I have personally seen to it

57
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:15,333
that no harm will
come to my wife.

58
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,000
[GALLUS growls]

59
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,375
[GALLUS]
What do ya think you're doing?!

60
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,208
How dare you take
such extreme actions?!

61
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:24,250
Again, there's no need to worry.

62
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,916
For the time being,

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,750
I'm nothing more than
a rebel to Gjallarhorn.

64
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,458
But, once that item
is in my hands,

65
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,250
our positions will be reversed.

66
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,458
[gasps] You... don't mean...

67
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,916
[MCGILLIS]
At long last, the day has come.

68
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,291
[MCGILLIS]
The truth.

69
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,500
No.

70
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,875
I should call it the
truth that I discovered.

71
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,208
[crunch]

72
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,125
[MCGILLIS]
I was in need of power.

73
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,666
[thud]

74
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,208
[MCGILLIS]
I had nobody to call a friend,

75
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,625
and never knew a parent's love.

76
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,416
[MCGILLIS] The powerless crawled
on the ground like vermin,

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,333
while those with power took
everything they could.

78
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,666
Cruel and unforgiving.

79
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,833
That was how I saw the world.

80
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,541
[MCGILLIS] My perspective
of the world didn't change

81
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,000
even after that man took me in.

82
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,958
[MCGILLIS]
However, if anything changed,

83
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,041
it was that I learned there were
many different kinds of power.

84
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:01,833
[MCGILLIS] And I showed them
just how much power I had.

85
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:06,500
[BUTLER] The Master wants you
to come to the main residence.

86
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,250
Pack your things.

87
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:16,166
[MCGILLIS] With that, I became
the heir to the Fareed family.

88
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,166
But, despite how
things appeared,

89
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,083
it made very little
difference in my life.

90
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:27,083
[MCGILLIS] Even with all I had,
I still needed more power.

91
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,875
[MCGILLIS]
And I found it.

92
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,125
Before me was the
greatest symbol of power

93
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,583
the world had ever seen.

94
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,625
Authority, vigor,
might, capability,

95
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:42,666
vitality, influence.

96
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,708
As well as... brute force.

97
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,625
A being that possessed
all those qualities.

98
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:54,833
The leader of Gjallarhorn.
Agnika Kaieru.

99
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,166
The truth.

100
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,375
[MIKAZUKI]
Come on, how much longer?

101
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,375
[ISURUGI]
Sorry.

102
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,791
It'll be a while
until headquarters

103
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,708
is completely suppressed.

104
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,958
I need you to wait
a little longer.

105
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,416
Where is Chocolate Man?

106
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,250
[ISURUGI] The General is
preparing the finishing touches.

107
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,833
And please refrain
from calling him that.

108
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,375
It won't be long now.

109
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,833
Victory is within our grasp.

110
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,000
[RUSTAL]
What's the status of the fleet?

111
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:24,208
[OPERATOR 43A] Well, the
Second and Fifth Fleets

112
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,416
deployed to neighboring areas

113
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,458
should be arriving
sometime today.

114
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,375
As for the Third
and Fourth Fleets,

115
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,000
they were deployed
on training voyages,

116
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,916
so it'll take them at least
three days to arrive.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,250
Have them hurry.

118
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,916
But, Commander, if you
aim to suppress the coup,

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
wouldn't it be more
to our advantage

120
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,500
to speed to Earth, rather than
wait for the rest of our forces?

121
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,000
That's true, since
soldiers seem to prefer

122
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,083
speed over planning.

123
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,166
But as it stands now,
we must assess the situation.

124
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,833
Yes, sir.

125
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,291
[door hisses]

126
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,041
Excuse me, Lord Elion.

127
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,375
Yes?

128
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:58,750
I would ask that you listen
to our request, sir.

129
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,833
Please allow Master Iok
to accompany you

130
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,333
on your mission to
suppress the coup.

131
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,583
[RUSTAL]
Not this again.

132
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,166
[GROUP gasps]

133
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,666
How many people have
come by, at this point?

134
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,458
These three bring the
total to exactly 40.

135
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,708
[RUSTAL]
Hmph.

136
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,208
Good grief.

137
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,750
You know, I almost envy the man.

138
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,750
To have such
faithful subordinates

139
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,875
even after having so
many awful failures.

140
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,500
Now that Iok is
under house arrest,

141
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,041
you are the ones
who're in command

142
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,000
of what remains of his fleet.

143
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,000
Your master's honor
depends on your actions.

144
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,541
Do your best to maintain a place
for Iok to come back to.

145
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,208
With our very lives, sir!

146
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,500
Now then.

147
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,041
What is it that you're
trying to assess...

148
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,333
...Vidar?

149
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,833
[LIZA]
It is such an honor to meet you!

150
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,791
Nothing is impossible,
and no future is unchangeable!

151
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,750
What Tekkadan
accomplished at Edmonton

152
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,333
lit a fire underneath us
and gave us the courage

153
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,916
to rise up and fight!

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,833
And for that, I thank you.

155
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,708
[ORGA]
Yeah, uh, Mr. Liza...

156
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,333
[LIZA]
Hm?

157
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,500
Any word from
the scouting party?

158
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,333
Huh? Oh.

159
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,791
According to their information,

160
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,125
the Arianrhod Fleet has
started massing its ships

161
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,041
in lunar orbit.

162
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,125
Massing?

163
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,458
How big a fleet
are we talkin' about?

164
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,291
[LIZA]
Well, once they all arrive,

165
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,291
there will be 40
Halfbeak-class ships in total.

166
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,166
Are you guys kidding me?

167
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,166
It's more than double
of what we have!

168
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,208
Yeah, we don't have to take
them all on, do we, Liza?

169
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,583
Destroying them all
isn't the objective here.

170
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,000
Despite the large showing,

171
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,708
all we need to do
is give the general

172
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,708
enough time to
complete his plan.

173
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,708
So you're sayin'

174
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,750
everything's up
to your boss, huh?

175
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,416
I hope he can handle this.

176
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,416
Mika is down on Earth, too.

177
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,833
If Barbatos and Mika can't take
care of things down there,

178
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,791
then it was hopeless
from the start.

179
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,166
This is gonna be
our moment of truth,

180
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,541
so we have to make it count.

181
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,666
Yeah, hope it goes well.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,333
[MCGILLIS]
This is it.

183
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,875
[MCGILLIS]
We finally meet... Bael.

184
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,333
No...

185
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,875
[MCGILLIS]
It's the dawn of a new era.

186
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,375
Awaken, Agnika Kaieru.

187
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,125
What's this?

188
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,416
[VIDAR]
I knew it.

189
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,750
I knew I'd find you here.

190
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,875
[MCGILLIS]
Gaelio Bauduin.


191
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,416
[YAMAZIN] Even if we're supposed
to be on battle standby,

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,958
isn't it kinda early
for you to be here?

193
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,000
[JULIETTA] There's a coup
taking place on Earth.

194
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,833
I can't stand around
doing nothing.

195
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,500
[JULIETTA] Shouldn't he
have come back by now?

196
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,583
What's that guy doing
at a time like this?

197
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,708
Oh, yeah, Vidar
headed out for Earth.

198
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:18,583
[JULIETTA]
Huh?

199
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,416
You didn't know about that?

200
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,375
He got special permission
from Lord Elion and took off.

201
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:25,791
Seriously?

202
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:28,416
[YAMAZIN] Are you feeling
left out of the loop?

203
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:32,791
I mustn't make the same
mistake I made last time.

204
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,958
Surely Master Rustal
has some kind of plan.

205
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,333
I just wonder if he's going
to be okay all on his own.

206
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,708
Beats me.

207
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,416
But I think there's
something you ought to know.

208
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,250
In all the time that
man has been here,

209
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,958
alone is something
Vidar has never been.

210
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:55,583
[MCGILLIS] So you've resorted to
being Rustal Elion's lapdog...

211
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,875
[GAELIO] He and I
have the same interests.

212
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,500
Ours is a partnership
between equals.

213
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,041
[MCGILLIS]
Being so quick to trust people

214
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,500
has always been
a bad habit of yours.

215
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,625
Yes, you may have a point.

216
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,083
After all, I was once
murdered by a man

217
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,625
I thought was my best friend.

218
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,333
Best friend?

219
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,666
No... that phrase
isn't quite right.

220
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,458
I guess, in the end,
I never really understood you.

221
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:26,583
[GAELIO] For me, you were
always a distant goal.

222
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:29,666
A person I had to catch up to.

223
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,291
And that's why...

224
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,916
[GAELIO]
I admired you.

225
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,666
[GAELIO] I wished to be
acknowledged by you

226
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,416
and be allowed to
stand by your side.

227
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,958
[GAELIO] But before long,
you put on a mask...

228
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,625
...and hid who you really were.

229
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,250
[GAELIO]
Yet...

230
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,000
[MCGILLIS] How is it they're
able to control the world

231
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,916
with such a weak council system?

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,333
The fact that no one
considers these

233
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,000
contradictory concepts
to be a problem is exactly

234
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,875
what's wrong with
Gjallarhorn these days.

235
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,708
Careful. Is that something
you want your father

236
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,666
to hear you going on about?

237
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,041
[MCGILLIS chuckles]

238
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,500
No, it's not. Which is why

239
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,833
I'm griping about it
in front of you.

240
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,375
I'm honored.

241
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,750
But you know what?

242
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,125
I actually agree with
your point of view.

243
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,375
I knew you'd see things my way.

244
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,208
[GAELIO chuckles]

245
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:29,583
[GAELIO] I thought my wish
to stand alongside you

246
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,083
had come true.

247
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,041
Moments like those
made me feel as though

248
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:38,916
you could briefly take off your
mask when you were around me.

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,500
However...

250
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,750
[GAELIO gasps]

251
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,416
No!

252
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,875
[GAELIO] I... wanted to
see it for myself.

253
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,666
I wanted to see first hand
what you craved,

254
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,666
this thing you wanted
to acquire so desperately

255
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,333
that you would betray Carta, me,

256
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,750
and everyone else close to you.

257
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,541
Well, you've found your answer.

258
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,958
[GAELIO]
Yes.

259
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,833
The very fact that
you're in this chamber

260
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,625
tells me everything
I need to know.

261
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,833
Are you satisfied?

262
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,541
It's strengthened my resolve.

263
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,958
Virtuous feelings like love,
trust, and respect...

264
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,375
They mean nothing
in your eyes, do they?

265
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,333
All that someone
like you understands

266
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:31,833
is authority, might,
and brute force.

267
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,375
[GAELIO] Only things that
translate into power.

268
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,250
Since you're here, it means
you can pilot it, right?

269
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,166
So get into Bael.

270
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:46,583
I assumed the reason you
came here was to stop me.

271
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,791
Do you understand what it means
for me to possess this?

272
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,416
There's no going back from here.

273
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,833
Or are you implying
you have nothing to lose

274
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,000
because you've already died?

275
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,333
Oh, no, the opposite.

276
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,250
[GAELIO]
I bear many burdens now.

277
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,875
But they're all things
you'd never be able to see,

278
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:09,041
as they're far too
humane for you.

279
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,458
You, McGillis, would
deny them outright

280
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,458
even if they were
shoved in your face.

281
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,708
I'll shoulder these burdens.

282
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:22,416
But know this. I'll reject
all your unmasked ideals.

283
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,666
I don't think that'll
be necessary, Gaelio.

284
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,291
[gasps]

285
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,500
[MCGILLIS]
Barbatos...

286
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Can I kill him?

287
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,875
Yes, by all means.

288
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:52,875
[GAELIO gasps]

289
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,000
You cannot win
against him, Gaelio.

290
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:03,750
Yeah, you're right.

291
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,875
It might be impossible for me.

292
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:09,583
Although... maybe
the two of us can.

293
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,000
What's he...?

294
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,625
Ein!

295
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,166
Make use of me as you will.

296
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,500
Now take my body,
as I surrender it to you!

297
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,000
What the...?

298
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,666
[gasps]

299
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:38,750
How did he...?

300
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,708
[MIKAZUKI]
That move just now...

301
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:46,125
I know this guy.

302
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,083
[JULIETTA]
He's never alone?

303
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,916
What do you mean by that?

304
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,166
[YAMAZIN]
There's a special system

305
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,333
built into that Mobile Suit.

306
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:54,583
[JULIETTA]
Special?

307
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,416
Vidar also said something
along those lines.

308
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,083
Say, Julietta.

309
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,000
Do you know what
the Alaya-Vijnana is?

310
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,541
Of course.

311
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,500
It's a vile combat interface
that they used in the old days.

312
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,583
Also, it ruined the reputation
of Gjallarhorn at Edmonton.

313
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:14,125
[YAMAZIN]
Ah, yes, the Battle of Edmonton.

314
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:17,000
During that skirmish,
Second Lieutenant Ein Dalton

315
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,916
of Gallarhorn melded
with a Mobile Suit

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,083
for Alaya-Vijnana testing
and lost control.

317
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,166
It was a disgrace
to Gjallarhorn, sure.

318
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,708
But what does-- 

319
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,541
[JULIETTA]
It can't be...

320
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,625
[YAMAZIN] What's installed
in that Mobile Suit

321
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,000
is a pseudo
Alaya-Vijnana System.

322
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,166
What's more, it's based
on Ein Dalton's brain.

323
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,416
[gasps]

324
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,333
[YAMAZIN]
The Alaya-Vijnana is an external

325
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,666
sensory organ for humans.

326
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,208
In addition to what
was left of Ein's brain,

327
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,083
his Alaya-Vijnana was installed
as an auxiliary system.

328
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,375
[YAMAZIN]
Once Vidar targets his opponent,

329
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,375
the system forcibly takes
control of the Mobile Suit

330
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,041
and maneuvers it independently.

331
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,875
This gives him strength
that's on par

332
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,541
with a true
Alaya-Vijnana system.

333
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,333
[JULIETTA]
So then...

334
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,208
Did Vidar choose to use that
system of his own free will?

335
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,750
Yes.

336
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:34,750
He said that he had an enemy
he couldn't defeat on his own.

337
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,333
This time, the system
had been equipped

338
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,041
to a Gundam Frame
but there's more

339
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,125
to the Alaya Vijnana
than just that.

340
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,166
It was originally
developed to allow humans

341
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,250
to overcome their limitations
in order to fight mobile armors.

342
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,875
[YAMAZIN] However, since it
exceeds the natural limits

343
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,208
of the human body,

344
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,750
it causes a great deal
of strain on the brain.

345
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,791
But Vidar used another process.

346
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,625
By channeling the excess
data through Ein's brain,

347
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,416
he could power it
without that limitation.

348
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,500
So what you're saying is that...

349
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,375
[YAMAZIN] Vidar now has
the capacity to access

350
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,708
the same kind of
power as Barbatos,

351
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,333
who they say defeated a
mobile armor all by itself.

352
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,416
This guy, huh?
It's gonna be trouble.

353
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:29,291
[MCGILLIS] You are a truly
fascinating man... Gaelio.

354
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,750
[MCGILLIS] I was able
to perfect this research

355
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,708
thanks in large part to the
assistance of you and Ein.

356
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,083
I never thought
you two would see

357
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,583
the end results personally.

358
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:47,083
[MCGILLIS]
Could this be destiny?

359
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,083
Regardless, the time
for that is over now.

360
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,208
[MCGILLIS gasps]

361
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,750
[MCGILLIS growls]

362
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,791
[MCGILLIS]
Three hundred years.

363
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,625
I believe you've
rested long enough,

364
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,000
don't you think...

365
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,750
...Agnika Kaieru?

366
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,791
Come, it's time to awaken.

367
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,916
[GAELIO]
Two against one?

368
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,041
Who is that?

369
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,291
[GAELIO] Allow me to
apologize for before.

370
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,833
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

371
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,875
I held all of you
in such contempt for so long.

372
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,375
All those with
the Alaya-Vijnana.

373
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,416
[MCGILLIS]
No need to chase him.

374
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,291
The operation was a success.

375
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,750
Huh?

376
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:57,958
Hey, Boss!

377
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,625
We're reading an
unidentified shuttle

378
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,750
coming up from the Earth!

379
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,083
Wait, what?

380
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,958
[ENBI]
Its booster has separated.

381
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,208
It's small...

382
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,458
...and, from what I can
tell, it's avoiding us

383
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,833
and heading toward the moon.

384
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,083
Who the hell is that?

385
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:11,458
Do we chase it?

386
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,583
[ELGAR]
Emergency signal from Earth!

387
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,375
[MCGILLIS] People of
Gjallarhorn, hear me well!

388
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,166
Finally awoken from
its 300-year slumber

389
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,875
at the hands of McGillis Fareed,

390
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,375
Bael is resurrected!

391
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,958
[LIZA]
General.

392
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,583
We did it, everyone!

393
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,625
Our plan was a success!

394
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,833
Today, victory is ours!

395
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,875
Did that idiot
actually activate it?!

396
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,500
No, McGillis! What have
you gone and done?!

397
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,958
[RUSTAL] A Mobile Suit that
carries within it the soul

398
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:47,125
of Agnika Kaieru,
the founder of Gjallarhorn.

399
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,500
Gundam Bael.

400
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,375
In the end, it would
appear McGillis'

401
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:55,708
true objective was
a symbol of a just cause.

402
00:21:55,791 --> 00:22:00,500
And here I thought it was just
the ramblings of a child.

403
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,916
To think that you
really made it happen.

404
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,541
What a fool.

405
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:11,416
[RUSTAL] You're just a child who
can't grow up, McGillis Fareed.

406
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,375
What shall we do next, sir?

407
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,916
[GAELIO]
Sorry for the wait.

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,625
[RUSTAL]
Vidar?

409
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,125
I see now.

410
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:22,500
Given your unmasked face,
you figured out your destiny.

411
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,791
[GAELIO]
Yes, I shall obey only you.

412
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:29,791
Allow me to go back
to being myself.

413
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:31,208
[MCGILLIS]
Everyone who calls themselves

414
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,000
a Gjallarhorn member
understands the significance

415
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,875
of this legendary Mobile Suit.

416
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,708
For, within Gjallarhorn,

417
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:43,208
the person who has control of
Bael shall wield absolute power!

418
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,250
And he shall reign supreme!

419
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,166
Irrespective of your rank
or opinion on the matter,

420

you must obey!

421
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:52,791
So this is the trump card
McGillis was talking about?

422
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,375
Hang on just a second, Orga.

423
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,458
Does this announcement mean

424
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,916
that we've already
won or something?

[GAELIO] I, Gaelio Bauduin,
declare here and now.
