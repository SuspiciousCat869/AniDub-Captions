1
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:37,750
All finished here.

2
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,666
General, that was brilliant.

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,916
It was nothing.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,583
Let's reduce the enemy's
forces a bit more.

5
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,958
Arbrau's troops were
hastily formed.

6
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:48,750
They can't have an infinite
number of Mobile Suits.

7
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,500
They're sure to run out soon.

8
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,791
[MCGILLIS' GUARD A]
Sir!

9
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,833
We mustn't let this chaos
drag on any longer.

10
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,000
Or we'll be mocked by
that snake on the Moon.

11
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,500
I found him.

12
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,583
[ASTON] That's the Commander
Type our recon unit reported.

13
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,000
A Graze Ritter
with shoulder armor.

14
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,666
That's him all right.

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,291
[TAKAKI]
If we can take him out,

16
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,583
this crazy war will
finally come to an end.

17
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,750
[GALAN]
That's right.

18
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,916
Our victory on this
day will be a tribute

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,541
to our fallen comrades.

20
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,583
If we take him out here...

21
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,416
If I take him out...

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,958
[ASTON]
Takaki. Let's do it like always.

23
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,750
Aston.

24
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,375
[ASTON]
Me up front and you in back.

25
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,208
If we do it like we
always do, we'll win.

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,958
We're going back to Fuka
together, remember?

27
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,041
Yeah, you bet we are.

28
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,375
Together, then.

29
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:42,583
Yeah.

30
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,208
That's a promise.

31
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,541
[MCGILLIS]
Unless I'm mistaken,

32
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,500
the Arbrau Defense Force's
forward base is up ahead.

33
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,833
Yes, though, it's still quite
some distance from our location.

34
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,375
If we take it out,

35
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,750
perhaps we'll finally be able
to clear up this situation.

36
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,208
[beeping]

37
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,125
[GALAN yells]

38
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,208
[MCGILLIS' GUARD A]
General!

39
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,875
So the big man himself
is out in the open.

40
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,041
Have you forgotten the
first rule of warfare?

41
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,375
[MCGILLIS' GUARD A]
Five enemy machines!

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,625
Please fall back, General!

43
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,041
Don't worry about me!

44
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,916
Call headquarters
for reinforcements!

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,625
Headquarters, do you read me?!

46
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,875
Requesting reinforcements!
We're under attack!

47
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
There's no point in
calling for back up.

48
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,416
I've already sent a separate
force to deal with them.

49
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,875
Kids, I'll keep this guy busy!

50
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,416
You get the one
with shoulder armor.

51
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,458
[MCGILLIS]
Alaya-Vijnana movements.

52
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,750
Tekkadan?

53
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,625
They're not as easy
as the Defense Force.

54
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,125
Attack when I say!

55
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,541
[TAKAKI]
Got it.

56
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,750
[MCGILLIS]
Attention, Tekkadan pilots.

57
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,791
Are you acting on
your boss' orders?

58
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,541
What's that?

59
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,875
[MCGILLIS] I'm asking if these
are Orga Itsuka's orders.

60
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,500
[ASTON]
They are.

61
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,333
[MCGILLIS] And you're positive
that the order to kill me

62
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:49,375
came directly from him?

63
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,833
I want to know whose directions
you're fighting under.

64
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,250
Whose directions?

65
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,333
[ASTON] It's the enemy talking.
Don't listen, Takaki.

66
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,416
If we kill him,
the war will end.

67
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,750
That's right!

68
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,041
If I defeat you, Aston and
I can go home together!

69
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,208
[ASTON]
Takaki!

70
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:07,916
We just have to do it
like we always do!

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,708
I'm sure of it, Aston!

72
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,041
I'm the one who's
supposed to be up front!

73
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,208
[ASTON]
Fall back for now, Takaki!

74
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,875
You're no match
for this guy alone!

75
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,625
[yells]

76
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,333
[TAKAKI] After we're done,
we can go home!

77
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,791
[ASTON]
Move away from him, Takaki!

78
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:41,666
I can't get a clear shot!

79
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,708
I'm risking my life,
just like you!

80
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,583
Aston, no!

81
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,708
[ASTON]
Like I said...

82
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,333
What?

83
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:15,708
...I'm the one up front...
and you're behind.

84
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,208
[ASTON]
That's what works best for us...

85
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,458
[GALAN]
Good boy!

86
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,416
Just like an obedient dog.

87
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,708
He does what he's told to do.

88
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,375
[GALAN] It almost seems too
easy once it's over, huh?

89
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,333
But that's war!

90
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,875
[beeping]

91
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,208
What the hell?!

92
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,375
The Barbatos. It's here.

93
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,000
Almost as if...

94
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,333
[MIKAZUKI]
Orga told me that I wasn't

95
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,500
supposed to allow you to die.

96
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,250
Lucky you.

97
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,208
[HUSH]
Mr. Mikazuki!

98
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,208
[HUSH] Wh-What the heck
is going on around here?

99
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,583
[GALAN]
Who are they?

100
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:06,291
Captain!

101
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,500
They're the Martian guys

102
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,250
that we were trying
to stall up in orbit!

103
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,875
[GALAN'S MAN B] How'd they
get down to the surface?

104
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,208
[GALAN'S MAN A]
No idea! Orders, sir!

105
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,208
Damn. So this is it?

106
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,458
We're pulling out!

107
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:18,916
Make sure you tell the
guys back at camp, too!

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,291
[HUSH]
Hey! Come back!

109
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,208
Mr. Mikazuki!

110
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh no, you don't. I won't--

111
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,333
[TAKAKI]
Aston! Aston!

112
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,750
Hold on, Aston!
I'll get you out of there!

113
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,250
[ASTON]
No... you've done enough.

114
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,333
What're you talking about?!

115
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,375
Oh my god.

116
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,208
Aston, don't die!

117
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,083
I was only able to
make it here on Earth

118
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,791
because you were
always there for me!

119
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,541
I was so afraid that
I wouldn't be able

120
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,500
to make Fuka happy
away from Mars.

121
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,458
But I was able to
overcome that fear

122
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,208
because you were by my side.

123
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,791
Because you were one
of my best friends.

124
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:03,041
[ASTON]
I don't... feel that way.

125
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,500
Meeting you... and Fuka...

126
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,916
...I wish it had
never happened...

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,875
It's impossible for Human Debris
to survive with feelings.

128
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,333
Even if a friend got killed,

129
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,083
you'd be crushed if you
let yourself mourn them.

130
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,416
We lived by pushing
our emotions down

131
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,375
into the depths of our souls.

132
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:32,333
But... right now...

133
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:37,708
...I honestly wish that I'd...
never met any of you guys...

134
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,083
Because...

135
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,125
[TAKAKI]
Aston!

136
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,625
[ASTON]
Because now I have to die...

137
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,500
...and I wish I
didn't have to go...

138
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:05,791
Still... Thank you...

139
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:13,500
[wailing]

140
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,583
[RADICE] What do you mean you
can't reach Galan Mossa?!

141
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,083
What's going on out there?!

142
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,291
[BOY SOLDIER A] I already
told you, I don't know!

143
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,375
They up and left, and Takaki
still hasn't come back!

144
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:27,458
We're also getting reports

145
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,208
that the Barbatos
has been spotted!

146
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,958
We have no idea if
that's true, though!

147
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,833
The Barbatos?! Get
confirmation immediately!

148
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
[BOY SOLDIER A] That's what
we're tryin' to do, right now!

149
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,208
[RADICE] Find out what you
can, as soon as possible!

150
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,125
Intel on the Mars group
takes top priority!

151
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,041
There somethin'
you wanna tell us?

152
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,125
How in the world
did you get here?

153
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,166
Landing clearance for
Arbrau's spaceports

154
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,583
have been suspended!

155
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,708
[EUGENE] Yeah, because
of that we had to take

156
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,083
a detour through the SAU.

157
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,333
Through the SAU?!

158
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,666
I'd like to know why the hell

159
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,875
you haven't been answering
any calls from Mars.

160
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,791
You've got a lot of
explaining to do, Radice.

161
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,291
It's not what you--

162
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,583
Don't even think
about playing stupid.

163
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,333
Mikazuki and the others
are on the battlefield.

164
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,750
We'll know everything
soon enough.

165
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,333
You have to believe me.
This was all Galan Mossa's idea!

166
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,583
You have my word,

167
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,833
I was only following the
orders that he gave me!

168
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,000
Then go get him and
bring him here.

169
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,458
He's on the front line.

170
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,458
However, if he
knows you're here,

171
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,750
then it's possible that he's
already fled and gone into hid--

172
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:37,041
If he did go underground,
I know where he might be!

173
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,833
Deputy Boss, there's
a call from Ms. Lafter!

174
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:40,666
Put her through.

175
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,166
Uh... But how?

176
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,541
She's on!

177
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,125
[LAFTER]
Uh, Eugene?

178
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,291
So how's it goin' over there?

179
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,333
[LAFTER] The fighting
has died down for now.

180
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,750
[EUGENE]
That's good news.

181
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,958
[LAFTER]
I hate to say,

182
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:57,041
but that's about the
only good news I have.

183
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,583
We've lost a lot of Tekkadan
members over the past month.

184
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:04,458
Like I told you, I was
just following my orders.

185
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,125
[LAFTER] And the worst part is,
Aston was just killed in battle.

186
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,291
He died protecting Takaki.

187
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,416
I see...

188
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,708
[growls]

189
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,833
Where the hell is
this Galan bastard?

190
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,750
I... I don't know!

191
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,666
If he's not on
the battlefield...

192
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,166
No wait!

193
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,166
He has a few places across
the border, in SAU territory,

194
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,500
where he lies low when
things are lookin' dicey!

195
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,625
[EUGENE]
And why would you know that?

196
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,458
You better not be
trying to set us up.

197
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:37,708
Galan deceives people without
giving it a second thought.

198
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:42,250
I wanted to negotiate fairly,
so I decided to do some digging.

199
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,625
The information is in my desk!

200
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,625
As soon as we're done with
him, we're coming for you.

201
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,083
Make sure you're ready.

202
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,083
As for that
Galan bastard,

203
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,250
he's a dead man.

204
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,416
[GALAN]
We'll head out to sea,

205
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,375
and then travel to the
African Union by boat.

206
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,791
We didn't manage
to kill McGillis,

207
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,250
but I'm sure Rustal will be
able to handle things from here.

208
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,083
[GALAN'S MAN A]
Captain?

209
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,208
[GALAN]
Hmm?

210
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,500
Don't worry about it.

211
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:16,000
Our work here is done,
for the time being.

212
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,750
Now, we act like
good mercenaries

213
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,625
and find our next battle.

214
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,708
Looking forward to it, sir.

215
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,000
[GALAN]
That's right.

216
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,750
Because it's what
Rustal would want.

217
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,375
[alarm blaring]

218
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,625
[GALAN'S MAN A]
Enemy forces?

219
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,666
[GALAN'S MAN C]
Which side? Arbrau? Or the SAU?

220
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,000
[GALAN] We'll find out later!
Prepare for battle!

221
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,208
We're abandoning the base!

222
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,583
Ditch anything you
can't carry with you!

223
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:38,916
[GALAN]
They found us here?

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,625
If this is a joke,
I'm not laughing!

225
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,875
[GALAN]
Dammit. They're everywhere!

226
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,041
Spread out before
they surround us!

227
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,166
You know where to meet!

228
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,500
[GALAN'S MEN]
Yes, sir!

229
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,708
[HUSH]
They're here!

230
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,458
[MIKAZUKI] Follow my lead,
and do your best to keep up.

231
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,583
And try not to push yourself.

232
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:02,791
[grunts]

233
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,791
[HUSH]
I can fight, too.

234
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,333
[GALAN'S MAN A]
What the--?!

235
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,416
[GALAN'S MAN B] Crap!
Who the hell are these guys?!

236
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,208
[GALAN]
No one else is here yet?

237
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,500
Blast it. Am I gonna have
to find new troops again?

238
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,166
Sorry, Rustal.

239
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,125
I might need a little more time
before I start on the next job.

240
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,916
But how'd they find
out about the base?

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,375
From above?!

242
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,833
[AKIHIRO]
Are you Galan Mossa?

243
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:51,791
[GALAN] If I say no, are you
gonna let me leave in peace?

244
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,500
Although, if you're the ones who
came after me, that means...

245
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,666
...this is Radice's doing.

246
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,958
It looks like I underestimated
that small-timer.

247
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,166
[GALAN]
Brute force is a dangerous thing

248
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,875
since there's no
hesitation in the attack!

249
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,333
[HUSH]
This can't be happening!

250
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,750
[yells]

251
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:32,875
[HUSH]
It hurts...

252
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,750
[HUSH]
It hurts...

253
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,208
It hurts!

254
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,500
[HUSH]
I'm scared!

255
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,666
[MIKAZUKI]
Stay back.

256
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,125
[HUSH]
Wait. Come back!

257
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,083
[HUSH]
I'm--!

258
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,625
[GALAN] I won't let myself get
caught by a bunch of punks!

259
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:31,000
[AKIHIRO yells]

260
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,041
I see that your attacks are
driven by personal feelings.

261
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,833
Have you lost someone
close to you?

262
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,458
[AKIHIRO]
Shut up!

263
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,958
Having something to protect,
that's admirable.

264
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:47,333
As is getting revenge when
it's been taken from you!

265
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,708
[AKIHIRO]
I'm gonna grind you into dust!

266
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,750
That's all there is to it!

267
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,000
You're perfectly decent
as a human being,

268
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,583
but the thing is--

269
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,333
[yells]

270
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,458
[GALAN]
On the battlefield,

271
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,541
it's always the decent
ones who die first!

272
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,791
The ones who're striving
for something greater

273
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,750
and fighting for justice are the
ones who get weeded out first!

274
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,791
[gasps]

275
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:33,708
[AKIHIRO] Then it's a good thing
that you seem pretty decent!

276
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,833
You have my thanks
for the compliment!

277
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,916
Mark my words, my
nameless young friend,

278
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,791
somewhere down the line,

279
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,625
you'll meet the
same fate as me.

280
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,250
Akihiro!

281
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,583
[GALAN]
So long, kid!

282
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,666
[GALAN]
Sorry, Rustal...

283
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,166
Akihiro!

284
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:09,166
[AKIHIRO]
It's fine. I'm... alive.

285
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,416
Yeah, you are.

286
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,166
You're alive.

287
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,875
[RADICE] I keeping telling you,
you've got this all wrong!

288
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,916
If we crossed Galan Mossa
in even the slightest way,

289
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,791
the Earth Branch wouldn't
have had a chance in hell!

290
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,291
I did it to protect Tekkadan!

291
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,916
[EUGENE]
Then try explaining to me

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
why you had a personal
contract with him.

293
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,583
According to these forms,
if you sold us out,

294
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,916
you were guaranteed
safety and money.

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,666
I can explain!

296
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,250
It was to lull him into a
false sense of security!

297
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:47,416
Do you not understand anything
about the game of diplomacy?

298
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,375
Stop your fidgeting.

299
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,083
[EUGENE]
And stop screwin' around.

300
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,958
[MIKAZUKI] What's the point
in talking to this guy?

301
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,125
[EUGENE]
Huh?

302
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,708
It's obvious that he
betrayed Tekkadan.

303
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,666
And worse he let our
people die for nothing.

304
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,625
I say we just--

305
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,791
No, don't!

306
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,875
[TAKAKI]
Hold on.

307
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,625
I wanna talk with him first.

308
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,916
You sure?

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,708
Talk about what?

310
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,208
This problem belongs
to the Earth Branch.

311
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:18,875
I'm the one Mr. Chad
left in charge.

312
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,750
So let me be the
one to handle this.

313
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,375
[EUGENE]
Mikazuki, what're you--?

314
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,291
[EUGENE] Why did he ask us
to clear the room like that?

315
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:43,666
He's not going to let
Radice go, is he?

316
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,041
I dunno...

317
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,041
I mean, I just can't imagine
Takaki killing anyone.

318
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,666
Yeah, you're right. That
kid's as sweet as they come.

319
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,083
[AKIHIRO] We don't know
what went on down here.

320
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,916
Even though that Radice
bastard is a damn traitor,

321
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,541
Takaki might have some
attachment to him.

322
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,500
So then, should we
go in and stop him?

323
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,875
Leave him be.

324
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:05,708
[AZEE]
Huh?

325
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,125
I agree.

326
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,000
This entire conflict has been
an Earth Branch problem.

327
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:14,041
With Chad in the hospital,
it's Takaki's call to make.

328
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,583
[LAFTER]
Akihiro!

329
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:19,083
[AKIHIRO] Takaki already told
us to let him handle things.

330
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,458
However he decides to do it,
I'll support him to the end.

331
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,291
[RADICE]
I knew it!

332
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,208
I always had faith that you
would be fair and hear me out!

333
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,000
Thank you, Mr. Takaki!

334
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:35,833
Mr. Radice, how could
you repeatedly lie to us?

335
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,708
I apologize for that.

336
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,791
Listen, I know I've
said it before,

337
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,166
but I only did what I
thought was necessary.

338
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,416
I wanted to protect you
and the Earth Branch.

339
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,541
I merely took the most
logical course of action!

340
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,416
Mr. Takaki, this is
Earth, not Mars.

341
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,875
Even if Mr. Orga had
given us instructions,

342
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:59,333
he's too far removed
from the action.

343
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,083
Ultimately, the only
thing we could do

344
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,666
was evaluate each
situation for ourselves

345
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,291
and make our own decisions!

346
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,958
[TAKAKI]
You're right.

347
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,708
Mr. Takaki-- Uh.

348
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,708
[RADICE]
Huh?

349
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,375
And I've decided...

350
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,708
[gunshots]

351
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:20,833
[ZACH]
Huh?

352
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey, did you hear
something just now?

353
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,208
No. Did you?

354
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,875
It was probably nothing.

355
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:29,125
Anyway, you're a bona fide
Mobile Suit pilot now!

356
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,958
Congratulations, Hush!

357
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,750
Huh? What's with you?
Lighten up, dude!

358
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,958
[TEKKADAN MEMBER A]
Hey, Zack!

359
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,500
Give us a hand over here!

360
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,875
Seriously?! You have
gotta be kidding me!

361
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,958
I wanna move up
in the world, too!

362
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,208
[HUSH]
This feeling sucks...

363
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,916
To realize how
powerless you are...

364
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,166
That you're nothing more
than some punk kid...

365
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:01,583
[HUSH] He and I are
completely different.

366
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,666
And it has nothing to do
with the Alaya-Vijnana.

367
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,000
We were different to begin with.

368
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:11,625
Well, being able to
accurately assess

369
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,916
the situation you
find yourself in

370
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,916
is probably one of the natural
talents of a good pilot.

371
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,833
What's wrong?

372
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,333
[HUSH]
I'm just surprised

373
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,166
'cause I've never heard you
say that many words before.

374
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,625
[DANE]
Hmm. I guess.

375
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,250
[MIKAZUKI]
Who were these guys?

376
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,500
[MCGILLIS] An organization
under the influence of Rustal.

377
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:43,083
But any proof of that has now
been reduced to ashes.

378
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:44,250
There's proof?

379
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,125
We weren't able to
get any valuable intel

380
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,291
out of the mercenaries
we captured.

381
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:52,875
It seems as though this Galan
character was the cautious sort.

382
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:55,166
He managed all of
the records himself

383
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,958
by using the software
on his Mobile Suit.

384
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,375
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh.

385
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,000
[MCGILLIS] Which reminds me,
I forgot to thank you.

386
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,958
Just doin' my job. Huh?

387
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:12,833
When you and your Barbatos
saved my life during the battle,

388
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,666
it was like watching a scene

389
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,583
from the legend
of Agnika Kaieru.

390
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,958
Agnika?

391
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,541
[MCGILLIS] He was the man
who founded Gjallarhorn.

392
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,875
[JULIETA]
The bearded gentleman is...?

393
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,458
That can't... How could he?

394
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,708
He's the strongest man I know!

395
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,666
And he's so kind--

396
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,625
[RUSTAL]
Julieta.

397
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:42,416
You must not mourn his death.

398
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,750
Master Rustal.

399
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:48,208
[RUSTAL] The man you
speak of never existed.

400
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,166
To assist with my
activities in secret,

401
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,416
he sacrificed his family,
affiliations, and even his name.

402
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,208
He lived only through fighting
and through fighting did he die.

403
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:03,125
Mourning the death of a
man who never existed

404
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:05,291
means trampling on
the wishes of someone

405
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,208
who did such great
things for us.

406
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:12,250
[JULIETA]
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,833
[RUSTAL]
My friend...

408
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,125
[TAKAKI]
I'm home...

409
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,583
Oh, Takaki...

410
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,833
[gasps] Takaki!

411
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,208
Thank goodness! I'm so
glad you're home, Takaki!

412
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:50,208
You came back to me!
I've been waiting for so long.

413
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:53,958
Hey Takaki, did you
come back alone?'

414
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,750
And where is Aston...?

415
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,250
Is... he...?

416
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,250
[FUKA]
N-No...

417
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,333
[TAKAKI]
And so,

418
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,708
this nameless war of
ours came to an end.

419
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,375
[JULIETA]
Next time on

420
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,208
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans</i> ,

421
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:30,166
"Sovereign Of Mars."

422
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,041
Why does Master Rustal
keep that man at his side?

423
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,958
Is there anything
trustworthy about him?


424
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:38,583
Hmph. He doesn't even
show his face.
