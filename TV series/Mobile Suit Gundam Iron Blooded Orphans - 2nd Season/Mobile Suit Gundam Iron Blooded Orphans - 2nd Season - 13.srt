Apologies. I hate to call you in

It seems like a position

[ORGA] In response to
everything that happened,

51
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,958
Gjallarhorn has launched a
full-blown search on Mars

52
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,250
to find other remnants
of the Calamity War.

53
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,166
I don't care about that.

54
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,166
I believe we've
demonstrated our strength.

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,958
But even though we won,

56
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:10,458
I realize that we couldn't
handle it on our own.

57
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,791
Still, as long as Lord Fareed
continues to think highly

58
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,166
of Tekkadan, we'll keep
doing everything we can

59
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,416
to help him win.

60
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,333
I have no doubt that

61
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,541
from this in the long run, sir.

62
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,458
Here, sir.

63
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:30,000
[MCMURDO]
And that would be?

64
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,958
Tekkadan's entering a battle.

65
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,541
A battle where the final outcome
is unpredictable, at best.

66
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,750
So, if our existence

67
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,125
should ever start to
become a burden on you,

68
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:44,458
I'm asking you to smash this,
and disown me from the family.

That's not wh-- [gasps]

[MCMURDO] Don't worry, I have no
intention of reprimanding you.

76
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,000
If for no other reason than
it being foolish for Teiwaz

77
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,916
to risk losing the earnings
Mars brings in.

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,708
However,

79
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,083
from this point on, things are
going to be a little different.

80
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,625
But, I'll keep this for now.

I've gone to great lengths

to look after you
for all this time.

83
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:26,125
So, if you do anything
to double-cross Teiwaz,

84
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,791
I can promise you that this cup

85
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,166
won't be only thing
that I smash.

And now the old man has

I mean, he's basically given
his blessing to them

working with Gjallarhorn.

[JASLEY] Don't forget, we've
made connections of our own.

00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,583
[MCGILLIS]
As I stated in the report,

104
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,291
the purpose of my trip to
Mars was simply to inspect

105
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,125
the Mobile Armor and
assess the situation.

106
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,791
But Lord Kujan,
suspicious of my motives,

107
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,166
interfered with the inspection

108
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,708
and his actions led to
the machine awakening.

109
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,708
The Fareed Family cooperated
with a local organization

110
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,541
and effectively dealt
with the incident

111
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,666
by destroying the Mobile Armor.

112

But, had there been one misstep,

113
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,333
an urban area would
have been overrun,

in such things.

Eliminating the Mobile Armor

was an impressive
display, Lord Fareed.

Why, Master?!

Why did you not denounce

for his sinister ambitions?!

Calm yourself, Iok.

of his ambitions,

accusations levied against him

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,041
would amount to little
more than wasted breath.

00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:19,375
It's why I have to get stronger.

161
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,041
I don't wish for anything
more than that.

162
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,916
[RUSTAL]
Hmm...

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,166
--[RUSTAL] Suit yourself.
--[gasps]

164
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,791
But know that you're
strong enough as you are.

165
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:35,625
Understand that what I expect
from you is something different.

166
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,541
Yes, sir!

167
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,041
[NAZE] I hear you gave your
Sakazuki cup to the old man.

168
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,375
I bet that was a
pretty scary moment.

169
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,791
He gave me a stern warning
about there bein' hell to pay

170
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,416
if I ever betrayed him.

171
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,791
[chuckles]

172
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,416
If all goes well,
I'll be promoted to underboss

173
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,458
according to what
the old man said to me.

174
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,875
An underboss, huh?

175
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,750
He must be anticipating
what's to come after you win.

176
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,000
I guess putting me in
a high-ranking position

177
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,833
is his way of keeping
you guys on a tight leash.

178
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,583
He only makes decisions
based on results.

179
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,583
And once you get
started with this,

180
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,000
you won't be allowed to quit.

181
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm prepared for that.

182
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,208
All right, then.
I'm glad to hear it.

183
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:17,708
On a different note,

184
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,208
when are you bringing Barbatos
to the Saisei for repairs?

185
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,375
I'm told the battle left
it in a pretty bad way.

186
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,458
[ORGA]
Yeah.

187
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,958
[NAZE]
Mm...

188
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,333
Is Mikazuki okay?

189
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,458
[ORGA]
He's, uh...

190
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,916
[MEMBER 38A] Stay calm and
care for the injured first.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,416
[MEMBER 38B]
Bring me the fire extinguisher!

192
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,666
[MEMBER 38C]
The mobile workers can wait!

193
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,458
[ORGA]
Why aren't you pullin' Mika out?

194
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,291
[YUKINOJO] It's too dangerous
to disconnect him

195
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,458
from the system while
he's unconscious.

196
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,166
There's no way to know
what'll happen to him

197
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,125
if we just force it off.

198
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,416
Damn it.

199
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,166
[MIKAZUKI groaning]

200
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,541
--[YUKINOJO] Huh?
--[ORGA] Mika!

201
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,625
[YUKINOJO]
Good, he's coming to.

202
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,625
[ORGA]
Talk to me, Mika! Are you okay?

203
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,541
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah, I'm fine.

204
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:55,666
Do it, Pops!

205
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,958
Right, you got it.

206
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,541
Yamagi! Disconnect him.

207
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,583
I'm on it.

208
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,666
All right. Disconnecting.

209
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,291
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

210
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,041
[ORGA] Mika! What's the matter?
Are you in pain?

211
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,041
No, it's...

212
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,166
It's just...

213
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,750
...I can't move one of my legs.

214
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,916
[gasps]

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,333
[gasping]

216
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,041
[ORGA]
Mika...

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,916
[NAZE]
So it's his leg this time, huh?

218
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Actually, it's his
whole right side.

219
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,166
[NAZE]
Hm...

220
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,291
Hey, Orga, can I ask
you somethin'?

221
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,375
Huh?

222
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,208
This whole "Sovereign
of Mars" thing.

223
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,625
Are you sure it's a goal
that you're pursuing

224
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,083
for the best interest
of your family?

225
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,375
I honestly believe it is.

226
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,250
When that happens, I can
give them an easier life.

227
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,250
With proper status.

228
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,625
I see.

229
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,750
[ORGA] But why are you
asking about that, Brother?

230
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,083
Something wrong?

231
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,041
It just seems like you're
in too much of a hurry

232
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,916
to accomplish this.

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,250
You know there could be other
ways for your family--

234
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,958
[ORGA]
Yeah, maybe there are.

235
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,666
But...

236
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,208
When it comes down to it,

237
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:02,958
we can't run away
from the fighting.

238
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,708
The blood we've already shed,
and the blood we're gonna shed.

239
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,625
[NAZE]
Don't get so worked up.

240
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,333
It's just as you've said,
Blood Brother.

241
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,041
This may very well
be the only way

242
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,125
that you can reach
your objective.

243
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,083
But there's something
you should know.

244
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,958
As I sit here,
looking into your eyes,

245
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:22,708
I see someone who isn't quite
sure where he's headed.

246
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,000
You wanna get to your
goal as soon as possible

247
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,958
and take it easy, right?

248
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,833
[ORGA]
Brother...


249
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,583
[KUDELIA]
I'm so sorry

250
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
that I couldn't come
by to see you earlier.

251
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,541
[ATRA] Oh, it's okay.
We sort of figured

252
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,208
you were busy dealing with
the aftermath of the battle.

253
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,166
Boy, these sure do
look delicious.

254
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,250
Do you like them, Mikazuki?

255
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,541
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah.

256
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,833
[MIKAZUKI]
This is good.

257
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,250
Glad to hear it.

258
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,291
[ATRA] Careful, Mikazuki.
The cream is dripping.

259
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,791
[MIKAZUKI]
Hmm?

260
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,208
Don't know why, but Mikazuki
just won't stay still.

261
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,875
He makes Hush carry him around

262
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,333
and then they go
missing all the time.

263
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:03,833
Huh?

264
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,125
[MIKAZUKI] I keep telling you,
leave me next to Barbatos.

265
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,541
If you connect me to it,
then I can move.

266
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,583
[ATRA]
Oh, come on. Not that again.

267
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,916
[MIKAZUKI]
How are things at the farm?

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,791
Things are going smoothly.

269
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,083
Come to think of it, next
month will be the harvest.

270
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,583
Oh, that's right.

271
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,250
Though I guess I won't be
able to help her like this.

272
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:25,166
[gasps]

273
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,791
Don't talk that way!

274
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,666
If they need extra farm hands,
I'd be more than happy to help!

275
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,708
[MIKAZUKI]
But you can't.

276
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,625
[KUDELIA, ATRA gasp]

277
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,000
You're much too busy.

278
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,041
You have your own work
to do, Kudelia.

279
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,875
[gasps]

280
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:41,833
Yeah. I... suppose you're right.

281
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,791
[KUDELIA]
I'm such a coward.

282
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,291
Uh?

283
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,416
[KUDELIA]
I was afraid to see Mikazuki.

284
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,375
I was worried.

285
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:57,250
That's the reason I haven't
come to see him before now.

286
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,333
Miss Kudelia...

287
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,583
B-But, think about it!

288
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,958
Mikazuki was exactly
the same, wasn't he?

289
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,458
He was. Hadn't changed
a single bit.

290
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,958
But that's... exactly
what I was afraid of.

291
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,500
[ATRA]
Huh?

292
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:12,875
[KUDELIA]
If going through all this

293
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,583
didn't change him
in the slightest,

294
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,500
what would happen if
he went away again?

295
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,750
[ATRA gasps]

296
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,291
What's wrong, Atra?

297
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,208
[ATRA] Miss Kudelia, what were
you in your former life?

298
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,916
My... former life?

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,333
Sorry, but I'm not really sure.

300
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,583
You had the exact same
thought as me!

301
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,708
Huh...?

302
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,666
[ATRA]
That Mikazuki didn't change.

303
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,708
Even after he lost
the use of his arm,

304
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,833
he said that he'd be fine as
long as he had Barbatos.

305
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,916
And now he says
he can work again

306
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,625
anytime the boss tells him to.

307
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,875
Oh, miss Atra.

308
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,166
[ATRA] It's just... you'd
think I'd be happy

309
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,791
he's still the same person
we know and love.

310
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:03,208
But, I'm afraid the next
time he leaves. it'll...

311
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,166
It'll be for good and we'll
never see him again.

312
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,125
[ATRA cries]

313
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,291
Try not to worry.

314
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,208
[ATRA] I don't mean
to sound pushy, but,

315
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,875

00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,458
What do you mean by "simpler"?

474
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:51,375
[MIKAZUKI]
Kudelia told me something.

475
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,166
She said that she's
going to make a world

476
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,875
where we don't have to fight.

477
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,958
I never really understood it.

478
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:00,916
But, now I don't have to.

479
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,250
[gasps]

480
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,583
[MIKAZUKI] I can't run anymore
without Barbatos.

481
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:07,791
And because of that limitation,

482
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,500
I can no longer live
without fighting.

483
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,416
[ORGA whimpering]

484
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,375
[MIKAZUKI] Orga, would you
please take me with you?

485
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,625
[ORGA]
Mika...

486
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,416
[MIKAZUKI]
As long as I have your orders,

487
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,708
I know that I can go anywhere.

488
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,583
[ORGA whimpers]

489
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,500
[MIKAZUKI]
I'm not gonna let you be sorry.

490
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,666
[ORGA]
Yeah, I understand.

491
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,166
No apologies.

492
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,875
I promise...
to take you with me.

493
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,958
[AMIDA]
Next time on

494
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:29,208
<i>Mobile Suit Gundam:</i>
<i>Iron-Blooded Orphans,</i>

495
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,541
"Counsel."

496
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,125
Isn't the color of my
Hyakuren wonderful?


497
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:35,083
I absolutely adore it.


498
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,708
It just shouts "love,"
doesn't it?
