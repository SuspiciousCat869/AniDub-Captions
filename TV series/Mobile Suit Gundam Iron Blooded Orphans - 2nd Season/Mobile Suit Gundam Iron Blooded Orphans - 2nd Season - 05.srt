00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,708
we could've made him
look even more important!

160
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,125
That's for sure.

161
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,083
[LAFTER]
You're looking happy, Akihiro.

162
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,625
Yeah...

163
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,250
Not too long ago, Chad and I
were both called Human Debris.

164
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,708
Yes, I know.

165
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,875
There's not a doubt in my
mind that he'll do us proud.

166
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,000
[RIDE]
You know it!

167
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,791
Although, I bet if
it were you Akihiro,

168
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,041
you'd get all nervous
and totally freeze up!

169
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:54,958
[AKIHIRO grunts]

170
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,208
[RIDE gasps]

171
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,250
[SHINO]
Ride!

172
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,000
You comin' with, or not?

173
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,041
[RIDE]
Nah, not this time.

174
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:03,916
I have a lot of work that
needs to get finished here.

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,541
No way in hell am I
getting shown up by Takaki.

176
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,458
[SHINO chuckles]

177
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,541
[RIDE]
Hey, how's it coming?!

178
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,416
[ZACK]
Yo. What's up?

179
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,333
Is Mikazuki going to earth, too?

180
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,458
We're just delivering Shidens
at the moment, so I doubt it.

181
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:17,958
Why do you ask?

182
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,500
If there's even the
slightest chance

183
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,958
there's going to be a battle,

184
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,583
then I wanna be there
when it happens.

185
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,458
[ZACK] Huh? Are you still
going on about that?

186
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:29,625
Dane, there's somethin'
wrong with this dude!

187
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:30,958
[DANE]
Mm.

188
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,666
[ORGA]
Sorry, Atra.

189
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,041
You were just about to
close up shop, weren't you?

190
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,250
[ATRA]
Not a problem.

191
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,416
But, are you sure you
want it like that?

192
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,916
I can reheat it if you'd like.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,916
That's alright.

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,333
[ATRA]
Oh, I have fruit, too!

195
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,041
Hey. Why didn't you
reheat the food?

196
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,458
Huh?

197
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,625
[ORGA chuckles]

198
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:54,166
I'm fine with
eating it as it is.

199
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,791
Yeah, and why is that?

200
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:59,541
It goes the same for food,
work, or trouble.

201
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,583
You gotta deal with what's
in front of you, as is.

202
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:06,208
Otherwise, it becomes
impossible to move forward.

203
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,583
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm?

204
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,625
[ORGA]
Hm? What's wrong?

205
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,291
I can't eat with you
staring at me like that.

206
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,416
You've lost weight.

207
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
Huh? Think so?

208
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,458
[ORGA gasps]

209
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,791
What the hell's that?

210
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,583
[MIKAZUKI]
Nutrients.

211
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,000
[ORGA gasps]

212
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,458
I don't wanna see you getting
too skinny. So eat up.

213
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,750
[ORGA chuckles]

214
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,875
[ATRA] Hey, you want
some fruit, Mikazuki?

215
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,375
[MIKAZUKI] No, thanks.
Peeling them is a hassle.

216
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,333
[ATRA]
Hm?

217
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,125
[ORGA grunts]

218
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,208
What's wrong?
Did it taste bad?

219
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,625
Oh, uh... no.

220
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,250
[ORGA]
Thanks though, Mika.

221
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,666
[IOK]
My apologies, sir.

222
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,208
I overlooked all the
warning signs,

223
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,791
regarding McGillis's
intentions.

224
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,333
[JULIETA]
Why stop there?

225
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,333
It's probably more
accurate to say that you

226
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,250
helped him along.

227
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,250
[IOK grunts]

228
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,500
[RUSTAL]
No matter...

229
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,208
They got the better of
us in the Mars-sphere,

230
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,291
but it'll be our turn next.

231
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,833
[IOK]
Our turn, sir?

232
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,166
Our next battleground
will be on Earth.

233
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,666
[JULIETA]
Huh?

234
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,250
Earth is the home base of
the McGillis faction, is it not?

235
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,250
I would assume that
us taking action there

236
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,500
would stir up trouble
within the Seven Stars.

237
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:15,958
[RUSTAL]
True.

238
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,375
Which is why I've requested
assistance from that man.

239
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,000
By that man...
you don't mean...?

240
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,416
The bearded gentleman?

241
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,625
[RUSTAL chuckles]

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
[IOK] I always feel weird
around that bearded man.

243
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,083
His personality is
a bit oppressive.

244
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:30,791
I agree, he possesses

245
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:33,708
an impressive mind and
an equally powerful body.

246
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,166
Merely looking
him in the eye

247
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,416
must be a daunting prospect
for one as feeble as you.

248
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,541
[IOK grunts]

249
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,375
[JULIETA] I should get going.

250
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,375
[IOK scoffs]
Monkey bitch!

251
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,333
[JULIETA]
I want him to watch me!

252
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,708
To see what I'm capable of now!

253
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,041
[JULIETA gasps]

254
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,208
[JULIETA] I still can't
wrap my brain around it.

255
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,916
There's no shortage
of able bodies

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
within the ranks
of Gjallarhorn,

257
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,541
and yet...

258
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,291
[JULIETA] ...he still
chose a nobody like you

259
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,250
to be his right-hand man.

260
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,083
Surely you must see
how alarming that is.

261
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,291
[VIDAR]
Alarming?

262
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,583
To put it simply,

263
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:14,083
Master Rustal is
showing favoritism.

264
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,125
[VIDAR chuckles]

265
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,125
[JULIETA gasps]

266
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,541
Did I just hear a
laugh from you?

267
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:21,750
[VIDAR] You did indeed, as the
people of this fleet once said

268
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,916
the very same thing about you.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,083
[gasps]
You're right... they did.

270
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,583
I have no rank or supporters.

271
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,666
[JULIETA]
However, I can say this.

272
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,375
I was acknowledged by Master
Rustal for my exceptional

273
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:37,166
ability to pilot a
Mobile Suit.

274
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,166
[VIDAR]
I take it you trust Rustal?

275
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,958
[JULIETA]
Mm? Of course I do!

276
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,958
I'm proud of Master Rustal.

277
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,833
He's a respected
superior officer.

278
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,291
[VIDAR]
Hm... I see.

279
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,833
[JULIETA gasps]

280
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,291
[VIDAR]
Proud of him, you say?

281
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,958
[CHAD]
The ceremony will begin at ten.

282
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,333
VIPs will start
arriving at nine.

283
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,541
If you see anything
remotely suspicious,

284
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,000
report it to me immediately.
That clear?

285
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,500
[TEKKADAN MEMBERS]
Sir!

286
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,958
All right, that's it then,
go take your positions.

287
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,958
[TEKKADAN MEMBERS chatter]

288
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:11,916
Takaki.

289
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,375
[TAKAKI]
Huh?

290
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,666
[CHAD] I'm putting you in
charge of things around here

291
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,916
while I'm away. Got it?

292
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,333
Yes, sir!

293
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,625
[MINISTER A] This grand
occasion marks the formation

294
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,375
of the new Arbrau
Defense Force.

295
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,625
Until now, we've had no
means of defending ourselves

296
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,416
besides hiding under the
umbrella of Gjallarhorn's

297
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,791
military might. Given this fact,

298
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,625
I would say we've achieved
a tremendous feat...

299
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:36,375
Sounds like the
ceremony is underway.

300
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,875
[TAKAKI gasps]
Aston?

301
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,750
Huh? Yeah?

302
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,125
You know you've been
acting kinda weird lately.

303
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,458
I'm not exactly a brainiac,

304
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,583
so I can't really put my
thoughts into words.

305
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,708
[TAKAKI grunts]

306
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,250
I guess I was just a little
shocked when I saw Chad

307
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,875
all dressed up.

308
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,416
It made me wish
that everyone else

309
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,708
could see him, too.

310
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:00,375
[ASTON grunts]

311
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,166
So you're saying that
you're proud of him?

312
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,791
Yeah, I guess I am sorta proud.

313
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,458
Sounds to me like you
were feeling happy too.

314
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,791
[ASTON]
Mm.

315
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,208
[TAKAKI]
Mm.

316
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,833
[MAKANAI] Tekkadan has been
doing a remarkable job

317
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:18,333
of fulfilling its military
advisor duties.

318
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,500
It's because of you all

319
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,333
that we're able to
have this ceremony.

320
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,750
Thank you so much.

321
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,125
You're welcome, sir.

322
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,958
[MAKANAI]
I will continue to count on you

323
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,625
as the man in charge of
this branch of Tekkadan.

324
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,041
Chad Chadan.

325
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,708
[gasps]
He knows my name...

326
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:34,958
[knocking]

327
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,458
[AIDE A]
Excuse me.

328
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,083
Mr. Makanai, they're just about
ready for your speech, sir.

329
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,000
Huh?

330
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,166
[MAKANAI]
Hm?

331
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,916
[AIDE A] How long have
those been there?

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,083
They weren't there
during our sweep.

333
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,958
[MAKANAI]
You mean these flowers?

334
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,208
[CHAD]
Mr. Makanai, wait!

335
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,125
--[beeping]
--[MAKANAI] Huh?

336
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,416
[CHAD grunts]

337
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,791
[ASTON]
Huh?

338
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,958
[MAN A]
An explosion?

339
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,375
[MAN B] It came from
inside the building!

340
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,208
[TAKAKI] Aston, would you
wait for a minute?!

341
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,666
Arbrau is on internal
security, remember?!

342
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,875
So don't worry.

343
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,291
Plus, Chad's also in there.

344
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,583
But we...

345
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,208
[TAKAKI] Our job right now
is to check the area

346
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,833
around the building
for anyone suspicious!

347
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,083
[MAN C]
How bad is the damage?

348
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,000
[MAN D]
Can't tell.

349
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,250
[STAFF A]
Was anyone hurt?

350
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,791
I've already told you
everything that I know!

351
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,583
[MAN E]
Apparently, Mr. Makanai is hurt!

352
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:22,791
[STAFF B gasps]
Seriously?!

353
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,666
What?

354
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,791
[ASTON]
Hey, where is Chad?

355
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,583
What? Chad who?

356
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,875
[ASTON] He's part of
Makanai's security team!

357
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,250
[MAN F]
Well...

358
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,416
I heard some security people
were injured as well.

359
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,625
[MAN G]
What happened?

360
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,541
[MAN H]
An explosion.

361
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,000
[WOMAN A]
Look! Over there!

362
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,625
[GALAN]
There's the starting signal.

363
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,625
Now it begins.

364
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,208
Smoke from a much bigger
blast will soon rise.

365
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,750
Before anything
else happens,

366
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,458
I think we should discuss
the matter of my payment.

367
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,083
[GALAN]
Not to worry.

368
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,541
I fully intend to honor
each and every one of

369
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,833
your proposed terms.

370
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,208
[RADICE]
Mm.

371
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,166
[GALAN] But doesn't this
nag at your conscience

372
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,000
in the slightest?

373
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,750
You're essentially taking a
bunch of kids you've lived with

374
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:07,083
and throwing them
into the chaos of war.

375
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,000
[RADICE]
Space rats, like them,

376
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,583
without the least
bit of education,

377
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,458
are no better than animals.

378
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,625
And due to my allergies,
I hate being around animals.

379
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,375
[GALAN laughs]
That's a good one!

380
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,666
You're a really funny guy,
you know that?

381
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,041
[GALAN]
Hm.

382
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:27,875
Luckily, I happen
to like funny guys.


383
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,375
[MCGILLIS' MAN A]
Investigations are currently

384
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,708
underway to determine if
this was the act of a group

385
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,041
or a lone perpetrator,

386
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,583
as well as possible
motives and goals.

387
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,166
[MCGILLIS]
Hm.

388
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,666
[MCGILLIS' MAN A]
There's been some speculation

389
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,291
going around that
it might be the act of

390
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,750
a terrorist group
that's opposed to

391
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,041
the formation of the
new defense force.

392
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,166
As of late, a reliance
upon Gjallarhorn has fallen.

393
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,000
And there's been a
global rush to establish

394
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
independent military forces.

395
00:15:55,583 --> 00:16:00,041
If that's the underlying cause
of this, it's understandable.

396
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,666
Arbrau guarded the
ceremony venue,

397
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,916
along with a bit of assistance
from our friends, Tekkadan.

398
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,208
[TEKKADAN MEMBER A] Come on,
it's been three days already!

399
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,958
What's going on with Mr. Chad?

400
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,791
[TAKAKI]
According to Mr. Radice,

401
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,000
he still hasn't
regained consciousness.

402
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,541
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B] No way!
What does the Boss think?!

403
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,875
Mr. Radice is HQ's
go-between, so I'm not sure.

404
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,083
[TEKKADAN MEMBER A] I am so
sick of hearing that guys name.

405
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,583
[TAKAKI gasps]

406
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,250
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B] Let's just
go avenge Chad ourselves!

407
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,416
Nothing's stopping us!

408
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,375
No, you can't act on
your own like that!

409
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:30,625
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B]
Why the hell not?

410
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,333
If Boss were here,
you know that's what

411
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,750
he'd order us to do!

412
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,916
That's exactly my point,
he hasn't given any orders yet!

413
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,125
So we can't run off and
act on our own authority!

414
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,166
[TEKKADAN MEMBER B groans]

415
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,458
[TEKKADAN MEMBER A]
This sucks...

416
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,375
[TAKAKI]
Tch...!

417
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,208
There's been no change
in his condition.

418
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:47,125
Mr. Makanai is
still unconscious.

419
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,500
Even so...

420
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,625
[RADICE] Arbrau doesn't have
any leads at this point,

421
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,666
so they're looking into
a lapse in security.

422
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,708
[TAKAKI gasps]

423
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:54,833
[RADICE]
It's possible they'll start

424
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:58,125
pointing the finger
at us before long.

425
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,500
--[TAKAKI] Umm...
--[RADICE] Hmm?

426
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,916
[TAKAKI]
I have a question,

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,583
and it's something I need
to ask the Boss directly.

428
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,666
[RADICE] As I've said,
Chad put me in charge

429
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,166
of all communications
with HQ in his absence,

430
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,791
which means any messages
are to be sent through me.

431
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,250
Do you honestly think
that story is gonna fly

432
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,875
with the rest of
the members?!

433
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:18,791
Unless I'm mistaken, it's your
job to make sure that it does.

434
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:23,125
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have paperwork to finish.

435
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,583
[TAKAKI]
Understood.

436
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,250
[TAKAKI] You heard Chad,
just like I did.

437
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,625
I'm in command while he's gone.

438
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,416
That's why I have to
keep a level head

439
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,416
and not act selfishly.

440
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Even if it doesn't sit
well with the guys.

441
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:43,375
I can't endanger everyone's
lives over my personal opinions.

442
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,333
I'm with the others on this.

443
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,000
Somebody's gonna
have to pay for Chad.

444
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,375
Aston...

445
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,083
But, what I want even
more is to be your ally.

446
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:56,083
[TAKAKI gasps]

447
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,416
Thank you, Aston.

448
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,416
[EUGENE] Damn it! We're totally
out of the loop, here!

449
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,041
What're we hearing
from the Earth Branch?

450
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,000
All they're doing is
repeating the fact

451
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,416
that Chad and Mr. Makanai
have been injured.

452
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,458
"It's all under control,
let us handle it," they say.

453
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,833
Besides that,
we don't know jack!

454
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,083
Well isn't it possible
to talk to Takaki?

455
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,458
[EUGENE] They said he doesn't
have time to stop and talk

456
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,083
because he's
filling in for Chad.

457
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,708
[AKIHIRO]
Hm.

458
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,583
My gut's sayin'
something's wrong.

459
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:23,791
Oh yeah?

460
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,875
[ORGA] Eugene, can you
take off right away?

461
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,041
I guess, but where am I going?

462
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,000
[ORGA] Earth. We're gonna
bump up the Shiden delivery.

463
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,291
Huh?

464
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,666
[ORGA] I want you on
that ship... Both of you.

465
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,875
[AKIHIRO]
Hm.

466
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,583
[TEKKADAN MEMBER C]
Looks like there's trouble.

467
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,291
[TAKAKI]
Hm?

468
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,541
Yeah? What's going on?

469
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,291
I just overheard some of
