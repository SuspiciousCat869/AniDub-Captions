155
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,666
up and running, and it's
already in this sorry state.

156
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
Damn it...

157
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,500
I wish you'd show a little
restraint with your gear.

158
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,500
So how'd the Lupus
do out there?

159
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,875
Lupus?

160
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,958
[YUKINOJO] You know good
and well that's the new name

161
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,416
the Teiwaz chief
mechanic gave it.

162
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,791
The Barbatos is the Barbatos.

163
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,833
The repairs were good.

164
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,166
--You never change.

166
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,500
Hello, everyone. How are you?

167
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,666
[YUKINOJO]
Hey.

168
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,875
[KUDELIA] Hi Mikazuki.
It's been a while.

169
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,125
[MIKAZUKI]
Mm. Good to see you.

170
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,708
[YUKINOJO] Why don't you go
and get some air, Mikazuki?

171
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,250
You two must have
some catching up to do.

172
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,208
[MIKAZUKI]
We do?

173
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,083
[YUKINOJO]
Just go, already.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,583
[KUDELIA]
Have you been well?

175
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,041
[MIKAZUKI]
Yeah.

176
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,333
[KUDELIA] I've stopped by
to visit a few times now,

177
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,583
but you've always been away.

178
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,166
[MIKAZUKI]
Oh... yeah.

179
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,000
[KUDELIA] Orga tells me
whenever there's fighting,

180
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,458
you and the Barbatos are
always on the front lines,

181
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,750
leading the charge into battle.

182
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,750
[MIKAZUKI] Well... unlike all
the other guys...

183
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,083
...fighting is the only
thing I'm good for.

184
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,500
[KUDELIA gasps]

185
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,833
[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia.

186
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,541
Good, you're here!
Perfect timing!

187
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,041
[KUDELIA]
Miss Atra!

188
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:31,041
[ATRA] There's, uh, something
that I'd like to give you.

189
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,916
[ATRA]
Here.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,041
This is for me?

191
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,208
[ATRA] Yep! Now we
have a matching set!

192
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,125
This way, no matter where
we are in the world,

193
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,458
we'll stay connected.

194
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,250
[gasps]

195
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,583
[MIKAZUKI] Lately, mine has
started to smell a little.

196
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,375
[ATRA]
Really?

197
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,750
Honestly, it smells like you.
Sorta like blood.

198
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,583
[ATRA] But if it bothers you,
I'll wash it. I will!

199
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,666
[MIKAZUKI]
Hm.

200
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,250
[ATRA]
Miss Kudelia.

201
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,416
[KUDELIA]
Huh?

202
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,875
Shall we go?

203
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,583
[KUDELIA chuckles]

204
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,625
[EUGENE]
This had better be important.

205
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,708
I have work to do.

206
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,916
[NEW MEMBER A]
Sorry to bother you,

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,666
but there's this
strange old dude...

208
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,416
Old dude?

209
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,333
[TODO]
Hello there!

210
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,250
Hey there, Deputy Boss Eugene.

211
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,208
[EUGENE]
Great... It's you.

212
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,958
[TODO]
so, are these new recruits?

213
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,250
You need to make sure they
know the names and faces of

214
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,583
your business associates.
This kind a thing won't do.

215
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,541
[NEW MEMBER B]
Is he a VIP?

216
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,708
You could say that.
Very Irritating Person.

217
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,208
[TODO laughs]
That's the witty Deputy Boss

218
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,875
we all know and love!
Always with the witty retorts!

219
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,166
I knew taking you under
my wing was a good idea.

220
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,375
I wanna kill you.

221
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,875
[TODO]
Oh, lighten up.

222
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,041
This is what happens when
you don't have a proper diet.

223
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,541
Speaking of which,
want some candy, little boy?

224
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,625
Seriously?

225
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't fall for that crap.

226
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,500
[TODO]
Now, now...

227
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,833
I come with news that'll put
a smile even on your face.

228
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:54,958
Directly from my boss.

229
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,416
Huh?

230
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,250
[ORGA] It's not that I don't
appreciate the job offer,

231
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,208
but our hands are pretty
full for the time being.

232
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,208
Mister...?

233
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,166
[MCGILLIS]
Montag. Call me Montag.

234
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,083
I'd rather you used that
name when referring to me.

235
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,583
Though it's an open secret that
you've been lending me a hand.

236
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,916
Fine... what's the job?

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,458
[MCGILLIS] To eliminate
the Dawn Horizon Corps.

238
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,083
[gasps]

239
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:23,208
Heh. That your way of saying
you know what's going on?

240
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,125
Why the interest
in pirate hunting?

241
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,166
[MCGILLIS] The Dawn Horizon
Corps is an enormous,

242
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,708
yet elusive,
pirate gang whose reach,

243
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:32,416
extends all the way
to the Earth Sphere.

244
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,291
Tracking them has proven to be
a difficult task, even for us.

245
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,500
[ORGA sighs]

246
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,458
[MCGILLIS]
I'll help however I can.

247
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:43,500
My assistant, Isurugi, is
already heading over to aid you.

248
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,333
He's familiar with the
inner workings of the

249
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,583
Dawn Horizon Corps
and very skilled.

250
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,250
So you're using us as bait, huh?

251
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,458
[MCGILLIS]
Such a lack of trust.

252
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,708
I never trusted
you to begin with.

253
00:11:56,791 --> 00:12:00,875
[ORGA] However... I'll take
you up on your offer.

254
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,666
Oh? Why would you accept it,
if you don't trust me?

255
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Because accepting your
offer means taking the


256
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,250
shortest route
possible to our goal.


257
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,666
[MCMURDO] You want to fight
the Dawn Horizon Corps?

258
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,333
[ORGA]
Yeah. They raid shipping lanes,

259
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,208
so I believe they're also
a nuisance to Teiwaz.

260
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,375
[MCMURDO]
That's true... But still...

261
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,708
[ORGA] And we can promote
Teiwaz's latest frame

262
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,916
by showing off the
power of our Shidens.

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,875
[JASLEY]
Hmph.

264
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,666
[MCMURDO]
I see your point.

265
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,000
Very well, do as you wish.

266
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,708
[ORGA] Thanks. You're not
gonna regret this.

267
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,208
[JASLEY]
Old man...

268
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,708
...why do you always let that
guy do whatever he wants?

269
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,833
There's no point putting
on the "nice grandpa"

270
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,250
act with those kids.

271
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,166
What are you saying exactly?

272
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,500
Will you hunt down the
Dawn Horizon Corps?

273
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,625
Are you kidding?
I'm not that crazy.

274
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,125
Let the newbies take care
of those idiot pirates on

275
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,458
their own, it's not like they
can't handle it by themselves--

276
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,666
Then why are you complaining?

277
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,750
[JASLEY gasps]

278
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,125
[MCMURDO]
Hm.

279
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,375
They're shaping up to
be an interesting bunch,

280
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:08,208
aren't they, Naze?
Those kids are quite something.

281
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
[RADICE]
This isn't what we agreed on.


282
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,625
I thought that the plan was
for them to send Shidens

283
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,708
to the Earth Branch no later
than the end of the month.

284
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,375
Surely they know
we can't hold out

285
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,750
with just the Landman
Rodis we have.

286
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,250
[CHAD]
Of course they do.

287
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:24,750
But HQ is taking on the
Dawn Horizon Corps,

288
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,416
so they need the firepower.

289
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,083
I would think you'd be a little
more understanding about it.

290
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,375
[RADICE]
Not my problem, I'm afraid.

291
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,000
[he Earth Branch will have no
involvement in that conflict,

292
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,583
so it's none--

293
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,500
If I'm being frank, they're the
ones who need reinforcements.

294
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,666
But the boss doesn't ask

295
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,500
because he's worried
about our situation.

296
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,666
[RADICE grunts]

297
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,375
[CHAD] So keep that
in mind before you--

298
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,416
Orga's worried. Is he?

299
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,791
[CHAD gasps]

300
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,208
[RADICE] The equipment
shortages and our relations

301
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,041
with Arbrau's
regular soldiers.

302
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,166
That's what we're worried about.

303
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,375
And yet... HQ doesn't
help us, at all.

304
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,541
They just keep
making things worse.

305
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,416
And at this rate...

306
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,250
[CHAD]
Mr. Radice.

307
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
[RADICE gasps]

308
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,291
[CHAD] Both the Earth Branch
and HQ are part of Tekkadan.

309
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,041
We all trust Orga.

310
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,958
And we know our boss'll
lead us down the right path.

311
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,458
That's how Tekkadan works.

312
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:09,875
[RADICE grunts]

313
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,666
What nonsense.

314
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,791
[CHAD sighs]

315
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,375
[SOLDIER A]
What did you just say?!

316
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,250
Wanna run that by
me again, you little--

317
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,458
As long as you're here,

318
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,333
you're gonna do things
the Tekkadan way.

319
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,291
[SOLDIER C]
Calm down, already!

320
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,583
[TAKAKI]
What's going on?

321
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,125
[SOLDIER A] Oh, I'll tell
you what's going on!

322
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,041
This little know-it-all
punk here doesn't know

323
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,375
who he's talking to!

324
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,291
Since when do you call the
guy who's teaching you

325
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:39,666
the ropes a "know-it-all?"

326
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,958
Aston come on!

327
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,541
Sorry about this.
I promise talk with him.

328
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,791
You apologize too.

329
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,208
[ASTON]
Hmph.

330
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,541
[TAKAKI]
Aston!

331
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,958
[TAKAKI]
Here, eat up.

332
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,125
This?

333
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,791
Just dig in, okay?

334
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,333
[ASTON grunts]

335
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,791
I was expectin' to get
chewed out or somethin'...

336
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,583
[TAKAKI] You know,
you weren't wrong back there.

337
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,125
[ASTON grunts]

338
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,083
But I don't think
those regular soldiers

339
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,416
were in the wrong, either.

340
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,958
They have their pride,
just like you.

341
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,416
[TAKAKI]
That's how it is.

342
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,875
[FUKA]
So...?

343
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,416
[ASTON]
Hm?

344
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,916
How's it taste?

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,625
Good.

346
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,208
Do you really mean it?

347
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:26,208
[ASTON grunts] Growing up, there
was nothing to eat but garbage,

348
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,375
so everything tastes good,
compared to that.

349
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,416
Well, I'm glad it's
better than garbage...

350
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
[ASTON]
No! That's not what I meant!

351
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,541
Don't worry about it,
you're fine.

352
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,458
Fuka, is there tea?

353
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,500
Yep.

354
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,166
[ASTON] 
Don't you ever get lonely?

355
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,583
[TAKAKI]
Huh?

356
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,125
Being away from Mars.

357
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,500
[TAKAKI] Not really. My life
here is actually pretty great.

358
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:52,666
I get to live with Fuka and I
can even send her to school.

359
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,791
Plus, I've got
friends here, too.

360
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,000
[ASTON gasps]

361
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,583
Sorry... was that too
presumptuous of me?

362
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,208
Oh... no...

363
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,333
Can you set out
some cups, Takaki?

364
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,000
[TAKAKI]
Sure.

365
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,541
Are the red ones okay?

366
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,166
[FUKA]
No, the good ones for guests.

367
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,666
[YUKINOJO] Mm! Today's soup
sure is delicious.

368
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,333
[ATRA chuckles] It was
prepared with real chicken

369
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:18,250
for our hard-working
maintenance crew!

370
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,583
[YAMAGI]
Meat from a living creature?

371
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,583
I'll pass, thanks.

372
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,166
yum.

373
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,833
[ATRA] Come on! You're starting
to sound exactly like Mikazuki.

374
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,958
[YAMAGI]
I'm not that bad, am I?

375
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,416
Got a sec?

376
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,916
Oh... Hush, right? Did you
not get enough food to eat?

377
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What's wrong?

378
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,041
Nothing, I...

379
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,833
Would it be all right if
I piloted a mobile suit?

380
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,083
Huh? Are you serious?

381
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,750
[HUSH]
I've read all the manuals.

382
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:43,458
[DANE]
Yeah.

383
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,250
You're kidding, right?

384
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,791
It takes more than that
to pilot a mobile suit.

385
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,833
Which is why I... I wanna
get the Alaya-Vijnana.

386
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,083
[ATRA gasps]

387
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:54,791
[YUKINOJO] Hush, was it?
How old are you anyway?

388
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,250
Seventeen, sir...

389
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,833
Well, if that's the case,

390
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,708
then you're too old to get
the Alaya-Vijnana surgery.

391
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,083
I'm sorry, kid.

392
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,125
Too old?

393
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,166
You heard me. At your age,

394
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,208
it'd be impossible for the
nano-machines to take root.

395
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,666
You could at least try
it on me, couldn't you?

396
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,916
I don't care if it
doesn't work out.

397
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,875
Don't say that!

398
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,083
[gasps]

399
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,125
[ATRA]
It's not to be taken lightly!

400
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,833
The Alaya-Vijnana surgery...
is a really dangerous one!

401
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,666
And if it doesn't work,
you could die!

402
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,083
I understand that.

403
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,458
[ATRA gasps]
You do not!

404
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,833
There's a reason the boss
banned the surgery.

405
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,750
He's looking out for you guys!

406
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,291
What do you know
about it, anyway?

407
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,750
Get out of my--

408
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,416
[HUSH gasps]

409
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,666
[YAMAGI]
Mikazuki.

410
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,208
Hold on, Mikazuki,
it's not what you think--

411
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,458
What are you doing?

412
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,333
Why is he--

413
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,541
[HUSH groans]

414
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:47,000
[MIKAZUKI] What were
you doing to her? Talk.

415
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,750
[HUSH groans]
Let go!

416
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,250
[YUKINOJO]
Hey.

417
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,583
[ATRA gasps]

418
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,875
Dial it down before you
break the poor kid's arm.

419
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,541
Yeah, we were just having
a conversation, really!

420
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,708
So, wait...

421
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:57,958
...he wasn't picking on you?

422
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,583
[ATRA] Hey You know
I don't get bullied!

423
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:01,500
Why on you...?

424
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:02,750
[MIKAZUKI]
Huh?

425
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,708
[HUSH grunts] Why did it
work on you but not him?

426
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,500
[MIKAZUKI]
"Him"?

427
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,083
[HUSH grunts]

428
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:12,250
[HUSH] Just forget it.
Sorry I bothered you.

429
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,000
[MIKAZUKI]
Sorry, I guess.

430
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,125
[HUSH]
It's fine.

431
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,666
What was that about?

432
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,875
[ATRA]
Hmm. He's pretty strange.

433
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,041
[DANE] So what,
you're not afraid to die?

434
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,000
[HUSH]
Hm?

435
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,875
Everyone's afraid of dying.

436
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,916
That's true.

437
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,666
[HUSH]
But...

438
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,750
[DANE]
Hm?

439
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,125
Something else scares
me even more...

440
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,625
[DANE grunts]

441
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:44,041
[HUSH]
I come from the slums.

442
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,708
All of the kids that lost
their parents stuck together

443
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,208
to survive.

444
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,125
[BOY A giggles]

445
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:52,958
[BOY B]
We sure got a major haul!

446
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,000
[BOY A]
Major haul!

447
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,958
[HUSH]
Hey guys, don't run so fast!

448
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,250
[HUSH]
Huh?

449
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,791
Builth...

450
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,916
[HUSH] Builth was
like our big brother.

451
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,708
He always said he wanted
to make our lives easier.

452
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,458
So he left the slums
to become a soldier.

453
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,708
[HUSH]
But it didn't work out,

454
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,458
and Builth came back
paralyzed from the waist down.

455
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,333
[HUSH]
Builth!

456
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,500
You must be starving!
It's the usual scraps,

457
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,833
but the cafeteria owner
threw in some extra!

458
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,125
[BUILTH grunts]

459
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,833
[HUSH gasps]

460
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,166
[BUILTH]
Apparently,

461
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,291
my surgery for the
Alaya-Vijnana didn't take.

462
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,625
They called me
"Industrial waste."

463
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,333
[HUSH]
Huh?

464
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,000
[BUILTH] And they said
I was worthless now.

465
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,541
[HUSH gasps]

466
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,916
What're you talking about?

467
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,041
That wound'll heal
up in no time!

468
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,875
I mean, come on, you're the
toughest guy I know,

469
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,833
and I'm not just sayin' that.

[BUILTH]
You're wrong...

471
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,833
If I were tough,
this wouldn't have happened.

[HUSH]
Builth...

473
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:07,291
[BUILTH] There were tons of
guys who were tougher than me.

474
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,041
Like this kid who was
in the bed next to mine.

475
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,250
He was way smaller than I was,

476
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,083
but he had the same
surgery three times,

477
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,125
and was as good as new.

478
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,916
Unlike me.

479
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,583
Don't think like that!

480
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,125
[BUILTH]
I didn't make the cut,

481

[HUSH]
Come on, don't!

482
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,875
[BUILTH]
I'm sorry.

483
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,958
I wanted to make life
easier for you guys.

484
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,541
[BUILTH]
But instead...

485
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,750
[BUILTH]
...I'm just a burden.

486
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:46,833
Nothing but industrial waste.
Forgive me... I'm so sorry.

487
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,583
[HUSH] We all thought
the same thing, back then.

488
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,708
That if we stuck with Builth,
everything would work out.

489
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,458
But he... That's why...

490
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:02,250
I have no choice but to
become the next Builth.

491
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:06,375
I'm gonna pilot a Mobile Suit,
mark my words.

492
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:10,791
And I'll make Mikazuki
Augus eat my dust!

493
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,125
I'll show them that
if they stick with me,

494
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,625
we can make this hellhole
of world worth living in.

495
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,208
[HUSH]
Huh? H-Hey...

[DANE]
Good luck on that.

497
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,875
Wasn't expecting that.

498
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,708
[IOK] Who could've imagined that
we'd get stuck battling it out

499
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,500
with pirates on Mars?

00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,375
And McGillis Fareed.

501
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,250
I wonder what the heck
is going through his mind.

502
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,833
There's no need to worry.

503

I am here so that I may
protect you, Master Iok.

[IOK]
Hm?

505
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,958
Truth is, I am repaying
Master Rustal for taking me in.

506
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,875
I feel no particular sense
of devotion toward you,

507
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,000
but for Master Rustal's sake,
I shall keep you safe.

[IOK gasps]

509
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,125
Honestly, I find it
very unlikely McGillis

510
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,333
could ever prove to be a
threat to Master Rustal.

511
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:07,083
However, that other
man does concern me.

Oh... that one.

513
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,708
Trust him or not,
he has been useful.

514
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,833
Because of him, we now
know what McGillis is up to.

00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,291
But, even so...

516

...there's something about
him that doesn't feel right.

[RUSTAL]
How are you doing?

518

I've sent Iok and Julieta...

...to the battle sector.

Seems like McGillis
sent Isurugi.

Exactly as you
predicted he would.
