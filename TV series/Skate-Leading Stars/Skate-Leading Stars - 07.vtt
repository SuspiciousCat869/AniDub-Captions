00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.724 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] The first match
of the Grand Prix Series.

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:19.185 position:50% align:center
The Ionodai members tried
to skate safely and steadily,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50% align:center
but I, the brilliant
Hayato Sasugai,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.523 position:50% align:center
suggested that they
switch to a performance

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:25.567 position:50% align:center
more befitting of challengers.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.070 position:50% align:center
However, the results
weren't exactly positive.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.614 position:50% align:center
I hope it's not getting
everyone down too much.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.659 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI] "At the first
competition of the Grand Prix

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:37.120 position:50% align:center
Series, Chutei University
High School,

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.955 position:50% align:center
last year's
sixth-place finishers,

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.957 position:50% align:center
showcased their
high-level unison skating

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.585 position:50% align:center
in both the short program
and the free skate,

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.503 position:50% align:center
earning them first
place overall."

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.172 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] "It was a
different story for last year's

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.381 position:50% align:center
fourth-place school."

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:50.050 position:50% align:center
Ionodai High School
was ranked second

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.177 position:50% align:center
after delivering a
solid short program,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.387 position:50% align:center
but their score nosedived
in the free skate."

00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:55.847 position:50% align:center
That puts them in sixth place,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.433 position:50% align:center
a difficult position for
the start of the series."

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.726 position:50% align:center
Just great.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.935 position:50% align:center
What do we do, you guys?

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:02.354 position:50% align:center
If the same thing
happens next time,

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.314 position:50% align:center
we're going to lose for sure.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.857 position:50% align:center
Listen, we'll be fine.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.691 position:50% align:center
We will?

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.942 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we've still got time.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.153 position:50% align:center
Not enough to keep
screwing around like that.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.030 position:50% align:center
We're in the worst possible
shape for making it

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:13.490 position:50% align:center
to finals at this point.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:14.699 position:50% align:center
Aki!

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.076 position:50% align:center
I'm not going along
with one of Sasugai's

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.995 position:50% align:center
"brilliant" ideas again.
Not ever.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.498 position:50% align:center
Yeah, man, sorry,
but I feel the same way.

00:01:25.418 --> 00:01:27.045 position:50% align:center
Heya, team.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.797 position:50% align:center
Given the results
of the first match,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.548 position:50% align:center
I've got some ideas for
how we can change up

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:31.758 position:50% align:center
the routine.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.719 position:50% align:center
Let's take a look at them.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:39.474 position:50% align:center
So, uh...

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.199 position:50% align:center
Why is it so tense in here?

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.034 position:50% align:center
Aside from the obvious, I mean.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:22.786 position:50% align:center
We still have two matches left.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.245 position:50% align:center
We can turn it around.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.164 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
I sure hope so.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:28.583 position:50% align:center
I'm going out for a run. See ya.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.126 position:50% align:center
I'm coming with you.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.217 position:50% align:center
Maeshima. Let's talk.

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.638 position:50% align:center
Hey, where are you going?

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.473 position:50% align:center
Jeez, what the hell
is wrong with him?

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.974 position:50% align:center
Maybe give him some time.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.142 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI growls]

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.062 position:50% align:center
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.188 position:50% align:center
So do I.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.693 position:50% align:center
Maeshima! Hold up!

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.070 position:50% align:center
How could you walk in
there smiling like that?

00:03:57.153 --> 00:03:58.947 position:50% align:center
You do realize we
got sixth, right?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.490 position:50% align:center
That seriously sucks!

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.867 position:50% align:center
And it's all because you
opened your big mouth!

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:04.035 position:50% align:center
We were just fine.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.912 position:50% align:center
I mean, sure, we might've
come in second,

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.539 position:50% align:center
but that's better
than dead last.

00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.374 position:50% align:center
And a hell of a lot
better than Shinozaki

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.251 position:50% align:center
seeing such a
crappy performance.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.546 position:50% align:center
Got that out
of your system?

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
[MIURA] An article on
the first competition?

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.283 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Huh? Mr. Miura.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.160 position:50% align:center
Well-written, isn't it?

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.828 position:50% align:center
Of course, it's only
a shorter version

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:48.371 position:50% align:center
of what was in the paper.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:49.789 position:50% align:center
What brings you here?

00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:51.458 position:50% align:center
I'm babysitting the newbie.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.753 position:50% align:center
It's her first reporting gig.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:55.879 position:50% align:center
I was more or less free,

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
so they sent me
along to supervise.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
I'd say the better question
is what are you doing here?

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:04.179 position:50% align:center
You have a thing for
ice show rehearsals now?

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:06.473 position:50% align:center
I'll get some practice
in after the show.

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
School doesn't mind if
it's on my own time.

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:11.936 position:50% align:center
Speaking of Ionodai,
wanna talk about

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.065 position:50% align:center
why they tanked so bad?

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.525 position:50% align:center
After a steady performance
in the short program,

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.195 position:50% align:center
Maeshima became more
spirited in the free skate,

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:21.821 position:50% align:center
and the others tried to follow.

00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.157 position:50% align:center
Only they couldn't catch up.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.077 position:50% align:center
Maeshima was focused
on his own performance,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.455 position:50% align:center
Terauchi and Kiriyama
were watching Maeshima,

00:05:30.538 --> 00:05:32.665 position:50% align:center
and Jonouchi and
Akimitsu were attempting

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.709 position:50% align:center
to emulate the two of them.

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.920 position:50% align:center
They were all looking
in different directions,

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:39.214 position:50% align:center
and it threw them more
and more off course,

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:40.632 position:50% align:center
until eventually...

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.301 position:50% align:center
...they just fell apart.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.886 position:50% align:center
Kind of like an orchestra
that doesn't have

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.638 position:50% align:center
a conductor to lead it.

00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:48.932 position:50% align:center
But as haphazard as it was,
there was something

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:52.352 position:50% align:center
riveting about how
ambitiously they were skating.

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.062 position:50% align:center
The audacity of it
made me feel like

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.690 position:50% align:center
another outcome was possible.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.818 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'm the only
one who felt that way.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.320 position:50% align:center
Yeah, maybe.

00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:04.656 position:50% align:center
Are you gonna continue
on as their coach?

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
You said something
before, didn't you?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.369 position:50% align:center
About not wasting
my time or theirs.

00:06:09.452 --> 00:06:11.413 position:50% align:center
What do you want me
to do, Mr. Miura?

00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:12.455 position:50% align:center
[gasps]

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.583 position:50% align:center
Ask yourself that question.

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.210 position:50% align:center
I figure you coming
here to practice means

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.879 position:50% align:center
that your back is starting
to return to normal.

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.464 position:50% align:center
If you're gonna go
back to competing,

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
stop coaching.

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.968 position:50% align:center
Then you can focus
on your skating.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.845 position:50% align:center
And the Ionodai boys
can start training

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.513 position:50% align:center
under a new coach.

00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:31.057 position:50% align:center
That's what I was getting at
in our other conversation.

00:06:33.143 --> 00:06:34.853 position:50% align:center
It isn't fair to waste
their time because

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.856 position:50% align:center
your own circumstances
are changing.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.607 position:50% align:center
They're aiming to win nationals,

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:42.068 position:50% align:center
and for some of them,
it's their last chance.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:46.906 position:50% align:center
But look, what do I know anyway?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.952 position:50% align:center
It's like I said before,
I'm Takumi Adachi's fan.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
So whatever decision
you end up making,

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.372 position:50% align:center
I'm sure I'll support it.

00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.582 position:50% align:center
See ya.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.585 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:06:59.711 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Good work today.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.004 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Later.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.982 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Good show tonight.

00:07:23.777 --> 00:07:25.987 position:50% align:center
Glad you're here.
Can we talk in a bit?

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.741 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] We should ask the
coach to sit in on practice

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:31.785 position:50% align:center
and see if he has any advice.

00:07:31.868 --> 00:07:33.411 position:50% align:center
That would be easier
if his coaching style

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
wasn't hands-off to
the point of not seeming

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.873 position:50% align:center
interested in us at all.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're forgetting
our intra-club match.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.086 position:50% align:center
He helped us out
then, didn't he?

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:42.379 position:50% align:center
It made a big difference.

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.713 position:50% align:center
You know it did.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:46.049 position:50% align:center
I mean, just think how
much he could teach us.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.634 position:50% align:center
An awesome skater
like him must have

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.886 position:50% align:center
plenty of moves that
we don't know about yet.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.514 position:50% align:center
Is the guy really
that big of a deal?

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:53.807 position:50% align:center
You don't know?

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.228 position:50% align:center
[SEKITA] You ever think
about turning pro?

00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.437 position:50% align:center
Competing costs money,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:00.814 position:50% align:center
and even if you
do have sponsors,

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.524 position:50% align:center
your main source of
income is still that school

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:03.942 position:50% align:center
you've been coaching at, right?

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:05.360 position:50% align:center
My agency said
they could treat you

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:08.071 position:50% align:center
exceptionally well,
financially speaking.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:10.198 position:50% align:center
I'm sure you would like
what they have to offer.

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.120 position:50% align:center
"But I still I haven't
won yet," right?

00:08:16.538 --> 00:08:18.832 position:50% align:center
That's what you used
to always say.

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.875 position:50% align:center
"I haven't gotten
to the top yet.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.378 position:50% align:center
If there's a chance that I
could, then I'm not ready

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:25.255 position:50% align:center
to give up."

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.589 position:50% align:center
You still think that?

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
Even now?

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.180 position:50% align:center
No need to answer.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.724 position:50% align:center
Just give it some thought, okay?

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.945 position:50% align:center
You could call this the
coach's signature move.

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:52.157 position:50% align:center
A quadruple Axel,
quadruple toe loop,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.701 position:50% align:center
and a quadruple loop,
one after the other.

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:58.913 position:50% align:center
He did it once in a competition,
but nobody's landed it since.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:01.833 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] It takes serious
physical ability to pull off.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
It's a tough combo,
made even more difficult

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.796 position:50% align:center
by how hard it is to
incorporate into a routine.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.256 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Tomo! One more time!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.633 position:50% align:center
Oh. Sure thing.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:13.386 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] Second at All-Japan,
a career-high ranking

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
of eighth in the world,

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
and he placed at a lot of
other top-tier competitions.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.852 position:50% align:center
The media doesn't cover
him as much anymore,

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.270 position:50% align:center
but back before he was injured,

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:23.730 position:50% align:center
a lot of people had
their eyes on him

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.065 position:50% align:center
as a potential star.

00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:26.858 position:50% align:center
Of course, that gruff
personality of his

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.985 position:50% align:center
was off-putting to some.

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.487 position:50% align:center
But at least we knew
what to expect

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.863 position:50% align:center
when we met him.

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.698 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
I know, right?

00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:35.116 position:50% align:center
He really is amazing.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.619 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Both technically
and performance-wise.

00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:47.087 position:50% align:center
Got a sec, Coach?

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:49.464 position:50% align:center
What do you guys want?

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:51.633 position:50% align:center
This place is off-limits
to the public right now.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Sorry, but we got
permission to come in, sir.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.553 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] Teach me how to
do that awesome quadruple

00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:57.847 position:50% align:center
jump combination of yours!

00:09:57.931 --> 00:09:58.932 position:50% align:center
Moron!

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.142 position:50% align:center
We came to ask you
to teach us again.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.561 position:50% align:center
Our goal is not just to skate
in the Grand Prix finals

00:10:03.645 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
but to be first in the nation.

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:08.692 position:50% align:center
To do that, we need your help.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.026 position:50% align:center
Please, sir!

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.821 position:50% align:center
What do you ultimately
want to do?

00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:14.614 position:50% align:center
Go pro? Get famous?

00:10:14.698 --> 00:10:18.993 position:50% align:center
Is winning now about prestige
or your future careers?

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:20.245 position:50% align:center
That's not--

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.413 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] You said you
want me to teach you my

00:10:21.496 --> 00:10:23.081 position:50% align:center
quadruple jump combination.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.125 position:50% align:center
That's right. I watched
a video of you skating it,

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.002 position:50% align:center
and it was incredible! So I--

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.920 position:50% align:center
That was something
I spent years training for

00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:30.547 position:50% align:center
and perfecting.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.258 position:50% align:center
You expect me to teach
it to you just like that?

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.511 position:50% align:center
Clearly you don't
understand its value.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
Go home!
You're interrupting my practice.

00:10:41.808 --> 00:10:44.269 position:50% align:center
What, didn't you hear me?
I said go!

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.399 position:50% align:center
Great job. The coach is
super mad at us now,

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.192 position:50% align:center
and it's all thanks to
you, Maeshima.

00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:53.528 position:50% align:center
Not fair. You guys
were there, too.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.280 position:50% align:center
Hey, speaking of people
who screwed up,

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:57.157 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen Sasu recently.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.451 position:50% align:center
Do you think he's avoiding
us 'cause of what happened?

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:00.869 position:50% align:center
He wouldn't up
and quit the club

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
without saying
anything, would he?

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.206 position:50% align:center
That would be kind of sad.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
So many things going wrong.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.336 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah.
But when are they not?

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.420 position:50% align:center
Just wait.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.213 position:50% align:center
We're gonna prove 'em all wrong.

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.722 position:50% align:center
The Boys' High School
Skate-Leading

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:22.432 position:50% align:center
Grand Prix Series has begun,

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:25.101 position:50% align:center
and it's off to an
interesting start so far.

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:27.187 position:50% align:center
Here are the results of
the second competition,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.855 position:50% align:center
which was held today.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.399 position:50% align:center
In second, we have Chutei
University High School,

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.068 position:50% align:center
who led the first competition.

00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:35.320 position:50% align:center
On top this time was
the team that placed first

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.697 position:50% align:center
in the preliminaries,
Kogahara High School.

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.200 position:50% align:center
This was their first
match of the series.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.785 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER B] Do you think
skating in the first and second

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:43.703 position:50% align:center
competitions negatively
impacted your

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:45.121 position:50% align:center
performance at all?

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:47.374 position:50% align:center
I don't think it
really did, do you?

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.167 position:50% align:center
If anything, I would
say that we did better.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.670 position:50% align:center
Ahem. No, we delivered
two strong routines

00:11:51.753 --> 00:11:53.296 position:50% align:center
in the first competition,
which gave us

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.964 position:50% align:center
considerable momentum
heading into

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.591 position:50% align:center
the second one today.

00:11:56.675 --> 00:11:58.635 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER B] Anything to say
about your remaining match?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.929 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.472 position:50% align:center
We intend to approach
it as we have

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.391 position:50% align:center
the other two,
doing our best so we can

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:06.685 position:50% align:center
finish the series
without any regrets.

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.190 position:50% align:center
This was your first
match of the series.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.274 position:50% align:center
Were you nervous?

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:12:16.277 --> 00:12:18.029 position:50% align:center
Still, you must be pretty proud.

00:12:18.113 --> 00:12:20.699 position:50% align:center
Taking the top spot right
out of the gate like that.

00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:21.950 position:50% align:center
Anything to add?

00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.410 position:50% align:center
No, nothing.

00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:24.911 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER chuckles]

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
You have the highest
single-match score

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.206 position:50% align:center
out of any team so far.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.875 position:50% align:center
Are we finished here yet?
I've got practice.

00:12:32.377 --> 00:12:33.461 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] I didn't think
Himekawa's team

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.213 position:50% align:center
would do so well.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.297 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Yeah.

00:12:36.381 --> 00:12:38.049 position:50% align:center
They overtook
Chutei University High

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:40.010 position:50% align:center
and the Ishikawa brothers.

00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.346 position:50% align:center
Plus, they got the highest
score for a single competition.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.473 position:50% align:center
And with this
point difference...

00:12:45.557 --> 00:12:47.225 position:50% align:center
So basically what it
comes down to is,

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.352 position:50% align:center
do we stand a chance at
beating Himekawa's team

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:50.937 position:50% align:center
the way they're performing now?

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:52.856 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
It isn't that simple, though.

00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:54.482 position:50% align:center
I think we should
go back to the coach

00:12:54.566 --> 00:12:55.692 position:50% align:center
and ask for his help.

00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.528 position:50% align:center
Why, so he can
kick us out again?

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.406 position:50% align:center
Why isn't Maeshima here?

00:13:01.489 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
Are he and Sasugai
both skipping?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.743 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.203 position:50% align:center
Hey, guys, it's not just club.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.205 position:50% align:center
Sasugai hasn't been
in class, either.

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.248 position:50% align:center
Really?

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.125 position:50% align:center
And he's not picking
up the phone.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:14.044 position:50% align:center
So, what? He's missing?

00:13:14.127 --> 00:13:16.379 position:50% align:center
You don't think...

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.548 position:50% align:center
Surely this isn't
the case, but--

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:23.011 position:50% align:center
what if he was so upset
that he took his own life?

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:25.013 position:50% align:center
Jeez, don't say that!

00:13:25.096 --> 00:13:26.097 position:50% align:center
How long now?

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:28.767 position:50% align:center
Ever since he stopped
coming to club.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.060 position:50% align:center
Not good.

00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:31.728 position:50% align:center
I didn't bully him, you guys!

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.355 position:50% align:center
Really, I promise I didn't.

00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:34.481 position:50% align:center
Hey, calm down.

00:13:34.564 --> 00:13:35.690 position:50% align:center
Where does he live?

00:13:35.774 --> 00:13:36.733 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
I don't know.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
It should say in
the school register.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:39.861 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
I'll go check!

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.198 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
What's Maeshima up to?

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:44.741 position:50% align:center
We could use him right now.

00:13:56.795 --> 00:13:58.171 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
A park?

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.131 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] This is the address
that was in the registry.

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:01.466 position:50% align:center
I don't understand.

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.594 position:50% align:center
Do you think he
listed a fake one?

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:06.179 position:50% align:center
I guess, but I don't
see why he would

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.764 position:50% align:center
do something like that.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:08.973 position:50% align:center
It is him.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:10.225 position:50% align:center
Where's Maeshima?

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:11.976 position:50% align:center
He's not answering his phone.

00:14:13.395 --> 00:14:14.437 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
What's up?

00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:16.773 position:50% align:center
Um, back during
the first match,

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.068 position:50% align:center
I was walking with Sasugai,
and we saw Shinozaki.

00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:21.444 position:50% align:center
He didn't say much about it,

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:22.570 position:50% align:center
but I got the feeling
that they'd known

00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:25.281 position:50% align:center
each other for a long time.

00:14:25.365 --> 00:14:27.534 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.285 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Hey, Tomo. What's up?

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.745 position:50% align:center
Aren't you in the
middle of club?

00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.415 position:50% align:center
Oh, by the way,
I meant to ask you-- 

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.208 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Shinozaki, Shinozaki!

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.668 position:50% align:center
Will you give me his
number please?

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:37.877 position:50% align:center
It's an emergency!

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.796 position:50% align:center
We need to talk to
him as soon as--

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:41.256 position:50% align:center
[phone ringing]

00:14:41.339 --> 00:14:42.674 position:50% align:center
Good, he's calling!

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:48.638 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:50.223 position:50% align:center
No way!

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:51.975 position:50% align:center
You sure this is really it?

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.852 position:50% align:center
That's what it says here.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.645 position:50% align:center
[BUILDING MANAGER]
Ugh, what a pain.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.856 position:50% align:center
Don't cause any trouble,
ya hear me?

00:14:57.939 --> 00:14:59.274 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Yes, sir, sorry.

00:15:00.942 --> 00:15:02.610 position:50% align:center
Hey, Sasugai, you here?

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.697 position:50% align:center
Empty.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.198 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Maybe he just didn't hear you?

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.825 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
Hello, anyone home?

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:11.327 position:50% align:center
If you're here, Sasugai,
speak up already!

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.871 position:50% align:center
Hey! What the--
Get off me!

00:15:12.954 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
Uh, Jonouchi?

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.915 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Stop that! Seriously, it hurts!

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.167 position:50% align:center
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:19.294 position:50% align:center
Honestly, he always
finds trouble.

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.462 position:50% align:center
Let's keep looking.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.340 position:50% align:center
Hey! Isn't anybody
gonna help me?!

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.092 position:50% align:center
Ow! I'm sorry, okay?
Nice kitty.

00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:27.427 position:50% align:center
Sasugai?

00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:32.265 position:50% align:center
This his room?

00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:36.936 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.146 position:50% align:center
What's on here?

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:42.275 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
This looks like...

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.819 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] An assessment of each
school, complete with data.

00:15:44.903 --> 00:15:47.238 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU] Did he do this
for every team in the series?

00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
Amazing.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.284 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] He put all of
this together by himself?

00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.203 position:50% align:center
This has yesterday's date on it.

00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.621 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
This is from the day before.

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:56.581 position:50% align:center
Wait, this is practice footage.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:57.957 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
How did he film that?

00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
[CAT meows]

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.713 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Fight like
the challengers you are!

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:06.091 position:50% align:center
"Challengers," huh?

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.805 position:50% align:center
Looks like a plan
for a new routine.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:15.934 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
What's that?

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.519 position:50% align:center
I think it's the schedule
for the ice show

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:19.270 position:50% align:center
the coach goes to see.

00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:33.159 position:50% align:center
So, the schemer drowns
in his own scheme?

00:16:33.243 --> 00:16:35.370 position:50% align:center
Hey, even Homer sometimes nods.

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:37.163 position:50% align:center
And it's not like I
didn't know it would be

00:16:37.247 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
a gamble.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.626 position:50% align:center
To be fair, I understood
why you suggested it.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.046 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and I appreciate
you backing me up.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.214 position:50% align:center
You're not an idiot.

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.008 position:50% align:center
That's a real comfort to know.

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.264 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Go home. I'm trying to practice.

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.184 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
What are you doing?

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.228 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
I'm willing to beg if I have to.

00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.231 position:50% align:center
Teach the team your
quadruple jump combination.

00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:05.150 position:50% align:center
Help them to reach
their full potential.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.528 position:50% align:center
Sasugai's begging?

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.447 position:50% align:center
I think so.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
You think that this will
convince me to teach them?

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.493 position:50% align:center
Why would you go so far?

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.579 position:50% align:center
Isn't it obvious?

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.039 position:50% align:center
I want to win!

00:17:20.206 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
I can't skate.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.960 position:50% align:center
I have to leave
that part to them.

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:26.296 position:50% align:center
But I'll do anything
in order to win.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:28.673 position:50% align:center
If bowing my head is what it
takes to make that happen,

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:30.800 position:50% align:center
then it's a small price to pay.

00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:33.261 position:50% align:center
Guess that's the difference
between you and me.

00:17:34.679 --> 00:17:36.139 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
I will never lower my head.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:38.600 position:50% align:center
Not even to ask for instruction.

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:40.101 position:50% align:center
You said before that
they don't completely

00:17:40.185 --> 00:17:41.394 position:50% align:center
trust you.

00:17:41.478 --> 00:17:42.979 position:50% align:center
Well, maybe they're
the ones who need

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:46.274 position:50% align:center
to see how serious
you are about this.

00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:48.860 position:50% align:center
Skate-leading isn't
an individual sport.

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
There are five
skaters on the ice,

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
each of them have
their own feelings

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.407 position:50% align:center
and their own daily struggles.

00:17:54.491 --> 00:17:55.700 position:50% align:center
If you can't understand that,

00:17:55.784 --> 00:17:58.203 position:50% align:center
then your skills as
a tactician are lacking.

00:17:58.286 --> 00:18:01.039 position:50% align:center
Come on.
Like you're one to talk.

00:18:01.122 --> 00:18:03.917 position:50% align:center
Pestering me won't do
you or them any good.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.794 position:50% align:center
Talk to the team,
not about strategy,

00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:07.629 position:50% align:center
but about how you feel.

00:18:07.712 --> 00:18:09.673 position:50% align:center
Though, I suppose
you already did.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:15.637 position:50% align:center
What're you doing?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.430 position:50% align:center
It's bad manners to
eavesdrop, you know.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:19.808 position:50% align:center
Yep, there he is.
That's the Sasugai we know.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.602 position:50% align:center
Hey, bowing your head's
a small price to pay, right?

00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:25.146 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI growls]
Damn you.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.107 position:50% align:center
Wait. Where's Maeshima?

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:53.174 position:50% align:center
Aw, man, it's hard to keep going
after that first quadruple Axel.

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.972 position:50% align:center
Was that what I think it was?

00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:00.223 position:50% align:center
Yep, no doubt.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:01.725 position:50% align:center
He was totally trying
to pull off the coach's

00:19:01.808 --> 00:19:03.226 position:50% align:center
super special move.

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:05.353 position:50% align:center
He didn't have enough
rotations, though.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:12.777 position:50% align:center
Uh, sorry.

00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:14.446 position:50% align:center
Did I accidentally
do something to make

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.614 position:50% align:center
everyone mad again?

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.658 position:50% align:center
Do you know how much I envy you?

00:19:18.742 --> 00:19:19.701 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
What?

00:19:19.784 --> 00:19:21.077 position:50% align:center
You've got incredible
coordination

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.038 position:50% align:center
and tons of raw talent,

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.999 position:50% align:center
and the way you waste it
seriously pisses me off.

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:28.668 position:50% align:center
But the fact of the
matter is I need you.

00:19:28.752 --> 00:19:31.004 position:50% align:center
We both want to
beat that bastard.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
So, like it or not,
we're gonna keep fighting.

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.967 position:50% align:center
Just thought you should
know that's how I feel.

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.177 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.428 position:50% align:center
I don't really get it,
but you've given me

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:39.888 position:50% align:center
that speech before and
it's the whole reason

00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.806 position:50% align:center
I'm here.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.266 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna quit now.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.852 position:50% align:center
And there's no way I'm
gonna let you quit, either.

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.398 position:50% align:center
Was I the only one here
who thought that he might?

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:51.816 position:50% align:center
The rest of us have
been running around

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.610 position:50% align:center
worrying about Sasugai,
but I guess that

00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.820 position:50% align:center
doesn't include you, Maeshima.

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:57.655 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Why were you worried about him?

00:19:57.739 --> 00:20:00.158 position:50% align:center
He was totally MIA
for a long time.

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.619 position:50% align:center
Come on, this is Sasugai
we're talking about.

00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.162 position:50% align:center
He was probably just
off setting one of his

00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
crazy plans in motion, right?

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.249 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, pretty much.

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:10.960 position:50% align:center
I guess we overreacted,
didn't we?

00:20:11.044 --> 00:20:12.337 position:50% align:center
You've been out
here by yourself trying

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.340 position:50% align:center
to land the three
consecutive quads?

00:20:15.423 --> 00:20:18.551 position:50% align:center
That's right. Because somebody
wouldn't teach me.

00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.262 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] That move puts a
lot of strain on your body.

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:24.724 position:50% align:center
Stop practicing it on your own.
I mean it.

00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.601 position:50% align:center
Unless, of course,
you're looking to sacrifice

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:28.770 position:50% align:center
your entire skating
career for a single

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:30.689 position:50% align:center
high-school win.

00:20:30.772 --> 00:20:32.982 position:50% align:center
What are you even
saying right now?

00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:34.651 position:50% align:center
If you don't go out there
and get the victory

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:37.153 position:50% align:center
right in front of you,
then what is there after that?

00:20:39.322 --> 00:20:40.365 position:50% align:center
Anyway...

00:20:40.448 --> 00:20:42.158 position:50% align:center
I don't want you
doing it on your own.

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.118 position:50% align:center
That's not fair!

00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:44.369 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
I'll teach you, okay?

00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:49.124 position:50% align:center
You heard me.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:50.834 position:50% align:center
I'll teach you to do it right.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.632 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Really? He refused?

00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:58.800 position:50% align:center
I don't know what's up,

00:20:58.883 --> 00:21:00.051 position:50% align:center
but he said something
about not getting

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.220 position:50% align:center
the victory in front of him yet.

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.638 position:50% align:center
If that's the case,
you'd think he would

00:21:03.722 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center
quit coaching, too.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.182 position:50% align:center
I guess he's just
choosing the path

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.059 position:50% align:center
that's right for him.

00:21:08.143 --> 00:21:09.728 position:50% align:center
Thanks, man.
I'll talk to you later.

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.314 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
So, you found your resolve.

00:21:13.398 --> 00:21:14.691 position:50% align:center
Hope you're ready.

00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:16.985 position:50% align:center
'Cause it's gonna be a harder
path than you imagine.

00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:37.881 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA grunts]

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:39.090 position:50% align:center
You all right?

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:40.967 position:50% align:center
Man, that hurt.

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:42.093 position:50% align:center
My blade.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.720 position:50% align:center
I definitely landed that wrong.

00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.513 position:50% align:center
Get it taken care of ASAP.

00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:47.265 position:50% align:center
It's almost time for
the next match.

00:21:47.349 --> 00:21:50.060 position:50% align:center
If you don't take it seriously,
it could lead to an injury.

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.605 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Fourth match entry form is here.

00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
Get ready.

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.817 position:50% align:center
Looks like we've got
some stiff competition.

00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:59.611 position:50% align:center
Including Shinozaki's team.

00:22:03.073 --> 00:22:04.657 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
It's finally time.

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:38.460 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Terauchi.

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:39.836 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
What is it, Himuro?

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:40.837 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO] Lately Tomo's been
like, "Ken and Sasugai 

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.255 position:50% align:center
did this."

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:44.758 position:50% align:center
"Akimitsu, Jonouchi, Yukimitsu,
and Kiriyama did that."

00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:46.134 position:50% align:center
All he talks about is you guys.

00:23:46.217 --> 00:23:47.677 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Somebody sounds jealous.

00:23:47.761 --> 00:23:48.595 position:50% align:center
More importantly--

00:23:48.678 --> 00:23:49.679 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
What?

00:23:49.763 --> 00:23:50.597 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
He doesn't talk about me?
