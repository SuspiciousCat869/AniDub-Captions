00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:23.375 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:25.208 align:middle
Himekawa withdrew from school?

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:27.625 align:middle
Yeah. He didn't drop out,
though, he transferred.

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.500 align:middle
I don't get it,
what's going on, Coach?

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle
I have no clue.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:33.125 align:middle
Today's the first I'm
hearing of it, like you.

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:34.917 align:middle
Did you know? Terauchi?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.042 align:middle
I didn't.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.667 align:middle
It does seem really sudden.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.625 align:middle
What reason did
he give for leaving?

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:42.417 align:middle
He said his family was moving.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle
That was all.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.917 align:middle
Who'd move like that
out of nowhere, though?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.208 align:middle
I mean, what, is he gonna
quit skate-leading, too?

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle
It could be that he's actually
known this for a while.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.125 align:middle
I mean... Himekawa is definitely
on the secretive side.

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:55.542 align:middle
The question is,
what's gonna happen

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.083 align:middle
to our team formation now?

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.083 align:middle
Without our ace,
the balance will be--

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle
Maeshima?

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:02.625 align:middle
What exactly did you
hope to accomplish

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle
by running out like that?

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle
You're welcome.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.208 align:middle
You know, if you'd kept
going the way you were,

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.792 align:middle
you'd still be lost right now.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle
Whatever.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.042 align:middle
Are you seriously gonna
give me attitude

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.583 align:middle
when I'm the one who
told you what school

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.292 align:middle
Himekawa's transferring
to and got the

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.083 align:middle
bullet train tickets
to take us there?

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:19.292 align:middle
Get your hands off!

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:21.375 align:middle
Why are you so worried
about that guy, anyway?

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.792 align:middle
I thought you were more
self-centered than that?

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.792 align:middle
Honestly, I don't
know why, either.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.917 align:middle
It just got under my skin.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle
It was impossible to sit still.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.458 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Hmph. Interesting.

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:33.958 align:middle
I consider Himekawa
one of our assets, too,

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:36.667 align:middle
so I don't plan
on letting go easily.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle
That's enough of your private
little chat fest, boys.

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.417 align:middle
You should both come
inside and eat some lunch.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.208 align:middle
I have frozen mandarin oranges.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:45.083 align:middle
You our auntie now or what?

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:46.875 align:middle
Your Dad's over
here worried, too.

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle
Who're you calling "Dad"?

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.458 align:middle
[JONOUCHI] I never would've
thought Maeshima

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.083 align:middle
would just run out like that.

00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.667 align:middle
[AKIMITSU]
Right? Weird move, for sure.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.417 align:middle
And even weirder that
the captain and Yuki

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.208 align:middle
decided to go along with him.

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:34.917 align:middle
I get that part, though.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.125 align:middle
You know how Maeshima
and Sasugai are.

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.208 align:middle
They might've done something
crazy on their own!

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:40.417 align:middle
For sure. Ha!

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.958 align:middle
Just 'cause Terauchi
isn't here doesn't mean

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle
you can slack off.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.792 align:middle
--Right!
--[AKIMITSU] Okay.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle
Hey, Coach, the captain
left to go check out

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:49.417 align:middle
the school Himekawa
transferred to.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.583 align:middle
Oh, that's fine.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.875 align:middle
Feel free to join
practice now, Kubota.

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:53.917 align:middle
[KUBOTA]
Yes, sir!

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:57.917 align:middle
So, where did Himekawa go,
anyway, do you know?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.458 align:middle
Um, I think Niigata?

00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:02.042 align:middle
--Rice?
--Ski resorts.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:04.958 align:middle
--The yellowtail!
--Uesugi Kenshin.

00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:06.375 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU]
Sasu, I meant to ask,

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:07.917 align:middle
why were you in Osaka, anyway?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.958 align:middle
[SASUGAI] To ask a choreographer
I know there for advice

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:12.333 align:middle
about creating
lead-focused routines.

00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle
[TERAUCHI] Make sure you
let us know next time.

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:15.125 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
You got it.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:18.417 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Is this it?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.708 align:middle
Would you stop?

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.208 align:middle
Oh! Sorry, how much?

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:22.542 align:middle
Wait right there!

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.917 align:middle
Need to see your permit.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.167 align:middle
What? I just need to talk to
someone who goes here--

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.125 align:middle
There's no unauthorized
entry allowed.

00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:29.792 align:middle
You need to make an appointment.

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.792 align:middle
Listen, I just need like
two minutes to talk to him

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.417 align:middle
about something, and then
I swear, I'm gone!

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.625 align:middle
'Fraid not.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle
We can't have students
from other schools

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:37.542 align:middle
coming here to fight.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.083 align:middle
Don't make me call the police.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:41.167 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
No need for that!

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle
My friend and I will
be on our way now.

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.167 align:middle
Come on.

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.417 align:middle
Hey, idiot, why are
you goin' in through

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.083 align:middle
the front door?

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:49.542 align:middle
Just give me a second
and I can figure out

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:50.917 align:middle
a way to sneak in.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.333 align:middle
You're the idiot here.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:53.542 align:middle
Huh?

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:54.708 align:middle
Going in through the
back door isn't always

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:57.208 align:middle
the solution to
everything, you know.

00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle
[TERAUCHI]
I'm Shotaro Terauchi, third year

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.625 align:middle
at Ionodai High School.

00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:02.250 align:middle
I have an appointment
with Coach Kumada

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:03.792 align:middle
from the skate-leading club.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:05.708 align:middle
Yes, of course.
He expects you.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU]
We called ahead on our way over.

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:12.708 align:middle
It's not rocket science.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.333 align:middle
[TERAUCHI] Sasugai, you might
want to start working

00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle
on your frontal attack
for situations like this.

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:18.708 align:middle
Thank you so much
for the random,

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:20.042 align:middle
unsolicited advice.

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:21.958 align:middle
More importantly,
what was that about talking

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle
to the coach of the
skate-leading club?

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:25.208 align:middle
It's great, isn't it?

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:26.875 align:middle
He isn't actually quitting;
he just decided

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle
to change teams, that's all.

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.167 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
But, wait, that's weird, right?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.458 align:middle
Why now, of all--

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:32.500 align:middle
[TERAUCHI]
Would you be quiet?

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Yes, sir.

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:37.167 align:middle
[TERAUCHI]
Kogahara High School.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.917 align:middle
They're a new team that
only officially started up

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle
after they finished building
this rink last year.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:45.042 align:middle
The school's putting a lot
of resources into the team.

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:47.042 align:middle
For example,
they invited Coach Kumada,

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:50.875 align:middle
who's grown famous
for his eye for talent.

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.292 align:middle
[SASUGAI] This school's track
record only goes back a year,

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:54.833 align:middle
huh?

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:58.167 align:middle
Well, at least that explains
why it wasn't on my list.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.417 align:middle
Coach Kumada, right?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.625 align:middle
I'm Terauchi.

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.292 align:middle
We spoke on the phone
a bit earlier?

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:03.375 align:middle
'Bout skate-leading?

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:06.375 align:middle
I'm Captain of my club.
Ionodai High.

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:08.667 align:middle
[KUMADA]
That's quite a jaunt! Welcome.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.417 align:middle
Hey! Izumi, come here!

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:14.458 align:middle
Your old teammates
have come all this way

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:15.792 align:middle
just to talk to you.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.833 align:middle
Why don't you take a little
break so you can chat?

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:20.917 align:middle
I'm in the middle
of practice now.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.792 align:middle
--I apologize.
--It's fine.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.333 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Wait a minute!

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.083 align:middle
You've at least gotta tell us
why you transferred schools!

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle
What the heck were you thinking,
changing teams without even

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.042 align:middle
--telling us?
--[KUMADA] Pardon me.

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:32.208 align:middle
Would you mind not
shouting into the rink?

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:34.458 align:middle
Just for the safety
of the other skaters.

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:35.875 align:middle
You understand?

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:37.208 align:middle
Um, sure.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:38.708 align:middle
Sorry about that.

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:40.917 align:middle
Great. Please feel free to stick
around and watch practice

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.333 align:middle
as long as you'd like.

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:48.417 align:middle
They're just drilling
the basics.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.583 align:middle
True.

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle
It doesn't feel like
he's teaching them

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:53.167 align:middle
anything super-flashy.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle
They're a good team, though.

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:56.333 align:middle
I'd say they're pretty solid.

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:00.208 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Keiji Kumada.

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:02.458 align:middle
He's won high praise
for training juniors,

00:07:02.542 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle
but that's all his coaching
is really known for.

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:08.125 align:middle
So, what made Himekawa
choose this school?

00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:09.958 align:middle
[KUMADA] I'm so flattered that
you're interested enough

00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:11.625 align:middle
to look me up.

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:13.333 align:middle
So, most of the students
you see here

00:07:13.417 --> 00:07:15.292 align:middle
are former members
of the junior club where I

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle
used to coach a few years ago.

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle
When the high school asked
me to take this position,

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle
I got back in touch and
invited them to join me.

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:25.417 align:middle
Izumi was one of the
members of that club.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.042 align:middle
I had tried to recruit
him back when he was

00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle
taking his high school
entrance exams.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:30.917 align:middle
He turned it down then.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.125 align:middle
[HIMEKAWA] I'm not hoping to
make a living figure skating,

00:07:33.208 --> 00:07:36.000 align:middle
so I don't need to
take it that seriously.

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:38.083 align:middle
[KUMADA] I don't know what
happened when he was with you,

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.333 align:middle
but in the end,
he decided to join me.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:42.083 align:middle
He even got permission
to change clubs

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle
from the Federation.

00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:46.583 align:middle
I'll be sure to thank you
when we meet at nationals.

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:48.625 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
What a crafty old man.

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.708 align:middle
[KOGAHARA SKATER]
Thank you very much!

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.125 align:middle
[KOGAHARA SKATERS]
Thank you very much!

00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:56.833 align:middle
You guys are still here?

00:07:56.917 --> 00:07:58.083 align:middle
You made us wait this long,

00:07:58.167 --> 00:07:59.792 align:middle
and now you're gonna
cop an attitude?

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:01.958 align:middle
Sorry, but I still
needed to practice.

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:03.833 align:middle
Practicing late by yourself?

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.792 align:middle
Huh, that's pretty different
from the Himekawa

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:08.042 align:middle
who used to leave
exactly on time.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:11.125 align:middle
What's the deal with
this change of heart?

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:12.708 align:middle
Go on, talk to them.

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle
They came all this
way to see you.

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle
[HIMEKAWA]
Right.

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:18.667 align:middle
So, what do you want?
And make it quick.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.125 align:middle
I'd rather not to have
to warm up all over again.

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:22.417 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
I told you!

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.458 align:middle
I want to know why you
suddenly changed schools.

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:28.167 align:middle
Just when we were ready
to skate as a team!

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.458 align:middle
Good question.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.583 align:middle
I'd like to know, too,
as the head of the club.

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.583 align:middle
Why would you decide to do that?

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:38.292 align:middle
Because that guy came.

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:39.708 align:middle
--"That guy"?
--This guy?

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:41.083 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
I knew it.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.333 align:middle
Once Maeshima joined us,
I knew it was time to go.

00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:45.500 align:middle
Huh?! Wait, me? For real?

00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:47.667 align:middle
I don't get it, though,
did I do something weird?

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.375 align:middle
At the big club match.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle
I was able to do
my best jump ever.

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle
Not how I wanted, though.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:56.417 align:middle
You were doing
whatever you wanted,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.917 align:middle
and I was skating my
hardest to show you up.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.917 align:middle
However, as I pushed
myself to beat your speed,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.458 align:middle
agility, and presentation,

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.458 align:middle
I was propelled
like never before,

00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:08.083 align:middle
and the result was that jump.

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:09.792 align:middle
So, you challenge each other.

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:11.125 align:middle
Isn't that good?

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:12.583 align:middle
No, it was aggravating!

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:14.208 align:middle
It felt like I was controlled
by someone else

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:15.750 align:middle
and that gave me the creeps!

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.292 align:middle
It all hit me at once.

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle
I wanted my motivation
to come only from me.

00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.458 align:middle
Not a guy like you!

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:24.542 align:middle
So I decided to come back
and skate with Coach Kumada.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.625 align:middle
In order to get things
straight in my head.

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:30.333 align:middle
Are you satisfied?
I need to get back to practice.

00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:32.708 align:middle
[MAESHIMA] What the hell?
Of course I'm not satisfied!

00:09:32.792 --> 00:09:34.292 align:middle
What am I s'posed to do here?

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:35.708 align:middle
What can I say to
get you to come--

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:37.167 align:middle
No, just let it lie.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.583 align:middle
Huh?

00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:41.417 align:middle
It's pretty clear there's
no use in talking anymore.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.833 align:middle
Listen, do you think I'd
give up such an important

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.542 align:middle
asset so easily?

00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:46.833 align:middle
Not my problem.

00:09:46.917 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle
Himekawa. I understand.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle
We'll meet you at nationals.

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle
Thank you for that.
For everything.

00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:57.208 align:middle
I appreciate all you've done.

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle
Damn, Sho. Are you really
gonna leave it at that?

00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:03.417 align:middle

--[KUBOTA grunts]
--[KIRIYAMA] What is it?

00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:06.208 align:middle
Well, they won't make
it back tonight,

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:08.042 align:middle
so they're staying
at a hot springs inn.

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:09.125 align:middle
I'm jealous.

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:10.750 align:middle
Wait, that's not fair!

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:16.625 align:middle
Jeez, will you stop
sulking already?

00:10:16.708 --> 00:10:18.792 align:middle
My plans got messed up,
too, you know.

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:21.500 align:middle
I have to figure out new
positions for everyone now.

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:22.958 align:middle
It's not about that.

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:24.833 align:middle
Well, what is it, then?

00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:26.333 align:middle
I've just been thinking.

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:28.625 align:middle
That match was
really fun for me.

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle
Jonouchi and Himekawa.

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:32.583 align:middle
Being out there
together with them.

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle
Even Himekawa claiming
the best moment

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.833 align:middle
for himself with that last jump.

00:10:38.292 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle
Somebody else had
landed that final move,

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.625 align:middle
but the thing is,
it still felt good.

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:45.458 align:middle
It made me start thinking
that things were just

00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:47.875 align:middle
going to keep
getting better, but...

[YUKIMITSU]
Oh, thank goodness.

00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:52.875 align:middle
The last dinner service
here was pretty late,

00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle
so I was hoping it would
work out somehow.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:56.042 align:middle
[TERAUCHI]
Thanks.

00:10:56.125 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle
I had to look pretty
hard, you know.

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:00.292 align:middle
Especially keeping in
mind our club budget.

00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:01.833 align:middle
Now we just have
to buy souvenirs

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:03.792 align:middle
for Akimitsu and the others.

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:05.042 align:middle
This food looks great!

00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.667 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU]
Here, Shima. This is for you.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.125 align:middle
For the badge test.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.458 align:middle
You probably have one
for singles already,

00:11:18.542 --> 00:11:20.792 align:middle
but you don't have one
for skate-leading, right?

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:22.708 align:middle
You have to have it
to compete so I might've

00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:23.875 align:middle
applied for you.

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:25.667 align:middle
All you need to do is show up.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.167 align:middle
And pass, of course.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle

[TERAUCHI]
What?

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:34.917 align:middle
You always get all
captain-like whenever

Vice-Captain Kiriyama
isn't around.

00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle
Why is that?

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:40.167 align:middle
Do I change that much?

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.125 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU]
Yeah.

00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:42.625 align:middle

Am I the only high schooler?

Most of the time,
people take their badge test

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:01.042 align:middle
when they're still kids.

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:03.083 align:middle
So, yeah, they're all
in elementary school.

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:04.458 align:middle
I have mine already.

to come along, too?

You're right.

I mean, of course you'd
pass in one go, Maeshima!

00:12:14.875 --> 00:12:16.292 align:middle
You're an ex-genius, after all,

00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:18.208 align:middle
and I'm sure the hot
springs were a boost.

Oh, great, thanks for all
the weird extra pressure.

--Stop that.

[SASUGAI]
This is Noa Kuonji.

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:51.625 align:middle
He used to live abroad
and he's won a bunch

00:12:51.708 --> 00:12:53.750 align:middle
of Canadian tournaments.

00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:56.250 align:middle
He came back after you
quit skating singles.

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.042 align:middle
Since then he's made
a name for himself,

00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:00.083 align:middle
mostly for being
Shinozaki's rival.

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:01.292 align:middle
His rival?

00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:02.875 align:middle
Always second, though,
he's never been able

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:04.583 align:middle
to beat him in a competition.

00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:09.125 align:middle
Your nickname's literally
"Number Two Prince,"

00:13:09.208 --> 00:13:10.125 align:middle
isn't it?

00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle
Well, that's how
it goes, you know?

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:14.458 align:middle
I mean, after all, it isn't
always the oldest brother

00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:16.333 align:middle
who ends up succeeding
to the throne.

00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:18.542 align:middle
So you've accepted that
you're number two?

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:20.792 align:middle
It's like the ultimate
underdog story.

00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:22.792 align:middle
Full of pitfalls
and full of heart.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:25.458 align:middle
So, the younger brother
toils away in obscurity

00:13:25.542 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle
right up until he wins.

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle
That's weird, 'cause any
time he appears on TV,

00:13:31.083 --> 00:13:32.667 align:middle
he gets totally flamed online.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.667 align:middle
Lots of suggestions
to practice more.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.417 align:middle
Well, yeah. That's obviously
a part of my strategy.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle
It's just how I want to be seen.

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:41.708 align:middle
Is it me or does he
remind you of Jonouchi?

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:43.917 align:middle
This guy's a lot
classier, though.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle
[JONOUCHI]
Getting girls, tip number four.

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:48.167 align:middle
If you want them to drool,
train your core.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.708 align:middle
Getting girls, tip five.

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:52.333 align:middle
If you wanna be the hot one,
then you must style your hair.

00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:53.833 align:middle
[KUONJI laughs]

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:55.375 align:middle
I had been planning
to claim a big

00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:57.208 align:middle
come-from-behind
victory at my debut

00:13:57.292 --> 00:13:58.833 align:middle
competition as a senior,

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle
but then, of course,
Shinozaki had to go

00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:02.417 align:middle
and switch to skate-leading.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle
I felt like I had no
choice but to follow.

00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:06.917 align:middle
Hey, what you're attempting
is all well and good.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.125 align:middle
But look.

00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle
Shinozaki is gonna be
brought down by me!

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:11.958 align:middle
[KUONJI]
Huh?

00:14:12.042 --> 00:14:13.542 align:middle
[laughs]

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:15.625 align:middle
Oh, wow, sorry I offended you.

00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:17.542 align:middle
But please, you're just
starting out and you think

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:18.958 align:middle
you can beat Shinozaki?

00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle
I am not just starting out!

00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:21.708 align:middle
[KUONJI]
No?

00:14:21.792 --> 00:14:22.833 align:middle
But you came here to
take your skate-leading

00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:24.292 align:middle
badge test, right?

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:26.042 align:middle
For what it's worth,
this guy's been skating

00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:27.417 align:middle
since he was a kid.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.167 align:middle
He took a break from competition
for a while, though.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.958 align:middle
Back in elementary school,
people called him

00:14:32.042 --> 00:14:33.583 align:middle
Shinozaki's rival.

00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:34.708 align:middle
Wait, this guy?

00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:36.292 align:middle
Anyway, we have a
lot in common, so--

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.667 align:middle
Oh, you poor thing!

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.417 align:middle
For your early childhood
years to be the peak

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.542 align:middle
--of your life!
--They're not!

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:42.833 align:middle
Hey, quiet down over there!

If you're not going
to register, just go home.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.833 align:middle
[MAESHIMA] Oh, wait, I am!
Sorry! I am gonna register!

00:14:47.917 --> 00:14:49.458 align:middle
[JONOUCHI]
Getting girls, tip 23.

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:51.708 align:middle
Girls love sweat, so sweat!

[OFFICIAL A]
Welcome.

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle
The skate-leading badge test
will begin momentarily.

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:57.792 align:middle
First, you'll be
tested in pairs.

00:14:57.875 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle
Then, individually.

00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:00.875 align:middle
For the pairs test,
you'll partner up

00:15:00.958 --> 00:15:03.375 align:middle
with the person
standing next to you.

00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:04.792 align:middle
Don't worry about perfection.

00:15:04.875 --> 00:15:06.875 align:middle
We're looking to see
if you can instinctively...

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:08.542 align:middle
Hey, relax, don't sweat it!

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle
I'm gonna be right there
with you the whole time.

00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:11.917 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Ugh...

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.250 align:middle
You guys are the only
two high schoolers

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:14.375 align:middle
taking the test.

00:15:14.458 --> 00:15:16.083 align:middle
So, of course
you'd be paired up.

00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:17.542 align:middle
Looking forward to it, Saejima!

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:18.583 align:middle
It's Maeshima!

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.333 align:middle
[OFFICIAL A]
Ahem.

00:15:20.417 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle
All right, let's start off
with the first pair.

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.292 align:middle
[JONOUCHI]
Getting girls, tip 147.

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:25.875 align:middle
To be the fave,
win at nationals!

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:29.167 align:middle
Getting girls, tip 148. To be
that guy, you gotta skate lead!

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.417 align:middle
Getting girls, tip 149.
To be her king--

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.958 align:middle
You know that three on three
match the other day?

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.458 align:middle
I happened to see it.

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.875 align:middle
It was actually pretty good.

00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.208 align:middle
Huh? Thank you!

00:15:46.292 --> 00:15:47.292 align:middle
That's nice to hear!

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:48.417 align:middle
He's eating it up.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.333 align:middle
I didn't switch to skate-leading
just 'cause I felt like it.

00:15:52.417 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle
I have other reasons too.

00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:55.042 align:middle
Oh, yeah?

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:57.292 align:middle
It won't feel right
if I never win.

00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:00.417 align:middle
So it's true that I'm here
chasing after Shinozaki.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.625 align:middle
But that's really
just half of it.

00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:05.625 align:middle
The other half is just
as important, though!

00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:07.583 align:middle
I want to use my voice
to get people excited

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.375 align:middle
about figure skating!

00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:10.417 align:middle

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.167 align:middle
Well, people do
seem to notice you.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.667 align:middle
[KUONJI] No matter the sport,
if you want to revitalize it,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.833 align:middle
you need a good story

Bright and shiny star athletes.

Rivals vying with
each other over time.

And I'll be the driving
force in that story.

00:16:24.958 --> 00:16:26.542 align:middle
That's the reason
I give interviews,

00:16:26.625 --> 00:16:28.042 align:middle
to get people to
remember my name,

00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:29.708 align:middle
and to watch competitions
where they can be

00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:30.958 align:middle
deeply moved.

00:16:32.625 --> 00:16:35.167 align:middle
It's all for the
future of skating.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.875 align:middle
No matter how
much I'm ridiculed,

00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:38.667 align:middle
I'll take as much
publicity as I can get

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.667 align:middle
as I battle against Shinozaki.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.583 align:middle
I've got more than enough
resolve to make it happen!

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:47.458 align:middle
So, will you join me on
this thorny path to glory?

as Shinozaki's big rival.

Even if you suck,
it'll create drama.

Apparently, that Kuonji is
switching to skate-leading.

the allotted amount of time.

00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:55.292 align:middle
He did that on top
of perfecting the test?

00:19:55.375 --> 00:19:57.333 align:middle
It's obvious that
he's picking a fight.

00:19:57.417 --> 00:20:00.625 align:middle
He's trying to say he's
just as good as Shinozaki.

00:20:00.708 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle
Interesting.

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:05.083 align:middle
I could use an outlet
for this built-up tension!

00:20:05.167 --> 00:20:06.667 align:middle
Wait!
I think I did it again!

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.208 align:middle
I accidentally egged you
on like I always do.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle
Listen, this is a test.

00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle
Make sure you do what
you're supposed to do.

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.542 align:middle
[OFFICIAL A]
Next! Number 13!

00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:14.833 align:middle
Here!

00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:16.333 align:middle
Maeshima, wait!

00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:18.708 align:middle
Now you've done it.

00:20:21.917 --> 00:20:24.292 align:middle
You better do it exactly
like we planned.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:26.417 align:middle
My nerves and my
sanity are begging.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.458 align:middle
Begging!

00:20:28.917 --> 00:20:29.875 align:middle
[MAESHIMA grunts]

00:20:29.958 --> 00:20:31.625 align:middle
[KIDS laugh]

00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.042 align:middle
Jeez, that little mongrel...

00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:34.375 align:middle
Why is he doing
moves that aren't part

00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:36.083 align:middle
of the requirement?

00:20:36.167 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle
[KUONJI]
Not bad. Maeshima, huh?

00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:41.542 align:middle
[JONOUCHI laughs]

00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:44.458 align:middle
No way, dude, you seriously
failed your badge test?

00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:46.292 align:middle
You're a real idiot, aren't ya?

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:47.417 align:middle
I didn't fail.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.125 align:middle
It's just that I
almost didn't pass.

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:50.708 align:middle
Last place, to be precise.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:52.542 align:middle
I'm amazed you were
able to recover!

00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:53.792 align:middle
Beaten by kids!

00:20:53.875 --> 00:20:56.708 align:middle
Oh, how the genius
has fallen, am I right?

00:20:56.792 --> 00:20:58.292 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA]
See? What did I tell you?

00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:00.125 align:middle
You have to be conscious
of what you're doing.

00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:01.458 align:middle
You've gotta be able
to look at yourself

00:21:01.542 --> 00:21:02.750 align:middle
objectively or you'll never--

00:21:02.833 --> 00:21:04.292 align:middle
I don't know what you're
rambling on about,

00:21:04.375 --> 00:21:05.708 align:middle
but I'm sorry, okay?

00:21:05.792 --> 00:21:06.833 align:middle
[KUBOTA gasps]

00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:08.042 align:middle
What's wrong?

00:21:08.125 --> 00:21:10.125 align:middle
[KUBOTA] Uh, I just saw
something on the news.

00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:11.292 align:middle
He's formed a new team!

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:12.917 align:middle
Kuonji and some
teen idols have created

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle
a skate-leading team!

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:15.750 align:middle
--[SASUGAI] They what?
--[MAESHIMA] What the--?

00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:17.542 align:middle
[REPORTER A] Tell us, what
was it that made you decide

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.167 align:middle
to team up with Mi*Leon?

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.375 align:middle
Well, partly because we
go to the same school,

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle
but also, these guys
are already stars,

00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:25.000 align:middle
so they have a great
sense of movement

00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:26.708 align:middle
with that cheeky touch!

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:28.917 align:middle
I'm the only one with any
figure skating experience,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.667 align:middle
but we're seriously
aiming to take home

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.750 align:middle
that win at nationals!

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:36.042 align:middle
We're the team to watch!
Here we go!

00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:38.708 align:middle
We know what you're wondering,
"why did they form a team?"

00:21:38.792 --> 00:21:39.792 align:middle
And the answer is,

00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.542 align:middle
"just so we could give
you our hearts."

00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:42.833 align:middle
--[MI*LEON] Mi*Leon!
--[KUONJI] Noa!

00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:44.250 align:middle
--[MI*LEON] Mi*Leon!
--[KUONJI] Noa!

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:45.708 align:middle
--[MI*LEON] Mi*Leon!
--[KUONJI] Noa!

00:21:45.792 --> 00:21:47.375 align:middle
--[MI*LEON] Mi*Leon.
--[KUONJI] Noa.

00:21:47.458 --> 00:21:49.417 align:middle
[REPORTER] We can't take
our eyes off of Mi*Leon,

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.792 align:middle
led by Kuonji.

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:52.083 align:middle
[REPORTER A] We plan to
follow the five of them

00:21:52.167 --> 00:21:53.875 align:middle
on their journey and
show you their progress

00:21:53.958 --> 00:21:55.708 align:middle
along the way,
so tune-in for more

00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:56.958 align:middle
on this team soon!

00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle
It's a talk show, not the news.
But whatever.

00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:00.917 align:middle
I know, right?

00:22:03.042 --> 00:22:05.167 align:middle
[MAESHIMA] Just you wait
and see, Noa Kuonji.

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle
[SASUGAI] Hey, Coach, you
actually did skate-leading

00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:41.333 align:middle
for a while, didn't you?

00:23:41.417 --> 00:23:42.333 align:middle
[ADACHI]
You researched me?

00:23:42.417 --> 00:23:43.292 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
And you were a wing.

00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle
[ADACHI]
You researched me?

00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:45.375 align:middle
[SASUGAI] And you've
had three girlfriends.

00:23:45.458 --> 00:23:46.375 align:middle
[ADACHI]
You researched me?

00:23:46.458 --> 00:23:48.375 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Also one boyf--Oh, no!

00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:49.417 align:middle
Watch the glasses!

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.542 align:middle
[ADACHI]
No more research.
