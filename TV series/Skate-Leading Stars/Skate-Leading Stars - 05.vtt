[STUDENT A]
Let's go!

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.765 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Fight! Yeah! Fight! Yeah!

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.975 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
We can do this!

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.686 position:50% align:center
[GIRLS]
Fight! Yeah! Fight! Yeah!

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.774 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA yells]

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.651 position:50% align:center
He's off, once again.

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.361 position:50% align:center
Yep, he refuses to listen.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.115 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Remember to pace yourself!

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.367 position:50% align:center
What's up, man?
Outta gas already?

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:35.493 position:50% align:center
Not a chance!

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.539 position:50% align:center
Hey, Ken, breathe, 'kay?

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.542 position:50% align:center
I'm having some déjà vu.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.754 position:50% align:center
You still have work to do
on basic physical fitness.

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.047 position:50% align:center
You're a lap behind.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.300 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] Shut up!
I can do it. I know I can.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.011 position:50% align:center
Quality over quantity, though.
Remember that.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.347 position:50% align:center
I know it's hard when you
haven't had a trainer.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
Come on.
How long're you gonna lay there?

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.601 position:50% align:center
You'll never finish like that.

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.020 position:50% align:center
Dammit! I'll show you!

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.147 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Can't believe the
Grand Prix Series for high

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.983 position:50% align:center
school skate-leading
is around the corner.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.152 position:50% align:center
This training camp
is gonna be key.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.404 position:50% align:center
This is how we'll
make it to the finals.

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.074 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.450 position:50% align:center
Nothing. You just look
handsome when you're having

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.035 position:50% align:center
deep thoughts. Cutie.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:18.078 position:50% align:center
Stop that.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.093 position:50% align:center
All right, you guys,

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.137 position:50% align:center
this year's Grand Prix
Series is coming up.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.597 position:50% align:center
This is important for us.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.558 position:50% align:center
Needless to say,
we're aiming for nationals.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.394 position:50% align:center
To achieve that, first, we
need to make it to finals.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:07.937 position:50% align:center
You don't wanna cry on
the ice 'cause we missed

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.732 position:50% align:center
qualifying by a hundredth
of a point, right?

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:12.233 position:50% align:center
So, we will qualify.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:14.194 position:50% align:center
We'll reach for every
point we can get.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.863 position:50% align:center
And that focus starts here,
at training camp!

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:17.989 position:50% align:center
--Right!
--Yessir!

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:18.990 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.200 position:50% align:center
Hold on a minute, Maeshima,

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:21.409 position:50% align:center
please don't tell
me you don't even

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.036 position:50% align:center
know the rules for this series.

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.580 position:50% align:center
Uh, we just have to win, right?

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.624 position:50% align:center
No? How's that not the goal?

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.042 position:50% align:center
Okay, listen up.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.044 position:50% align:center
The Grand Prix Series for
high school skate-leading

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.046 position:50% align:center
has a total of eight matches.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.965 position:50% align:center
The six schools from last
year's finals are seeded.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.842 position:50% align:center
Add the ten who make
it through preliminaries

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:39.594 position:50% align:center
for a total of 16 schools,

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.097 position:50% align:center
who each compete in three
of the eight matches.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.391 position:50% align:center
From there, the six schools
with the highest scores

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.810 position:50% align:center
are the ones who
qualify for finals.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:50.313 position:50% align:center
They're also seeded in
next year's competition.

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.399 position:50% align:center
Then, obviously,
the top-scoring school

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.859 position:50% align:center
at finals becomes the champion.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:55.902 position:50% align:center
Got all that?

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.904 position:50% align:center
Basically, we just have to win.

00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:59.698 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
We have the line-up.

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.241 position:50% align:center
We've been assigned to
compete in the first match

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.076 position:50% align:center
in Shizuoka next month.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:04.411 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Shinozaki?

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.329 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Saint Clavis
starts in the third match.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:07.831 position:50% align:center
Wow, lucky us.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.166 position:50% align:center
We don't have to face the
favorite right outta the gate.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.543 position:50% align:center
That's no fun, though.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.211 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
But don't let your guard down.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.296 position:50% align:center
We'll be going up against
Chutei University

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.091 position:50% align:center
Kamimaezu High,
who placed sixth last year.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:19.759 position:50% align:center
Perfect unison.

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:21.636 position:50% align:center
A team known for their precision

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.930 position:50% align:center
and pristine synchronization.

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.057 position:50% align:center
The Ishikawa brothers,
their twin aces,

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.059 position:50% align:center
make them even harder to beat.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:29.853 position:50% align:center
They get pretty high
scores for style,

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:31.938 position:50% align:center
and of course,
their technical is perfect.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.399 position:50% align:center
They're an
infallible powerhouse.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] But we won't be
losing to them or any team.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:39.904 position:50% align:center
Let's take this first match!

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:41.364 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.908 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] The coach has
chosen our music and formation.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.744 position:50% align:center
You'll learn the choreography
for each of your

00:04:45.827 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
positions during
this training camp.

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.875 position:50% align:center
Now, then, here's
the starting team.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.002 position:50% align:center
First, the guards
are Jonouchi and me.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
Uh...! All right.

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.881 position:50% align:center
--Problem?
--[JONOUCHI] Nah.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.758 position:50% align:center
I bet he was counting on a lead.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.801 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Wing. Akimitsu.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:02.802 position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.180 position:50% align:center
Lead, Kiriyama.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.225 position:50% align:center
And in the position of
second lead, Maeshima.

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.477 position:50% align:center
Tomo on reserve.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.646 position:50% align:center
Oh, hell yeah!
I mean, it was obvious, though!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.358 position:50% align:center
If that's true, then why
do you seem so relieved?

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] You were a little
nervous, weren't you?

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I was not!

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.695 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Individual skill is important,

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.864 position:50% align:center
but this is team figure skating,

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:24.783 position:50% align:center
and that means
teamwork is vital.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
So don't ever forget that.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:28.578 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Okay!

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.913 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B]
Wow, that's weird.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.873 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT A]
Weren't those Ionodai students?

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.583 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT B] I don't get it,
why're they here?

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.585 position:50% align:center
[STUDENT C]
I mean, they're a public school.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.421 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] Heh heh!
I can finally train on the rink!

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
Don't go too crazy.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.759 position:50% align:center
You really wore yourself out
running those mountain trails.

00:05:42.842 --> 00:05:44.594 position:50% align:center
Just get the feeling back today.

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:46.096 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Yep, sure thing.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
Hey, whatcha' you got there?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.685 position:50% align:center
Oh, uh...

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.561 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd be a
support for Akimitsu.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.231 position:50% align:center
You may be on reserve,
but you're still on the team.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.400 position:50% align:center
Don't do support
work, go practice.

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:00.110 position:50% align:center
Go ahead, I'll take
care of this.

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:02.445 position:50% align:center
Kubota, you're a lead. Got that?

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.738 position:50% align:center
I got it, sir!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.491 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
No, listen.

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
You've still been going
way too wide!

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.662 position:50% align:center
You gotta keep it tighter
and get the timing right!

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.997 position:50% align:center
But dude, you know it's
so much cooler my way.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.374 position:50% align:center
That's not what it's about!

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.543 position:50% align:center
You need to focus
on position and timing!

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:17.877 position:50% align:center
Are you kidding?

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
Having a cool show is
the most important thing!

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.297 position:50% align:center
You better watch your tone!

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.883 position:50% align:center
That's enough.
Tomo, come take his place.

00:06:23.967 --> 00:06:26.094 position:50% align:center
I want to do a full
run-through to review.

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.470 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Y-Yes, sir.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:29.973 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA yelps]

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.725 position:50% align:center
Just practice with
me instead, okay?

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
You don't have to listen
to Master Four-Eyes.

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.061 position:50% align:center
You can do what you want!

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.146 position:50% align:center
Would you cut this out?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
You first!

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:38.898 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA chuckles]

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.942 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Tomo, what are you laughing at?

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:44.529 position:50% align:center
Okay, what do you
have up your sleeve?

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:47.490 position:50% align:center
You actually chose the
music and a routine.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.826 position:50% align:center
Has your sense of duty awakened?

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:51.619 position:50% align:center
It's self-preservation.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.204 position:50% align:center
I've got to show that
I'm doing at least

00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
the bare minimum, after all.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.416 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Hmm?

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.084 position:50% align:center
I have one slight
change I'd like to make

00:06:58.168 --> 00:06:59.210 position:50% align:center
to the routine.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.587 position:50% align:center
How would you feel
about suggesting it

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.130 position:50% align:center
to the team for me?

00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:03.923 position:50% align:center
Why not propose it yourself?

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.801 position:50% align:center
Cause not all of 'em are
super-comfy trusting me yet.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.053 position:50% align:center
Why don't you let
me help you with

00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:09.471 position:50% align:center
the self-preservation thing?

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.780 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
He really is good.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.783 position:50% align:center
Strong interpretation
and performance.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:14.411 position:50% align:center
I've only ever been able
to skate as I'm told.

00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:16.329 position:50% align:center
Stop it!

00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.872 position:50% align:center
No time to get depressed.

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:19.874 position:50% align:center
I need to steal some
of these techniques.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.962 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] All right, today,
we'll be running through

00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.840 position:50% align:center
the short program.
Starting team, get in the rink.

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:27.924 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Okay!

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.644 position:50% align:center
This it?

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:41.604 position:50% align:center
How many times are you
gonna make me repeat it?

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.232 position:50% align:center
Stick to your
position and timing!

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.067 position:50% align:center
Speak up if you
have something to say.

00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.361 position:50% align:center
You can't expect us
to read your mind.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:49.696 position:50% align:center
Look, it's just that...

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.698 position:50% align:center
I've always hated
the short program.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.324 position:50% align:center
Most of the performance
is set in stone,

00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
so you can't improvise
and it sucks!

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.162 position:50% align:center
Who cares if you like it or not?
You're such a--

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.038 position:50% align:center
Kiriyama.

00:08:58.121 --> 00:08:59.289 position:50% align:center
Question.

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.207 position:50% align:center
Didn't you used to skate
singles back in the day?

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.585 position:50% align:center
You woulda done
a short program then.

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.253 position:50% align:center
What did you do?

00:09:05.337 --> 00:09:06.296 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Copied it.

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.131 position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.550 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] I watched my
coach skate and copied it.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:11.634 position:50% align:center
You what?!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.720 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, now that
I think about it,

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.055 position:50% align:center
that does make sense.

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.973 position:50% align:center
Your short program scores
were never very high

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.099 position:50% align:center
back then.

00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:20.393 position:50% align:center
Hey! I scored well
when I was into it!

00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.020 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
When you were into it?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:22.896 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Are you...

00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:24.356 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Could it be?

00:09:24.439 --> 00:09:26.649 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] You really are no
good at the short program?

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:27.817 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.944 position:50% align:center
We've discovered an
unexpected weakness!

00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:32.530 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] I just don't like
dealing with the fine details!

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
Everyone has a weakness, right?

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:35.658 position:50% align:center
Say something!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
Let's run it again.
Everyone get in position.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.538 position:50% align:center
Maeshima, focus on getting
the choreography down

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.582 position:50% align:center
to a tee.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:43.792 position:50% align:center
Fine.

00:09:43.875 --> 00:09:46.252 position:50% align:center
You didn't know that was
how he worked, Sasu?

00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.171 position:50% align:center
I mean, yeah, he mimics.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
That's always been
kind of his thing.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.510 position:50% align:center
But then he apparently
feels the need to modify!

00:09:59.349 --> 00:10:00.600 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI yawns]

00:10:00.684 --> 00:10:01.685 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Hey.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.937 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Mr. Miura. This is a surprise.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.355 position:50% align:center
What are you doing here?

00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:08.108 position:50% align:center
I'm here to cover any stories
at the training camp.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.151 position:50% align:center
Naginata. Tennis and such.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.320 position:50% align:center
Our budget is
scary-low these days.

00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:13.905 position:50% align:center
So that means I'm also
covering high school

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.990 position:50% align:center
skate-leading and whatever else.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.076 position:50% align:center
Think I could come by
for an interview tomorrow?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.411 position:50% align:center
Special issue.

00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.163 position:50% align:center
Yeah, as long as you have
the school's consent.

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.457 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Well? How are they coming along?

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.500 position:50% align:center
Dunno.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.918 position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:10:27.002 --> 00:10:28.878 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
I haven't taught them anything.

00:10:28.962 --> 00:10:30.839 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Nothing?

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:31.840 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Right there!

00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
You weren't together. Again.

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.762 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Don't waste time, Adachi.

00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:38.847 position:50% align:center
You know?

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:43.018 position:50% align:center
Neither yours nor
that of those kids.

00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.894 position:50% align:center
But I'm a big fan
of the figure skater

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:47.230 position:50% align:center
Takumi Adachi, regardless.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.357 position:50% align:center
Whether you're on
the ice or teaching.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:51.359 position:50% align:center
I hope I'll always get
to see that personality

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.819 position:50% align:center
shine through.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.530 position:50% align:center
Anyway. See you tomorrow.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:56.906 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Nope, other way!

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.074 position:50% align:center
Stop right there!

00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:00.326 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
What's wrong?

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.162 position:50% align:center
You don't seem like
yourself, Jonouchi.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:03.580 position:50% align:center
Oh, he's just all
bummed out because

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.915 position:50% align:center
he doesn't get to
skate lead. Right?

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.000 position:50% align:center
What? Shut up!

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.460 position:50% align:center
Terauchi is an
excellent guard,

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.086 position:50% align:center
but we rely on your skills, too.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.755 position:50% align:center
Your physical
ability and balance

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:14.341 position:50% align:center
are valuable assets
and hard to come by.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:16.468 position:50% align:center
Thank you for that,
it is good to hear.

00:11:16.551 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
He was expecting
to get a lead position,

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:20.889 position:50% align:center
same as he did during
the inter-team match.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:23.850 position:50% align:center
Well, it's near impossible
to alter the formation now.

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.895 position:50% align:center
That said, the starting team
isn't quite set in stone yet.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.647 position:50% align:center
Well, that's excellent
news for me,

00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.107 position:50% align:center
'cause I have zero
doubt that I can snatch

00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.026 position:50% align:center
that position with pure skill!

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:34.736 position:50% align:center
Hey, don't go getting
ahead of yourself

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.780 position:50% align:center
and slack on guard practice
because of that.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.114 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be fine!

00:11:38.198 --> 00:11:39.949 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Jonouchi, can I count on you?

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:41.701 position:50% align:center
You better believe you can!

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:44.496 position:50% align:center
Listen, I think you should
steal Itsuki's starting spot.

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.081 position:50% align:center
Then you can skate with me.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:47.457 position:50% align:center
I can't do that!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.376 position:50% align:center
Come on, I know you can do it.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.961 position:50% align:center
Wanna compete in the
Grand Prix Series together?

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.553 position:50% align:center
No, that's not happening.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.305 position:50% align:center
My method is designed
to allow the team

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:03.973 position:50% align:center
to earn maximum points.

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:05.558 position:50% align:center
Believe me,
everything will fall apart

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
if you go with his method.

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:08.645 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying that
you have to be

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:10.188 position:50% align:center
Maeshima's best friend.

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.356 position:50% align:center
But for the good of the team,

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.857 position:50% align:center
I need you to try to
find a middle ground

00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.359 position:50% align:center
where you can both agree.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.111 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] Some amount
of pressure can be good,

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.320 position:50% align:center
even within a team.

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:18.822 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Sure, but he's a first year,

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.323 position:50% align:center
and we're seniors now, right?

00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:26.287 position:50% align:center
Just do it for the team. Please.

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:28.373 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU, JONOUCHI]
One, two, three, four.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.500 position:50% align:center
One, two, three, four.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:32.669 position:50% align:center
One, two and three and four.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.587 position:50% align:center
One, two and three and four.

00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:35.839 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Maeshima.

00:12:39.718 --> 00:12:41.803 position:50% align:center
You, uh, need something?

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:43.471 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Well, Terauchi said...

00:12:43.555 --> 00:12:44.889 position:50% align:center
I mean, I didn't want to,

00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:47.642 position:50% align:center
but Terauchi said
I should, uh...

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:49.102 position:50% align:center
It's your favorite. So...

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.979 position:50% align:center
Ugh, why me?

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.105 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.440 position:50% align:center
Right, here it is.

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.525 position:50% align:center
Terauchi gave me this
protein bar and said that

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.485 position:50% align:center
I should bring it in
and give it to you.

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.070 position:50% align:center
Personally, I thought
the whole thing--

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:01.114 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
This has been a waste of time.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.699 position:50% align:center
--Thanks.
--[KIRIYAMA growls]

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:04.993 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.746 position:50% align:center
Whenever I see his
face, I just wanna...

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
Well, you can take it slow.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:10.707 position:50% align:center
Some things need time.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.001 position:50% align:center
Oh, god, this sucks.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.919 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
I know. I'm sorry.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.884 position:50% align:center
Hey! I thought you were out
with the captain, weren't you?

00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.345 position:50% align:center
Terauchi and the coach
are giving an interview,

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.554 position:50% align:center
so they're tied up.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.389 position:50% align:center
Wow, this is finally
starting to feel like

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:27.891 position:50% align:center
the real thing!

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:30.602 position:50% align:center
[MIURA] Thanks so much for
taking the time out today.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:31.853 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.104 position:50% align:center
Well, first, why don't
you tell me your goal

00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.315 position:50% align:center
for this year's
Grand Prix Series?

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.941 position:50% align:center
It's the same every year.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:38.735 position:50% align:center
We're aiming to be
the national champions.

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:41.905 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki has switched over
to skate-leading this year.

00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:43.156 position:50% align:center
Any thoughts on that?

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.158 position:50% align:center
We'll keep it
in mind, naturally.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.659 position:50% align:center
If I understand correctly,
he's joined the

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.037 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis team,
captained by Himuro,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.164 position:50% align:center
one of your former
teammates, right?

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:53.792 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Yes. But that
doesn't change anything.

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.418 position:50% align:center
In other words?

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.795 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
No matter who's on a team,

00:13:56.878 --> 00:13:59.089 position:50% align:center
we consider them
rivals to defeat.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:00.632 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
I see.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.342 position:50% align:center
Well, how's the team
coming together?

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.010 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] The majority of
us have skated together

00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:06.429 position:50% align:center
since we were young,
so we all know each other well.

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:08.723 position:50% align:center
[MIURA] If I recall, that's all
of you but Jonouchi,

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:09.766 position:50% align:center
who's from Tochigi.

00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.017 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.770 position:50% align:center
But this is Jonouchi's
second year on the team.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.105 position:50% align:center
He and our other second year,

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:18.525 position:50% align:center
Akimitsu Mochizuki, have
both gotten much stronger.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.193 position:50% align:center
We also have two first years,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.154 position:50% align:center
Kubota and Maeshima,
who have a lot of potential.

00:14:23.238 --> 00:14:24.406 position:50% align:center
They're great additions.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.074 position:50% align:center
Hey, you hear that, Kubota?

00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:28.576 position:50% align:center
Um... I don't know.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.329 position:50% align:center
I knew about you even back
when you were a novice.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:34.290 position:50% align:center
Solid technique, and you
perform meticulously.

00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.376 position:50% align:center
I bet your teammates trust
you completely, right?

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:37.627 position:50% align:center
No, I couldn't say that--

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:38.628 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
It's true.

00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:40.422 position:50% align:center
Kubota excels at
matching others,

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:42.465 position:50% align:center
and he's a very reliable skater.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:45.010 position:50% align:center
His skating is focused on
consistently earning points,

00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.512 position:50% align:center
so he's obviously a
huge asset to our team.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.722 position:50% align:center
Oh. I dunno.

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:50.974 position:50% align:center
You heard what he said, kid.
You can go.

00:14:51.057 --> 00:14:52.767 position:50% align:center
Oh, yes, sir!

00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:55.812 position:50% align:center
[MIURA chuckles] Okay, let's
move on to the next question.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:56.896 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Sure.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.245 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
One, two, three, four.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:16.624 position:50% align:center
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:17.959 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Adachi...

00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:21.296 position:50% align:center
You might actually be
a decent coach after all.

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:22.714 position:50% align:center
Guess we'll see.

00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.884 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
C'mon, Maeshima, enough already!

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:26.801 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
What now?

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:28.178 position:50% align:center
Oh, no!

00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.056 position:50% align:center
It happened again!
How many times is that today?

00:15:31.139 --> 00:15:32.349 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
We went wider like you wanted,

00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:33.725 position:50% align:center
but you still
changed the timing!

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:36.394 position:50% align:center
And again, why did you
suddenly go inwards?

00:15:36.478 --> 00:15:38.229 position:50% align:center
I haven't seen you
do it right yet!

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:40.315 position:50% align:center
Not a single run-through
has been correct!

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:43.026 position:50% align:center
Maybe because I know it's
way cooler the other way!

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.277 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
That again?

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.404 position:50% align:center
How am I supposed
to know if I don't try it?

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.989 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] You have a lot
of nerve talking like that

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:49.366 position:50% align:center
to an upperclassman!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Don't change the subject!

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.161 position:50% align:center
My goal is to beat Shinozaki.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:56.790 position:50% align:center
You can hate me all you want,
but don't you dare drag me down!

00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.250 position:50% align:center
--Got a problem?
--[KUBOTA] Ken.

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:00.835 position:50% align:center
Tomo, would you
please tell him--

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:02.045 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
That's enough.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:04.130 position:50% align:center
You know how focused
Kiriyama is on winning,

00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:05.256 position:50% align:center
don't you?

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.466 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, but...

00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.717 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Let's have a match.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.094 position:50% align:center
What?

00:16:09.177 --> 00:16:11.054 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] Yeah, skate
a match with me, Ken.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.764 position:50% align:center
We can do the short program.

00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:15.725 position:50% align:center
Tomo... but why?

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.061 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] Because, if I win,
I want you to put me

00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:19.437 position:50% align:center
on the starting team.

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.939 position:50% align:center
You're really serious?

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
[dog barking]

00:16:30.824 --> 00:16:32.158 position:50% align:center
What's going on?

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
Shima and Tomo both want
to be on the starting team.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
So, they're holding
a match and skating

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.622 position:50% align:center
the short program together.

00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:38.915 position:50% align:center
Sasugai, what did you...

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.041 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Hey, it wasn't me.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.501 position:50% align:center
Kubota challenged him.

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
But you don't seem against it.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:45.130 position:50% align:center
Does that mean you think
he'll get an easy win

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.381 position:50% align:center
against Tomo?

00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
No way.

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.343 position:50% align:center
It might actually
be pretty tough.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.470 position:50% align:center
But he needs to break
that narrative in his head

00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:55.223 position:50% align:center
about it being his weakness.

00:16:55.306 --> 00:16:57.684 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
We'll skate it simultaneously.

00:16:57.767 --> 00:16:59.769 position:50% align:center
Whoever ends up
with more points wins.

00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:01.146 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.064 position:50% align:center
Hey. Listen, if you're mad--

00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.274 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
I'm not.

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:06.151 position:50% align:center
If it's a straight match,
I won't go easy.

00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:08.278 position:50% align:center
I know. Do your best.

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:20.540 position:50% align:center
Well, they're both off
to a pretty good start.

00:17:20.623 --> 00:17:21.833 position:50% align:center
Yeah, check it out.

00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:24.169 position:50% align:center
Maeshima's doing the
actual choreography.

00:17:24.252 --> 00:17:25.754 position:50% align:center
And Tomo's so skilled.

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:28.089 position:50% align:center
He's got a strong foundation
since he applies himself

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.507 position:50% align:center
during training.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.557 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] Almost time for the
element where he goes too wide.

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.351 position:50% align:center
What'll you do, Maeshima?

00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:43.021 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Crap.

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:45.648 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be late to
the next intersection!

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:46.816 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
You see?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
Skate-leading is a team sport.

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:50.820 position:50% align:center
As long as you fail to
accept how it's different

00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:53.239 position:50% align:center
from singles, Maeshima...

00:17:53.323 --> 00:17:54.532 position:50% align:center
...you'll never be able
to beat someone

00:17:54.616 --> 00:17:56.451 position:50% align:center
well-rounded like Tomo!

00:17:56.534 --> 00:17:59.496 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] Wait, where's the
wing supposed to be right now?

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.955 position:50% align:center
And the guard?

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:03.333 position:50% align:center
Man, I'm in trouble.
Am I gonna...

00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:07.379 position:50% align:center
Wow, Kubota's winning.

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.173 position:50% align:center
And the gap will only
widen if this keeps up.

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:11.841 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Huh, we could take Maeshima off

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:14.469 position:50% align:center
the short program and
use Tomo instead.

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.061 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Yes! I can do this!

00:18:23.144 --> 00:18:25.897 position:50% align:center
Solid technique, and you
perform meticulously.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.942 position:50% align:center
So he's obviously a huge
asset to our team.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.570 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Meticulous and precise. Yes!

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:35.949 position:50% align:center
It feels kinda like fitting
pieces into a puzzle.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
The short program
suits my style!

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:41.496 position:50% align:center
I'll win if you don't stick
to the program, Ken!

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:42.622 position:50% align:center
I will!

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.166 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Are you kidding me?

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.835 position:50% align:center
Why can't I catch up to him?

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.003 position:50% align:center
At this rate...

00:18:50.505 --> 00:18:53.800 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Remember, if you learn
it, then you can replicate it.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.760 position:50% align:center
Trust me, you can do this.

00:18:55.844 --> 00:18:57.762 position:50% align:center
Just learn those moves.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:00.390 position:50% align:center
You've got the best example
right in front of you.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.685 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Tomo. I'm sorry.

00:19:03.768 --> 00:19:06.855 position:50% align:center
I'll let you win
any other match.

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
But not this one!

00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:14.404 position:50% align:center
Hold on.
Is the difference shrinking?

00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:16.781 position:50% align:center
Looks like Maeshima's
starting to catch up.

00:19:16.865 --> 00:19:18.700 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Why? How?

00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:21.327 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
I see.

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:24.914 position:50% align:center
By copying Kubota, he's avoided
getting points deducted.

00:19:24.998 --> 00:19:26.750 position:50% align:center
Which means...
it comes down to who has

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
better presentation.

00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:37.218 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
So, Shima won, huh?

00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.973 position:50% align:center
I was thinking about
how the captain

00:19:42.057 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
started this team
as a first-year.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:47.562 position:50% align:center
They recruited students
with experience.

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
Their first year,
people thought of them

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.149 position:50% align:center
as an unofficial club.

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.527 position:50% align:center
They were narrowly seeded
for the Grand Prix Series

00:19:54.611 --> 00:19:56.863 position:50% align:center
and finally accepted
as an official team.

00:19:58.865 --> 00:20:01.242 position:50% align:center
Akimitsu and Jonouchi
joined the next year,

00:20:01.326 --> 00:20:03.411 position:50% align:center
and they placed
fourth at nationals.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:06.414 position:50% align:center
Do you even get
how cool that is?

00:20:06.498 --> 00:20:08.958 position:50% align:center
Yeah, kind of. I guess.

00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.336 position:50% align:center
I watched it. Those finals.

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:17.300 position:50% align:center
The others seemed pretty
thrilled about getting fourth.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:20.929 position:50% align:center
But the captain and Kiriyama
looked so frustrated.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.640 position:50% align:center
The day after that
disappointment,

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.558 position:50% align:center
they got right back to training.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:29.187 position:50% align:center
Determined to place first
at nationals next time.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.398 position:50% align:center
And I wanted to
be a part of that.

00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:34.693 position:50% align:center
I wanted to help them
achieve that dream.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.695 position:50% align:center
But I can't!

00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:39.906 position:50% align:center
I've just never been able
to reach that same level.

00:20:39.989 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
I'm not good enough.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.536 position:50% align:center
Tomo, that's what you
wanted to figure out?

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.332 position:50% align:center
This is the last
year the captain

00:20:49.416 --> 00:20:51.543 position:50% align:center
and Kiriyama
will get to try for it.

00:20:51.626 --> 00:20:52.794 position:50% align:center
Understand?

00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.005 position:50% align:center
Oh, right, so you're saying...

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.089 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Ken.

00:20:57.841 --> 00:20:59.134 position:50% align:center
It's up to you.

00:20:59.217 --> 00:21:02.178 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but isn't this a
little cheap for a bribe?

00:21:02.262 --> 00:21:04.973 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] Sorry, that's the
best I can do right now.

00:21:05.056 --> 00:21:08.268 position:50% align:center
Come on, you're
ruining the moment!

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:09.477 position:50% align:center
Well, thanks!

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.608 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] All right, I'm gonna
head back first, then.

00:21:23.658 --> 00:21:26.494 position:50% align:center
I was rude earlier,
and I'm sorry.

00:21:26.578 --> 00:21:27.996 position:50% align:center
Please forgive me.

00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:32.292 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] Hey, what's
going on with Maeshima?

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.919 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Ah, you mean his recent skating?

00:21:35.003 --> 00:21:37.088 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU] He's been using
Tomo as a reference.

00:21:37.172 --> 00:21:38.840 position:50% align:center
He says, for visualizing
the position

00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:40.091 position:50% align:center
of the wing and guards,

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:41.968 position:50% align:center
Tomo's skating is the best.

00:21:42.052 --> 00:21:43.219 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Mine?

00:21:43.303 --> 00:21:44.596 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI] Seems unusual
for that idiot to use

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
someone else as a reference.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.266 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] Isn't it just
that he finally gets

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.977 position:50% align:center
what skate-leading is all about?

00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:52.937 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] If so, I'm sure
glad it happened in time

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.439 position:50% align:center
for the Grand Prix Series.

00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:55.815 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Costumes are ready, too!

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.484 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
And the choreography's tight.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.820 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] It's the first match
of the Grand Prix Series!

00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:02.489 position:50% align:center
Ionodai is going
to find our rhythm

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:04.074 position:50% align:center
and bring home the victory!

00:22:04.157 --> 00:22:05.325 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, we will!

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:39.919 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME, SUSUMU whispering]

00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:41.171 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA]
Come on now, you two.

00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:42.589 position:50% align:center
Why won't you talk out loud?

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.132 position:50% align:center
Didn't I just finish
teaching you about

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.468 position:50% align:center
emotional release
and proper vocal use?

00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:47.594 position:50% align:center
[HAJIME, SUSUMU]
Right. Yes, sir!

00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:48.845 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA]
Well, that's too much!

00:23:48.928 --> 00:23:50.597 position:50% align:center
Warn me if you're going
to scream like that!
