[SASUGAI]
There once was a foolish boy.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.018 position:50% align:center
With only the purest
of intentions,

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.479 position:50% align:center
he taught his older
brother how to skate.

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.689 position:50% align:center
His brother was talented,
and in no time,

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:26.568 position:50% align:center
he had risen to become a star
in the figure skating world.

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.403 position:50% align:center
The foolish boy looked
for a new place

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:30.072 position:50% align:center
for himself in skate-leading.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:33.700 position:50% align:center
But wouldn't ya know, his
brother turned up there, too.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:35.619 position:50% align:center
So, the boy made a pact
with his brother's

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.038 position:50% align:center
one-time rival, Kensei Maeshima,

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.082 position:50% align:center
and even got the
Ionodai team involved

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:41.917 position:50% align:center
in his fight against
his brother.

00:00:43.836 --> 00:00:47.631 position:50% align:center
The fool is me, of course,
the brilliant Hayato Sasugai.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.550 position:50% align:center
Just a dude who was
super slow to learn

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:51.593 position:50% align:center
that everything in his
world would eventually

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.805 position:50% align:center
be taken away by his older
brother, Reo Shinozaki.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.523 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.692 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] What a wonderful
performance by St. Clavis

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
Gakuin!

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.403 position:50% align:center
Let's see how they did!

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.618 position:50% align:center
A technical of 83.67,
a performance of 57.17,

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.621 position:50% align:center
for a total of 140.84!

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.082 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis Gakuin has just
achieved the highest score

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:23.709 position:50% align:center
in the history of the series!

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.135 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Wow, I can't
get over that score.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:34.344 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.305 position:50% align:center
At this point, are they
pretty much guaranteed

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:37.890 position:50% align:center
their second consecutive win?

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.516 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] Hard to say,
but there's no denying

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.101 position:50% align:center
that they're amazing.

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:42.311 position:50% align:center
One team's left, though,

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.605 position:50% align:center
and I don't want
to count them out.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:47.065 position:50% align:center
It won't be easy for Ionodai
to beat St. Clavis,

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.903 position:50% align:center
but even so, I want to believe
they've still got a shot.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.419 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] It's hard to believe
this year's Boys' High School

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:34.214 position:50% align:center
Skate-Leading Grand Prix
finals is nearing its end.

00:03:34.298 --> 00:03:35.757 position:50% align:center
We're on the edges of our seat.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:38.552 position:50% align:center
Will the last school, Ionodai,
come from behind to take it,

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.387 position:50% align:center
or will St. Clavis be
the first school to get

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.514 position:50% align:center
two consecutive wins?

00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:44.183 position:50% align:center
[CROWD A]
It's obvious who's gonna get it.

00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.560 position:50% align:center
[CROWD B] It'd be impossible
for them to catch up now.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.937 position:50% align:center
[CROWD A] Ionodai's gonna
shoot for second place, right?

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:50.189 position:50% align:center
[CROWD C]
I'd say that's enough.

00:03:50.272 --> 00:03:52.107 position:50% align:center
[CROWD B] It's a public-school
team? Really?

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:53.442 position:50% align:center
[CROWD D]
They've done so well.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:54.985 position:50% align:center
[CROWD E]
They barely have enough skaters.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.778 position:50% align:center
[CROWD C]
They're totally outclassed.

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.489 position:50% align:center
[CROWD D] Yeah, seems
like bad luck for Ionodai.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
Well, you guys, you got
unbelievably lucky.

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:05.996 position:50% align:center
Be thankful.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.165 position:50% align:center
If you'd scored any lower
on the short program,

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.416 position:50% align:center
then you'd most likely
be shooting

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.752 position:50% align:center
for a solid second right now.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:13.462 position:50% align:center
But you still have
a chance to win.

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.591 position:50% align:center
Terauchi, you're the
pillar of this team.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:18.926 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to keep
your eyes open

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.761 position:50% align:center
and your head high,
like I taught you.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.095 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:04:22.179 --> 00:04:23.805 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] Jonouchi, you tend
to wander off beat.

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.432 position:50% align:center
Pay attention
and don't speed up.

00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:26.934 position:50% align:center
Yes sir!

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:28.227 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] Kiriyama, you're the
key to connecting the team

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.478 position:50% align:center
out there,

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.271 position:50% align:center
but this time, focus on
your own performance.

00:04:31.355 --> 00:04:32.940 position:50% align:center
You can fulfill your
role best by simply

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.149 position:50% align:center
doing that, understand?

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:35.234 position:50% align:center
Got it!

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.069 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Akimitsu, you tend to look down.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:39.071 position:50% align:center
Keep the height you need
to spot at in mind.

00:04:39.154 --> 00:04:40.656 position:50% align:center
It'll make your
skating look lighter.

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:41.823 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.784 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] Maeshima,
you're the point getter.

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:45.452 position:50% align:center
So, if you think you're
ready to do that thing

00:04:45.536 --> 00:04:47.871 position:50% align:center
we've been working on...

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.081 position:50% align:center
...then just do it.

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:50.499 position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:52.042 position:50% align:center
This is ours.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.377 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win it.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.837 position:50% align:center
We'll beat Shinozaki.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.046 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
How boring.

00:04:57.381 --> 00:04:58.882 position:50% align:center
I thought you'd be
more shaken up,

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.176 position:50% align:center
so I was kinda looking
forward to figuring out

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.719 position:50% align:center
how to get you motivated.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.763 position:50% align:center
Looks like my plan's
gone to waste.

00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:06.139 position:50% align:center
Well, when there's
such a big difference

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.267 position:50% align:center
in points like that,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.560 position:50% align:center
we really have no choice
but to just go for it.

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:10.853 position:50% align:center
I mean, why not, right?

00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:11.895 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Totally!

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.647 position:50% align:center
Well, he's not wrong.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.069 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.737 position:50% align:center
Okay, okay.

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
I get it, you're feelin'
ready to fight back.

00:05:23.282 --> 00:05:25.075 position:50% align:center
So, let's have a
strategy meeting.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.785 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:30.247 position:50% align:center
Hey, bummer for Ionodai,
but that was our personal best!

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.874 position:50% align:center
Our second consecutive win!

00:05:31.957 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
It's actually happening!

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.587 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Ionodai's kinda stuck.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.338 position:50% align:center
They only have two options.

00:05:38.422 --> 00:05:40.507 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] Risk it all in order
to win or skate by the book

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:42.217 position:50% align:center
so they can at
least take silver.

00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:44.553 position:50% align:center
Second place is still
impressive, though,

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:45.888 position:50% align:center
in company like this.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Even if I had any
wise words, you'd forget 'em,

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.573 position:50% align:center
so all I'm gonna say is this.

00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:07.451 position:50% align:center
If the time is right, feel free
to skate the way you want.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
Go for it.

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:09.995 position:50% align:center
Just leave it all out there.

--Right! Coming.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:16.710 position:50% align:center
--[TERAUCHI] Let's go!
--[GROUP] Yes sir!

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:18.128 position:50% align:center
[CROWD clapping]

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:20.923 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] All right, the skaters
have just come out!

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.175 position:50% align:center
They're in their
starting positions.

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:24.218 position:50% align:center
This is it.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:25.844 position:50% align:center
The last team to
skate at this year's

Grand Prix finals.

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:31.308 position:50% align:center

[music playing]

00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:40.859 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
And they've begun!

00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center
Starting off strong is
so important here.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.780 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] Yes, and I'm hoping
they keep true to the same

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.949 position:50% align:center
bold style everyone
loves about them.

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
Whoa! A surprise triple Axel!

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:56.375 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI chuckles]

00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.252 position:50% align:center
Well, we know they're not
aiming for second, then!

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.921 position:50% align:center
They're still shooting
for a win from behind!

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.381 position:50% align:center
But that's a difficult path.

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.007 position:50% align:center
The pressure of not
being able to make even

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.134 position:50% align:center
a single mistake
is extraordinary.

00:07:06.218 --> 00:07:08.220 position:50% align:center
I don't envy them!

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
When stakes are
this high, all it takes

00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:12.432 position:50% align:center
is for one team member
to buckle under that weight,

00:07:12.516 --> 00:07:13.767 position:50% align:center
then it's all over.

00:07:26.071 --> 00:07:27.239 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
It's over.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:28.991 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA] Yeah, they
can't overtake us now.

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:31.118 position:50% align:center
Will they switch focus?
Aim for second?

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.206 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA] If they keep
it up with these desperate

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.709 position:50% align:center
measures, we could
actually end up being third.

00:07:41.837 --> 00:07:43.422 position:50% align:center
Maeshima's changed
the program to add

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.756 position:50% align:center
consecutive jumps.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.508 position:50% align:center
Which increases
the level of difficulty

00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:48.302 position:50% align:center
in terms of scoring.

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
Is he storing points to
make up for mistakes?

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.097 position:50% align:center
No, that can't be it.

00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:54.516 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI chuckles]

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.351 position:50% align:center
Increase the difficulty
of the skills?

00:07:56.435 --> 00:07:59.021 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying push
yourselves unreasonably.

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.440 position:50% align:center
Only choose moments when
you think you can do it.

00:08:01.523 --> 00:08:03.400 position:50% align:center
I've seen you guys
practicing at a higher level

00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.736 position:50% align:center
than what you actually
skate out there.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:07.029 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree?

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:07.863 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Yeah.

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:09.281 position:50% align:center
You guys know I'm right!

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.866 position:50% align:center
Everyone's got moves
they're confident in

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:12.284 position:50% align:center
and feel good about.

00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:13.702 position:50% align:center
You know what
your strengths are.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.996 position:50% align:center
I'm saying, now's the
time to show 'em off.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.373 position:50% align:center
But if we do that,
we risk failing big.

00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.209 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Yeah, that's
why this is a gamble.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.377 position:50% align:center
Mess up and it all falls apart.

00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.588 position:50% align:center
FYI, the captain and
vice-captain's college

00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.965 position:50% align:center
recommendations
could be revoked, too.

00:08:27.049 --> 00:08:28.008 position:50% align:center
What'll you do?

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.927 position:50% align:center
It's obvious. Isn't it?

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.054 position:50% align:center
We're not gonna
be silver collectors!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:35.098 position:50% align:center
It's time to fight all-out like
the challengers we are.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:46.652 position:50% align:center
Why are they being so reckless?

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.695 position:50% align:center
It's not like there's any
chance they could win.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.405 position:50% align:center
They could end up being last.

00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:51.990 position:50% align:center
But still.

00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:53.700 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Damn it.

00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:55.244 position:50% align:center
This is smart.

00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:57.871 position:50% align:center
They're appealing to everyone's
hearts and minds right now.

00:08:57.955 --> 00:08:59.790 position:50% align:center
There are teams like
mine who regularly add

00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.167 position:50% align:center
fun elements, and those
like Shinozaki's

00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:05.712 position:50% align:center
who focus more on executing
each skill to perfection.

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:07.172 position:50% align:center
This is different.

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:09.550 position:50% align:center
It's about the spirit
of challenge.

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:10.926 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
That's right.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:13.595 position:50% align:center
What's capturing the admiration
of everyone watching

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.722 position:50% align:center
is the fact that they
refuse to give up.

00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:21.019 position:50% align:center
Look at 'em go.

00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:22.396 position:50% align:center
They're so cool.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.232 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I can't breathe. It hurts.

00:09:25.315 --> 00:09:26.608 position:50% align:center
But...

00:09:26.692 --> 00:09:28.902 position:50% align:center
If the time is right,
feel free to skate

00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:30.529 position:50% align:center
the way you want.

00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:32.906 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
You don't need to tell me!

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
Again!

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.660 position:50% align:center
Maeshima's pulling
the others in his wake.

00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.537 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Once you know how fun this is,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.998 position:50% align:center
it's hard not to go
for the encore.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.374 position:50% align:center
I can jump higher.

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.625 position:50% align:center
I can do more!

00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.880 position:50% align:center
What is this?
What's going on?

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:54.344 position:50% align:center
Sho, everyone,
we might be able do it now.

00:09:54.428 --> 00:09:56.180 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Go ahead, Maeshima!

00:09:56.263 --> 00:09:58.432 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Not like we could stop you!

00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.893 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
We gotchu-- go get those points!

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:01.977 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Go!

00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:04.897 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
All right!

00:10:11.236 --> 00:10:14.406 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:15.824 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Hey, hey.

00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:16.992 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
No way!

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.118 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
I know that move!

00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:19.578 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI]
It's Mr. Adachi's.

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.121 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA]
No, it's not!

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:23.290 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
He's added his own choreography!

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:45.687 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:10:45.771 --> 00:10:47.564 position:50% align:center
I hope you take this in, Adachi.

00:10:47.648 --> 00:10:49.483 position:50% align:center
What you've accomplished here...

00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:50.901 position:50% align:center
The performance
we just witnessed

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:53.070 position:50% align:center
was the fruit of all your labor.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:55.864 position:50% align:center
Your coaching along with
the management team.

00:10:55.948 --> 00:10:57.407 position:50% align:center
You should be incredibly
proud to be a part

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.243 position:50% align:center
of what happened out there!

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:02.746 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] This is extraordinary!
Is it possible? Could it be?

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.122 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
It could.

00:11:04.206 --> 00:11:05.749 position:50% align:center
That move of Maeshima's
especially could accumulate

00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.084 position:50% align:center
a lot of points.

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.836 position:50% align:center
I'm frankly shocked
his captain let him do

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.379 position:50% align:center
something so dangerous.

00:11:10.462 --> 00:11:12.256 position:50% align:center
Terauchi.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:15.259 position:50% align:center
[ALL sigh]

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.553 position:50% align:center
Kiriyama. You gonna live?

00:11:17.636 --> 00:11:19.137 position:50% align:center
Mind your business.

00:11:19.221 --> 00:11:20.389 position:50% align:center
[laughs]

00:11:20.472 --> 00:11:22.266 position:50% align:center
Man, I am beat.

00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:23.433 position:50% align:center
That was a lot!

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:24.935 position:50% align:center
Seriously!

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:26.144 position:50% align:center
But you know...

00:11:26.228 --> 00:11:28.522 position:50% align:center
I've really never felt better!

00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.482 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Yay. Thanks.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.278 position:50% align:center
Where's Maeshima?

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.655 position:50% align:center
He killed it. That was awesome.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:40.284 position:50% align:center
I know!
I can't believe he did it.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.451 position:50% align:center
Where'd he go?

00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:42.911 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
What are you doing?

00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.038 position:50% align:center
Get back out there, they have
to give you your scores!

00:11:45.122 --> 00:11:47.416 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
My body won't move.

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.458 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Jeez.

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.793 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
No!

00:11:49.877 --> 00:11:51.587 position:50% align:center
Tomo, go put on your skates.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.671 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:11:58.051 --> 00:11:59.428 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA laughs]

00:11:59.511 --> 00:12:02.097 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me, you were so
moved you had to come over?

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:06.935 position:50% align:center
There were a lot
of people who said

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:08.562 position:50% align:center
they would beat me.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.564 position:50% align:center
When you ended up
being one of them,

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.192 position:50% align:center
it made me sad.

00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:16.361 position:50% align:center
Your skating has always
been exciting to me.

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:19.656 position:50% align:center
From the beginning, it was
so free and unrestrained.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.783 position:50% align:center
It might not have earned
you many points,

00:12:21.867 --> 00:12:24.995 position:50% align:center
but I learned about artistic
expression from you.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:27.623 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.917 position:50% align:center
Maybe I admired you.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.127 position:50% align:center
And maybe I still do.

00:12:33.545 --> 00:12:35.255 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Hold on.
What's happening down there?

00:12:38.217 --> 00:12:40.719 position:50% align:center
Is that Shinozaki
from St. Clavis?

00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.888 position:50% align:center
Wow, it looks like he's
giving Maeshima a hand.

00:12:45.807 --> 00:12:47.518 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
You never needed to beat me--

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.478 position:50% align:center
you needed to beat yourself.

00:12:49.561 --> 00:12:51.021 position:50% align:center
The only thing we
should fight is to be

00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:52.689 position:50% align:center
better than we
were yesterday.

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.859 position:50% align:center
Today, you've done it.

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:58.070 position:50% align:center
You've surpassed your past self.

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.822 position:50% align:center
You say as you literally
look down on me.

00:13:00.906 --> 00:13:02.407 position:50% align:center
Not that I can blame you.

00:13:02.491 --> 00:13:03.909 position:50% align:center
I am kind of a mess.

00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.414 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
Now, for Ionodai's scores.

00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:10.541 position:50% align:center
Here they come!

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.252 position:50% align:center
--Look at that!
--[CROWD cheering]

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.170 position:50% align:center
[cheering continues]

00:13:28.392 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
I guess it's just us left now.

00:13:31.562 --> 00:13:33.772 position:50% align:center
Kinda lonely, isn't it?

00:13:33.856 --> 00:13:35.399 position:50% align:center
Why'd it end up like this?

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:36.984 position:50% align:center
--[YUKIMITSU] Tomo!
--Yes?

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:38.569 position:50% align:center
Why are you in here
trying to put everyone

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:39.945 position:50% align:center
in a weird mood?

00:13:40.028 --> 00:13:42.322 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, we
haven't graduated yet.

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] No, that's not it!
They were just--

00:13:44.116 --> 00:13:45.117 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI laughs]

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.368 position:50% align:center
Don't be a tattler!

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:48.662 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but you definitely
are graduating, right?

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.789 position:50% align:center
We thought we should
rehearse for the big moment.

00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.500 position:50% align:center
Okay, you know that sounds
ridiculous, don't you?

00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:55.669 position:50% align:center
Congratulations to both of you!

00:13:55.752 --> 00:13:56.879 position:50% align:center
I heard the news!

00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:58.630 position:50% align:center
Your recommendations
went through!

00:13:58.714 --> 00:13:59.882 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.717 position:50% align:center
We'll be skating on the
same team in the spring.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.343 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU] Then I'll have
to apply to get in.

00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:05.095 position:50% align:center
I mean, we share
a common destiny.

00:14:05.179 --> 00:14:06.930 position:50% align:center
But we can't go
soft before college.

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:08.557 position:50% align:center
So, it's a good thing we're
still joining you guys

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.560 position:50% align:center
for practice, assuming
you're all cool with that.

00:14:11.643 --> 00:14:13.103 position:50% align:center
--Yeah!
--For sure!

00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:14.897 position:50% align:center
Speaking of which,
where's Coach?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.064 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:17.524 position:50% align:center
He said he had
something to do today

00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
and couldn't come to practice.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.739 position:50% align:center
[MIURA] You're going back
to competing, huh?

00:14:23.822 --> 00:14:24.948 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Yeah.

00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:26.658 position:50% align:center
My back has healed,
and the anxiety I felt

00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:28.076 position:50% align:center
is gone, too.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.953 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Is that because of those boys?

00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:32.497 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] Coaching was always
temporary from the start.

00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:35.792 position:50% align:center
But yes. I won't deny it.

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.628 position:50% align:center
[MIURA chuckles]

00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:39.296 position:50% align:center
They taught me nothing ends.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.298 position:50% align:center
Everything has potential.

00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.175 position:50% align:center
Even the jump sequence
I thought was complete

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:45.719 position:50% align:center
can change,
can still be made better,

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.513 position:50% align:center
and change brings growth.

00:14:47.596 --> 00:14:49.056 position:50% align:center
Also, I've been thinking
about something

00:14:49.139 --> 00:14:51.308 position:50% align:center
out of character for me.

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:52.935 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
What do you mean?

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:55.145 position:50% align:center
Guys like Shinozaki and Himuro,

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:57.898 position:50% align:center
the ones sometimes called
part of the Platinum Age.

00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.441 position:50% align:center
I'd like to make
a path for them.

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:01.527 position:50% align:center
Help 'em out.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.737 position:50% align:center
--Really?
--[ADACHI] Yes.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.532 position:50% align:center
Well, who's gonna coach
the team next year, then?

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:09.034 position:50% align:center
I heard they've got over 20
people wanting to join.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.286 position:50% align:center
That's about how many
there are on Chutei High's

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.788 position:50% align:center
second string.

00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.039 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

00:15:14.122 --> 00:15:15.415 position:50% align:center
They already have
someone pretty smart

00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:16.667 position:50% align:center
to take my place.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.460 position:50% align:center
I also told them they
could reach out to me

00:15:18.544 --> 00:15:20.838 position:50% align:center
any time if they need to.

00:15:20.921 --> 00:15:22.339 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA] The members
of this year's team

00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:24.883 position:50% align:center
will most likely end up back
on the same team together

00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:26.260 position:50% align:center
when they get to college.

00:15:26.343 --> 00:15:28.387 position:50% align:center
However, and I didn't
tell you this.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.973 position:50% align:center
But I will not be your coach
in college like we thought.

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.267 position:50% align:center
I've decided I need
to stay here.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.561 position:50% align:center
It's important to me that this
school wins next year.

00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:36.979 position:50% align:center
[CHUTEI A]
What?

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:38.480 position:50% align:center
[CHUTEI B] Does that mean
no interpreter at college?

00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:39.982 position:50% align:center
[CHUTEI C] How are we gonna
communicate with the twins?

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:40.983 position:50% align:center
Hajime. Susumu.

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:42.901 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, Kito,
you'll do great.

00:15:42.985 --> 00:15:44.444 position:50% align:center
Whoa! What was that?

00:15:44.528 --> 00:15:46.947 position:50% align:center
I had no idea that you
thought so highly of me.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.574 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and he's not the only one.

00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:49.741 position:50% align:center
You, too, Susumu?

00:15:49.825 --> 00:15:51.326 position:50% align:center
--[COACH ISHIKAWA] Kito.
--Yes, sir!

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
See there?

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:54.204 position:50% align:center
You can interpret
in college, too.

00:15:54.288 --> 00:15:55.289 position:50% align:center
[KITO]
Huh?

00:15:57.416 --> 00:15:58.750 position:50% align:center
[KUMADA]
For this year's training camp,

00:15:58.834 --> 00:16:00.419 position:50% align:center
we'll be joining up
with the same teams

00:16:00.502 --> 00:16:02.796 position:50% align:center
we competed against
at the Grand Prix finals.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.381 position:50% align:center
We'll also have some
new students who plan

00:16:04.464 --> 00:16:07.509 position:50% align:center
to join us next school year,
so go easy.

00:16:07.593 --> 00:16:09.636 position:50% align:center
Let's work together to
find areas for growth

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.055 position:50% align:center
and use that to make
us the best we can be.

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:13.056 position:50% align:center
Sound good?

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.141 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:17.936 position:50% align:center
I'm Terahigashi from
Eimei Academy.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.605 position:50% align:center
I look forward to
working with you.

00:16:19.688 --> 00:16:22.399 position:50% align:center
I'm from Matsuyama Fukuonji.
Irie.

00:16:22.482 --> 00:16:24.276 position:50% align:center
And I hope we can
all loosen up a little.

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.485 position:50% align:center
Life's too short!

00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:26.653 position:50% align:center
Okay, you know what...

00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:28.989 position:50% align:center
I'm the new team
captain, Ajikata.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:31.116 position:50% align:center
Our third years aren't
here due to exams.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.744 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll bear with us
because we plan to work hard.

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.037 position:50% align:center
Looking forward to it.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.788 position:50% align:center
It's gonna be great.

00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:38.916 position:50% align:center
But, um, where's Himekawa?

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.918 position:50% align:center
[KUMADA]
I'm sorry, he couldn't make it.

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.045 position:50% align:center
He had somewhere else to be.

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:46.840 position:50% align:center
He was just recruited
to join the national team.

00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:48.842 position:50% align:center
So he had to go right away.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:51.178 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
Oh, there you are!

00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:52.429 position:50% align:center
I'm Michinaga.

00:16:52.513 --> 00:16:54.598 position:50% align:center
It's our first time on
the same team, right?

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:56.558 position:50% align:center
If you need any help,
let me know.

00:16:56.642 --> 00:16:58.435 position:50% align:center
Right, but I'm the captain.

00:16:58.519 --> 00:16:59.478 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
Hello.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:01.271 position:50% align:center
Hey, you're Himekawa,
aren't you?

00:17:01.355 --> 00:17:02.898 position:50% align:center
Your things are
already here for ya.

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:04.816 position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.985 position:50% align:center
But, um, where is everyone else?

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.695 position:50% align:center
You're the first one here.

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:10.531 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO] So, listen,
we're aiming to win the world

00:17:10.614 --> 00:17:12.950 position:50% align:center
championship and it's
not gonna be easy.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.868 position:50% align:center
In order to get there,
practices will be tough,

00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:16.370 position:50% align:center
so prepare yourself.

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:17.913 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
Great. Bring it on.

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:23.418 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] Oh, hey, weren't
Terauchi and Kiriyama

00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:26.046 position:50% align:center
also both selected for
the national team?

00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:28.090 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI] Yeah, didn't
you need to go today?

00:17:28.173 --> 00:17:29.633 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] We don't start
up till next week.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.677 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I still
can't get over it.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.429 position:50% align:center
Why wasn't I chosen?
I'd kick butt on that team.

00:17:34.513 --> 00:17:37.432 position:50% align:center
The selection committee decided,
so no use whining now.

00:17:37.516 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
So not fair.

00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, don't tell me you
guys really practice

00:17:41.103 --> 00:17:42.980 position:50% align:center
in a public space for commoners!

00:17:43.063 --> 00:17:45.399 position:50% align:center
Number Two Prince?
What're you doing here?

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.359 position:50% align:center
I was just looking for Maeshima.

00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.736 position:50% align:center
I've got some very
good news for him.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
Well, what's the news about?

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.156 position:50% align:center
I happened to find
a new sponsor!

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.492 position:50% align:center
Exclusively overseas,
but it looks like I'll be able

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:57.828 position:50% align:center
to keep my promise to him.
Where is he?

00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:01.123 position:50% align:center
Maeshima is out today,
and Sasugai is, too.

00:18:05.169 --> 00:18:06.461 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Ow!

00:18:07.296 --> 00:18:09.256 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Would you focus already?

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:10.424 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I am!

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:11.842 position:50% align:center
Fine, focus more!

00:18:11.925 --> 00:18:13.260 position:50% align:center
You said you didn't
want to keep using

00:18:13.343 --> 00:18:14.803 position:50% align:center
the same move you did at finals.

00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:16.722 position:50% align:center
That's the whole reason
I rented this place.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.557 position:50% align:center
So, don't waste it!

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.725 position:50% align:center
I know, chill out.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:20.934 position:50% align:center
[door closes]

00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:25.606 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki?

00:18:25.689 --> 00:18:26.899 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
I messed up.

00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:28.609 position:50% align:center
I used to skate here a lot,
so that jerk knows

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:30.360 position:50% align:center
about this place, too.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:33.530 position:50% align:center
Wait, he's still
practicing here?

00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:36.241 position:50% align:center
So, that's how he found
out that I rented it.

00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:37.367 position:50% align:center
Can I help you?

00:18:37.451 --> 00:18:39.203 position:50% align:center
What do you want?

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:41.580 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] Your performance
at the finals was wonderful.

00:18:41.663 --> 00:18:42.831 position:50% align:center
Yeah, and?

00:18:42.915 --> 00:18:45.834 position:50% align:center
You weren't chosen to be
on the national team.

00:18:45.918 --> 00:18:47.878 position:50% align:center
What do I care about that?

00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:49.379 position:50% align:center
There's the next
Grand Prix Series

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:51.590 position:50% align:center
and the interscholastic
competition.

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:53.342 position:50% align:center
Plenty of stuff
still left to do.

00:18:55.886 --> 00:18:58.305 position:50% align:center
[laughs] If I was on the
national team, too,

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.182 position:50% align:center
I don't think I'd be able to
keep all those different

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.184 position:50% align:center
formations straight in my head.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.519 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
In your head?

00:19:03.602 --> 00:19:05.896 position:50% align:center
I thought you remembered
things with your body.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.064 position:50% align:center
Ever since you were young.

00:19:07.147 --> 00:19:08.857 position:50% align:center
That's true. Hey!

00:19:08.941 --> 00:19:11.318 position:50% align:center
I think it's about time you
take back what you said.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.445 position:50% align:center
You said I'd never be
able to beat you.

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:15.572 position:50% align:center
Sure proved that
wasn't true, didn't I?

00:19:15.656 --> 00:19:16.990 position:50% align:center
I said that at the finals?

00:19:17.074 --> 00:19:18.951 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
No, before! In fifth grade!

00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:21.995 position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:23.664 position:50% align:center
You seriously forgot?

00:19:23.747 --> 00:19:26.875 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] Back then, I thought
sooner was better than later.

00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:29.169 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:31.338 position:50% align:center
What are you trying to
be, the Chutei twins?

00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:32.464 position:50% align:center
Is Kurayoshi here?

00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:34.675 position:50% align:center
Someone do something
about this guy!

00:19:34.758 --> 00:19:35.884 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Nah.

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:38.136 position:50% align:center
I think I might know
what he's getting at.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.596 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
You can understand him?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.848 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Once in a while.

00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:42.516 position:50% align:center
He's saying back then,
you lost your parents

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:44.476 position:50% align:center
and everything familiar.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
And it happened only a short
time before that, right?

00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:48.605 position:50% align:center
When you started
swearing up and down

00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:49.857 position:50% align:center
that you'd beat him.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.316 position:50% align:center
So, I think what he meant was,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.236 position:50% align:center
"if all you want is to win,
it's your only joy,

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:56.822 position:50% align:center
then you have bigger
problems." Am I right?

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:58.073 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Is he?

00:19:58.156 --> 00:19:59.074 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Mmm.

00:19:59.157 --> 00:20:00.409 position:50% align:center
Seriously, what the heck?

00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.870 position:50% align:center
If that's what you want
to say, then just say it!

00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:05.122 position:50% align:center
Hey, why did you
come here, anyway?

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.373 position:50% align:center
Big Brother?

00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:09.835 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] I've thought
about it since finals,

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:11.587 position:50% align:center
and here's my conclusion.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.422 position:50% align:center
I could've skated your
performance better.

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.258 position:50% align:center
Huh? You told me you thought
it was wonderful!

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:17.843 position:50% align:center
But it's far from perfect.

00:20:17.926 --> 00:20:18.844 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA grunts]

00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:20.179 position:50% align:center
Oh, you think so?

00:20:20.262 --> 00:20:22.306 position:50% align:center
The beginning needs a
"nyuun," know what I mean?

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:23.849 position:50% align:center
I think a "whoo!"
there would help it

00:20:23.932 --> 00:20:25.726 position:50% align:center
connect to the next
part a lot better!

00:20:25.809 --> 00:20:27.436 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
No, you need to rein it in.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.021 position:50% align:center
At least a "swoooh."

00:20:29.104 --> 00:20:30.230 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
After that, there's a "ba-bang!"

00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:32.232 position:50% align:center
and I have to emphasize that!

00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:34.193 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] Listen, I
totally get how you feel,

00:20:34.276 --> 00:20:36.361 position:50% align:center
but you need to listen
to your body, too.

00:20:36.445 --> 00:20:37.696 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] I guess I
see what you're saying,

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.656 position:50% align:center
but without that, the
next part would be harder

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.241 position:50% align:center
to segue into.

00:20:41.325 --> 00:20:42.409 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
The footwork can help--

00:20:42.492 --> 00:20:44.286 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
That's true! Plus it looks cool.

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:45.913 position:50% align:center
--[SHINOZAKI] Or elegant?
--[MAESHIMA] Cool.

00:20:45.996 --> 00:20:47.915 position:50% align:center
--[SHINOZAKI] Harmonious?
--[MAESHIMA] I wanna be cool!

00:20:49.082 --> 00:20:51.168 position:50% align:center
Sasugai, thank you.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:53.837 position:50% align:center
You were great, and you
worked hard for the team.

00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:56.131 position:50% align:center
Thanks especially for
bringing Maeshima back.

00:20:56.215 --> 00:20:58.050 position:50% align:center
I really have no words.

00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:59.718 position:50% align:center
Take care of 'em for me.

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:04.014 position:50% align:center
Ionodai, from now on,
the next phase is all yours.

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:12.314 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful for everything
you just said, Captain.

00:21:12.397 --> 00:21:14.441 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
There you are!

00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:16.318 position:50% align:center
What the heck are
you doing out here?

00:21:16.401 --> 00:21:18.570 position:50% align:center
You took a break
without saying anything?

00:21:18.654 --> 00:21:21.073 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, I didn't want
to get in the way.

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:24.076 position:50% align:center
So? How was practicing
with Shinozaki, huh?

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.160 position:50% align:center
Did you kick his butt?

00:21:25.244 --> 00:21:26.578 position:50% align:center
Shut up. Don't be stupid.

00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:28.288 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI laughs]

00:21:28.372 --> 00:21:29.373 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right.

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:32.167 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:33.585 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] The gold medal
from the Grand Prix finals.

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:35.796 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I know that.
What about it?

00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:36.964 position:50% align:center
It's yours.

00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:38.966 position:50% align:center
I mean, half of it, anyway.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:40.509 position:50% align:center
I can't actually split it
in two, though,

00:21:40.592 --> 00:21:42.636 position:50% align:center
so it's still mine in
the physical sense.

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:44.471 position:50% align:center
I don't follow you at all.

00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:45.973 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] The only reason
I returned to the ice

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:47.724 position:50% align:center
was because you sought
me out and talked to me

00:21:47.808 --> 00:21:49.142 position:50% align:center
that day.

00:21:49.226 --> 00:21:52.312 position:50% align:center
Your strategy and routine was
what got me this medal.

00:21:52.396 --> 00:21:54.314 position:50% align:center
There's simply no denying it!

00:21:54.398 --> 00:21:56.233 position:50% align:center
I want us to keep being a team.

00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.943 position:50% align:center
That's why you
deserve half of this.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:22:01.655 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI laughs]

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:05.951 position:50% align:center
[laughing continues]

00:22:06.034 --> 00:22:07.536 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
But you can't split it, right?

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.621 position:50% align:center
That's why it's the
thought that counts.

00:22:09.705 --> 00:22:10.956 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Sure, sure.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.041 position:50% align:center
We can still fly even
higher, you know.

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:13.959 position:50% align:center
What do ya say?

00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:15.377 position:50% align:center
I say I'm in.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.172 position:50% align:center
Let's take it all the way...
to the whole wide world!

00:23:37.084 --> 00:23:38.168 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
I see.

00:23:38.252 --> 00:23:39.503 position:50% align:center
It looks like Maeshima
didn't understand

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:41.380 position:50% align:center
what I was trying to say.

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:44.216 position:50% align:center
I guess I'm pretty bad at
expressing my feelings.

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:46.844 position:50% align:center
Even if words could be used
to convey those feelings,

00:23:46.927 --> 00:23:49.179 position:50% align:center
I'll never be as good at
"real talk" as Hayato.
