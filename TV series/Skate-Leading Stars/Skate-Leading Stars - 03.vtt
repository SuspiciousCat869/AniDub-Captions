00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:16.292 align:middle
Look, you guys, we've gotta
get some practice in tonight!

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.208 align:middle
There's not much time
left before the match!

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:20.625 align:middle
We haven't even decided
on a routine yet.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:22.375 align:middle
There's nothing
for us to practice.

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:23.792 align:middle
Seriously, get a grip!

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:27.958 align:middle
Also, watch how you talk to me,
kid, or I'll crush you!

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.125 align:middle
Hey, where you goin'?

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.125 align:middle
Wait! We're not done
talking about this!

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:32.625 align:middle
[HIMEKAWA]
Sorry, practice is over.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:33.875 align:middle
What?

00:00:33.958 --> 00:00:35.208 align:middle
I mean, come on!

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:36.958 align:middle
The match is this weekend,
and I don't even know

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:39.083 align:middle
what we're supposed
to do at this point!

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:40.667 align:middle
That's right, it sure is.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.333 align:middle
Really think about
that for a second!

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.625 align:middle
Yep, that's what I'm doing.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:46.417 align:middle
We need a piece, routine,
positions, practice.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.375 align:middle
There's so much we have to do,
but nothing's been decided!

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle
Not to mention, we're up against
national semifinalists,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.708 align:middle
and if we lose,
we have to drop out!

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.125 align:middle
Well, I wouldn't worry.

00:00:55.208 --> 00:00:57.625 align:middle
Worse comes to worst,
we'll just transfer schools.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.833 align:middle
--Problem solved.
--Seriously?

00:00:59.917 --> 00:01:01.958 align:middle
The hell? Do you
even hear yourself?

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:04.417 align:middle
Here's you earlier:
"You guys, team togetherness.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.583 align:middle
Blah, blah, blah.
Team togetherness."

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.333 align:middle
Please, I was kidding.

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle
If we want to beat Shinozaki,

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.542 align:middle
then this is the best possible
team to get it done.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.292 align:middle
I won't give that up.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle
[SASUGAI gasps]

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle
Hayato.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.042 align:middle
Where are we?

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.125 align:middle
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle
I'm lost.

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.917 align:middle
Hey, has he always
been like this?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.458 align:middle
I mean, was that supposed
to be a metaphor, or what?

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:13.917 align:middle
How should I know? We've never
been close or anything.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.792 align:middle
He's always been an
annoying bastard

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:17.208 align:middle
who didn't talk much, though.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:22.083 align:middle
Transferring. I heard you
say it. What's that about?

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.625 align:middle
It's about us.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:26.167 align:middle
It doesn't have anything to do
with you, so no worries, right?

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.583 align:middle
[SHINOZAKI] I heard that
you ran away from home.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.125 align:middle
Now you're transferring?

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:33.667 align:middle
Well, it's my life. I can live
it however I want, can't I?

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.417 align:middle
Big Bro.

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.667 align:middle
So, uh, Shinozaki, guess what?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.958 align:middle
I've decided to come
back to the ice.

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle
[SHINOZAKI]
I know.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.667 align:middle
But, look,

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.458 align:middle
I don't really see it as
breaking my promise to you.

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:49.417 align:middle
The promise was about
singles, right?

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.042 align:middle
And this is skate-leading,
which is obviously different.

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:53.375 align:middle
So, um...

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:56.375 align:middle
Anyway, we'll be facing
off again, but this time--

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:58.625 align:middle
Hayato, go home, immediately.

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:00.542 align:middle
Because of what you've done,
so many people--

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:02.125 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Hey, Mr. High and Mighty,

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle
how 'bout addressing the person
who's actually speaking to you?

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.708 align:middle
I don't care how famous
you might've gotten.

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:09.458 align:middle
If you aren't careful,
someone like me

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.208 align:middle
could end up crushing you
before you knew what happened.

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:14.167 align:middle
People say that,
but the thing is,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.042 align:middle
no one's ever beaten me yet.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:18.417 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Maeshima!

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:24.333 align:middle
[KURAYOSHI]
No! Wait! Hold on!

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:26.458 align:middle
Please, wait! No! I'm sorry.

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:28.292 align:middle
I don't know what happened here,

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.958 align:middle
but he's not doing it out
of spite, I swear to you.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle
Oh! Maeshima?

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.417 align:middle
[SHINOZAKI]
Kurayoshi.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.125 align:middle
[KURAYOSHI]
I've been looking for you.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:39.417 align:middle
Sorry, guys. We'll, uh,
be on our way now.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.083 align:middle
Okay. Sorry from us,
too, I guess.

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle
Ah, damn it!

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:44.667 align:middle
What?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Ugh. Give me some time alone.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.000 align:middle
I'll be back the day
after tomorrow.

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:49.333 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?!

00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:50.708 align:middle
[SASUGAI] Make sure you
keep practicing till then.

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:51.958 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Wait just a minute!

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.417 align:middle
Also, don't get too
carried away, man.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.667 align:middle
[grunts]

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:05.375 align:middle
[KUBOTA]
Ken, you look scary.

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:08.583 align:middle
I'm annoyed by a bunch of
stuff. Shinozaki, for one.

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:10.042 align:middle
Uh. Shinozaki?

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.958 align:middle
Hurry up and eat so
we can go practice!

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:14.792 align:middle
Oh, okay. Hey, Jonouchi.

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:16.208 align:middle
[JONOUCHI]
Hey. See ya later.

00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:17.542 align:middle
We'll practice
during lunch, too,

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:19.917 align:middle
so hurry and scarf
that down, Jonouchi.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.167 align:middle
[JONOUCHI]
Tch.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.625 align:middle
Okay...

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle
[AKIMITSU] Doesn't look like
things are going so well

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.917 align:middle
with Jonouchi and Himekawa.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.042 align:middle
--Aki.
--Akimitsu to you!

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:32.958 align:middle
Or maybe "Mochizuki, sir."

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:35.875 align:middle
Underclassmen need to
show some respect.

00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle
However, I don't
actually dislike

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.917 align:middle
you and Sasugai, you know.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle
I mean, we're all on
the same team now,

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.625 align:middle
so I'd like everyone
to get along.

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle
Or at least try.

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:46.833 align:middle
Hello, Akimitsu.

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:49.167 align:middle
Wow, look at you.
So much confidence.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.708 align:middle
Uh. Look at what?

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle
Calories don't even seem to
matter to you. You're so chill.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:54.958 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.083 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Uhh...

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:03.625 align:middle
[KUBOTA] Oh, this is actually
how I've always eaten.

00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:04.708 align:middle
[MAESHIMA grumbles]

00:06:04.792 --> 00:06:07.208 align:middle
[AKIMITSU]
Okay, Maeshima. Over here!

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:10.792 align:middle
What the--?

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.333 align:middle
I'm gonna post on my page
that I'm hanging out

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:14.375 align:middle
with a cute new
underclassman today.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle
Oh, and don't worry,
because even if you drop out,

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:19.375 align:middle
the only people who look
at this are my fans anyway.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:20.625 align:middle
So, It's no biggie.

00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:22.125 align:middle
Crap, I wanna punch him.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:23.250 align:middle
No, please don't.

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.500 align:middle
[AKIMITSU]
"On this day, all my friends

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.042 align:middle
seem more remarkable than I."

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.917 align:middle
Oh, hey, I know that poem.
"My tears," um...

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle
Nope, that's not it, Ken.

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:32.292 align:middle
[MAESHIMA grunts]

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.958 align:middle
--Well, sorry!
--Ken, wait!

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:36.417 align:middle
[AKIMITSU]
At least put away your tray!

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:43.125 align:middle
[door opens]

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU]
So this is where you were.

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:47.875 align:middle
Yeah, I just needed to
finish up an assignment.

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.583 align:middle
You can do anything that's
thrown at you, can't you?

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA] Jack of all trades
and master of none, huh?

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.583 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU] No, that's
not what I was saying.

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:58.208 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA] I'm bad with
technology, for one thing.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle
Well, maybe you
should focus on this.

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:02.583 align:middle
The entry form for
the Grand Prix Series.

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:03.833 align:middle
For the members.

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:06.625 align:middle
Not yet. We'll decide
that after the match.

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:11.458 align:middle
Shima might not even be here
by then. It's hard to say.

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:13.708 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA] That one will
get what he deserves.

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:16.042 align:middle
[YUKIMITSU]
But don't you think <i>he</i> will

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.917 align:middle
say something to him first?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.667 align:middle
Words from our hero.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.250 align:middle
[grunts]

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:24.583 align:middle
Let's hurry up and
get to practice!

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:25.875 align:middle
There's no time to waste!

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.292 align:middle
Can you slow down just
a little, though?

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:30.708 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Uh.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:34.083 align:middle
Uh, hey, Terauchi.

00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:36.792 align:middle
Look, I think you're too
self-centered for this sport.

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:38.083 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?!

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:40.333 align:middle
You work out wrong and
build up too much muscle.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:42.208 align:middle
You aren't careful
about what you eat.

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:44.458 align:middle
You rely on your
feelings when you skate.

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.875 align:middle
There's no way you
can win like that.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:49.667 align:middle
We're using the routine we
skated at nationals last year,

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.792 align:middle
which we've re-staged
for three people.

00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:55.583 align:middle
Skate-leading is a team sport.

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle
So, what's your part?
What can you do for this team?

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle
If you don't grasp that concept,

00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:03.083 align:middle
then even if you
do win the match,

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:06.167 align:middle
there's no place for you on
the starting team, got it?

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.667 align:middle
Sho, wait!

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:16.333 align:middle
[SASUGAI] Yo, buddy! How's the
new practice routine going?

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:17.875 align:middle
Sasugai!

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:19.958 align:middle
Hold on, I thought you weren't
coming back until tomorrow.

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:22.125 align:middle
[SASUGAI] I finished
earlier than expected.

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:23.583 align:middle
Where are the other two?

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.125 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Himekawa practiced on his own,

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.625 align:middle
then decided when practice
was over on his own.

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.125 align:middle
[KUBOTA]
And Jonouchi said something

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.083 align:middle
about not feeling motivated.

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:33.333 align:middle
Sheesh, what the heck am I
going to do with those guys?

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:35.792 align:middle
[MAESHIMA] More importantly,
where'd you go running off to?

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:36.875 align:middle
To Osaka.

00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.625 align:middle
I can fill you in on
the details later,

00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:42.208 align:middle
but first, take a look at this.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.875 align:middle
What are you doing?

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:48.458 align:middle
Oh, nothing. Thinking
about deleting this.

00:08:48.542 --> 00:08:52.375 align:middle
I've got more likes than usual,
but I feel conflicted about it.

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:53.917 align:middle
Do whatever you want.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.042 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA] It looks like you
gave Maeshima some advice, huh?

00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle
You saw that?

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.167 align:middle
Just a hunch.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.458 align:middle
If we're smart about it,

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:04.917 align:middle
we can make some good use
of the upcoming match.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.583 align:middle
Our last year of high school...
we finally have a team

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:10.875 align:middle
that stands an actual chance
at winning nationals.

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:14.042 align:middle
But Shinozaki switched
to team skating.

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:16.292 align:middle
So the question is,
how does this team stack up

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle
against a team with him on it?

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:20.625 align:middle
This is a good litmus
test for that.

00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:22.375 align:middle
It's a scary prospect.

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:25.333 align:middle
Well then, we'll just need
to try our best to win.

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:28.042 align:middle
We will. All of us.

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle
Great! What an excellent
job, everybody!

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:35.875 align:middle
Thanks to technology,

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.167 align:middle
we can gauge how many points
this routine would get.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.042 align:middle
So let's do a little analyzing.

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle
Was there anything that bothered
you guys? Hajime? Susumu?

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:44.333 align:middle
I'm good, aren't you?

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.292 align:middle
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about it.

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:47.417 align:middle
[COACH ISHIKAWA]
All right, it sounds like

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.542 align:middle
someone's reserved
this space after us.

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.708 align:middle
Let's get outta here.

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:52.917 align:middle
[COACH ISHIKAWA]
I know they're my own kids,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.042 align:middle
but those moves
were astonishing.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:56.458 align:middle
I'm so glad they've
improved enough

00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:59.292 align:middle
to make this team
something truly special.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:02.792 align:middle
It's been a while, but we could
even win nationals again.

00:10:05.458 --> 00:10:06.792 align:middle
[BOTH grunt]

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:10.042 align:middle
[PHOTOGRAPHER 03A]
Thanks a lot for this, Kuonji.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:12.250 align:middle
The editor-in-chief
was also super excited

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:14.625 align:middle
that we could do an
exclusive on your practice.

00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:18.458 align:middle
Well, I owe an awful lot to
Mr. Terasawa. Least I could do.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:19.958 align:middle
This skating arena is even used

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:21.917 align:middle
for world championships,
isn't it?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.125 align:middle
Shinozaki's switched
to team skating now,

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:26.292 align:middle
so sadly, I've lost
some motivation.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:29.208 align:middle
I thought this would be perfect
for getting me fired up again.

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:31.292 align:middle
That's Japan's next ace for you!

00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:33.292 align:middle
[TERAUCHI] I don't remember
asking you to come.

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.292 align:middle
[HIMURO] Don't say that. Come
on, we're friends, aren't we?

00:10:36.375 --> 00:10:39.292 align:middle
I know! You can come check
out our practice next time.

00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle
[TERAUCHI]
That's not the issue here.

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:43.375 align:middle
It's the same for
you guys, right?

00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:44.958 align:middle
Your coach should get a say.

00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle
Wait, what's going on?

00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:47.625 align:middle
These are all the same teams

00:10:47.708 --> 00:10:49.667 align:middle
from last year's
Grand Prix finals.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.125 align:middle
What're they about to do?
And Shinozaki's here, too.

00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:55.208 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Sorry, sorry!

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:58.167 align:middle
Time flies when you're
practicing, am I right?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.292 align:middle
Well... wanna get started?

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:16.125 align:middle
Hm? Why are there
so many people here?

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:22.958 align:middle
Hey! Tomo!
Appreciate the heads-up.

00:11:23.042 --> 00:11:25.542 align:middle
What's that mean?
What's goin' on?

00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:27.917 align:middle
Well, it's just that,
as fate would have it,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.333 align:middle
I happen to live right next door
to Himuro from St. Clavis.

00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:34.042 align:middle
We were also on the same team
in middle school, so, uh--

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:36.083 align:middle
Okay, spit it out, what'dja do?

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:37.375 align:middle
[KUBOTA]
I'm sorry!

00:11:37.458 --> 00:11:39.208 align:middle
[SASUGAI] Next time,
at least steal some intel.

00:11:39.292 --> 00:11:40.417 align:middle
[KUBOTA]
What?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.792 align:middle
Anyway, practice isn't
open to the public.

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.208 align:middle
Sorry, but could you go?

00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:46.875 align:middle
Come on, it's not such a
big deal to let them watch.

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:49.125 align:middle
Don't you think, Shinozaki?

00:11:50.417 --> 00:11:51.875 align:middle
Is that cool?

00:11:51.958 --> 00:11:54.333 align:middle
If we kicked them out of here,
you'd be way less fired up.

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle

Just make sure to finish
before our rink time runs out.

00:12:01.708 --> 00:12:02.792 align:middle

All right! Here--

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.417 align:middle
[TERAUCHI]
Wait. That's fine.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.208 align:middle
But in exchange, our team
will be the one to go first.

00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:13.917 align:middle
If you don't like it,
you have yourself to blame.

on anyone else.

He's way too nice.

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:21.292 align:middle
Is he seriously letting Shima
and his team rest up a little

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:22.625 align:middle
since they're all sweaty?

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.083 align:middle
No, he's actually doing it

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:26.667 align:middle
so they can't complain later
when the results come in.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:30.208 align:middle
Besides, if we skate first,
the ice will only be smoother.

00:12:30.292 --> 00:12:32.417 align:middle
Well, I guess we're
leaving it at that.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle

what's at stake, right?

useful for my performance.

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:32.125 align:middle
[buzzer sounds]

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.583 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA] Hm. He's the lead.
No shock there.

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:42.625 align:middle
[music plays]

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:46.875 align:middle
Huh? He skates lead, too?

00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.625 align:middle
So they don't have a wing?

00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:50.083 align:middle
[SHINOZAKI]
No.

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:56.833 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:15:56.917 --> 00:15:58.500 align:middle
Is this really happening?

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:00.542 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Man, we had such a tough time

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:02.292 align:middle
trying to decide on positions.

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:04.083 align:middle
Everybody wanted to be lead.

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle
Technically, we'd need to have
at least one wing and one guard,

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.792 align:middle
but since this is
a three-person team,

00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:12.417 align:middle
I thought, why not
make them all leads?

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.333 align:middle
I don't think it's against
the rules or anything.

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:18.333 align:middle
[SASUGAI] I've considered having
three leads for a while now.

00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle
I'd originally wanted to keep it

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.958 align:middle
as our secret weapon
for nationals,

00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:26.042 align:middle
but after bumping into Shinozaki
that day, I changed my mind.

00:16:26.125 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle
If I'm serious
about beating him,

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:30.208 align:middle
this is no time to
be holding back.

00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:33.292 align:middle
Doesn't mean I'm glad he's
here to see it, though.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:35.417 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.292 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Uh.

00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:38.083 align:middle
Oh, crap.

00:16:44.583 --> 00:16:45.583 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle
They've increased
the difficulty.

00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:50.708 align:middle
Jonouchi and Himekawa
were late just now.

00:16:54.542 --> 00:16:56.458 align:middle
I'm not quite sure what
they were trying to do,

00:16:56.542 --> 00:16:58.458 align:middle
but whatever it was,
it didn't go as planned.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:17:02.667 align:middle
[growls] That little mongrel!
I said not to get carried away!

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.167 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
This rush of speed.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.875 align:middle
The tension of a match.
This is so freakin' fun!

00:17:07.958 --> 00:17:10.708 align:middle
[JONOUCHI] That's not how
we practiced it, you jerk!

00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:14.167 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
I can do it. I can fly!

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.000 align:middle
Bigger, faster,
and better than ever!

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:19.708 align:middle
[JONOUCHI]
Stop messing around, dude!

00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:22.375 align:middle
Ah, saved the bigger moves
for the second half

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.250 align:middle
to try and gain
more points, huh?

00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:25.792 align:middle
Come on, gimme a break.

00:17:25.875 --> 00:17:27.708 align:middle
You know that's not
what's happening here.

00:17:27.792 --> 00:17:30.917 align:middle
Impressive. The speed
and the height. Wow.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.625 align:middle
They've really kicked it up
a gear from the first half.

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:37.042 align:middle
But at this rate, is their
stamina going to hold out?

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:52.708 align:middle
Here comes that big finish! Go!

00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:03.458 align:middle
[ALL gasp]

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle
You idiot! What were you doing?

00:18:14.833 --> 00:18:17.875 align:middle
Think about your fellow
skaters once in a while!

00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:20.625 align:middle
Hey, what in the
world was that?

00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:23.375 align:middle
You took the best part for
yourself at the end, huh?

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:25.792 align:middle
Your skating's amazing!

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:30.667 align:middle
[HIMEKAWA]
It really was my best jump ever.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.458 align:middle
Was it 'cause I was challenged?

00:18:32.542 --> 00:18:36.292 align:middle
Is <i>he</i> making me
better? Is that it?

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:37.792 align:middle
And that Himekawa.

00:18:37.875 --> 00:18:40.333 align:middle
Why didn't anyone notice that
he had that kind of talent

00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:42.083 align:middle
back in middle school?

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:44.042 align:middle
The height of that last jump.

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:46.042 align:middle
He's obviously
the ace of Ionodai,

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle
and here I thought we only
had to worry about Shinozaki.

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:50.208 align:middle
[HAJIME]
No.

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:51.208 align:middle
[SUSUMU]
That's not it.

00:18:51.292 --> 00:18:52.708 align:middle
The one we need to worry about

00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:55.208 align:middle
is the guy who's always at the
center of the performance.

00:18:55.292 --> 00:18:56.583 align:middle
[SHINOZAKI]
Kensei Maeshima.

00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:58.833 align:middle
[OTHERS gasp]

00:18:58.917 --> 00:19:00.875 align:middle
[HIMURO]
That's right.

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:03.542 align:middle
Thank you, Thank you!
All right! Up top!

00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:06.542 align:middle
[SASUGAI] Didn't I tell you
not to get carried away?

00:19:06.625 --> 00:19:07.833 align:middle
Looks to me like someone needs

00:19:07.917 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle
a much stronger leash
from now on!

00:19:09.833 --> 00:19:11.542 align:middle
It turned out all
right, so it's fine!

00:19:11.625 --> 00:19:13.167 align:middle
It's the opposite
of "all right"!

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.042 align:middle
[BOTH growling]

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:16.958 align:middle
Oh, hey! Here comes the score!

00:19:21.917 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle
What the--?!

00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:24.542 align:middle
We lost?

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle
No way.

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.042 align:middle
[HIMURO] With Jonouchi's
first time as lead

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle
and Maeshima coming
off of a break,

00:19:29.833 --> 00:19:32.375 align:middle
guess they didn't score
as high as they expected.

00:19:32.458 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle
Although, if the entertainment
points from the judges

00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:36.958 align:middle
were factored into
the final score,

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:39.375 align:middle
who knows what
would've happened?

00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle
Wish you could see your faces.

00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:42.625 align:middle
See you at a match.

00:19:42.708 --> 00:19:43.625 align:middle
--[HAJIME] Coach,
--[SUSUMU] we should,

00:19:43.708 --> 00:19:44.958 align:middle
--go home, too,
--right away.

00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:46.667 align:middle
--To analyze,
--and practice.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.667 align:middle
Um, yeah, okay.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle
[COACH ISHIKAWA]
I know they're my own kids,

00:19:50.083 --> 00:19:52.000 align:middle
but it still shocks me
whenever they speak.

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle
[KUONJI]
All right, I've just decided!

00:19:53.833 --> 00:19:56.042 align:middle
I'm switching from singles
to skate-leading, too!

00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.417 align:middle
[PHOTOGRAPHER 03A]
Uh, but, why?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.958 align:middle
[KUONJI] Well, my main rival
is Shinozaki, after all.

00:20:00.042 --> 00:20:02.208 align:middle
If I really want to settle
things between us,

00:20:02.292 --> 00:20:05.042 align:middle
I can aim to be number
one with a team.

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:08.667 align:middle
The best part is,
it sounds like a real blast!

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.458 align:middle
Looks like the prince is ready
to head home. I'm out, too.

00:20:12.542 --> 00:20:13.875 align:middle
[ADACHI]
'Kay. Later.

00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:15.875 align:middle
[MIURA] You've got a
pretty good team there.

00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:19.000 align:middle
Don't you think it might be
fun to actually train them?

00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:32.417 align:middle
So, okay, about that deal

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.250 align:middle
regarding Maeshima and
Sasugai dropping out?

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:37.750 align:middle
[TERAUCHI sighs]

00:20:37.833 --> 00:20:40.125 align:middle
See ya tomorrow. Don't be late.

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle
Uh, does that mean--?

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.417 align:middle
[AKIMITSU]
What?

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.667 align:middle
You're still letting them join
up even though we won?

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.833 align:middle
That's what the
captain decided.

00:20:47.917 --> 00:20:50.583 align:middle
But I want you to
know I hate you.

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:51.875 align:middle
You're only being
allowed to join

00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:53.833 align:middle
because Terauchi
acknowledged you.

00:20:53.917 --> 00:20:55.458 align:middle
If you dare to
cause trouble again,

00:20:55.542 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle
you'll be removed on the spot.

00:20:57.833 --> 00:20:59.292 align:middle
That's you being a sore loser.

00:20:59.375 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle
What was that?

00:21:00.583 --> 00:21:01.958 align:middle
[JONOUCHI] I've got your
back, Kiriyama, sir!

00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:02.667 align:middle
Thank you.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle
Yeah, me, too, totally.

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:04.917 align:middle
[MAESHIMA]
Didn't you say you wanted

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.625 align:middle
to get along the other day?

00:21:06.708 --> 00:21:08.208 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:21:08.292 --> 00:21:11.458 align:middle
It feels just like I'm back in
the club from elementary school.

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:13.875 align:middle
[KIRIYAMA] That is
definitely not the case.

00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:22.417 align:middle
This is weird, Sasu.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.917 align:middle
I was looking for your name
to register you for the club,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.792 align:middle
but you're not in the registry.

00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle
You don't happen to know
the reason for that, do you?

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.417 align:middle
And tell the truth.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.458 align:middle
[SASUGAI]
Ah? 'Course I'm not there.

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.792 align:middle
I haven't officially
transferred here yet.

00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:35.958 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:37.292 align:middle
Which means, that bet
about dropping out

00:21:37.375 --> 00:21:38.667 align:middle
of school was just--

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.458 align:middle
It's so much paperwork
to transfer twice, you know?

00:21:41.542 --> 00:21:43.625 align:middle
That's why I left
it all until now.

00:21:43.708 --> 00:21:45.208 align:middle
But man, I panicked a little

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:48.208 align:middle
when Maeshima said he'd
drop out along with me.

00:21:48.292 --> 00:21:49.667 align:middle
Are you insane?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.042 align:middle
[SASUGAI] It's all right,
it turned out fine!

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:53.542 align:middle
No, it's not "all right"!

00:21:54.583 --> 00:21:55.750 align:middle
[BOYS]
Good morning!

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:57.292 align:middle
Hey.

00:21:57.375 --> 00:22:00.500 align:middle
Sorry, Coach, but Himekawa
hasn't gotten here yet.

00:22:00.583 --> 00:22:03.125 align:middle
[ADACHI]
Oh, about Himekawa.

00:22:03.208 --> 00:22:05.833 align:middle
He decided to withdraw
from the school.

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:38.417 align:middle
[HIMURO]
Kurayoshi.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.417 align:middle
[KURAYOSHI]
What is it, Captain Himuro?

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.458 align:middle
[HIMURO]
Can you talk to Shinozaki?

00:23:40.542 --> 00:23:41.833 align:middle
[KURAYOSHI]
Yeah, why do you ask?

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:44.167 align:middle
[HIMURO] Okay. You're in
charge of him, then.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.792 align:middle
Stay with him at all times and
try to keep him out of trouble.

00:23:46.875 --> 00:23:49.792 align:middle
I can't do it. Kurayoshi,
it's all up to you.

00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:50.917 align:middle
[KURAYOSHI]
That's mean.
