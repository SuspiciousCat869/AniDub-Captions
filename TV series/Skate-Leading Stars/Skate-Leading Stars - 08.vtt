[SASUGAI] After fighting
hard and overcoming tons

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.767 position:50% align:center
of obstacles, the Ionodai
skate-leading team

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.894 position:50% align:center
finally came together,
thanks to me,

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.272 position:50% align:center
the brilliant Hayato Sasugai.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.399 position:50% align:center
Granted, some might
disagree on that point,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:25.984 position:50% align:center
but they would be wrong.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:27.736 position:50% align:center
Now, it's just a matter of
competing against

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.279 position:50% align:center
their past selves.

00:00:29.362 --> 00:00:30.989 position:50% align:center
But it takes a cool head
to keep focused

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.907 position:50% align:center
on that goal, which is
gonna be a challenge

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.784 position:50% align:center
for one skater in particular.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:38.121 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA panting]

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.502 position:50% align:center
All right! One more time!

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.546 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Nope. No more times.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.555 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow's just the fourth
competition of the series,

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:57.349 position:50% align:center
so you've gotta
conserve your energy.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.850 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I can't sit still.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.144 position:50% align:center
If I don't move,
I'll be like "ahh!"

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.604 position:50% align:center
and totally freak out!

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.731 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Channel that feeling
into the competition.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:08.068 position:50% align:center
Which includes resting
your body so you don't die.

--I can't sleep.
--You have to.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:11.321 position:50% align:center
Take a warm bath,
and when you get out,

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.947 position:50% align:center
use stretching and
massage to get rid of

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:14.407 position:50% align:center
the lactic acid buildup.

00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:17.202 position:50% align:center
And eat foods high
in vitamins B1 or B2,

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.037 position:50% align:center
but keep the portions
small for now.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.121 position:50% align:center

how many toes.

In the front and
the back, it isn't.

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:35.512 position:50% align:center
But that's an octopus
so it has four blue toes.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.514 position:50% align:center
Don't forget to vacuum though.

sheets for that, check.

you're using enough toner?

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:56.950 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
Yeah, I think it's fine.

a crap about stuff

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:02.580 position:50% align:center

you be playing?

[ANNOUNCER B] We're here
at the fourth competition

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.846 position:50% align:center
of the Boys' High
School Skate-Leading

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:24.723 position:50% align:center
Grand Prix Series.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.891 position:50% align:center
All the teams have completed
their short programs

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:29.352 position:50% align:center
and now we're enjoying
a brief intermission.

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.230 position:50% align:center
The following are the results
from those short programs: 

00:04:32.313 --> 00:04:35.233 position:50% align:center
In first place is
St. Clavis Gakuin.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
Their impressive
strength has kept them

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.737 position:50% align:center
in the top spot, once again.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.739 position:50% align:center
In second is last year's
fourth-place winner,

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:42.490 position:50% align:center
Ionodai High.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.742 position:50% align:center
With their carefree performance,

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.660 position:50% align:center
they nabbed their
best score ever,

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.038 position:50% align:center
quickly closing in on
the first-place team.

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.581 position:50% align:center
Wow. Interesting.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.915 position:50% align:center
Quite a point difference
between them

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.167 position:50% align:center
and the next two schools.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.169 position:50% align:center
I wonder how this
will all play out.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.420 position:50% align:center
--Ms. Abe--
--Yes?

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.380 position:50% align:center
With the only thing
left being free skate,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:58.923 position:50% align:center
I'm curious,
what would you predict

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.383 position:50% align:center
will happen next?

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:01.718 position:50% align:center
So hard to say!

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:03.428 position:50% align:center
But while I fully expect
that all the schools

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.597 position:50% align:center
will fight hard
until the bitter end,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.766 position:50% align:center
in this case, I think
it's pretty safe to say

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:10.268 position:50% align:center
that St. Clavis Gakuin
and Ionodai High

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.146 position:50% align:center
will be the top two finishers
of the fourth competition.

[SASUGAI]
Hey, Mr. Smug!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
Aren't you forgetting
to thank the person

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.942 position:50% align:center
who carried your
butt home last night?

be the same, you know.

Look, I'm sorry about that!

[KUMADA] Izumi, FYI, the match
between your old teammates

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.749 position:50% align:center
and Shinozaki's team
has already started.

Feel free to go watch
it if you'd like.

I can watch the recording.

Are you really this indifferent?

[KUONJI]
Oh, Himekawa!

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.344 position:50% align:center
Aw, there's no need to be
so cold, now, is there?

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.555 position:50% align:center
Besides, it's very unattractive
to hide your emotions.

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.057 position:50% align:center
Wouldn't you agree?

[KOGAHARA SKATER C]
He's really here?

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.189 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] I was in the area
on location for a TV show,

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.982 position:50% align:center
so I thought I'd drop in.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:05:59.401 position:50% align:center
Did he make an appointment?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:00.902 position:50% align:center
Not that I know of, no.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.112 position:50% align:center
Come on, Himekawa.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.947 position:50% align:center
Let's go watch this match
between Maeshima

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
and Shinozaki and decide
whether it's destiny

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:08.076 position:50% align:center
or just another opening act.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:11.246 position:50% align:center
Let me take you to a nice
little Japanese cafe nearby.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.039 position:50% align:center
There's so much I want
to talk about with you.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.249 position:50% align:center
Wait, why on earth should I--

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.750 position:50% align:center
Sounds like a good plan.

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.127 position:50% align:center
You should go with him.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.586 position:50% align:center
You're far too tense
for your own good

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.629 position:50% align:center
right now.

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.006 position:50% align:center
Go and see if he
can teach you how

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:22.632 position:50% align:center
to unwind and relax a little.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:23.842 position:50% align:center
You can't be serious!

This Yokohama guy?
I refuse to acce--

00:06:26.136 --> 00:06:27.554 position:50% align:center
[KUMADA] If you ditch and
go home instead,

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
I'll take you off
the starting roster.

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.599 position:50% align:center
It looks like you've
got permission.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.852 position:50% align:center
Come on, let's go,
"Princess River."

00:06:33.935 --> 00:06:35.437 position:50% align:center
Don't ever call me that.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.063 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:44.904 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] It looks like
they've begun smoothing

00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:48.867 position:50% align:center
the ice back down for
the upcoming free skate.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.076 position:50% align:center
So, while we have a moment,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.162 position:50% align:center
let's look back at
St. Clavis Gakuin

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.706 position:50% align:center
and Ionodai High's
short programs.

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
First, what's your
general impression

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.418 position:50% align:center
of the two schools, Ms. Abe?

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.129 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] Well, I'm sure
St. Clavis needs no explanation.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.964 position:50% align:center
They've been called an
unbeatable powerhouse,

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:06.343 position:50% align:center
and true to form, they've
been steady and reliable.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.470 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki's teamwork
is better than expected,

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.472 position:50% align:center
given his history
competing in singles,

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:13.933 position:50% align:center
so their line-up is full of
strong skaters this year.

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:15.477 position:50% align:center
They're one or two
rungs above the schools

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.688 position:50% align:center
they're competing against,
and that's all there is to it.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:20.690 position:50% align:center
But just like in their
previous competition,

00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.567 position:50% align:center
the entertainment aspect
seems difficult

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.527 position:50% align:center
for Shinozaki, so they
didn't gain as many

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.154 position:50% align:center
points as expected.

00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:29.240 position:50% align:center
True, but it's still a pretty
high score, regardless.

00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:31.451 position:50% align:center
What about Ionodai High School?

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
Compared to their performance

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:33.912 position:50% align:center
in the first competition,

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:35.997 position:50% align:center
they feel a little surer
and more stable.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.374 position:50% align:center
They've added this
wild edginess...

00:07:37.457 --> 00:07:39.000 position:50% align:center
Hey, why're you streaming this?

[HAJIME] I don't want to
go out there, do you?

00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:47.842 position:50% align:center
No, who wants to
watch the others?

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:49.302 position:50% align:center
[BOTH laugh]

00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:51.096 position:50% align:center
Right! Exactly my point.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.347 position:50% align:center
Maybe just the best teams.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.682 position:50% align:center
Very well.

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.309 position:50% align:center
I'll let you know when the
top-ranking teams skate.

00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
He could tell what
they were saying?

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.354 position:50% align:center
Well, he is their father.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.820 position:50% align:center
Pretty good pics, right?

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.196 position:50% align:center
Yeah, they are.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Keep it up, and tell the
others to do the same thing.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:11.449 position:50% align:center
You got it.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.326 position:50% align:center
You should go eat now,
while you can.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.870 position:50% align:center
The free skate is quite a bit
longer than the short program.

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:16.955 position:50% align:center
Good call.

00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
Second. Not a bad start at all.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.421 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Right now,
the three teams going first

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:27.257 position:50% align:center
are in the bottom rink for
their six-minute practice.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.175 position:50% align:center
Ours will start
after that, but...

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.135 position:50% align:center
Wait.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.970 position:50% align:center
Where'd Maeshima run off to?

00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:32.846 position:50% align:center
Who knows?

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.264 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
You idiot!

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.099 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] He was dancing
around the basement levels,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.475 position:50% align:center
so I brought him back up.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
Look how you trashed
your costume!

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:41.312 position:50% align:center
Hurry and take it off,
then sit down!

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.148 position:50% align:center
What's going on? Wow.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:44.357 position:50% align:center
Doesn't sound good.

00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.484 position:50% align:center
--Tomo, come help me!
--[KUBOTA] Right!

00:08:46.568 --> 00:08:48.278 position:50% align:center
What in the world
were you thinking?

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:50.655 position:50% align:center
Wearing yourself out
before you go on.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.824 position:50% align:center
We've got barely any time left!

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.325 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I'm resting now, jeez.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.201 position:50% align:center
Get the hair dryer.

00:08:55.285 --> 00:08:56.619 position:50% align:center
Yep, on it.

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.329 position:50% align:center
Do you feel any remorse at all
for what you've done?

00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.539 position:50% align:center
Calm down.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.667 position:50% align:center
Maeshima, what were you doing?

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:04.002 position:50% align:center
I was practicing.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.379 position:50% align:center
You have to be careful.
Don't overdo it like that.

00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.465 position:50% align:center
I know, and I'm sorry.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.091 position:50% align:center
Although, you're not
a serious skater

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:12.302 position:50% align:center
if you don't give it your all.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.095 position:50% align:center
I just want to push
myself as close

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:17.265 position:50% align:center
to my limit as I can,
'cause I had that break.

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:19.184 position:50% align:center
But I'm sorry for
causing Yuki trouble.

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:20.727 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
It's fine, just be quiet.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.563 position:50% align:center
Our strategy is what I told
you in the meeting yesterday.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:24.939 position:50% align:center
You all remember
the changes we made

00:09:25.023 --> 00:09:27.192 position:50% align:center
--to the routine, right?
--[TERAUCHI] Yes, sir.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
That's the untamed horse
everyone's talking about.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.321 position:50% align:center
The rumors are right,
throwing his team

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:33.531 position:50% align:center
into chaos right before a skate.

00:09:33.615 --> 00:09:34.741 position:50% align:center
What's it matter?

00:09:34.824 --> 00:09:36.034 position:50% align:center
I mean, everyone
has their own way

00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.411 position:50% align:center
of getting and
staying motivated.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.829 position:50% align:center
Plus, the way you're talking,

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:41.539 position:50% align:center
it could end up leading
you to underestimate

00:09:41.623 --> 00:09:43.083 position:50% align:center
your opponent.

00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.168 position:50% align:center
Don't be distracted by others.

00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.419 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA, MICHINAGA]
Yes, sir!

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.672 position:50% align:center
[CROWD chattering]

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:50.465 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Thanks for your patience.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
We will now begin the free skate

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.385 position:50% align:center
of the fourth competition
of the Boys'

00:09:53.468 --> 00:09:55.887 position:50% align:center
High School Skate-Leading
Grand Prix Series.

00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.266 position:50% align:center
Skating first is Kusano
Mukaibara High School

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.393 position:50% align:center
of Fukushima.

00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.562 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:15.532 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Now for the
triple Lutz, and there it is.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.409 position:50% align:center
This café's amazing
because their desserts

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:19.911 position:50% align:center
are seriously good
despite being low-cal.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:21.705 position:50% align:center
Athletes can eat without fear.

00:10:21.788 --> 00:10:24.791 position:50% align:center
I always make them let me
come when I'm in the area.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:29.421 position:50% align:center
Thanks for visiting
us again, Noa.

00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.881 position:50% align:center
Well, I always look forward
to seeing your face, ma'am.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.508 position:50% align:center
[PROPRIETRESS A]
Oh, you charmer.

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.510 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] Aren't we here
to watch the competition?

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.220 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course we'll watch it!

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.140 position:50% align:center
But I also wanted
to talk to you.

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:42.058 position:50% align:center
Anyway, you know what
they always say.

00:10:42.142 --> 00:10:44.519 position:50% align:center
Talks over food close
emotional distance.

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:45.812 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.022 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
What'll ya have?

00:10:47.105 --> 00:10:48.940 position:50% align:center
I recommend the
<i>anmitsu</i> set here.

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.817 position:50% align:center
--Water.
--Two <i>anmitsu</i> sets, please!

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.152 position:50% align:center
[PROPRIETRESS A]
Coming right up!

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:54.612 position:50% align:center
By the way, what's your
favorite food, in general?

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:55.697 position:50% align:center
Water.

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:03.371 position:50% align:center
[MIURA]
Let's see, uh...

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.832 position:50% align:center
I'll take one of these
clam rice bentos, please.

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.044 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] We're now in the
second half of the free skate.

00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
Kanazawa Nishiizumi
Kogei did their best,

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.715 position:50% align:center
but didn't earn as many
points as they'd hoped.

00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.258 position:50% align:center
They're currently
fourth overall.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:16.551 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] Their
mistakes in the second half

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.470 position:50% align:center
sure cost them, didn't they?

00:11:18.553 --> 00:11:20.221 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Only two schools left.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.973 position:50% align:center
The next up is
Ionodai High School,

00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.683 position:50% align:center
who placed second
in the short program.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.921 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
Very nice.

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
They're so in sync!

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.478 position:50% align:center
They're showing us
the same stability

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:10.480 position:50% align:center
they had in the short program.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:11.398 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
You're right.

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:13.149 position:50% align:center
But it's about to get harder.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.401 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
That's so true.

00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:16.277 position:50% align:center
It's no small feat for
anyone to keep up

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.571 position:50% align:center
with Maeshima's dynamic
style out there.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:24.619 position:50% align:center
No small feat,
and it doesn't show

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:26.579 position:50% align:center
in their faces, but frankly,

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.039 position:50% align:center
it still looks like it's
taking everything

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.041 position:50% align:center
they've got to make it happen.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.501 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] You can totally
see what that wild card

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:33.169 position:50% align:center
of theirs is feeling, though.

00:12:33.253 --> 00:12:35.338 position:50% align:center
You can tell he's
desperate to win.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:38.800 position:50% align:center
Baring emotion can give momentum
to any performance.

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.970 position:50% align:center
You're right. And judges like
to reward passion like that.

00:12:42.053 --> 00:12:44.347 position:50% align:center
It can be easy to cross
the line, though.

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:45.890 position:50% align:center
If he doesn't learn
how to control himself

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.809 position:50% align:center
and his feelings, fast,

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:50.061 position:50% align:center
it'll end up like
the first competition:

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.022 position:50% align:center
They'll fall. Just watch.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.902 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Emotional control?

00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.487 position:50% align:center
What's that?

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:01.531 position:50% align:center
The guy's not a
very good student.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.827 position:50% align:center
I know I'm not
really one to talk,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.246 position:50% align:center
but Maeshima's working hard
'cause he wants to win.

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.749 position:50% align:center
Understand that much.

00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.167 position:50% align:center
You should be
encouraging him to skate

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.501 position:50% align:center
with everything he's got,

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.254 position:50% align:center
not asking him to make
himself smaller for you.

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.298 position:50% align:center
Yeah.
We're gonna back him up.

00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:20.425 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
No, don't do that.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:23.053 position:50% align:center
If you think of it that way,
you'll make yourself small.

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.263 position:50% align:center
You should rise up to meet him.

00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.432 position:50% align:center
You came to make Himuro
taste bitter defeat,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.475 position:50% align:center
isn't that right?

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.101 position:50% align:center
This is your chance, guys.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.732 position:50% align:center
Fine, I guess we'll at least
hear you out on this.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.692 position:50% align:center
Every member of this
team should already have

00:13:37.776 --> 00:13:40.028 position:50% align:center
the necessary technique
to keep up with him.

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.363 position:50% align:center
Don't you agree, Coach?

00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.824 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah. I taught you that.

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.618 position:50% align:center
Whatever.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.661 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Please. Vice Captain.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.997 position:50% align:center
If you can stick with
Maeshima and let him lead,

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:52.332 position:50% align:center
the whole performance
will improve,

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:54.250 position:50% align:center
and it'll stand out
to the judges.

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
Also gives the wing
and guards more room.

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:57.879 position:50% align:center
Easier said than done.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:13:59.214 position:50% align:center
I believe in you.

00:13:59.297 --> 00:14:01.007 position:50% align:center
Except you totally don't.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.384 position:50% align:center
Hey, now, have
I ever lied to you

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
at a time like this?

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.388 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Jonouchi!

00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:07.555 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI yelps]

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.391 position:50% align:center
D'jyou lose some sleep
gaming last night?

00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:10.850 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
No way, I swear!

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.811 position:50% align:center
I could tell in the
short program.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:13.978 position:50% align:center
Don't sweat it, though.

00:14:14.062 --> 00:14:15.522 position:50% align:center
They say being a little
tired can actually

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.899 position:50% align:center
enhance your
performance at times.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.109 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Really?

00:14:19.192 --> 00:14:21.528 position:50% align:center
It'd be cool to say
"I removed my limiter,"

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:22.779 position:50% align:center
wouldn't you agree?

00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:26.825 position:50% align:center
Heck yeah!

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:28.326 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Pulled it outta my butt.

00:14:30.662 --> 00:14:32.247 position:50% align:center
What's wrong?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.331 position:50% align:center
Do your best.

00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:34.874 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
At what?

00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:36.126 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Go.

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:38.253 position:50% align:center
Seize the victory with
everything you've got.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:41.006 position:50% align:center
That's what this
team's all about!

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.340 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I'm gonna win!

00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.092 position:50% align:center
--[TERAUCHI] I'm gonna win!
--[KIRIYAMA] Win it.

00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:45.969 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
I'm so freakin' cool!

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.684 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] They did it!
All five landed it cleanly!

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.020 position:50% align:center
Oh, wow, my first
time seeing this.

00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:56.354 position:50% align:center
Yeah, mine too.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.189 position:50% align:center
It's like they're shouting
with their whole bodies.

00:14:58.273 --> 00:15:00.191 position:50% align:center
Sho and the others are so cool!

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.110 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] Stop getting all
excited, you guys,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.528 position:50% align:center
it doesn't help.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:07.032 position:50% align:center
I mean, if you do that,
then I'll just want to win, too!

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.783 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Skate-leading
performances are sometimes

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:11.411 position:50% align:center
called "group dancing,"
but I've never seen a routine

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.830 position:50% align:center
fit that description
quite like this!

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.670 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:15:20.754 --> 00:15:21.755 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
They did it!

00:15:21.838 --> 00:15:23.089 position:50% align:center
They really did it!

00:15:23.173 --> 00:15:24.841 position:50% align:center
Ionodai High did not
let the results

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
of the first competition
haunt them.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.345 position:50% align:center
They gave a
breathtaking performance

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.472 position:50% align:center
that proved how
amazing they are!

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:42.650 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
There it is!

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:45.403 position:50% align:center
With a total score of 138.48,

00:15:45.487 --> 00:15:48.073 position:50% align:center
they've got the highest
scores in this competition!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.408 position:50% align:center
They've shot themselves
straight up to the top!

00:15:50.492 --> 00:15:52.494 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] That's because
they didn't make any mistakes,

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:54.329 position:50% align:center
each skater earned
every point he could,

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:56.456 position:50% align:center
and they really leaned
into the artistry!

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:58.583 position:50% align:center
I think even St. Clavis
will have a hard time

00:15:58.667 --> 00:15:59.876 position:50% align:center
beating this score.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.671 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki!
Well, did you see us skate?

00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.756 position:50% align:center
[chuckles]
This thing is totally ours.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.591 position:50% align:center
You haven't changed at all.

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:09.511 position:50% align:center
I'll tell you one more time.

00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.471 position:50% align:center
You will never be
able to beat me,

00:16:11.554 --> 00:16:13.640 position:50% align:center
no matter how much you
think you've progressed.

00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.935 position:50% align:center
In fact, you're
actually regressing.

00:16:17.018 --> 00:16:18.269 position:50% align:center
Hey, what are you doing?

00:16:18.353 --> 00:16:19.688 position:50% align:center
Stop, Maeshima!

00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:21.314 position:50% align:center
You're a little jerk.

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:23.608 position:50% align:center
Looking down on me, always!

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:24.651 position:50% align:center
Careful.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.486 position:50% align:center
We may feel the
need to report you.

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
Sorry about this, for real.
Apologize.

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.658 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] There's no
need for that, is there?

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.035 position:50% align:center
You insulted us first,
don't forget.

00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:36.371 position:50% align:center
Besides, if we were
to get suspended,

00:16:36.454 --> 00:16:39.040 position:50% align:center
you'd be pretty disappointed,
too, wouldn't you?

00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:40.709 position:50% align:center
Mr. Shinozaki.

00:16:43.003 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
Oh, no, don't worry.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:45.714 position:50% align:center
We're happy to
compete against you

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.132 position:50% align:center
fair and square.

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.559 position:50% align:center
Captain, we're still going
with the plan, right?

00:16:57.642 --> 00:16:59.894 position:50% align:center
That's right.
I'm counting on you two.

00:16:59.978 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
You bet. Let's do it.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:06.401 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] It's time
for the final performance

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:09.029 position:50% align:center
of the fourth competition
in this series.

00:17:09.112 --> 00:17:10.488 position:50% align:center
Which means we
can stop wondering

00:17:10.572 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
what the favorite to win
will show us today!

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:14.784 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.835 position:50% align:center
Uh...

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.003 position:50% align:center
The music is different,

00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.672 position:50% align:center
but it's the same
choreography as Ionodai!

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:29.257 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
Shinozaki is their only lead,

00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.968 position:50% align:center
but they've obviously changed
up their entire routine!

00:17:35.555 --> 00:17:36.848 position:50% align:center
Is this a coincidence?

00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:38.183 position:50% align:center
Of course it isn't.

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:41.019 position:50% align:center
To be able to change
this much last minute.

00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:42.687 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
In contrast to Ionodai,

00:17:42.771 --> 00:17:44.481 position:50% align:center
who used their
passion and power,

00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:46.524 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis's performance
is so fluid!

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:48.026 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Looks like
they've gone back to their

00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.486 position:50% align:center
original routine.

00:17:49.569 --> 00:17:51.363 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
That Shinozaki may be quiet,

00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:54.824 position:50% align:center
but it's becoming clear
he's fiercely competitive.

00:17:54.908 --> 00:17:57.494 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA] Wait, we're
changing the routine?

00:17:57.577 --> 00:18:00.747 position:50% align:center
Just the opening.
We'll do what Ionodai did.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.624 position:50% align:center
But why do you wanna do that?

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.167 position:50% align:center
What, did they set you off?

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:07.879 position:50% align:center
You're good enough
to handle this.

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
Like all of us are.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:10.924 position:50% align:center
One of our later
elements will come

00:18:11.007 --> 00:18:12.217 position:50% align:center
at the beginning now,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.135 position:50% align:center
so we'll make that
adjustment, too.

00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:16.971 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] I mean,
we probably can, but still.

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:18.723 position:50% align:center
I'm down. Let's do it.

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:19.724 position:50% align:center
Captain?

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:20.892 position:50% align:center
I think it's smart.

00:18:20.975 --> 00:18:22.560 position:50% align:center
You saw how they skated today.

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:24.020 position:50% align:center
If they keep that up,
we can expect them

00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.773 position:50% align:center
to continue getting high scores.

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
Left alone,
they might become more

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:30.068 position:50% align:center
of a nuisance than we'd like.

00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.154 position:50% align:center
That's why, now,
we've got to crush them.

00:18:33.238 --> 00:18:36.366 position:50% align:center
We'll make sure they know
who the champions are.

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.243 position:50% align:center
That sound good, Shinozaki?

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:44.082 position:50% align:center
I was surprised at first
when he suggested it,

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:45.959 position:50% align:center
but it shows how
conscious Shinozaki is

00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:47.669 position:50% align:center
of Maeshima's power.

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:48.628 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA]
It's true.

00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.797 position:50% align:center
Ionodai really did perform well.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.716 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
But we can't lose this.

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.801 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI] Our goal is
to win twice in a row.

00:18:54.884 --> 00:18:56.720 position:50% align:center
To not let anyone
else take the top.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:58.304 position:50% align:center
A complete victory!

00:18:58.388 --> 00:19:00.181 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Our foundation is better.

00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:02.350 position:50% align:center
We've put in the
necessary practice.

00:19:02.434 --> 00:19:04.352 position:50% align:center
You guys may have
the raw materials,

00:19:04.436 --> 00:19:06.312 position:50% align:center
but we've got the polish.

00:19:06.396 --> 00:19:09.607 position:50% align:center
We're the protagonists
here, not you!

00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:13.695 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Watch. Watch. Watch!

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.615 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Watch me!

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.956 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Wait a minute,
did Shinozaki just land

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.791 position:50% align:center
a quadruple Axel?

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.419 position:50% align:center
People, this is what a
champion looks like!

00:19:32.213 --> 00:19:34.215 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Unbelievable!

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:39.721 position:50% align:center
Not a single mistake!

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:42.098 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis just gave a
picture-perfect performance

00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.641 position:50% align:center
we won't forget!

00:19:43.725 --> 00:19:45.727 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
All I can say is "Wow!"

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.312 position:50% align:center
It was simply amazing!

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.022 position:50% align:center
But let's see-- have they
managed to score

00:19:49.105 --> 00:19:51.107 position:50% align:center
higher than the Ionodai team?

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:01.743 position:50% align:center
Hey, where you running off to?

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:02.869 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
Practice.

00:20:02.952 --> 00:20:04.454 position:50% align:center
You're not gonna
wait for the results?

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:05.789 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
I don't care about the results.

00:20:05.872 --> 00:20:07.165 position:50% align:center
I'll pay you back later.

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:10.001 position:50% align:center
You're an impatient one, huh?

00:20:10.085 --> 00:20:11.753 position:50% align:center
Thanks, Ma'am. Check, please.

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:13.171 position:50% align:center
Coming up.

00:20:16.216 --> 00:20:18.009 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] I won't let those
guys be the only ones

00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:19.886 position:50% align:center
fired up, damn it!

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.137 position:50% align:center
Think we should practice more?

00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.222 position:50% align:center
Yeah, let's go.

00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:23.807 position:50% align:center
That was actually
pretty impressive.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.018 position:50% align:center
It's true, you know, only
practice makes perfect.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.395 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Now, the moment of truth!

00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:33.066 position:50% align:center
Their total is 139.65!

00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.943 position:50% align:center
They've ranked even
higher than Ionodai's

00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:37.237 position:50% align:center
best score of the series,
and with that,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.864 position:50% align:center
they win first place at
the fourth competition!

00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:41.783 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis Gakuin!

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:42.992 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
It's incredible.

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.370 position:50% align:center
I've never seen such
high-level competition!

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.913 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
With this, St. Clavis now has

00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
two consecutive
wins in the series,

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:50.625 position:50% align:center
and they've managed
to stay on top for every

00:20:50.709 --> 00:20:52.961 position:50% align:center
competition they've
skated in so far!

00:20:53.044 --> 00:20:54.462 position:50% align:center
A nice, solid record
to take them

00:20:54.546 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
on their way to two
consecutive wins

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.757 position:50% align:center
at nationals!

00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.516 position:50% align:center
This is all part of
your calculations,

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.684 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna assume?

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:21:09.019 --> 00:21:10.937 position:50% align:center
It's actually even higher
than I predicted.

00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:13.606 position:50% align:center
It'll come down to
the Grand Prix finals.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.150 position:50% align:center

I acknowledge your
persistence to win

00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.403 position:50% align:center
and your hard work.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
However...

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.282 position:50% align:center
Don't push yourself too hard.

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.410 position:50% align:center
Thanks.

[MAESHIMA]
I've grasped it. That rush.

00:21:33.543 --> 00:21:34.836 position:50% align:center
I loved the way that felt!

00:21:34.919 --> 00:21:36.254 position:50% align:center
Yeah, same.

00:21:36.338 --> 00:21:39.049 position:50% align:center
At the very least, it felt a lot
better than last year.

00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:40.300 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Think about it.

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:42.844 position:50% align:center
Your hard work produced
future possibilities.

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:45.597 position:50% align:center
Keep that up and who knows
what you'll accomplish.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.390 position:50% align:center
All right.

00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:48.850 position:50% align:center
Let's do this, then!

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:50.018 position:50% align:center
Go all the way!

00:21:50.101 --> 00:21:51.436 position:50% align:center
I know we can!

00:23:37.125 --> 00:23:38.543 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
I'm Michinaga from St. Clavis!

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:40.795 position:50% align:center
--And this guy's Yamashita.
--[YAMASHITA] Yup.

00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:42.005 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
We're older than Shinozaki,

00:23:42.088 --> 00:23:43.882 position:50% align:center
but it's still hard
to talk to him.

00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:45.550 position:50% align:center
Kurayoshi helps us out, though!

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:46.801 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA]
Yup.

00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:48.178 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] Hey, are you
really okay sounding

00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:49.429 position:50% align:center
like a dork?

00:23:49.512 --> 00:23:50.680 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA] Wait, are we
taking this seriously?
