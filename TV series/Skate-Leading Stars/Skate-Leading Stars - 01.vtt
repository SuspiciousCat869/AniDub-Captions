[CROWD cheering]

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:21.250
[MAESHIMA]
Hey!

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:25.709
Look. I just...

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.875
I just want you to hear this!

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:32.667
If I lose to you today,
I'll quit figure skating!

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.542
I really mean that! I swear it!

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:42.709
[ANNOUNCER A] It's the All-Japan
Novice Championships!

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:44.792
The skater on the ice
right now is fifth grader,

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.333
Kensei Maeshima!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.500
[CROWD cheering]

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.875
[F COMMENTATOR A] He landed
that double axel beautifully.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:12.166
Well done.
He should be proud.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.792
[ANNOUNCER A] Reo Shinozaki
currently has a healthy lead,

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.542
but Maeshima could still
turn the tables on him!

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:21.041
Maeshima's parents,
who were also his coaches

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:22.792
and former pro-skaters
themselves,

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.417
were tragically lost in a
car accident two months ago.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.083
He's overcome quite
a lot to be here.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.041
[COMMENTATOR A] It's notable
that in past championships,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:32.583
he's always been edged
out by Shinozaki.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.375
He seems more determined
than ever before

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.583
if we can judge by his
performance here today.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.041
[MAESHIMA]
Grandma. Grandpa.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.625
I'm sorry for making you
anxious about me.

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.333
But, if I finally
nab first place,

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.000
that should help you relax!

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:48.667
And I'll get to skate more!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.750
[CROWD cheering]

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:01.041
[COMMENTATOR A]
He landed every jump perfectly.

00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.083
We can expect solid marks.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:05.959
[ANNOUNCER A]
Let's see! Any moment now!

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:08.208
[CROWD cheering]

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:09.500
[ANNOUNCER A]
Oh, wow!

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.000
He was just three tenths
of a point shy!

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:16.166
The champion is,
once again, Reo Shinozaki!

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.542
[MAESHIMA]
But I practiced so hard. Why?

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.250
I mean... I get that I don't
know when to give up.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:26.083
I know it's weird.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.667
But... But if he were to...

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.458
Shinozaki.

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.709
Okay, if he at least
acknowledges me as his rival.

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:40.208
It looks like you beat me again.

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:42.792
Then I could keep going.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.041
But next time?
I'm definitely gonna--

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.250
[SHINOZAKI]
The results are in.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.166
You can't beat me.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.250
Just stop trying.

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.000
You're wasting your time.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.208
You should quit figure
skating altogether.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.291
[F REPORTER A] Shinozaki, you've
won the Japan Championships

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:10.583
four times in a row.

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:13.542
Why switch to skate-leading now?

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.834
This was my plan all along.

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:18.750
In fact, I've already
submitted the paperwork.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:20.959
[REPORTER A] People expected
you to debut at the Seniors

00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.333
now that you're in high school.

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:24.875
What made you decide to do this?

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.792
[SHINOZAKI] Making this decision
was necessary in order

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.667
for me to grow.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.500
[REPORTER B]
As you know, many of your rivals

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.208
from your younger days
have transitioned over

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.291
to skate-leading.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:35.959
Are you looking forward
to seeing and competing

00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.458
against them again?

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:39.375
[SHINOZAKI]
I'm not interested in that.

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:43.000
As an athlete, I have one goal,
no matter what I'm competing at.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.208
I just aim for the top.

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:32.166
[MAESHIMA chuckles]

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.417
Man, you just kicked our butts!

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.792
[STUDENT D] You should join
the basketball club, Maeshima.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:43.250
They'd make you a
regular player right away.

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:46.166
Thanks, but no thanks.
I can't stand practicing.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.583
[STUDENT C]
Get out! If that's true,

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.750
how come you
can move like that?

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:53.250
It's not that hard!
Lotsa basketball videos online.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:55.000
[STUDENT D] Well, most people
can't pick up those kinds

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:57.250
of moves just by
watching videos!

00:05:58.583 --> 00:05:59.750
'Preciate ya.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.041
[FRIEND A] You know, you said
the same thing once before.

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:04.333
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.917
[FRIEND A] Remember?
During the baseball game?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.375
You said you'd copied
a pro player

00:06:07.458 --> 00:06:09.041
from an online video.

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:10.583
[FRIEND B] Didn't you tell
us that's how you learned

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:12.750
to play soccer, too?

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:14.417
[FRIEND A] I remember the
baseball and soccer clubs

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.458
were trying hard to recruit you.

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:18.333
[FRIEND B] But when you got
cocky and challenged the go

00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:20.709
and shogi clubs,
you got thrashed.

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:23.500
You're a total meathead,
you know. Ya lunk.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:24.667
[MAESHIMA]
Shut up.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.166
[FRIEND A]
You're wasting your talent.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.667
You shouldn't lay around
at home after school like us.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.166
You should join a club.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.375
It's not my thing.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.667
I'd only wanna do the fun stuff.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.834
Like playing in a match
to look cool--

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:39.375
[FRIEND B] Aren't they
the skate-leading club?

00:06:39.458 --> 00:06:40.750
I'm sorry!

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:43.083
I can help any club except
skate-related ones,

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:44.667
unfortunately.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.250
I don't care if we did used
to be in the same club before!

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:48.709
[JONOUCHI laughs]

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:50.500
Not me! I wasn't in that club!

00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:51.583
Hey.

00:06:51.667 --> 00:06:53.083
Okay, okay.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:56.583
Maeshima.
What are you talking about?

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:59.834
No one in our club is
in any way inferior to you.

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.083
We'd never ask for your help.

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:03.583
That's good to know, I guess.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:06.667
Why bother lying?
You do wanna skate with us.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.709
People believed in you, too.

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:10.917
You're the one who
chose what you are now.

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.667
[KUBOTA]
Uh... Captain.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.250
[KIRIYAMA]
Maeshima.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:18.166
I really couldn't hate you any
more than I do at this point.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.917
If you don't wanna take
part in skate-leading,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.125
that's fine.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.667
But don't act like
we're old friends.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.834
Just stop. That atti--

00:07:23.917 --> 00:07:26.375
Okay, take the intensity
down a notch.

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:28.125
Bye, now.
See you later.

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:29.291
[MAESHIMA laughs]

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:30.667
Yeah, see ya!

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.959
Sorry guys.
I gotta go take a leak.

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:40.792
Huh? But we're about to clear
this level, though, dude!

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:42.083
Look behind you.

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:43.917
[FRIEND B]
Huh?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.667
[FRIEND B]
Jeez, he's so messed up.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.792
[FRIEND A] Despite what he says,
he never talks about his

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:49.250
early days, you know.

00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:53.917
[MAESHIMA]
What a wuss.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.375
This is exciting!

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:58.166
Now that Shinozaki is moving
over from figure-skating,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.125
skate-leading's
entered the spotlight!

00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:01.959
Here are the basics.

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:04.291
[MC A] Skate-leading,
AKA team figure skating,

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.583
consists of five members
who skate as a team

00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:08.542
in three positions.

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:12.333
"Leads" are point-getters who
perform the jump combinations.

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:14.875
"Wings" are agile skaters
who get lifted in moves

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.792
like the twist lift.

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:20.208
"Guards" offer support
for lifts and steps.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.333
Teams must have at least
one skater for each

00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:23.834
of these positions.

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:31.208
But all five skate
at once, right?

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:33.417
That must be hard
for the judges.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.917
[F ASSISTANT]
Right.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.917
That's where this automatic
measurement system comes in.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It uses 15 cameras to record--

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:40.583
[phone ringing]

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:46.333
[ADACHI]
What is it?

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.291
This better not be
about skate-leading.

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.000
See ya!

00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:54.083
Later, man!

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:55.291
[MAESHIMA]
Yeah.

00:09:00.166 --> 00:09:03.834
[SASUGAI] Excuse me, can
I ask you for directions?

00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:05.458
Oh, sure. Where do you need to--

00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:07.083
[SASUGAI]
Thank you so much!

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:08.875
I just moved to
the area recently,

00:09:08.959 --> 00:09:10.834
and I don't want people
to think that I'm a bumpkin,

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.834
but the truth is I don't
know my way around here

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:14.250
at all.

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:16.458
To think that the first
person I talked to was so nice!

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:17.709
I'm glad I mustered up the--

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:20.000
Okay, okay, I get it!

00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.917
So, where do you wanna go?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.625
[SASUGAI] Right.
I'm looking for two ice rinks:

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:27.417
the one where Ionodai High's
skate-leading team practices

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.917
and the one Reo Shinozaki uses.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.959
Sorry. Ask someone else.

00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:35.041
Come on, don't be
so cold-hearted, dude.

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:36.458
Let's chat,

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:39.083
Kensei Maeshima,
former novice skater.

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:40.792
Runner-up at All-Japan.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.166
[SASUGAI laughs]

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.959
Here, look, check this out.
Someone uploaded it.

00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:54.917
I heard this is Shinozaki's
next exhibition program.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.750
He's good, isn't he?

00:09:56.834 --> 00:09:59.250
The moves are so sharp.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:01.667
Made me want
to see it in person.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.125
What's your problem?

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:05.667
If you're a fan,
look it up on your phone

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.250
and go by yourself!

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.417
He's biting.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.625
[MAESHIMA] Grandpa,
I'm gonna run for a bit.

00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:33.500
[MAESHIMA] Yep, he does
tighten his muscles here.

00:10:33.583 --> 00:10:34.875
Which means...

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:40.000
That's weird.

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:43.041
I wonder, is it because
I'm on the ground?

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:44.625
Hmm.

00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:48.458
On the ice, I'll have to push
more with the back outside edge.

00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:50.792
How do I take off?

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:53.709
I have to use the right side
as an axis, or I'll land wrong.

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:56.959
That wasn't bad!

00:10:57.041 --> 00:10:58.875
[SASUGAI]
I acknowledge your effort.

00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:01.417
Problem is, you do
a thing where you tend

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.375
to bend forward when you jump.

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:06.166
That's why your left leg
becomes unstable.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.500
You should stop training
only on the ground.

00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:11.375
[MAESHIMA]
What's with you?

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:14.375
Why stalk me
instead of Shinozaki?

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:15.667
Leave me alone,
or I'm gonna report you

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.000
to the police.

00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:19.250
[SASUGAI]
Go right ahead.

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:20.667
You sure, though?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.083
'Cause if you do that,
your grandparents will find out

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:27.208
you've been out here practicing
figure skating every day.

00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:29.834
Considering how far this
park is from your house,

00:11:29.917 --> 00:11:32.166
I'm gonna guess that
you've been hiding it, right?

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.208
Maybe you don't
wanna worry them.

00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.417
[MAESHIMA] You ran into me on
purpose earlier, didn't you?

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:41.917
Fine, who are you?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.917
And what do you want?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Sorry I skipped that before.

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:48.709
Allow me to introduce
myself properly.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:52.625
I'm Hayato Sasugai,
Reo Shinozaki's half-brother.

00:12:03.834 --> 00:12:05.333
What'd you say?

00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:07.333
You're Shinozaki's brother?

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:08.583
Younger.

00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:11.792
But our old man is
a special kind of jerk

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:14.417
'Cause technically
we're the same age.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.125
He was just born a
little earlier than me.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:18.834
Wanna tell me what
you're doing here?

00:12:18.917 --> 00:12:20.917
[SASUGAI]
Revenge.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.125
Shinozaki is such
a royal pain in the neck

00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:24.750
that just looking at
the guy makes me want

00:12:24.834 --> 00:12:26.333
to throw up.

00:12:26.417 --> 00:12:28.417
He's always out front.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.792
No matter what he does,
he's up ahead of me

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:36.000
without fail, wearing
that condescending look.

00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:39.375
Sound familiar?

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:42.041
[SHINOZAKI] You can't beat me.
Just stop trying.

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:45.041
You should quit
figure skating altogether.

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:47.250
[SASUGAI] I finally found
a place I could belong,

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.083
and he stole it from me.

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:50.250
Belong?

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:52.417
[SASUGAI]
I mean Skate-Leading.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.000
But then, I had a thought.

00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:57.041
This could be the chance
I need to knock him down

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:58.625
off his throne.

00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:02.291
Fortunately, this town
has Ionodai High.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:04.625
And best of all, there's you.

00:13:04.709 --> 00:13:07.875
You guys'd have the
strongest team for sure.

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:11.125
[MAESHIMA] Well, sorry, dude,
but I quit skating ages ago--

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.500
Come back to the ice, Maeshima!

00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:17.500
[MAESHIMA]
What're you talking about?

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:18.792
"Come back?"?

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:23.792
Yeah, come back, I need you.

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:26.875
[MAESHIMA laughs]
You came here just to say that?

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.000
So it's "the strongest
team," huh?

00:13:29.083 --> 00:13:31.375
And you need me
for your revenge?

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:32.709
If you need it that badly,

00:13:32.792 --> 00:13:34.792
then maybe you should
go lead the team yourse--

00:13:35.792 --> 00:13:37.250
[SASUGAI]
Can't jump anymore.

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:41.625
There've been lots of surgeries.

00:13:41.709 --> 00:13:45.834
I can walk, but I can't
go back on the ice.

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:48.000
I'm like you, though.

00:13:48.083 --> 00:13:51.250
There's something
I can't quite give up.

00:13:51.333 --> 00:13:53.083
You feel the same way.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.625
I know you do!

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:59.500
Right now, I'm aiming to
be a skate-leading coach.

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:01.417
My goal is to coach
the national team

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.583
for world competitions.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.166
Should be your size.
Try 'em out.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.125
You're giving me those?

00:14:09.208 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm assuming you know,
this weekend is Shinozaki's

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:13.917
last exhibition.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.625
Memorize the video you
saw and meet me there.

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:18.417
I'll get you a slot.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.291
Let's go and raise that comeback
flag, right in his face.

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:24.917
[MAESHIMA]
Screw that! Why would I?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.792
[SASUGAI] You ever heard
the phrase "carpe diem?"

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:30.792
Or do you plan on spending
the rest of your life in regret?

00:14:37.792 --> 00:14:40.709
Take it from someone
with experience.

00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:44.750
If you keep lying to yourself,
you'll get so confused,

00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:46.625
you'll eventually
forget who you are.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.041
Captain. Since it's over,
can I go now?

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:05.834
Not a chance.
What do you think we came for?

00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:08.417
Get a good look
at Shinozaki. Okay?

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.375
Most likely,
he'll be skating lead, too.

00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:13.375
You're our ace, he'll be theirs.

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:16.709
Wait. I'm the ace! Right?

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:18.583
Would you just be quiet?

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.041
Well, personality-wise,
I'd say that he's probably

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:22.500
the most suited for it.

00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:24.792
[ANNOUNCER B]
Thank you for waiting!

00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:28.291
The following program will be
performed by Reo Shinozaki.

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:31.500
His last before transitioning
to skate-leading!

00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:33.041
[buzzer]

00:15:36.375 --> 00:15:38.125
[music plays]

00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:42.417
[MAESHIMA]
Screw that! Dammit!

00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:48.333
[MAESHIMA yells]

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:13.625
[MAESHIMA] I didn't give it up
just to be mocked by a guy

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:14.875
like that!

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:20.000
No way.

00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:23.750
I refuse!

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.375
Not when I can still jump!

00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:30.875
I'm gonna skate!

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:37.250
Good, you're already
warmed up, then!

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.709
What's the deal?

00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:45.041
Did you come all this way
to be pissy or to skate?

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.917
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.917
[ANNOUNCER B] What a wonderful
final performance by Shinozaki!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.875
We can't help but look
forward to seeing him try

00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:53.500
skate-leading!

00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:56.375
Reo Shinozaki is on
a perfect skater's path.

00:16:56.458 --> 00:16:58.917
Please, let's give
him a hand again!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.375
[CROWD cheering]

00:17:02.458 --> 00:17:03.625
[MAESHIMA]
Hey.

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:05.375
Don't worry, this room
is specifically reserved

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:06.458
for trainees.

00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:07.750
[MAESHIMA]
But that guy--

00:17:07.834 --> 00:17:09.625
I've settled up with
his friends, so it's fine.

00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:12.625
To be honest, his skating
is just passable anyway.

00:17:12.709 --> 00:17:14.417
That's no excuse
for me to skate.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.917
[SASUGAI]
Then what'd you come for?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.583
You've got skates
in that bag, right?

00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:22.750
I recognized your talent.
Be confident.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.500
You have unbelievable
energy and vision.

00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:27.583
You also have the control
that allows you to move

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:29.166
with the precision
to match what you see

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.250
in your head, which is rare.

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.500
Who cares about the past?

00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:35.875
You're the only one who's
hung up on his pride, here.

00:17:35.959 --> 00:17:37.750
Anyway, wasn't it fifth grade?

00:17:37.834 --> 00:17:38.959
Not a good look, dude.

00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:40.625
No, I was just--!

00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:43.917
Stop whining.
Just go show 'em on the ice.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.625
[ANNOUNCER B] The second half
of our exhibition will begin

00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:47.041
in a moment.

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:49.208
We'll dim the lights just
before the first program,

00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:51.375
so please watch your step
heading back to your seats,

00:17:51.458 --> 00:17:52.417
folks.

00:17:56.291 --> 00:17:57.542
Sit down.

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:59.959
You need to stay until the end;
it's just polite.

00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:01.375
What're you saying?

00:18:01.458 --> 00:18:03.709
You saw Shinozaki
perform earlier.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:05.458
If he's that good
at skate-leading...

00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:07.291
We can't just sit around here.

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.208
We gotta get practicing now!

00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:10.333
[KIRIYAMA]
Terauchi.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.083
[MAESHIMA]
That damn Sasugai.

00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:17.709
Who does he think he is?

00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:20.208
And this program!

00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:22.250
Hmph. But who cares?

00:18:22.333 --> 00:18:24.417
I'm skating because I want to.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.041
That's what matters now.

00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:27.875
[SASUGAI]
You get it, right, Maeshima?

00:18:27.959 --> 00:18:31.041
It all depends on how
well you can copy him.

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:33.667
[ATTENDANT A] Uh, excuse me,
sir, about this program change.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.959
Oh, it's okay.

00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:37.750
Yamada wanted it to be
a surprise for Shinozaki,

00:18:37.834 --> 00:18:40.250
because he's his friend.
You get it.

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:41.667
Kuonji's known him forever.

00:18:52.208 --> 00:18:54.417
[music plays]

00:19:01.959 --> 00:19:04.500
Huh. This is different from
his planned program.

00:19:04.583 --> 00:19:07.417
Isn't this the same
music Shinozaki used?

00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:12.834
[SASUGAI]
Now, show us what you can do.

00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:22.875
What the--?
That's Shinozaki's music, right?

00:19:22.959 --> 00:19:25.166
Hold on, even the
routine's the same!

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.792
Ridiculous!
Why weren't we told about this?

00:19:40.834 --> 00:19:42.750
[SASUGAI]
Don't worry about the mistakes.

00:19:42.834 --> 00:19:45.208
You haven't been on
the rink in a while.

00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:46.667
[MAESHIMA]
Well, damn.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.291
But this is weird.
What's happening?

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:51.417
This is fun.

00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:55.250
Oh, that's right!

00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:57.208
I love this!

00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:59.333
And I'm back in the rink!

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:02.250
I can do so much
more on ice than dirt!

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.750
I can jump!

00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:07.667
Wow, is that really Yamada?
His skills are super rough.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.458
That's true.
Great instincts, though.

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.500
I like what he's doing.

00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:15.500
[SASUGAI]
Once. Just once is enough.

00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:17.875
Show everyone here
what you've got.

00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:19.458
Then the path will open up!

00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:22.000
Do it now!

00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:27.417
Holy...

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.875
[ANNOUNCER B]
Was that a quadruple?

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:32.208
What a surprise!

00:20:32.291 --> 00:20:35.208
Yamada was performing
exactly the same program,

00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:38.583
but I don't think the quad
flip was in there before.

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:41.709
[SASUGAI] That bastard went and
added some stuff on his own!

00:20:45.709 --> 00:20:48.125
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:53.166 --> 00:20:54.417
[SASUGAI]
Maeshima.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.875
You're like a puppy.

00:20:55.959 --> 00:20:58.083
When you're happy,
you jump around too much.

00:20:58.166 --> 00:20:59.375
[MAESHIMA]
Shut up.

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:01.583
[SASUGAI] It stirred the
soul, though, didn't it?

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:02.917
[MAESHIMA laughs]

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.542
Deep down, I think
I've been wanting to do this

00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:06.083
for years.

00:21:06.166 --> 00:21:09.125
[SASUGAI] Then... we have
a deal on teaming up?

00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.250
I'll take you to the top.
Whaddya say?

00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:12.792
[MAESHIMA]
So high and mighty.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:15.959
[YAMADA]
Hey! You two!

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.000
You guys're the ones who
lied and locked me up,

00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:19.375
--aren't you?
--[MAESHIMA] What?

00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:21.709
[SASUGAI] Okay, look, you want
money? I can pay!

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:22.750
[YAMADA]
That's not the point!

00:21:22.834 --> 00:21:25.166
Someone! Catch them!

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.083
You bastard!
What the hell did you do?

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:28.500
Yeah, yeah, sorry!

00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:30.500
[MAESHIMA]
What, was your ankle a lie, too?

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:31.834
Oh, that was makeup.

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.583
It's true I suck
at skating, though.

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:34.959
Huh?!

00:21:35.041 --> 00:21:36.166
[laughs]

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.750
Sheesh.
You sound like a crazy man.

00:21:38.834 --> 00:21:40.583
[laughing continues]

00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.959
[MAESHIMA]
So, yes, I, Kensei Maeshima,

00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:47.500
may have goofed around
a lot yesterday,

00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:50.917
but now, I'm formally joining
the skate-leading club!

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Thank you!

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
Oh, yeah? You think so?

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:58.125
Don't assume it's okay
just because we've known

00:21:58.208 --> 00:21:59.542
each other forever.

00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:01.500
Fact of the matter is,
there's no place for you

00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:02.750
in our club.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.291
[AKIMITSU]
Captain.

00:23:35.375 --> 00:23:36.625
[HIMEKAWA]
Captain.

00:23:36.709 --> 00:23:37.667
[JONOUCHI]
Captain!

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:38.917
[YUKIMITSU]
Captain Terauchi.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:39.750
[MAESHIMA]
Sho!

00:23:39.834 --> 00:23:40.625
[TERAUCHI]
What, Maeshima?

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:41.792
[GROUP gasps]

00:23:41.875 --> 00:23:44.250
[KIRIYAMA]
Terauchi. I can't believe you.

00:23:44.333 --> 00:23:46.208
[TERAUCHI] What? Did I
do something wrong? Or?
