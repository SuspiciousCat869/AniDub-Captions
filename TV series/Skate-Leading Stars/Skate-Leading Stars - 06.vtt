[SASUGAI] Ionodai aims to become
the national skate-leading

with me, the genius
Hayato Sasugai,

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:21.438 position:50% align:center
at their side.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.606 position:50% align:center
Our performance will
hinge on how we utilize

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.276 position:50% align:center
the forgotten phenom
Kensei Maeshima,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.986 position:50% align:center
managing both
his erratic brilliance

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.946 position:50% align:center
and his extreme mood swings.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.241 position:50% align:center
The big day is here, and
everyone's a little uneasy.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:36.578 position:50% align:center
But, hey, we're gonna
be fine, right?

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.580 position:50% align:center

return the championship flag.

Your attention please,

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:12.113 position:50% align:center
as third year at St. Clavis

Taiga Himuro, recites the oath.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.495 position:50% align:center
In the name of
all athletes present,

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.956 position:50% align:center
we promise always to uphold
the spirit of skate-leading.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.416 position:50% align:center
For the many people
involved who have

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.794 position:50% align:center
lent us their assistance,
for the judges,

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.588 position:50% align:center
the referees, and
our loyal supporters,

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.007 position:50% align:center
we promise to skate
fairly and honorably,

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.469 position:50% align:center
that we may do justice
to the sport we love.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.304 position:50% align:center
I hope that this
competition will benefit

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.807 position:50% align:center
our collective future by
heightening the popularity

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.600 position:50% align:center
of skate-leading,
helping more people

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.103 position:50% align:center
to understand it,
and increasing the number

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.188 position:50% align:center
of disciplined participants.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.276 position:50% align:center
Formalities aside, this will
be a two-month long venture,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.070 position:50% align:center
so we're in it
for the long haul.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.739 position:50% align:center
Take care of yourselves,
but please, have fun!

00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.408 position:50% align:center

[ANNOUNCER B]
For those who need a reminder,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.184 position:50% align:center
I will now review the rules
for the Boys' High School

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:49.437 position:50% align:center
Skate-Leading Grand Prix Series.

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
The competing teams consist
of the six seeded schools

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:55.235 position:50% align:center
from the finals of last
year's Grand Prix.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.986 position:50% align:center
Plus the ten schools
who scored the highest

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.780 position:50% align:center
at last month's preliminaries.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:02.784 position:50% align:center
This gives us a grand
total of 16 schools.

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.661 position:50% align:center
Each school will compete
in three matches,

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.037 position:50% align:center
all chosen by lottery,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.039 position:50% align:center
which will take place
around the country.

00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:09.666 position:50% align:center
After the eighth
competition is over,

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.209 position:50% align:center
the schools with
the six top scores

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.378 position:50% align:center
will continue on to
the Grand Prix finals

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.673 position:50% align:center
and are automatically seeded
into next year's series.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.550 position:50% align:center
This is our commentator,
Ms. Abe.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.677 position:50% align:center
Since our first competition
always takes place

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.887 position:50% align:center
right at the end of
opening ceremonies,

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:26.766 position:50% align:center
you will see many of our
athletes waiting in the stands.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.226 position:50% align:center
Which teams do you
have your eye on

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:30.020 position:50% align:center
this year, Ms. Abe?

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:31.438 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B]
First, I would definitely say

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.898 position:50% align:center
last year's champion,
St. Clavis.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:35.400 position:50% align:center
Including their captain, Himuro,

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.693 position:50% align:center
they have three returning
members on their

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.319 position:50% align:center
starting team.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.822 position:50% align:center
With the addition of singles
champion Shinozaki,

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:43.616 position:50% align:center
they are indisputably
the strongest team here.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.951 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Any others?

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.536 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B]
I'll also be looking closely at

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.747 position:50% align:center
last year's runner up,
Nagano Koryo High,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.750 position:50% align:center
as well as Otaru Technical High,
who placed third.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.210 position:50% align:center
And take note of last
year's sixth place.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.504 position:50% align:center
Chutei University
Kamimaezu High.

00:04:56.588 --> 00:04:58.631 position:50% align:center
With Hajime Ishikawa
and the slightly younger

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.593 position:50% align:center
Susumu Ishikawa,
the team's twin aces.

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.553 position:50% align:center
They seem to have improved
upon the unison skating

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:05.430 position:50% align:center
for which they were
already well-known.

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.973 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] What are your
thoughts on last year's

00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.641 position:50% align:center
fourth place, Ionodai High?

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:10.727 position:50% align:center
Their new coach is
the figure skater Adachi,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.604 position:50% align:center
who is recovering
from an injury.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.898 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B] I'm familiar
with Adachi's skill as a skater,

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.734 position:50% align:center
but I don't know much
about his coaching style yet.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.861 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Do you think the
return of Kensei Maeshima,

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.405 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki's rival from
his days as a novice,

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.657 position:50% align:center
will give them an edge
over the others?

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:27.327 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B] It depends on
whether he's still in shape.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.704 position:50% align:center
Don't forget they lost
their ace, Himekawa,

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:33.166 position:50% align:center
who transferred to Kogahara High
right before the series began.

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.001 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Kogahara High
School scored at the top

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:36.461 position:50% align:center
during the preliminaries.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.380 position:50% align:center
They'll be skating here today.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.173 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B] The famed
Coach Kumada has formed

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.510 position:50% align:center
a formidable team indeed,
Himekawa among them.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.387 position:50% align:center
They're going to be
hard to beat.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.763 position:50% align:center
True, though I must say,

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.515 position:50% align:center
it's looking like the hottest
team is likely to be

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.308 position:50% align:center
Yokohama Super
Global High School,

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:52.811 position:50% align:center
if you pay attention to
the preliminaries, that is.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:54.479 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B] Although their
abilities as a team are still

00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:57.315 position:50% align:center
unknown, Kuonji,
who skated overseas,

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.651 position:50% align:center
is setting the stage
as their captain.

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.696 position:50% align:center
I'm looking forward to an
energetic routine from them.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.447 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] This year's Grand
Prix Series is going to be

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:06.282 position:50% align:center
the battle of the century!

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.368 position:50% align:center
The first competition
will begin soon!

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.454 position:50% align:center
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:06:11.538 --> 00:06:13.623 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Come on, get a grip!

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:15.166 position:50% align:center
It's time for the meeting.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.960 position:50% align:center
Hurry up and get back
to the waiting room.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:19.170 position:50% align:center
I can't pass this up!
I've gotta buy it!

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
See? It's commemorative.
One of a kind!

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.133 position:50% align:center
Don't be ridiculous.

00:06:23.216 --> 00:06:24.592 position:50% align:center
What the heck is wrong with you?

00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
Come on.

00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.518 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Listen, everyone!

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.145 position:50% align:center
We're going to be the
last of the six teams

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.939 position:50% align:center
to skate in the short program.

00:06:38.023 --> 00:06:39.524 position:50% align:center
Do a thorough warmup.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:40.900 position:50% align:center
We don't want cold muscles.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:42.569 position:50% align:center
We know, we're pros.

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:43.945 position:50% align:center
Come on, you can trust us!

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.488 position:50% align:center
Enough.

00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:48.408 position:50% align:center
I think the most powerful team
in the first competition

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.618 position:50% align:center
is Chutei University High.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.663 position:50% align:center
They have an inspired routine,
are perfectly synchronized,

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.081 position:50% align:center
and have captured
people's attention

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.875 position:50% align:center
with their presentation
this year.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.376 position:50% align:center
But if we can skate
as well as we did

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
at training camp, we'll win!

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.338 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI, MAESHIMA]
Yes!

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
Right, Coach?

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.718 position:50% align:center
Yeah. Terauchi's said
everything I would've said.

00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.678 position:50% align:center
Try to do what you
did at training camp.

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:09.763 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI, KIRIYAMA]
Yes, sir!

00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:14.059 position:50% align:center
You'd better skate like we
practiced, okay, Maeshima?

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.853 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I got it, dude.
Don't worry.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.188 position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.606 position:50% align:center
You have something to say,
you better say it now.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.107 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
I'm good.

00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.401 position:50% align:center
Tomo, let's get to
the practice rink.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.736 position:50% align:center
We've got to scout the enemy.

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:25.945 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Yeah, sure.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.406 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] The first three
teams to skate will warm up

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.241 position:50% align:center
in the lower practice rink.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.911 position:50% align:center
The second three teams will
have their own turns later.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:34.662 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU] Come to me one
at a time for makeup.

00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:36.289 position:50% align:center
Let me know about
any wardrobe issues

00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:37.540 position:50% align:center
and I'll take care of them.

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.625 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Yes sir!

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:41.711 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI]
Uh... Shinozaki?

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.423 position:50% align:center
--Credit card.
--You want those?

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
They're all incredibly good.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.223 position:50% align:center
But what else would you expect?

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.641 position:50% align:center
Yeah, guess so.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.977 position:50% align:center
We'll go by skating order.
First, Tanabe Ryujin High.

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:02.065 position:50% align:center
42.94 and 44.39.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.150 position:50% align:center

00:17:10.864 --> 00:17:13.283 position:50% align:center
and would keep their lead
in the short program.

00:17:13.366 --> 00:17:15.076 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] We'll turn it
around in the free skate.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.119 position:50% align:center
--[AKIMITSU] Okay.
--[JONOUCHI] Yeah!

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.620 position:50% align:center
--Yeah we will!
--Ah.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:21.332 position:50% align:center
So this is how they got their
act together so fast. Huh?

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.500 position:50% align:center
What the...

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.294 position:50% align:center
What the hell?

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.420 position:50% align:center
No, wait.

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:26.880 position:50% align:center
I know how you feel, but still.

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.090 position:50% align:center
Hey, um, what's wrong?

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.383 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
This is boring.

00:17:30.467 --> 00:17:31.718 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI]
Huh?

00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:33.845 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] The outcome
is obvious at this point.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.723 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] We're going to lose to
Chutei High in the free skate.

00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:37.807 position:50% align:center
Wait, what do you mean?

00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:38.767 position:50% align:center
Quiet!

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.726 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
I mean what I said.

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:40.977 position:50% align:center
'Kay, but why?

00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.354 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
My predictions.

00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:43.730 position:50% align:center
Oh, give me a break.

00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.148 position:50% align:center
But just listen.

00:17:45.231 --> 00:17:47.442 position:50% align:center
His predicted scores for
the other teams were close,

00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.110 position:50% align:center
having only watched
their warm-ups!

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.071 position:50% align:center
Here, take a look at this!

00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:53.323 position:50% align:center
The first number is how
he scored the warm-up.

00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:55.241 position:50% align:center
And then there's
the actual score.

00:17:55.325 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Wow, they really are close.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.287 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] He predicted Chutei
High's score before they

00:17:59.371 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
even finished.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.791 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI] So you're saying
we'll definitely lose

00:18:02.874 --> 00:18:04.125 position:50% align:center
at this rate?

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:05.877 position:50% align:center
What do you suggest we do, then?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.337 position:50% align:center
Changing our routine
for the free skate

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.547 position:50% align:center
would be too risky at
this point in the game.

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.508 position:50% align:center
I didn't say anything
about changing it.

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:14.177 position:50% align:center
What you should do is let
Maeshima skate more freely.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:18.640 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] He was magnificent
when he was wild.

00:18:18.723 --> 00:18:20.225 position:50% align:center
Too bad they've tamed him.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.646 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Maeshima, why are you
suddenly being such a

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.231 position:50% align:center
goody two shoes?

00:18:26.314 --> 00:18:29.317 position:50% align:center
It's fine to match the others--
this is a team sport, after all.

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:31.277 position:50% align:center
But don't conform too much.

00:18:31.361 --> 00:18:34.030 position:50% align:center
I'm saying that what we need
is your explosive power.

00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:35.323 position:50% align:center
That's the key here.

00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.909 position:50% align:center
Athletes with great skill
are a dime a dozen.

00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.577 position:50% align:center
But won't he be just
like he was before

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:40.954 position:50% align:center
the training camp?

00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:43.164 position:50% align:center
Zooming around and
throwing us off?

00:18:43.248 --> 00:18:44.165 position:50% align:center
That's possible.

00:18:44.249 --> 00:18:45.583 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Huh?!

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:48.211 position:50% align:center
What has this team's
ultimate goal always been?

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.005 position:50% align:center
To become national champions!

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:53.299 position:50% align:center
Or are you satisfied just to
qualify for the finals now?

00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.884 position:50% align:center
Yay, whoopee!

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:57.095 position:50% align:center
The other teams are
competing fiercely.

00:18:57.178 --> 00:18:58.763 position:50% align:center
A team suddenly gets
stronger and lands

00:18:58.847 --> 00:18:59.931 position:50% align:center
a great score.

00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:01.599 position:50% align:center
I mean, isn't that what
high school sports

00:19:01.683 --> 00:19:02.851 position:50% align:center
are all about?

00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:04.644 position:50% align:center
Isn't that what they
said about you guys

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
after you placed fourth
at nationals in only

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:07.814 position:50% align:center
your second year?

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:09.566 position:50% align:center
Don't go on the defensive now!

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.901 position:50% align:center
This is the time to fight
all-out like the challengers

00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:12.986 position:50% align:center
you are.

00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.195 position:50% align:center
That's right!

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:15.196 position:50% align:center
Show them you've got
what it takes to turn

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.698 position:50% align:center
fourth place into first!

00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:19.200 position:50% align:center
But to ruin our chance
in the first competition.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.618 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
You need to do this because

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:22.245 position:50% align:center
it's the first competition!

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.830 position:50% align:center
What happens if you get
to the third match

00:19:23.913 --> 00:19:26.041 position:50% align:center
and the top school has
a huge lead on you?

00:19:26.124 --> 00:19:28.209 position:50% align:center
Will you take a chance
and be reckless then?

00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
Or would you rather do it now?

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:32.547 position:50% align:center
When there will still be
time left to perfect it.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.507 position:50% align:center
Keep this up and you
may still claw your way

00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:35.842 position:50% align:center
into the finals.

00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.219 position:50% align:center
But take a risk, and you
could be leading the pack.

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.930 position:50% align:center
Which would give you
better momentum?

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.099 position:50% align:center
Don't be a bunch of chickens.

00:19:43.183 --> 00:19:45.643 position:50% align:center
Were you serious about
being national champions?

00:19:51.024 --> 00:19:52.776 position:50% align:center
Ah, to be young and dumb again.

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.361 position:50% align:center
Buncha idiots.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:55.236 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Coach?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.446 position:50% align:center
Listen to him.

00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.490 position:50% align:center
What Sasugai is saying
is right on target.

00:19:58.573 --> 00:20:01.826 position:50% align:center
You're gonna have a tough
time winning this way.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.787 position:50% align:center
Trying to earn points
by playing it safe

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.207 position:50% align:center
is one strategy. But...

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.585 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Maeshima. What do you think?

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:12.921 position:50% align:center
I'm... not sure.

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.513 position:50% align:center
We win.

00:20:21.596 --> 00:20:22.847 position:50% align:center
Kiriyama.

00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:29.062 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA sighs]

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.106 position:50% align:center
Maeshima, give it a shot.

00:20:31.189 --> 00:20:33.108 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP gasps]
--[AKIMITSU] Really?

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:34.150 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI]
Hmph.

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:35.944 position:50% align:center
We want to win this!

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
To become the champions!

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.407 position:50% align:center
If there is a way to achieve
that right in front of us,

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.908 position:50% align:center
I don't think we're the
type of team that would

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.035 position:50% align:center
fall apart even if we do fail!

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.745 position:50% align:center
We're better than that!

00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:46.955 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Maeshima!

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.633 position:50% align:center
We're almost up. Get ready.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Chutei University
High blows everyone away

00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:04.723 position:50% align:center
and takes a solid lead!

00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.016 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B]
They received high performance

00:21:06.099 --> 00:21:07.308 position:50% align:center
and technical points
from elements

00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.394 position:50% align:center
right in the middle
of their routine!

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:10.437 position:50% align:center
That was good.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.604 position:50% align:center
It was.

00:21:12.939 --> 00:21:14.607 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me you're
actually nervous.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:16.234 position:50% align:center
Uh... Of course I'm nervous.

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:17.485 position:50% align:center
Who wouldn't be right now?

00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.654 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Don't worry, Maeshima.

00:21:19.738 --> 00:21:21.406 position:50% align:center
We're the ones
who made this call.

00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:22.699 position:50% align:center
Be yourself out there.

00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:24.367 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we'll back you up.

00:21:27.537 --> 00:21:29.289 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Next is Ionodai High,

00:21:29.372 --> 00:21:33.084 position:50% align:center
who currently holds second place
after the short program.

00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.294 position:50% align:center
[F COMMENTATOR B]
They seemed somewhat reserved

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:35.754 position:50% align:center
during the short program,

00:21:35.837 --> 00:21:37.547 position:50% align:center
but how will they do
in the free skate?

00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:52.187 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] Sure enough,
in the first official match

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.315 position:50% align:center
of this Grand Prix Series,
our team wound up

00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.275 position:50% align:center
in sixth place.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.568 position:50% align:center
Dead last.

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:01.821 position:50% align:center
Second to sixth, just like that.

00:22:01.905 --> 00:22:04.324 position:50% align:center
But still, it wasn't bad.

00:23:36.666 --> 00:23:38.043 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] You know,
I haven't had any problems

00:23:38.126 --> 00:23:40.045 position:50% align:center
conversing after
coming to Niigata.

00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:41.588 position:50% align:center
Is there no more dialect?

00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:43.214 position:50% align:center
[KUMADA] There are just
certain circumstances

00:23:43.298 --> 00:23:45.383 position:50% align:center
we ignore to make it
easier on the writers.

00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:46.926 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
Circumstances?

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.678 position:50% align:center
[KUMADA] Yes, like I'm actually
speaking Russian right now.

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:49.846 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
You're joking!
