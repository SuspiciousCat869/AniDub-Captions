WEBVTT

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:12.542
[SASUGAI]
An unpolished talent.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.083
A forgotten phenom.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.000
A former child prodigy.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.792
An unacknowledged genius.

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:19.333
Kensei Maeshima.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.834
Called back to the ice after
years away by the chance

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.458
to face the skater he'd
considered his rival,

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:25.959
Reo Shinozaki.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.917
Helped along by a nudge from
yours truly, Hayato Sasugai.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.917
However...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.542
[MAESHIMA]
So, yes, I, Kensei Maeshima,

00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:36.125
may have goofed around
a lot yesterday,

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:39.500
but now, I'm formally joining
the skate-leading club!

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:41.583
Thank you!

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:43.125
[MAESHIMA gasps]

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:19.500
[KIRIYAMA]
Oh, yeah? You think so?

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:20.792
Don't assume it's okay

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:23.083
just because we've known
each other forever.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.959
Fact of the matter is, there's
no place for you in our club.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.458
Itsuki!

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:29.750
Disrespecting an upperclassman
and threatening violence?

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:31.583
--That proves how unworthy--
--Man, what the hell?

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:33.667
Maeshima, Kiriyama,
that's enough!

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.917
Easy!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.875
What's up? I heard yelling.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.208
Sorry, Coach.

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.041
We've been practicing
with Himekawa as the ace,

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.333
and we don't need some
outsider shaking things up.

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:44.500
And there's me--
ace number two!

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.166
Incorrect and unhelpful.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.000
Now is not the time for us
to be adding on new members.

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:50.250
We're a team.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:51.792
You get that this is a
club for skate-leading,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.542
--not singles, right?
--Yeah, of course I do.

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.166
That's the entire
reason I'm here!

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.792
Hey, guys.
Quick question for ya.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.709
Are you actually interested
in being the number one team?

00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:03.375
Or are you cool with
Shinozaki's club beating you?

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:04.750
Whoa, hold on.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.208
You trying to tell me if
we add him onto the team,

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:07.542
then we'll win?

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.667
And just who are you?
I haven't seen you around.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.000
Hayato Sasugai, first year.

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:13.917
I'm hoping to join
the club, too.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.542
Oh, not as one of the skating
members, but as a coach.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:18.709
Do you know him?

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.458
Uh-uh. Maybe he's
a transfer student.

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:23.667
If you're really that determined
to return to the sport,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.875
I can give you the name

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.709
of a singles figure
skating club instead.

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:29.000
Shinozaki's not doing
singles anymore!

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.709
He's the one I wanna beat!

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:32.417
[KIRIYAMA sighs]

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.750
Sorry for the delay, Coach.
We'll start practice now.

00:03:35.834 --> 00:03:36.417
Let's go!

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.917
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.667
Uh...

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.417
Sho, wait! You don't agree
with him on this, do you?

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.875
You thought we'd be dying to
snap you up as our star skater?

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.834
You've been off the ice
for how many years now?

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:51.542
And the rest of us have spent
that whole time training.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.959
Things aren't like
they used to be.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.041
What about you? I mean,
you're the coach here, right?

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:02.750
So shouldn't you weigh
in or something?

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:04.041
[ADACHI grunts]

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:06.583
Huh?

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:09.375
Hey, don't give up so easily.
Leave it to me.

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.083
I'll think of a way to
convince them to let us--

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:14.875
You think I'm giving up?
No way am I gonna let this go!

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.917
Oh, boy. We're gonna need some
obedience training for sure.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.667
Bad doggie.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.250
[MAESHIMA]
Going for a run. I'll be back.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.041
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:32.000
Modern training regimens put
quality ahead of quantity

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:34.041
and include time
for plenty of rest.

00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:36.291
You were on the ice for
the first time in a while,

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:37.834
I'm sure your muscles are sore.

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:39.792
I can't afford to sit
around doing nothing.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:42.750
I need to start training now
if I'm gonna get back in shape.

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.583
[SASUGAI] So your grandparents
gave the "okay"

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:45.834
to you skating again?

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.583
Yeah, apparently,
they were worried about me

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.041
and think it might help.

00:04:49.125 --> 00:04:50.667
Well, you should rest for today.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.166
We don't want you
passing out tomorrow

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.375
during practice, you know.
That would be embarr--

00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:56.709
Hey! Didn't I tell you to rest?

00:04:56.792 --> 00:04:59.458
Stay! Sit! Heel!

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:04.875
[MAESHIMA yelling]

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.250
That jerk.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.875
What's he doing?

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:17.542
Seems like he really
wants on the team.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:23.709
What exactly do you
think you're doing?

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:25.792
Just getting a little
solo practice in.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:27.333
You're done. Get lost.

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:30.250
No way. I have a
right to be here.

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.583
Hey, you know,

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:42.667
I've got a better way to get
them to let you join the club.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.750
Less painful, too.

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:45.333
Shut up.

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:49.583
[KIRIYAMA]
I'm against it.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.709
I don't see any upside
to letting him join.

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:52.917
[TERAUCHI]
At least then he wouldn't be

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.041
such a distraction
during practice.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.166
You must realize that
somebody who's as moody,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.667
restless, and illogical as
Maeshima will get bored

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.333
and quit as soon as he's begun.

00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:02.834
If that's all there was to him,

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:05.166
could he have turned
out that performance?

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:11.083
He could become an asset.

00:06:11.166 --> 00:06:13.291
And if he doesn't,
then we'll force him out,

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:16.333
but I think it'll be okay just
as long as we rein him in.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:17.875
[grunts]

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:22.583
Well, you are the captain.
It's your call to make.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:24.375
Well, then. You decide?

00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:25.834
Uh-huh.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:28.792
Nice, huh?

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.000
The jacket fits so well it's
like it was made just for me!

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:32.750
You're still a
provisional member.

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:34.125
If you'd left it to me,

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:36.500
we'd be on the team officially
by now, just sayin'.

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:38.959
[MAESHIMA]
It'll be fine, you'll see!

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:40.875
Everything's gonna change now.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:44.583
Starting today, I get to
practice in a real rink again!

00:06:44.667 --> 00:06:47.583
[ADACHI] Well, it looks like
we've got an extra person today.

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:48.917
Take the paper
you're being handed

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.041
and do what it tells you to do.

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:55.208
Huh?!

00:06:55.291 --> 00:06:57.208
[ADACHI] Work hard,
but don't hurt yourself.

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.125
If you got questions, too bad.

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:00.375
I want you to take
the initiative

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:02.250
and figure it out on your own.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.625
Good luck.

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:06.250
Hey, hold on a second!
This is all stupid basic stuff!

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.291
Is that a problem?

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:08.792
Yeah, of course it is!

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:11.625
If you're dissatisfied, you're
more than welcome to quit.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.000
[YUKIMITSU] Hey, make sure
to keep your toes pointed

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:16.917
at the same angle!

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.834
Okay.

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:22.333
[MAESHIMA] Damn it! Everything
on my sheet is for beginners.

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.208
[SASUGAI] Captain: Third year,
Shotaro Terauchi.

00:07:25.291 --> 00:07:26.917
Position: Guard.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.792
Vice-Captain: Itsuki Kiriyama,
also a third year. Lead.

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:34.583
Akimitsu Mochizuki, second year.
The only wing on the team.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:37.417
Sota Jonouchi.
Second year, guard.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.208
Izumi Himekawa.
First year, lead.

00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:41.500
The team's ace.

00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:44.667
Tomoyuki Kubota.
First year, reserve.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.250
The name's Sasugai, isn't it?
You have a minute?

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.834
Huh?

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:51.250
Just studying the team's data.
At least, all the relevant info.

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.375
You're Yukimitsu,
third year, manager,

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:56.166
and Akimitsu Mochizuki's
older brother.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.709
You retired due to an injury

00:07:57.792 --> 00:07:59.458
during a growth spurt
in middle school.

00:07:59.542 --> 00:08:00.625
It's a shame.

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:02.041
If you had kept competing,

00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:05.125
you would've been a guard
to rival Captain Terauchi.

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.917
That amount of research
borders on stalker-level.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.625
Well, they say
knowledge is power,

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:11.208
and I like to be in control.

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:14.125
So, what other information
do you have on us?

00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:16.250
[SASUGAI] Other than
Jonouchi and Himekawa,

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:19.333
everyone was from the
same club as Maeshima.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.083
They did well at last
year's nationals,

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:23.834
making it all the way
to the semifinals.

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:26.083
[SASUGAI]
Then, there's Takumi Adachi,

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:27.667
still a competitive skater,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.667
but coaching during
the year off he's taking

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.959
to undergo rehab
for his lower back.

00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:35.291
All this raw talent
right in front of him.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:38.250
Is he really going to refuse
to teach them anything?

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:42.333
Well, that'll make it easier for
me to swoop in and take over.

00:08:42.417 --> 00:08:43.625
Okay, you've had your fun,

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:45.166
but that's enough
playing coach for now.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.083
I'm not playing
anything. I really--

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:49.834
We're really busy. Come on.

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:56.000
[SASUGAI]
Today's day ten, huh?

00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:57.709
I figured you would
snap right away,

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.291
but you've been pretty obedient.

00:08:59.375 --> 00:09:01.291
I am a new club
member, after all,

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.458
and I need to build
up my stamina.

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.291
Now the truth?

00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:08.083
[MAESHIMA] I didn't join up to
do this kind of low-level stuff.

00:09:08.166 --> 00:09:09.000
I want to jump.

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:10.375
To get out there
and really skate

00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:12.375
like I did at the exhibition.

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.792
[SASUGAI] Honestly,
for a training regimen

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:17.792
designed by a temporary coach,
it does kinda make sense.

00:09:17.875 --> 00:09:19.750
It's good for someone like
you who's coming back

00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:21.000
after a long break.

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.875
Try to keep going
with it for now.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:24.000
[YUKIMITSU]
Hey, Sasu!

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:25.834
Huh? Coming!

00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:29.500
Jeez. I'm being treated
like a manager.

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:32.959
[ALL]
Thank you very much!

00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:34.959
[ADACHI]
Mhm. See ya.

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.458
Here's the key to the place,
Shima. Don't lose it.

00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:39.500
The duty has been
Tomo's up until now,

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:41.125
but starting today, it's on you.

00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:43.375
The rink is open to
the general public, too,

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.208
so take good care of it.

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.875
[TEACHER 02A]
Maeshima? Where's Maeshima?

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.125
Is he absent today?
Has anyone heard from him?

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:57.625
[JONOUCHI]
Maeshima's absent?

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:00.709
[KUBOTA] Yeah, and nobody
contacted the school, either.

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:01.834
[JONOUCHI laughs]

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:03.667
You think he's
finally giving up?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.959
Somehow, I doubt
that's what happened.

00:10:06.041 --> 00:10:07.166
[grunts]

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:15.208
What the heck?

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:17.208
Don't tell me he's
been here since morning.

00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:19.792
He's definitely showing
signs of improvement.

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:23.625
Except, when did he find time
to practice this stuff?

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:46.500
Did he just try a quintuple?

00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:47.959
That hurt.

00:10:48.041 --> 00:10:50.834
Edge of my blade got caught
on the scratched-up rink.

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:55.750
[MAESHIMA]
Oh. Sorry about that, guys.

00:10:55.834 --> 00:10:58.166
I'll, uh, get to work
smoothing out the rink.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.709
[sighs]

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:02.041
You're expelled from the club.
Don't come back here again!

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:02.875
[gasps]

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.792
Tomo, contact the custodian.

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:06.083
Yes, sir!

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:07.834
[MAESHIMA]
What? But why?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.500
You didn't keep to your
assigned training plan,

00:11:10.583 --> 00:11:13.792
and you've wasted our practice
time because you were selfish.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:16.375
As I thought, you're not
right for team sports.

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:18.125
We don't need you in our club,

00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:20.083
so why don't you just go ahead
and take your things--?

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:21.625
[MAESHIMA]
What the hell?!

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:23.750
You've been making me practice
baby stuff every single day

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.709
when you know I can do
so much more than that!

00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:27.125
You're wasting me!

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:29.166
Take a good look at
what I can really do!

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.375
I mean, you guys couldn't
beat me before, right?

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.375
So maybe it's time for you
to shut your fat mouth

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:35.250
and follow me for a change!

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:36.917
--[AKIMITSU] Huh?
--[JONOUCHI] Ugh.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.583
Yeah, pretty sure
Ken's talking about

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:40.375
elementary school, you guys.

00:11:40.458 --> 00:11:43.208
And there's that
attitude of yours!

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.625
Maeshima, go get ready.

00:11:45.709 --> 00:11:47.333
I've decided that
if you can beat me,

00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:49.625
then I'll let you join
the club officially.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.125
And if that happens, I'll
also propose that the coach

00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:54.041
change up your training plan.

00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.375
Seriously?

00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:56.417
For real?

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.041
But if you lose,
you do understand

00:11:58.125 --> 00:11:59.709
what's going to happen, right?

00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:02.291
I've never lost to you
in a tournament before, Sho,

00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:04.500
and I'm not starting now.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.959
[SASUGAI snoring]

00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:18.625
[phone buzzing]

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:20.000
[SASUGAI]
Huh?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
What the--?

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:25.583
Damn it, is that
seriously the time?

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:27.875
Practice has already started.

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:45.834
[SASUGAI]
Huh?

00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:47.500
Hey, what happened?

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:50.000
Oh, Sasugai, you're here.

00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:01.667
Wow. How fascinating.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.834
It's really strange.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:04.709
Ken performed so well
at the exhibition,

00:13:04.792 --> 00:13:07.375
but then in his match
against the captain,

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:09.583
he just kept crashing
and burning.

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.125
[SASUGAI]
What was the contest?

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:12.709
[KUBOTA]
They were taught a routine,

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.875
and then they had ten minutes
to practice before they started.

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:17.834
Heh.

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:19.500
Hey, Maeshima!

00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:22.417
First of all, undervaluing
the basics is a mistake.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.083
Also, you need to watch
the overconfidence, bud.

00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:27.291
Not that we won't need that
competitive spirit of yours

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:30.625
in our upcoming fight,
'cause we totally will.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.375
I told you before--
you have an uncanny ability

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:35.041
to move your body
however you want

00:13:35.125 --> 00:13:37.750
and perfectly imitate
someone else's moves.

00:13:37.834 --> 00:13:40.125
But now, it's clear that
the key to unlocking that

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:42.542
is for you to be
inspired by it first.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:44.000
You won't be able
to visualize it well

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:46.000
if you're only taught it once.

00:13:46.083 --> 00:13:48.166
So, your break from
skating is in the way

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.583
of your visualization.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:52.959
Or you could be
stupid! Who knows?

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.792
The good news is, the coach's
training plan was designed

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.750
to help your body remember
how it moved before.

00:13:58.834 --> 00:14:01.166
I don't want to admit it,
but it's well thought out.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.959
Cool. You happy now?

00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:06.375
Then get off the rink. You're
in the way of our practice.

00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:09.834
It was really my
fault this time

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:12.542
for not taking your personality
into consideration.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:16.291
Sorry. I'll take responsibility.

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:18.208
Hey, here's a thought, Kiriyama.

00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.750
If your argument
is that Maeshima

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:21.333
isn't suited to being on a team,

00:14:21.417 --> 00:14:23.500
then shouldn't you
hold a team match?

00:14:23.583 --> 00:14:25.500
And, Captain, you took
advantage of the fact

00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:27.959
that your opponent hadn't
skated for a while to win.

00:14:28.041 --> 00:14:29.125
You good with that?

00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:30.875
Okay, what do you wanna do?

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:33.750
[SASUGAI] Let's have an
inter-team match, whaddya say?

00:14:33.834 --> 00:14:35.583
Your team versus ours.

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.750
If we win, then you let us
join the club officially.

00:14:38.834 --> 00:14:40.458
[KIRIYAMA]
And if you lose?

00:14:40.542 --> 00:14:43.083
If that happens,
then I'll drop out of Ionodai.

00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:44.083
[gasps]

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.166
[KUBOTA]
You'll drop out of school?

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.542
[YUKIMITSU]
For real?

00:14:46.625 --> 00:14:48.333
So, what do you say?
Those stakes sound fair to you?

00:14:48.417 --> 00:14:50.750
Screw that!
What're you thinking?

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.875
Then I'll just drop out, too!

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.458
The question is, what're you
thinking? I'm going through--

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:57.333
It's my problem to begin with!

00:14:57.417 --> 00:15:01.208
We made a pact, didn't we?
We're in the same damn boat!

00:15:01.291 --> 00:15:02.250
Oh, jeez.

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:03.458
Anyway, that's how it is,

00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:05.917
so please think about
it very carefully.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.125
I'm sure you realize that our
futures are at stake here.

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:10.875
[growls]

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:14.083
Maeshima, you said you wanted
a more challenging practice.

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:18.041
You'd acknowledge that he's got
initiative then, right, Coach?

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.000
Here's an idea, maybe you could
go ahead and call off the match

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:25.166
since it's totally unnecessary
and just let us join the club?

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.333
Oh, no, we'll take
that bet of yours.

00:15:27.417 --> 00:15:29.375
That's what you want, right?

00:15:29.458 --> 00:15:32.166
Fine by me.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.959
We're looking at a team
match with three per side.

00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:36.917
It'll take place in a week.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.333
On your team: Captain Terauchi,

00:15:39.417 --> 00:15:41.625
Vice-Captain Kiriyama,
and Akimitsu,

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:43.917
with Yukimitsu on reserve.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.041
Uh, I'd like to point
out that I'm retired.

00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:49.417
On our team, it's Maeshima,
Jonouchi, and Himekawa,

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.583
with Kubota on reserve.

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:54.125
[YUKIMITSU] Three people
who could all skate lead.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:56.500
It's not a very balanced choice.

00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.417
Are we giving him
too much credit?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.625
Hold on, though.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.750
I don't wanna be on the
same team as this guy.

00:16:01.834 --> 00:16:04.583
We don't really have time
to do this right now, do we?

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:06.667
We'll decide positions
and starting team members

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.500
based on what happens
in this match.

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:12.166
It's something we would've
had to do anyway.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.000
Is it okay with you, Coach?

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:15.291
[ADACHI]
Go ahead.

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:17.667
That's how it'll be, then.
Jonouchi, Himekawa.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.125
Yes, sir! Got it!

00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:20.333
Yes, sir.

00:16:20.417 --> 00:16:22.625
It's all decided, then.
Time to make plans!

00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:26.166
Let's go have our first little
team meeting--it'll be fun.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.417
Oh, right, Captain,

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.125
just a thought,
but during your slow jumps,

00:16:29.208 --> 00:16:31.834
you should really try to tighten
up your core a bit more.

00:16:31.917 --> 00:16:34.041
Kiriyama, you should
lift your head more.

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:35.959
And Akimitsu,
during your Choctaw,

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:37.458
you need to put
your right foot down

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:39.375
after you push
your heel forward.

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:40.750
Anything for me?

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:41.583
Dunno.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:43.333
Uh. How mean.

00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:45.417
Are you trying to help
the enemy or what?

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.375
[SASUGAI] A challenge will
only make us better!

00:16:48.458 --> 00:16:49.792
[TERAUCHI]
Sorry about this, Coach.

00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:52.458
It's fine. Just kind of a pain.

00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:54.250
But I'll admit,
it won't be a good look

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:58.166
if the team falls apart a split
second after I become the coach.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.208
Oh, well. Let's do it.

00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:02.709
[OTHERS]
We won't let you down, sir!

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:06.792
Sorry!

00:17:06.875 --> 00:17:08.000
About what?

00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:10.333
Because all of this is my fault.

00:17:10.417 --> 00:17:12.083
You might have to drop out.

00:17:12.166 --> 00:17:13.750
Then I guess you'll
just have to do your part

00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:15.250
to make sure we don't lose.

00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:17.709
Thing is, do we even
have a chance?

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:20.542
Everyone on the other team has
regularly made it to nationals

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:22.125
since middle school.

00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.375
Although, their other guard did
end up at a different school.

00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:28.417
Yeah, I know.
Taiga Himuro, right?

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.208
He's actually the captain
of Shinozaki's team now.

00:17:31.291 --> 00:17:33.583
An elite skater at
a prestigious school.

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:35.458
Anyway, you don't need to worry.

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:38.500
I'm not really in the habit
of making bets I can't win.

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:39.667
Yeah, but--

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.083
Oh, that's right,
we still need to talk

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:43.500
about our positions
for the match.

00:17:48.959 --> 00:17:51.417
[AKIMITSU] Wow, doing what he
said makes it a lot easier

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.625
to skate on the
back outside edge.

00:17:53.709 --> 00:17:55.542
[TERAUCHI]
That Sasugai.

00:17:55.625 --> 00:17:56.750
[KIRIYAMA]
This is crazy.

00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:59.333
How'd he figure out our
weaknesses so quickly?

00:17:59.417 --> 00:18:01.291
Oh, my, it looks to me like Sasu

00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:04.083
had a legit reason to
talk big, after all.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:05.709
[ADACHI]
It can't be helped.

00:18:05.792 --> 00:18:08.834
Guess I'll have to
actually teach now.

00:18:10.542 --> 00:18:13.875
I'm gonna skate lead.
I won't hear any objections.

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.166
I started figure
skating to get girls.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.208
But in order to do that,
I need to stand out!

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:20.291
And in order to stand out,
I gotta be the star,

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:22.125
the point-getter, the lead!

00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.917
I don't get it, though.
Your position is guard, right?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.375
That's just temporary--
laying low for now.

00:18:27.458 --> 00:18:29.375
Not because you'd have
to drop out, though.

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:32.000
It's my time. I'm skating
lead, no buts about it!

00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:33.333
What the hell, dude?!

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:35.291
Then who's gonna be guard,
you thought of that?

00:18:35.375 --> 00:18:36.250
Not my job.

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:37.542
[MAESHIMA growls]

00:18:37.625 --> 00:18:39.041
Can you--?

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:41.542
No. I've never trained to do
lifts, and I don't plan to.

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:44.291
And besides that, I have no
intention of giving up the lead

00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:46.208
to somebody worse than me.

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.750
Wha--?! What're you
trying to say?

00:18:47.834 --> 00:18:49.291
You think I'm that much
worse than you?

00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:51.542
Not to be rude, but have you
ever seen yourself skate?

00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:52.917
Let's take it outside!

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.834
No, thanks.

00:18:53.917 --> 00:18:55.417
[JONOUCHI growls]

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.625
[JONOUCHI] Himekawa, you've been
like this ever since you joined!

00:18:57.709 --> 00:18:59.500
You should learn a little
something from Kubota!

00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:00.750
How the heck are
you sitting there

00:19:00.834 --> 00:19:02.375
looking like this has
nothing to do with you?

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:05.041
This is very much your
problem, too, you know.

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.625
Calm down, it's fine.

00:19:06.709 --> 00:19:08.291
Why don't we see
how practice goes

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:11.000
and then we can decide
on positions after that?

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.458
Yeah. Makes sense.

00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:14.500
Arguing here won't
do us any good.

00:19:14.583 --> 00:19:16.625
Stop acting all
leader-like, First Year!

00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:17.166
He's right.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:18.083
Shut up!

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:19.291
Ken, would you calm down?

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:20.625
You'll make trouble
for the restaurant!

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:21.750
[MAESHIMA]
You shut up, too!

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:23.208
[JONOUCHI]
No, you, Maeshima!

00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:24.583
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?!

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.333
[AKIMITSU] The coach
really is amazing, huh?

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.250
I mean, it was his first
time really trying,

00:19:30.333 --> 00:19:33.000
but all his notes and
fixes were exactly right!

00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:36.333
I feel like I've dramatically
improved in just one day!

00:19:36.417 --> 00:19:39.375
Well, don't get so excited
that you hurt yourself.

00:19:39.458 --> 00:19:40.542
[KIRIYAMA]
Hey.

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:43.667
You worried about them?
You shouldn't be.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.125
Just think about it,

00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:47.041
they're the ones who brought
up dropping out of school.

00:19:47.125 --> 00:19:49.000
Whatever happens,
it's not on you.

00:19:49.083 --> 00:19:50.542
Nah.

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:53.542
I was actually just visualizing
the new routine in my head.

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.250
I see.

00:19:56.583 --> 00:19:59.500
[KIRIYAMA] Terauchi was scouted
by St. Clavis Gakuin.

00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.959
Just like Himuro.

00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:04.333
But he gave that up so he could
go to the same high school

00:20:04.417 --> 00:20:06.625
as the rest of us.

00:20:06.709 --> 00:20:09.208
He wanted to make it
to nationals together.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.542
And now, this guy who paid
no attention to us at all

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:15.625
when we were novices,
suddenly appears out of nowhere

00:20:15.709 --> 00:20:18.667
and starts messing
everything up.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:22.083
I will not let that happen.
There's no way.

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:24.041
Terauchi doesn't deserve that.

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:25.667
If I have to, I'll--

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.709
Hey, your eyebrows are
doing that thing again.

00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:28.750
Stop that.

00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:30.792
What? Come on,
I've known you forever.

00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:32.417
Be quiet.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.417
So, what do you think
of our school rink?

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.917
I'm surprised.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.875
I never imagined a high school
would have their own rink.

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:48.041
It's no wonder the
team's invincible.

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:50.208
[HIMURO]
Kensei Maeshima.

00:20:50.291 --> 00:20:51.959
He quit figure
skating for a while,

00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:54.417
but I heard he made
a big return recently.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.834
Someone I know told me about it.

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:00.917
So what?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.083
Get this--the club at his
school is having a match

00:21:03.166 --> 00:21:04.500
between club members soon.

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:06.458
Are you interested?

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:14.166
Oh, wow.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.375
Yeah, he really is good.

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:20.333
Back in middle school, no one
ever took much notice of him.

00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:22.667
I guess because his team
never did very well.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.583
But, yeah, his
individual abilities

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.041
are pretty considerable.

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:29.041
Maeshima, if you're seriously
aiming to be number one,

00:21:29.125 --> 00:21:30.792
then he's another person
you'll have to beat

00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:32.500
in order to get there.

00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:35.458
Doesn't change
anything, though!

00:21:35.542 --> 00:21:37.250
I'm not moving from
my lead position.

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:40.542
Well, I don't have any plans of
giving up my position, either.

00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:42.417
Oh, yeah? Meet me
behind the school

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.458
and I'll teach you 'bout a
thing called "hierarchy"!

00:21:44.542 --> 00:21:47.000
No, thanks. Also,
we're not even at school.

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:48.166
I'll kick your butt,
you bastard!

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.333
[KUBOTA]
Stop, you guys!

00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:51.542
Come on, both of you,
please just stop!

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:52.917
You fired up yet?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.667
You're gonna have to
bring this team together

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.792
in order to win the match,

00:21:55.875 --> 00:21:57.542
then beat the team
Shinozaki's on,

00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:59.542
or else you won't get
to be number one.

00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:03.125
Right. Let's get it done!

00:23:34.291 --> 00:23:35.583
[SASUGAI]
Your big brother.

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:36.583
[AKIMITSU]
Yuki?

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:37.542
[SASUGAI]
What are his weaknesses?

00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:38.709
Anything wrong with him?

00:23:38.792 --> 00:23:40.083
[AKIMITSU]
Uh, why do you ask?

00:23:40.166 --> 00:23:42.041
[SASUGAI] To manipulate him
and like, take him in.

00:23:42.125 --> 00:23:44.083
[YUKIMITSU]
Sasu, don't forget the laundry!

00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:46.041
[SASUGAI]
Fine, I'm taking it in now!

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.959
[AKIMITSU]
You're the one being taken in.
