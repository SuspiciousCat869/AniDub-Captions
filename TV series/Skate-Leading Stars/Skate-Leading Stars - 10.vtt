C'mon now, Shiratama,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.067 position:50% align:center
I've known you long enough
not to fall for that.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.325 position:50% align:center

memory come from?

Where were you?
It's almost your turn to skate!

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.641 position:50% align:center
Today's the day
I'm gonna beat you,

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.268 position:50% align:center
so prepare yourself!

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.077 position:50% align:center
Why the heck
would I be dreaming

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.620 position:50% align:center
about that now?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.842 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Now, as you know,
the reason we're here today

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:58.261 position:50% align:center
at the Grand Station
Hotel Chane-Claire

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.055 position:50% align:center
is to bring you

taking place in just two days!

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.899 position:50% align:center
Shinji Takai here to report,
and joining me

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.317 position:50% align:center
is Noa Kuonji.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.361 position:50% align:center
Pleasure to be here today!

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.737 position:50% align:center
Hey, congrats!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.864 position:50% align:center
This is your first day as
a commentator, isn't it?

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.325 position:50% align:center
That's true! Pretty wild,
but I'll do my best!

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.077 position:50% align:center
And thank you!

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.745 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] The skaters have
all gathered together here

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:27.165 position:50% align:center
and are waiting anxiously
for the lottery to start.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:28.708 position:50% align:center
But for now,
let's take a look at each

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.127 position:50% align:center
of the teams that
will be competing.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.921 position:50% align:center
First, the team that
made it to the finals

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:34.297 position:50% align:center
in the eighth competition.

00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:37.092 position:50% align:center
In sixth place, Niigata
Prefectural Kogahara

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
High School.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:41.262 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] Yes. They're led by
Himekawa, the Emerald Noble,

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.722 position:50% align:center
and that group of guys
have been skating

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.808 position:50% align:center
under the same coach
since they were juniors,

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.351 position:50% align:center
which gives them an advantage.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:49.104 position:50% align:center
You can't dismiss
their strength as a team.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.271 position:50% align:center
Okay, back up.

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.065 position:50% align:center
Where did this
"Emerald Noble" come from?

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:54.275 position:50% align:center
Oh, it's just a little
nickname I gave him.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.069 position:50% align:center
He needed a fancy title!

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:57.237 position:50% align:center
Right.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.822 position:50% align:center
Next, we have the
team that's currently

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.365 position:50% align:center
ranked in fifth place.

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.827 position:50% align:center
Ehime's Matsuyama
Fukuonji High School.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.954 position:50% align:center
It's their first finals
appearance since the team

00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:09.249 position:50% align:center
was created 20 years ago,
so this is pretty momentous.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.667 position:50% align:center
And while they may not be showy,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.086 position:50% align:center
every one of them is
a highly skilled skater.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.672 position:50% align:center
Slow and steady has
won the race for them.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.382 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] By contrast,
in fourth place we have

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:20.218 position:50% align:center
Saitama Prefectural
Ionodai High School.

00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.595 position:50% align:center
Their ace, Maeshima,
has just returned to skating

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:24.014 position:50% align:center
after a five-year break.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.098 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
That's right!

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.183 position:50% align:center
The Resurrected
Young Red Dog, Maeshima.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:29.102 position:50% align:center
--Did he call me a dog?
--[DOG barks]

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:30.311 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
And don't forget his teammates,

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.355 position:50% align:center
who can compete
at the national level.

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.857 position:50% align:center
I'm already looking
forward to seeing

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
what they've cooked up
to show us at finals!

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.862 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Next, and currently
in third place,

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:41.781 position:50% align:center
is Hokkaido's Eimei
Academy High School.

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.575 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] This team's also
taking their first trip

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.035 position:50% align:center
to the Grand Prix finals.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:47.912 position:50% align:center
To place third as relative
unknowns is amazing!

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.456 position:50% align:center
They're the dark
horses flying in,

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
and I can't wait to see
how far they can go.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.961 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] And placing
second overall, from Aichi,

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.131 position:50% align:center
we have Chutei University
Kamimaezu High School.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.507 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Yes, and as we both know,

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.218 position:50% align:center
the almost uncanny unison
of the Ishikawa brothers

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.803 position:50% align:center
is a thing of beauty.

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:06.056 position:50% align:center
They've also grown more
synchronized as a team,

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.558 position:50% align:center
so I'm anticipating
a great performance.

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.518 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] And finally, we have
last year's champions

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:12.437 position:50% align:center
sitting at the top of
this prestigious list,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.938 position:50% align:center
in first place.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.441 position:50% align:center
Aiming for a consecutive win,
this time with Shinozaki,

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:18.860 position:50% align:center
is Tokyo's St. Clavis Gakuin
High School.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.653 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Their record speaks for itself!

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.198 position:50% align:center
In addition to their
Absolute Ace, Shinozaki,

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.950 position:50% align:center
and the Ruler of the Ice,
Team Japan guard Himuro,

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.952 position:50% align:center
every member of their
team has proven skill

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:29.120 position:50% align:center
and strength.

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.914 position:50% align:center
I'll say it:
they've got a stranglehold

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.708 position:50% align:center
on this competition which
won't be easy to break.

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.960 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] So! These are the six
talented teams that have

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:37.921 position:50% align:center
advanced to the
Grand Prix finals.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.297 position:50% align:center
Which one will be
this year's champion

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.132 position:50% align:center
is anybody's guess!

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:44.219 position:50% align:center
The lottery to determine
skate-order begins soon!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.428 position:50% align:center
[SHIRATAMA meows]

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.015 position:50% align:center
[HEAD JUDGE] Now let me break
down exactly how the lottery

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.517 position:50% align:center
process will work.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.186 position:50% align:center
We'll have one representative
from each of the six teams

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.562 position:50% align:center
come up to the stage.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.523 position:50% align:center
They'll all draw at
the same time for both

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.650 position:50% align:center
the short program
and free skate.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.068 position:50% align:center
The numbers they
hold in their hands

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
will represent the
team skate order

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.530 position:50% align:center
for each program.

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:05.657 position:50% align:center
I think you'll find the rules
and judging criteria

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.451 position:50% align:center
for the Grand Prix finals
extremely familiar.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.036 position:50% align:center
That's because, in the
interest of keeping things

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.830 position:50% align:center
as simple as possible,
we'll be using

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.289 position:50% align:center
the same guidelines
that were used

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:15.000 position:50% align:center
for the rest of the series.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.376 position:50% align:center
Are there any questions?

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:20.046 position:50% align:center
Then, let's begin!

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.715 position:50% align:center
Will the representatives
for each team

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.633 position:50% align:center
please come forward?

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:25.260 position:50% align:center
--I'll go.
--Good.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:27.178 position:50% align:center
--Hey, good luck!
--Good luck with what?

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:28.304 position:50% align:center
With whatever!

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.931 position:50% align:center
--Well then.
--Go!

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.729 position:50% align:center
Sit down! It's not your place;
the captain should do it!

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
Have fun up there.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.649 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir.

00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:41.651 position:50% align:center
All right, everyone, first,
we'll have you choose

00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:43.903 position:50% align:center
from the box for
the short program.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.030 position:50% align:center
Go ahead.

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.075 position:50% align:center
Wonderful.

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:51.327 position:50% align:center
Next, please choose
from the free skate box.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.829 position:50% align:center
How far will they go?

00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:54.998 position:50% align:center
Adachi and his team.

00:06:55.081 --> 00:06:57.584 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] They've just drawn
from the free skate box.

00:06:57.667 --> 00:06:59.544 position:50% align:center
Which means the skating
order for the Grand Prix

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.379 position:50% align:center
finals is decided!

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.256 position:50% align:center
This is the order
they'll follow!

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.847 position:50% align:center
All right, we're last
for the free skate!

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.057 position:50% align:center
Why is that a good thing? 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.516 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
I dunno, it feels important,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.060 position:50% align:center
like everyone'll
pay more attention

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.770 position:50% align:center
'cause they saved
the best for last!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.023 position:50% align:center
Huh? You get that it was
decided by lottery, right?

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.817 position:50% align:center
Yeah, of course I do--
it's just a feeling.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:24.444 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
We can change our strategy,

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:25.904 position:50% align:center
depending on what happens.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:28.031 position:50% align:center
We got lucky with this order.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.324 position:50% align:center
[HEAD JUDGE]
So this will be the skate-order

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
the day after tomorrow
for this year's

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:32.744 position:50% align:center
Grand Prix finals.

00:07:32.827 --> 00:07:35.330 position:50% align:center
Thank you, and
good luck, gentlemen.

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.290 position:50% align:center
Let's give our six
representatives a hand!

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
[applause]

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:42.003 position:50% align:center
[SHIRATAMA meows]

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.547 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Next up, now that the
lottery's been taken care of,

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.633 position:50% align:center
it's time for some
interviews with this year's

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.593 position:50% align:center
lineup of talented skaters.

00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.387 position:50% align:center
--Kuonji?
--Yes!

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.263 position:50% align:center
We'll see who I can get,
'cause let me tell you,

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.808 position:50% align:center
these other reporters
are pretty competitive!

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:56.393 position:50% align:center
Oh, there's Maeshima!

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.727 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA grunts]

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.979 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] Well, the red dog
sure is shy, isn't he?

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:01.564 position:50% align:center
Can't say I saw that coming!

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.067 position:50% align:center
He doesn't wash his hair.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.902 position:50% align:center
So? Neither do you,
so maybe you shouldn't

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.237 position:50% align:center
throw stones, ugly.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.280 position:50% align:center
Hajime and Susumu Ishikawa,

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.574 position:50% align:center
what do you make of
the finals skating order?

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:12.951 position:50% align:center
Thoughts?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.869 position:50% align:center
Hey, isn't this guy from that
Yokohama Super school?

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.287 position:50% align:center
Yeah, Number Two Prince,

00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:17.455 position:50% align:center
thought we'd beat him
in the finals,

00:08:17.539 --> 00:08:19.082 position:50% align:center
but his team didn't
even make it.

00:08:21.084 --> 00:08:22.669 position:50% align:center
I couldn't quite hear,
but I think you said

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:25.338 position:50% align:center
the performance is more
important than the order.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.382 position:50% align:center
So, about that performance--

00:08:27.465 --> 00:08:29.551 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA] That's
definitely not what they said.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:31.011 position:50% align:center
Listen, Noa.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:34.431 position:50% align:center
Actually, never mind, it's
prob'ly better if you don't.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.558 position:50% align:center
Hey there, Gen.
Long time no see, huh?

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.102 position:50% align:center
Looks like you're
working hard, as usual.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.228 position:50% align:center
You know how it goes--

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.272 position:50% align:center
sorry I haven't said
hi before now!

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.274 position:50% align:center
--Yo, Himekawa!
--Blast from the past!

00:08:44.357 --> 00:08:45.442 position:50% align:center
How've you been?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.776 position:50% align:center
And sorry, by the way.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.987 position:50% align:center
Wish we'd gotten to watch
the eighth competition.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.989 position:50% align:center
As fate would have it,
we had practice.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.991 position:50% align:center
No, that's fine.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.285 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] So, what's up
with you and Kuonji?

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.704 position:50% align:center
I don't want him to
throw me off my rhythm.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.831 position:50% align:center
He creates this
really weird vibe.

00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.416 position:50% align:center
To come back after
a five-year "break"

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.792 position:50% align:center
talking like that.

00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.085 position:50% align:center
We can beat him.

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.171 position:50% align:center
[IRIE]
Hey, Terahigashi!

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:08.965 position:50% align:center
You've been working pretty
hard in Hokkaido, huh?

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.759 position:50% align:center
I think it's so cool to get
to compete against

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.635 position:50% align:center
a former teammate
in the Grand Prix finals

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:13.887 position:50% align:center
like this!

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.431 position:50% align:center
Here's to both of us
doing our best, huh?

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:17.849 position:50% align:center
Keep your hands to yourself!

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:19.351 position:50% align:center
We are not friends.

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.810 position:50% align:center
Now we're enemies.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.522 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
We may've lost last year,

00:09:24.606 --> 00:09:25.982 position:50% align:center
but this time will be different.

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.650 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win nationals.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.361 position:50% align:center
--Small potatoes.
--What?

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:30.987 position:50% align:center
For us, the Grand Prix
finals are only

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.156 position:50% align:center
a stepping stone
to what comes next.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.824 position:50% align:center
World Championships
are coming up

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.409 position:50% align:center
three months after the finals.

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.161 position:50% align:center
I'm skating on Team Japan.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:41.206 position:50% align:center
And all my teammates
were invited, as well.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:44.084 position:50% align:center
I'm not saying we'll all be
part of the starting team.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:45.752 position:50% align:center
But, you know, stranger
things have been known

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.045 position:50% align:center
to happen.

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.838 position:50% align:center
The Grand Prix finals
are our chance to show

00:09:48.922 --> 00:09:50.423 position:50% align:center
that we deserve those spots.

00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.425 position:50% align:center
We have Shinozaki this year.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.427 position:50% align:center
It's our chance to
vindicate ourselves.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.721 position:50% align:center
--Himuro!
--Easy.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.264 position:50% align:center
We're just coming at this
from a different place

00:09:58.348 --> 00:09:59.349 position:50% align:center
than you guys are.

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.892 position:50% align:center
That's some big talk.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.060 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Hard to hear, huh?

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:04.312 position:50% align:center
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:06.439 position:50% align:center
If your focus is too
far away, then

00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:08.400 position:50% align:center
you'll neglect what's
right at your feet.

00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.777 position:50% align:center
Gimme a break, our
training's better than that.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:15.949 position:50% align:center
Sorry!

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:21.579 position:50% align:center
You guys look so alike.
Are you twins or somethin'?

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.873 position:50% align:center
This place is actually off
limits to the general public,

00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
so you're gonna stand out.
You should just leave.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.670 position:50% align:center
Hey, idiot, they're
in the competition.

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.006 position:50% align:center
You've skated against
them before, remember?

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.424 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:34.467 position:50% align:center
--Wanna do it?
--It's probably time.

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.177 position:50% align:center
--We watched.
--The seventh match.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.554 position:50% align:center
--What?
--They spoke!

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.014 position:50% align:center
It's outrageous!

00:10:39.097 --> 00:10:40.849 position:50% align:center
Disorder isn't the same
as modulation.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:42.392 position:50% align:center
You guys are just
strumming along based

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:43.768 position:50% align:center
solely on feeling.

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.061 position:50% align:center
It might sound like music,

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:46.438 position:50% align:center
and people might
praise it for a minute

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:48.648 position:50% align:center
because it's a novelty,
but that's all it is.

00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.109 position:50% align:center
Shallow and superficial,
no mystery at all!

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:53.445 position:50% align:center
When we perform,
we always strive for beauty!

00:10:53.528 --> 00:10:55.488 position:50% align:center
--But we do it.
--In unison.

00:10:55.572 --> 00:10:57.282 position:50% align:center
Because that's
skate-leading's very essence

00:10:57.365 --> 00:10:59.034 position:50% align:center
--and true nature.
--That's right.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.453 position:50% align:center
It's the reason for
skate-leading's existence!

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:03.496 position:50% align:center
And in that sense,
Kuonji's team is ten times

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.706 position:50% align:center
better than yours!

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.708 position:50% align:center
Because beauty
and fun can coexist.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:08.293 position:50% align:center
I'm a big fan of
the kind of beauty

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:09.669 position:50% align:center
that's born from chaos.

00:11:09.753 --> 00:11:11.629 position:50% align:center
Can you elevate it
into art, though?

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
It's always the
mavericks who can make

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:14.591 position:50% align:center
a big change.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.968 position:50% align:center
Yes, people say that,
and then they disappear.

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:19.012 position:50% align:center
'Cause they didn't
know their place.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:21.097 position:50% align:center
And we know a ton
of people like that!

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.682 position:50% align:center
--Only champs.
--[SUSUMU] Understand.

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:23.933 position:50% align:center
--[HAJIME] Not.
--[SUSUMU] A loser.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.393 position:50% align:center
--[HAJIME] Like.
--[SUSUMU] You.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.228 position:50% align:center
[COACH ISHIKAWA] Boys! What
do you think you're doing?

00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:30.231 position:50% align:center
What was that about?

00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:31.941 position:50% align:center
My apologies, Maeshima.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.485 position:50% align:center
Did they say
anything rude to you?

00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.446 position:50% align:center
--I sure hope not.
--Oh, uh, no.

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.656 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
They do have a point.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.159 position:50% align:center
So, modulation or transposition.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:42.994 position:50% align:center
We should be grateful
to the unison experts

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:44.746 position:50% align:center
'cause it can't hurt
us to hear that.

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.915 position:50% align:center
They don't have
anything to do with this.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:50.043 position:50% align:center
There's only one person
we need to focus on.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.545 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A] The idol, Ms. Ito,
said she was a fan of yours.

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:54.381 position:50% align:center
What do you think about that?

00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:55.840 position:50% align:center
Lots of women have
been talking about

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.217 position:50% align:center
how you have the best skin.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.677 position:50% align:center
Do you have a special
skin care routine

00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.928 position:50% align:center
you could share?

00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER C] What would
you say is your "type"?

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.014 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER D]
What did you eat for breakfast?

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.725 position:50% align:center
Sorry, but could you
please keep your questions

00:12:05.809 --> 00:12:07.227 position:50% align:center
focused on the competition?

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.688 position:50% align:center
Sheesh, who let the
entertainment reporters in?

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.106 position:50% align:center
It's amazing what
you've accomplished

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:13.233 position:50% align:center
after only just switching
to skate-leading.

00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:14.818 position:50% align:center
But there are still
many people out there

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.653 position:50% align:center
hoping to see you
skate singles again,

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.279 position:50% align:center
so do you have anything
to say to them?

00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:20.031 position:50% align:center
Dude! Why are you asking that?

00:12:20.115 --> 00:12:21.574 position:50% align:center
It's a good question!

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:22.992 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER A]
Depending on his answer.

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.453 position:50% align:center
[REPORTER B]
Right, it could be big news!

00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:27.789 position:50% align:center
In the beginning,
the reason I switched

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.250 position:50% align:center
was just to expand the
range of my expression.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:35.714 position:50% align:center
But now, this is
interesting in itself.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.718 position:50% align:center
To work together
with my teammates,

00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:42.303 position:50% align:center
syncing up my
performance to theirs.

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.472 position:50% align:center
In my opinion, that
particular type of communal

00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.057 position:50% align:center
expression is something
you can only feel

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:47.934 position:50% align:center
in skate-leading.

00:12:48.018 --> 00:12:50.729 position:50% align:center
I bet it's the same for
all the skaters here.

00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:52.564 position:50% align:center
I just know I can only
perform like this

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:55.025 position:50% align:center
with this team,
with these teammates.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.696 position:50% align:center
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
kind of thing.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:00.905 position:50% align:center
However...

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:02.073 position:50% align:center
However?

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.575 position:50% align:center
If at some point
I feel like I can't

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:04.868 position:50% align:center
get anything more out of it,

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.494 position:50% align:center
then I'll go right back
to singles and aim

00:13:06.578 --> 00:13:07.579 position:50% align:center
for the world.

00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.165 position:50% align:center
Wait a moment, just to clarify,

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
do you mean if you were to
win the Grand Prix finals?

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:15.628 position:50% align:center
Well, I plan on waiting until
the world championships,

00:13:15.712 --> 00:13:16.546 position:50% align:center
at least, though--

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.256 position:50% align:center
[TERAHIGASHI]
What the hell?!

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.300 position:50% align:center
I will not let you take
the joy of beating you

00:13:20.383 --> 00:13:21.718 position:50% align:center
away from me!

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.511 position:50% align:center
I'll be the one who'll
beat Shinozaki!

00:13:23.595 --> 00:13:25.638 position:50% align:center
And my team are gonna
be the champions!

00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:31.186 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that's right.
We all feel the same way.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.397 position:50% align:center
You wanna beat me?

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.319 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] This is the same
thing I saw in my dream.

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:42.572 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] People say that,
but no one has ever beaten me.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.032 position:50% align:center
[TERAHIGASHI]
What's with this guy?

00:13:44.115 --> 00:13:46.743 position:50% align:center
[IRIE]
He seems different from earlier.

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.495 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI]
Man, Shinozaki usually seems

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.080 position:50% align:center
kind of distant and scattered,

00:13:50.163 --> 00:13:52.123 position:50% align:center
but when he really focuses
on the competition,

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:54.084 position:50% align:center
he changes completely.

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.628 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI] Please don't
make me repeat myself.

00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:58.421 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI] He has this
other face that says,

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:00.006 position:50% align:center
"I'm number one here."

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.259 position:50% align:center
No, that's his true self.

00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.011 position:50% align:center
The king on the ice
who overwhelms

00:14:05.095 --> 00:14:06.471 position:50% align:center
everyone else.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.140 position:50% align:center
That's who Reo Shinozaki is.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.809 position:50% align:center
Sorry to tell you this,
but none of you

00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:12.102 position:50% align:center
will ever beat me.

00:14:19.693 --> 00:14:21.152 position:50% align:center
Sorry to tell you this,
but none of you

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:23.321 position:50% align:center
will ever beat me.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:25.407 position:50% align:center
[MC A]
That really took me by surprise.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.158 position:50% align:center
This is the first time
he's ever said anything

00:14:27.242 --> 00:14:29.035 position:50% align:center
like that, isn't it, Kuonji?

00:14:29.119 --> 00:14:30.453 position:50% align:center
Yes, very true.

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:32.747 position:50% align:center
It's the first sign we've
ever had that Shinozaki

00:14:32.831 --> 00:14:35.667 position:50% align:center
is actually conscious of
the threat of competition.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
I mean, he's certainly never
said that to me before.

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:41.423 position:50% align:center
Well, this time, I'd say
he's made himself clear.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.299 position:50% align:center
Which makes me even more
excited to check out

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:44.801 position:50% align:center
tomorrow's Grand Prix finals!

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:45.927 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Mm-hmm.

00:14:50.974 --> 00:14:52.392 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] All right,
I think that's about it

00:14:52.475 --> 00:14:53.643 position:50% align:center
for today's practice.

00:14:53.727 --> 00:14:55.520 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir. Thank you very much!

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.647 position:50% align:center
Make sure you get
good rest tonight.

00:14:57.731 --> 00:14:59.232 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow is the real deal.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.442 position:50% align:center
You need all your strength.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:01.693 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.701 position:50% align:center
He seems pissed off.

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.036 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:12.579 position:50% align:center
Hey, do you feel like
grabbing something to eat?

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.456 position:50% align:center
Since we finished
up early and all.

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:15.665 position:50% align:center
I'm going home.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:17.042 position:50% align:center
C'mon, it's just for a bit!

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.501 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU laughs]

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.547 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Maeshima, do you have a minute?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.341 position:50% align:center
Uh... I guess.

00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:28.636 position:50% align:center
What, really? Your treat?

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.639 position:50% align:center
Think of it as a pep rally
before the competition.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:32.891 position:50% align:center
It won't take long.

00:15:32.974 --> 00:15:34.392 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
If you say so, Captain.

00:15:34.476 --> 00:15:35.685 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Thanks for treating!

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.145 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:42.400 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] Well, what was it
you wanted to talk about?

00:15:42.484 --> 00:15:43.485 position:50% align:center
Just tell me.

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:48.615 position:50% align:center
I'm going home.

00:15:48.698 --> 00:15:51.034 position:50% align:center
So, today's weather was
pretty nice, wasn't it?

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.327 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Huh?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.662 position:50% align:center
I sure hope we get that
lucky again tomorrow.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:55.997 position:50% align:center
Seriously?

00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
If you have something
to say, then just say it!

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:59.542 position:50% align:center
Or else I'm gonna go!

00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.086 position:50% align:center
Okay, fine.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:02.504 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Good.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.714 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
I... I hate you.

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:05.674 position:50% align:center
Huh?

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:06.925 position:50% align:center
More accurately,

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:10.011 position:50% align:center
I hated you, like, past-tense.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:11.513 position:50% align:center
We've worked for two
and a half years

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:13.264 position:50% align:center
trying to win nationals.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:15.058 position:50% align:center
And just when we thought,
"This is the year,"

00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.810 position:50% align:center
you showed up.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.728 position:50% align:center
As expected, you brought
a certain level

00:16:18.812 --> 00:16:20.313 position:50% align:center
of chaos with you.

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:22.148 position:50% align:center
But your obsession with
winning did transform

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
the team, and I mean
that in the best way.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.986 position:50% align:center
There's a sense
of possibility this year

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.032 position:50% align:center
that I didn't feel at the
Grand Prix finals last year.

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.034 position:50% align:center
So, I'm thankful.

00:16:33.118 --> 00:16:35.078 position:50% align:center
For us third years,
these Grand Prix finals

00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:38.456 position:50% align:center
will be our very last
high school competition.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.584 position:50% align:center
But even if we can't win
at nationals this year,

00:16:41.668 --> 00:16:43.628 position:50% align:center
you'll still have
two years left.

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:46.297 position:50% align:center
A whole new batch of first-years
could really change the team.

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:47.424 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
What are you saying?

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:48.883 position:50% align:center
Have you already given up?

00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:49.843 position:50% align:center
No, that's not--

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.302 position:50% align:center
Yes, you have, I can see it!

00:16:51.386 --> 00:16:53.555 position:50% align:center
There's no next year
or year after that!

00:16:53.638 --> 00:16:54.973 position:50% align:center
I know you heard it, too!

00:16:55.056 --> 00:16:57.392 position:50% align:center
If we don't crush Shinozaki
in the finals right now,

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:59.686 position:50% align:center
then he's gonna
go back to singles.

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:02.230 position:50% align:center
And Himuro was talking about
world champions, right?

00:17:02.313 --> 00:17:04.024 position:50% align:center
I mean, come on, think about it:

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:05.859 position:50% align:center
this might be your
once-in-a-lifetime,

00:17:05.942 --> 00:17:07.986 position:50% align:center
first and last chance
to beat Himuro!

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.446 position:50% align:center
Stop acting like a wuss!

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:11.281 position:50% align:center
If you've got time to cheer
up an underclassman--

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:12.907 position:50% align:center
Enough! You need to learn
to speak to people

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.242 position:50% align:center
with more respect!

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.661 position:50% align:center
Why are you always the
worst at things like that?

00:17:16.745 --> 00:17:18.038 position:50% align:center
When you've obviously
been blessed with

00:17:18.121 --> 00:17:19.956 position:50% align:center
so much talent.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.459 position:50% align:center
Well, I mean...

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:25.837 position:50% align:center
I've got my hands full
worrying about myself, here.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.589 position:50% align:center
And I guess I don't
know what to say

00:17:27.672 --> 00:17:28.923 position:50% align:center
to get you fired up.

00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:34.512 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Hmph. Well, that
was gloriously awkward.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
If you're gonna be thankful,

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.310 position:50% align:center
then you should wait till
after we beat those guys

00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.896 position:50% align:center
and win this amazing
victory together, right?

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:44.939 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
You're right. Fine.

00:17:45.023 --> 00:17:47.317 position:50% align:center
But listen.
Careful what you say.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.902 position:50% align:center
Right. Will do.

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:54.074 position:50% align:center
You were waiting?

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:55.283 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI]
Where's Maeshima?

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:57.243 position:50% align:center
He said he'd be out
after he called home.

00:17:57.327 --> 00:18:00.830 position:50% align:center
Well, Sasugai already left.
We should hurry.

00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:01.790 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
Sorry.

00:18:01.873 --> 00:18:03.249 position:50% align:center
About what?

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.710 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] No matter what
happens, tomorrow's the end.

00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:06.920 position:50% align:center
Let's kill it.

00:18:07.003 --> 00:18:09.172 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Yep.
We'll give it all we've got.

00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:10.507 position:50% align:center
No regrets.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.592 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] Hey, that time
with the protein bar,

00:18:12.676 --> 00:18:14.511 position:50% align:center
does Maeshima
even like chocolate?

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.721 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] I think he's
more of a curry guy.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:18.682 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] Wait, that's,
like, a whole meal.

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:26.731 position:50% align:center
Going for a run?

00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.024 position:50% align:center
My routine.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.818 position:50% align:center
Well, try not to
get lost or anything.

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:31.695 position:50% align:center
Yep. I'm fine.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.863 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Himekawa.

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:35.782 position:50% align:center
How 'bout letting
us go with you.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.534 position:50% align:center
I can't relax for some reason.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.953 position:50% align:center
Huh? Okay, sure.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.287 position:50% align:center
It's ten kilometers.

00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:43.289 position:50% align:center
[SHUNOBON] Oof, too far,
let's trim it down.

00:18:43.373 --> 00:18:45.709 position:50% align:center
[AJIKATA] I mean, we can't
get too worn out, after all.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.460 position:50% align:center
[GROUP laughs]

00:19:09.733 --> 00:19:11.276 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] I was surprised
when he suddenly started

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:13.194 position:50% align:center
talking about singles again.

00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:14.696 position:50% align:center
Did you know, Taiga?

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:17.574 position:50% align:center
I didn't, but I did
have a feeling.

00:19:17.657 --> 00:19:20.243 position:50% align:center
I'm just using him to get
my consecutive wins.

00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:21.619 position:50% align:center
It'll be good enough
if he stays through

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:23.288 position:50% align:center
the world championships.

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.665 position:50% align:center
There won't be any
consecutive wins.

00:19:25.749 --> 00:19:27.709 position:50% align:center
Because we'll be
the champs tomorrow.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.961 position:50% align:center
Nah, sorry, the day's ours.

00:19:30.045 --> 00:19:31.921 position:50% align:center
I can't even picture us losing.

00:19:32.005 --> 00:19:33.631 position:50% align:center
That's how much
confidence I have in what

00:19:33.715 --> 00:19:35.342 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki can do.

00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:46.561 position:50% align:center
Good job, very nice.

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:48.688 position:50% align:center
Lemme guess, you're
painstakingly checking

00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:51.191 position:50% align:center
positions and sharpening
up the movement.

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.151 position:50% align:center
Of course, it already
looks polished,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:55.403 position:50% align:center
as expected from my big brother.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:56.321 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Hayato.

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:58.239 position:50% align:center
I came to declare war.

00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:00.450 position:50% align:center
Tomorrow, we're the
ones who're gonna win.

00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:02.911 position:50% align:center
What's with the face?

00:20:02.994 --> 00:20:05.288 position:50% align:center
It's an old line.
I'm tired of hearing it.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:08.625 position:50% align:center
Well, it's a necessary ritual.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.502 position:50% align:center
Man, this takes me back.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.295 position:50% align:center
We used to skate
together all the time.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.562 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Yeah. We did.

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:32.107 position:50% align:center
Thinking back, that
might've been the origin

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.734 position:50% align:center
of my love for the sport.

00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.737 position:50% align:center
But of course, now,
as you can see,

00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:39.739 position:50% align:center
I'm a decrepit piece of junk.

00:20:39.823 --> 00:20:42.701 position:50% align:center
Ha. I forced myself to
rent some skates,

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:45.286 position:50% align:center
but I guess it's impossible.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:46.705 position:50% align:center
This is the last time
we're gonna be

00:20:46.788 --> 00:20:48.748 position:50% align:center
on the ice together.

00:20:48.832 --> 00:20:49.833 position:50% align:center
Later.

00:20:49.916 --> 00:20:51.918 position:50% align:center
I've declared war,
so I'm going home.

00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:53.086 position:50% align:center
Hayato.

00:20:54.087 --> 00:20:55.839 position:50% align:center
I'm glad that you came by.

00:20:55.922 --> 00:20:58.133 position:50% align:center
I wanted to thank you
before the competition.

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:00.260 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
Huh?

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:01.886 position:50% align:center
It's about Maeshima.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:03.596 position:50% align:center
Thank you for calling
him back to skating

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.266 position:50% align:center
and for encouraging him to grow.

00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.560 position:50% align:center
It's actually a great
motivation for me.

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.939 position:50% align:center
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:16.151 position:50% align:center
That's the one thing I've always
hated about you, brother.

00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:17.902 position:50% align:center
How you look at people
and see nothing more

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:19.487 position:50% align:center
than stepping stones.

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.531 position:50% align:center
But I'm happy. This is good.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:24.200 position:50% align:center
I haven't been excited about
a competition in a while.

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:37.964 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
This time,

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:39.841 position:50% align:center
I won't let you pass me up.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.221 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
Welcome!

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.723 position:50% align:center
The competition to
determine this year's

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.934 position:50% align:center
Number-one team in
Japan is about to begin!

00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.394 position:50% align:center
The last match of
the Boys' High School

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:53.313 position:50% align:center
Skate-Leading Grand Prix Series.

00:21:53.396 --> 00:21:55.106 position:50% align:center
The Grand Prix finals!

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.317 position:50% align:center
Which team will win
the laurels of victory?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
Well, it's anybody's game!

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.237 position:50% align:center
Hold on, folks!

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:04.157 position:50% align:center
This fateful match is
finally about to begin!

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.877 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO] Wasn't Yukimitsu
pushier in middle school

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.503 position:50% align:center
or did I dream that?

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.464 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA] Not much has changed
since we were beginners.

00:23:42.547 --> 00:23:43.923 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Well, there was
that time when he shaved

00:23:44.007 --> 00:23:45.300 position:50% align:center
his head.

00:23:45.383 --> 00:23:46.551 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU] In college,
I'm thinking I'll try being

00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.303 position:50% align:center
a mysterious Russian
who can train snakes

00:23:48.386 --> 00:23:49.554 position:50% align:center
and hawks.
What do you think?

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:50.722 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
That college doesn't exist.
