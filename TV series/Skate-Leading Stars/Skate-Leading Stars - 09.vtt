00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.598 position:50% align:center
[ADACHI] At the last match,
you guys definitely

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.350 position:50% align:center
discovered a new weapon.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.144 position:50% align:center
But you can't let that
fool you into thinking

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.271 position:50% align:center
you've already
reached the end goal.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.856 position:50% align:center
You should see it
as a starting point

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.483 position:50% align:center
for developing even better
moves to compete with.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.152 position:50% align:center
Just keep in mind,
if you sacrifice

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.863 position:50% align:center
team cohesion for flair,
then you're done.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.032 position:50% align:center
Wing and guards,
widen your fields of view.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.742 position:50% align:center
Be mindful of the
triangle formation

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.410 position:50% align:center
and adjust accordingly.

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.620 position:50% align:center
The key is to aim equally
for synchronization

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.830 position:50% align:center
and skill.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.665 position:50% align:center
You should be striving
for a perfect union

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.459 position:50% align:center
of unexpected, dynamic movement

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.045 position:50% align:center
and a precisely
calculated routine.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.255 position:50% align:center
Frankly, as far as
skilled individuals go,

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.966 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis Gakuin and
Chutei University High

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.051 position:50% align:center
both have us beat.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.719 position:50% align:center
But the skill of
each team as a whole

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.471 position:50% align:center
is a different story.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.056 position:50% align:center
All right, let's get to work.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:57.724 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes, sir!

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.196 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA]
Aiming to perfect both our style

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.073 position:50% align:center
and the issues the
coach pointed out,

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.117 position:50% align:center
we began to practice.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.411 position:50% align:center
Naturally, it wasn't
all smooth sailing,

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.413 position:50% align:center
and we didn't always
see eye to eye.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.458 position:50% align:center
But we were united in our
goal of refining the routine,

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.917 position:50% align:center
and I think everyone
could agree that we

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.462 position:50% align:center
improved greatly by the day.

00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.881 position:50% align:center
Then, we finally skated in
the seventh competition

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:53.965 position:50% align:center
of the series.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.259 position:50% align:center
Our third and last
preliminary match.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:57.719 position:50% align:center
Everything hinged on it.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:02.307 position:50% align:center
We won the short
program and free skate.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.060 position:50% align:center
So naturally, we came
in first and won the day.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.023 position:50% align:center
We're fourth overall!

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:11.816 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we've pretty
much secured a spot

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.193 position:50% align:center
at the Grand Prix finals.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.319 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yes!

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.073 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] The fourth competition
against Shinozaki's team

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.282 position:50% align:center
did it for us.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.035 position:50% align:center
That score would've
topped any other match.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.371 position:50% align:center
It made up for our loss
at the first competition.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:27.415 position:50% align:center
Will you stop sulking?

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.000 position:50% align:center
I'm not sulking!

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:30.710 position:50% align:center
So, Taiga's team's first?

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.170 position:50% align:center
I guess we expected that.

00:03:32.253 --> 00:03:34.339 position:50% align:center
Well, they do have Shinozaki.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:36.257 position:50% align:center
And Chutei High with
the Ishikawa brothers

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.593 position:50% align:center
is second, huh?
No surprise there.

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:39.886 position:50% align:center
Who's in third and fifth?

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.805 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Hokkaido's Eimei
Academy and Ehime's

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.848 position:50% align:center
Matsuyama Fukuonji.

00:03:43.932 --> 00:03:45.850 position:50% align:center
Both are first timers
to the finals,

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:48.228 position:50% align:center
and it's the first school
from Ehime ever.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.980 position:50% align:center
The top five teams are pretty
much set for the finals.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.524 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU]
Really?

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:54.442 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] There's a wide point
gap between fifth and sixth.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.653 position:50% align:center
I just don't see it
happening, you know?

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:57.821 position:50% align:center
Not now.

00:03:57.904 --> 00:03:59.364 position:50% align:center
There aren't any schools
that can clear it

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.032 position:50% align:center
with a single match remaining.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.992 position:50% align:center
So, who's in the
running for sixth?

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:06.246 position:50% align:center
There are two left
who stand a chance:

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.040 position:50% align:center
Himekawa's team and Kuonji's.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.003 position:50% align:center
Wow, you're amazing, Kuonji!

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.046 position:50% align:center
Didn't you just establish
the club this year?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.464 position:50% align:center
Oh, you're too kind.

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.800 position:50% align:center
It's all thanks to
these guys' hard work.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.010 position:50% align:center
[MC A]
Well, you've come this far,

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.761 position:50% align:center
so I assume you
aim to take first

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.430 position:50% align:center
in the eighth competition
to qualify for

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.056 position:50% align:center
the Grand Prix finals!

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.017 position:50% align:center
We can't let you down
now, can we?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.810 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best!

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.646 position:50% align:center
We'll be rooting for you.
Let's hear it, everyone!

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.064 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP] Miá*Leon!
--Noa!

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.524 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP] Miá*Leon!
--Noa!

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.860 position:50% align:center
--[GROUP] Miá*Leon!
--Noa!

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:38.778 position:50% align:center
I hope you'll
cheer them on, too!

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.281 position:50% align:center
Yes, please, we love you!

00:04:41.364 --> 00:04:42.615 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
What?!

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:47.620 position:50% align:center
Hey. What's up, guys?

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:48.913 position:50% align:center
Number Two Prince.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.290 position:50% align:center
[KIRIYAMA]
What are you doing here?

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.292 position:50% align:center
You were like, just on TV.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.626 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I just left there.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.796 position:50% align:center
Can I have a minute?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.220 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA] What'd you bring
me all the way out here for?

00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:05.305 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Sorry!

00:05:06.348 --> 00:05:08.516 position:50% align:center
I came to apologize.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.310 position:50% align:center
I invited you to
be a part of my team

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.562 position:50% align:center
a little while back,
do you remember that?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.899 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I seem to remember
turning you down.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.318 position:50% align:center
Well, now I'd like
to retract that offer.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.736 position:50% align:center
But I already refused it!

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.364 position:50% align:center
The thing is, all my teammates
were complete amateurs

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:23.531 position:50% align:center
in the beginning.

00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.451 position:50% align:center
But they worked
hard for the team,

00:05:26.534 --> 00:05:28.411 position:50% align:center
finding spare moments to
in their busy schedules

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.706 position:50% align:center
to practice, on top of the idol
stuff that they handle.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.625 position:50% align:center
It's at least partly
thanks to their efforts

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.127 position:50% align:center
that the Grand Prix finals
are now within reach.

00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.420 position:50% align:center
I'm not gonna lie, though,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.589 position:50% align:center
it's almost totally
thanks to me!

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:40.799 position:50% align:center
Jeez.

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:44.719 position:50% align:center
But I'm not kidding
about all their work.

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:46.888 position:50% align:center
This team committed
to following me despite

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:48.765 position:50% align:center
their various circumstances,

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.101 position:50% align:center
and now I feel like
I can't betray them.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.770 position:50% align:center
So, I'm sorry, but the
offer is off the table.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.021 position:50% align:center
Hold on, I never even--

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.023 position:50% align:center
And in exchange,
I'm going to build a team

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.526 position:50% align:center
and invite all of you
guys to join up, 'kay?

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:00.985 position:50% align:center
And that's a promise.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.028 position:50% align:center
But you really don't--

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.446 position:50% align:center
I'm so glad.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.906 position:50% align:center
Though I had no doubt you
would consent, of course.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:06.324 position:50% align:center
Would you listen to me?

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.160 position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, but I'm
afraid I've got to run.

00:06:09.244 --> 00:06:10.120 position:50% align:center
See ya later.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:11.496 position:50% align:center
Wait just a minute!

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.290 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] Oh, right,
I almost forgot, didn't I?

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.168 position:50% align:center
My team will be the champions
of the Grand Prix finals.

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:18.253 position:50% align:center
[phone rings]

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.005 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Yes, hello, is my manager there?

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.799 position:50% align:center
It's about my interview tonight.
Gimme those deets!

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.551 position:50% align:center
[laughing]

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.014 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
What do I think of Noa Kuonji?

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.056 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Yeah.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.307 position:50% align:center
You've competed
against him before,

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.393 position:50% align:center
so I thought you might
have a few thoughts.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.186 position:50% align:center
Do you?

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
Look, he was at the
competitions in Montreal

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.149 position:50% align:center
and Vancouver when
we were all juniors.

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.609 position:50% align:center
Aw. I do love maple syrup.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:43.028 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
You forgot about him?

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:44.154 position:50% align:center
A loud nuisance.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.489 position:50% align:center
What's he like as a competitor?

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:48.116 position:50% align:center
Well, Kurayoshi?

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.993 position:50% align:center
He has a unique personality.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.579 position:50% align:center
He's always positive and
he isn't afraid to mess up.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:55.540 position:50% align:center
I got the impression he
liked using risky elements.

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:56.958 position:50% align:center
Although, back in those days,

00:06:57.042 --> 00:06:58.793 position:50% align:center
he didn't quite have
the build for it yet.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.211 position:50% align:center
He made a lot of mistakes.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:01.838 position:50% align:center
Does he have the
build for it now?

00:07:01.921 --> 00:07:03.131 position:50% align:center
I don't know.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
It's all about body weight
and muscle mass.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.510 position:50% align:center
From the look of it,
he could be right on track.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.804 position:50% align:center
I know the talk's
all about Kuonji,

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:12.474 position:50% align:center
but we should actually watch
out for Himekawa, too.

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:13.600 position:50% align:center
Definitely.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:15.602 position:50% align:center
Terauchi's team lost
a valuable player

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.979 position:50% align:center
when Himekawa left and
took his skill set with him.

00:07:18.063 --> 00:07:19.397 position:50% align:center
I've known him since I was a kid

00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.150 position:50% align:center
and I can tell you he's the
exact opposite of Kuonji

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.402 position:50% align:center
and he's always
super consistent.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.988 position:50% align:center
And at a really high level, too.

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.991 position:50% align:center
To say he's not the talkative
type is an understatement.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:31.701 position:50% align:center
But deep down,
he's got this fiery,

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.870 position:50% align:center
competitive spirit
that really drives him.

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.542 position:50% align:center

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:41.795 position:50% align:center
Are you okay?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.380 position:50% align:center
Yeah. I'm fine.

00:07:43.463 --> 00:07:46.299 position:50% align:center
Hey, sorry,
I'll keep up next time.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:47.759 position:50% align:center
I know you will.

00:07:47.842 --> 00:07:50.011 position:50% align:center
[KUMADA]
That's enough. 20-minute break.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.939 position:50% align:center
I heard you stayed late
practicing on your own

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:02.941 position:50% align:center
last night, too.

00:08:03.024 --> 00:08:05.485 position:50% align:center
Listen, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:06.778 position:50% align:center
but before a competition--

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.029 position:50% align:center
Yes, I know.

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.365 position:50% align:center
Don't push myself
and rest my body.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.493 position:50% align:center
Thing is, I'm this
team's ace. So...

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.871 position:50% align:center
With one lead, their
performance has a greater

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.581 position:50% align:center
impact on the score.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.834 position:50% align:center
I won't let this end
before making finals!

00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.217 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
One, two, three, four.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.553 position:50% align:center
One, two, three, four. One.

00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:34.639 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI chuckles]

00:08:36.975 --> 00:08:38.560 position:50% align:center
So, you're still at it, then?

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.769 position:50% align:center
Oh. Manager.

00:08:39.853 --> 00:08:41.146 position:50% align:center
How long have you been here?

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:43.982 position:50% align:center
Don't worry. I've still
got changes of clothes.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.233 position:50% align:center
Where are the others?

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.359 position:50% align:center
[MANAGER A]
I sent them home.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:48.153 position:50% align:center
They had a shoot
hiking a mountain.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.280 position:50% align:center
Wanted to play it safe.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.906 position:50% align:center
Yeah, that sounds rough.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
Please finish up
soon, all right?

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.035 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
'Kay. Thanks.

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.126 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Kiriyama, Yuki,
and I are gonna go watch

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.378 position:50% align:center
the eighth competition today.

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:07.047 position:50% align:center
It's not too far from here.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.966 position:50% align:center
And I'll be tagging along
to scout the enemy.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.259 position:50% align:center
What'll you guys do?

00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:12.761 position:50% align:center
I'm gonna be practicing.

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.597 position:50% align:center
Same here.
Gotta work some iffy spots.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.223 position:50% align:center
I'm staying 'cause
I promised Jonouchi

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
I'd be his practice partner.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.894 position:50% align:center
And of course, I'll be
here practicing, too.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.646 position:50% align:center
Well, this blows.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.981 position:50% align:center
Why would you bother
asking if I don't

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.399 position:50% align:center
have a choice, anyway?

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.527 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] We're close
to the finish, folks!

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.654 position:50% align:center
With the chance to skate
in the Grand Prix finals

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.074 position:50% align:center
on the line, it's the eighth
and last competition

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.700 position:50% align:center
of the Boys' High
School Skate-Leading

00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
Grand Prix!

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:39.162 position:50% align:center
For better or worse,
today will decide

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.455 position:50% align:center
which six teams
will be competing

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.749 position:50% align:center
in the Grand Prix finals!

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.669 position:50% align:center
But we have a rare encounter
of two top-class schools.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.170 position:50% align:center
Yeah, we sure do.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.255 position:50% align:center
First, we have
Kogahara High School,

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.800 position:50% align:center
which is headed up by
their ace, Himekawa.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.593 position:50% align:center
Skating against them,
we have Yokohama Super

00:09:53.677 --> 00:09:56.346 position:50% align:center
Global High School,
led by their ace, Kuonji.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.972 position:50% align:center
It's an exciting pairing!

00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.767 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] The fateful eighth
competition will soon begin!

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.065 position:50% align:center
Don't tell me, you came
here to cheer me on,

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.525 position:50% align:center
didn't you, Maeshima?

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:09.859 position:50% align:center
Wait, what? No!

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:12.153 position:50% align:center
Aw, that's so sweet!

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:14.114 position:50% align:center
Didn't you hear
what I said? I'm not!

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:17.200 position:50% align:center
[laughs]
I'll be cheering for you!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.535 position:50% align:center
You're gonna kill it!

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.161 position:50% align:center
Also, I just bought
your new song,

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:21.663 position:50% align:center
"Love Passion on the Rink"!

00:10:21.746 --> 00:10:23.540 position:50% align:center
Oh! Thank you so much!

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:24.541 position:50% align:center
We'll do our best!

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.542 position:50% align:center
You're gonna watch, right?

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:26.710 position:50% align:center
Yeah, please watch.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:28.712 position:50% align:center
Our shining performance
of dreams!

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:30.505 position:50% align:center
Oh. I will.

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.799 position:50% align:center
--[KIRIYAMA] Himekawa.
--[GROUP] Huh?

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:35.719 position:50% align:center
[TERAUCHI] Mr. Kumada, thank you
for your help the other day.

00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:37.804 position:50% align:center
There's no need for that.
Go ahead.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.016 position:50% align:center
Hey, it's been a while.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:42.726 position:50% align:center
Though I guess it doesn't
feel that way since

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.769 position:50% align:center
I've seen you at competitions.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.104 position:50% align:center
Hey.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.273 position:50% align:center
Losing you really was
a heavy blow to our team,

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.941 position:50% align:center
and we've been
recovering ever since.

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:53.069 position:50% align:center
I didn't have a problem
with the team or anything.

00:10:53.153 --> 00:10:54.320 position:50% align:center
I was just--

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:56.573 position:50% align:center
No need to explain.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.576 position:50% align:center
Looks like you'll be able
to keep the promise we made.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.620 position:50% align:center
We'll meet you at nationals.

00:11:02.704 --> 00:11:04.956 position:50% align:center
So, I guess we'll
see you at finals.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.958 position:50% align:center
Yeah, I'll be there.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.501 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Are you sure, though?

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.170 position:50% align:center
I mean, you know
what they always say,

00:11:10.253 --> 00:11:11.880 position:50% align:center
don't count your chickens
before they hatch,

00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.340 position:50% align:center
am I right?
Here's the deal.

00:11:13.423 --> 00:11:15.925 position:50% align:center
I know you guys are
strong, Himekawa.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.303 position:50% align:center
But the ones to win a spot
at the Grand Prix finals

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:19.971 position:50% align:center
will obviously be us.

00:11:20.055 --> 00:11:21.181 position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.391 position:50% align:center
I know that you guys
are very strong, too.

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.643 position:50% align:center
But the ones to earn
a ticket to the finals

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:26.811 position:50% align:center
will be us.

00:11:26.895 --> 00:11:28.188 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Hmm.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.774 position:50% align:center
Sounds like we'll both
just have to give it our all.

00:11:30.857 --> 00:11:31.858 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:40.992 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Folks, we're
now halfway through the eighth

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:43.745 position:50% align:center
competition of the
Grand Prix Series.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:46.164 position:50% align:center
All six teams have finished
their short programs,

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.833 position:50% align:center
so we've reached our
brief intermission.

00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
You're watching, after all?

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.337 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] We're on break
right now, aren't we?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.797 position:50% align:center
I'm just trying to kill time.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.050 position:50% align:center
Welcome back everyone.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.177 position:50% align:center
Now let's review
the current standings.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.680 position:50% align:center
In first after the short
program is Niigata's

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.139 position:50% align:center
Kogahara High School.

00:12:03.223 --> 00:12:04.974 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] They've made
such huge progress getting

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:05.975 position:50% align:center
this far.

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.352 position:50% align:center
And their teamwork
has undoubtedly

00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.104 position:50% align:center
grown stronger over time.

00:12:09.187 --> 00:12:10.397 position:50% align:center
Next, in a close second,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.817 position:50% align:center
is Kanagawa's Yokohama
Super Global High School.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.610 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B] He may have
just switched to team skating,

00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:17.696 position:50% align:center
but Kuonji is still very strong!

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:20.365 position:50% align:center
And his teammates are expressive
and not to be taken lightly.

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.077 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Behind them
with a larger point gap

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.040 position:50% align:center
are Fukushima's Kusano Mukaibara
and Wakayama's Tanabe Ryujin.

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.375 position:50% align:center
Your thoughts, Ms. Abe?

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:32.168 position:50% align:center
Who will you be
keeping your eyes on?

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.796 position:50% align:center
I'll definitely be looking out
for Kogahara High School

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.172 position:50% align:center
and Yokohama Super Global,

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.967 position:50% align:center
who are both vying for
a spot at the finals, 

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
but I hope to see the other
teams put up a fight

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.680 position:50% align:center
and achieve the highest
overall scores they can.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.098 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
Agreed!

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.684 position:50% align:center
And now, the momentous free
skate is about to begin.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:51.312 position:50% align:center
First up to skate is Hiroshima's
Aki Shoshikan High School.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.647 position:50% align:center
Let's see how they do!

00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:03.199 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA humming]

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.659 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
The heck is all that?

00:13:04.743 --> 00:13:07.787 position:50% align:center
You mean you can't tell?
Limited-edition merch, buddy!

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.998 position:50% align:center
Not gonna give you any
even if you ask nice.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.291 position:50% align:center
What are you, five?

00:13:11.374 --> 00:13:13.877 position:50% align:center
Better be careful not
to talk to strangers.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.920 position:50% align:center
How do you think
this will turn out?

00:13:16.004 --> 00:13:17.005 position:50% align:center
Any clue?

00:13:17.088 --> 00:13:18.715 position:50% align:center
Even without my bias
for Himekawa

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.508 position:50% align:center
as an old teammate.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:23.136 position:50% align:center
I would say his team
has the advantage.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.722 position:50% align:center
There's a difference
in experience level.

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.766 position:50% align:center
And they've got the benefit
of having the same coach

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.684 position:50% align:center
since they were juniors,
so their team

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:31.478 position:50% align:center
cohesion's super strong.

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.646 position:50% align:center
Yeah, but Yokohama
Super Global High School

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.815 position:50% align:center
has Kuonji,
and he's no joke.

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.276 position:50% align:center
From what I've heard,
he's Shinozaki's old rival.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.403 position:50% align:center
I'm the one who's
gonna beat Shinozaki.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:43.531 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah. We know already.
Stay, stay.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:46.451 position:50% align:center
You've said that before.
What's "stay" mean anyway?

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:47.911 position:50% align:center
Keep your calm, man.

00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:51.706 position:50% align:center
Uh, like, it means you're
cooler when you remain calm.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:52.874 position:50% align:center
[MAESHIMA]
Huh...

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:54.334 position:50% align:center
Going back to what
we were saying,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:56.419 position:50% align:center
Kuonji's teammates'
skill levels are actually

00:13:56.503 --> 00:13:58.922 position:50% align:center
a total mystery.
They seem like entertai--

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:00.465 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
You don't believe in Rui's team?

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:01.716 position:50% align:center
I'm shocked!

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.218 position:50% align:center
No! That's not what I meant--

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.428 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU] Do you even get
how hard they've worked? Hm?

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:06.721 position:50% align:center
Right, um, I'm sorry--

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.598 position:50% align:center
[YUKIMITSU]
I'm not digging for an apology!

00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.767 position:50% align:center
The thing is, being unknown
doesn't necessarily

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.935 position:50% align:center
mean they're unskilled.

00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:13.478 position:50% align:center
Yes! That! Thank you!

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.190 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] Preparation for
the second half of the free

00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:18.942 position:50% align:center
skate will begin shortly.

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.194 position:50% align:center
This concludes the
six-minute warmup.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:24.823 position:50% align:center
Skaters, please leave the ice.
Repeat...

00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.366 position:50% align:center
Guys, you've done
great sticking with me

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.617 position:50% align:center
up until now.

00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:29.536 position:50% align:center
And here we are with
our final performance

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:31.788 position:50% align:center
of the series about to start.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:33.581 position:50% align:center
I'm sure sometimes
you've gotten angry

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:35.583 position:50% align:center
and frustrated, or at
least wanted to ditch

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:36.960 position:50% align:center
my crazy demands.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:38.712 position:50% align:center
But look how far you've
all come as a team

00:14:38.795 --> 00:14:40.797 position:50% align:center
in such a short period of time.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.467 position:50% align:center
That in itself is something
to be proud of.

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:48.179 position:50% align:center
I, for one, take pride
in this team.

00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:49.931 position:50% align:center
Now that we're here,
I say we give the best

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:52.809 position:50% align:center
performance of our lives
and grab all the glory!

00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:54.144 position:50% align:center
Us five, together!

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:55.562 position:50% align:center
[SUZAKI]
Yes!

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:57.022 position:50% align:center
[MIKADO] We're gonna skate
in the Grand Prix finals!

00:14:57.105 --> 00:14:58.023 position:50% align:center
[RENJO]
And we'll win it!

00:14:58.106 --> 00:14:59.399 position:50% align:center
Let's do this, Captain!

00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.235 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Here we go.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.403 position:50% align:center
[GROUP]
Yeah!

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.822 position:50% align:center
We're Yokohama Super
Global High School!

--Noa!

--Miá*Leon! Noa!
--Noa!

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.539 position:50% align:center
Are they done now?

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.291 position:50% align:center
There's really nothing
more I need to say

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:17.625 position:50% align:center
to this team.

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.669 position:50% align:center
Just get out there and
fight with all you've got.

00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:21.087 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:23.298 position:50% align:center
I'm not sure if this is really
the appropriate time

00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:26.843 position:50% align:center
to say this,
but thanks, Himekawa.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.554 position:50% align:center
You're the one who got us here.

00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:31.514 position:50% align:center
You worked hard on
your own which in turn

00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:34.517 position:50% align:center
lit a fire under us to try
and keep up with you.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:35.894 position:50% align:center
Thanks to that,
you ended up raising

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:37.854 position:50% align:center
the standard of the whole team.

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:40.398 position:50% align:center
It's like a dream to get
the chance to go to finals.

00:15:40.482 --> 00:15:42.150 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful. I really am.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:43.902 position:50% align:center
Not that it wasn't brutal.

00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:45.028 position:50% align:center
Ain't that the truth!

00:15:46.821 --> 00:15:48.823 position:50% align:center
Um, I mean, same here.

00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:50.367 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful, too.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.369 position:50% align:center
You accepted me
as the ace so fast.

00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:53.536 position:50% align:center
Well, yeah, duh.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.081 position:50% align:center
Because we'd actually
like to win.

00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.166 position:50% align:center
All right, let's give it
everything we've got

00:15:58.249 --> 00:16:00.001 position:50% align:center
so we can leave here
with no regrets.

00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:01.044 position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:03.338 position:50% align:center
It's fine, you know,
having regrets.

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:07.258 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] Today will not
be our last day to skate.

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:08.385 position:50% align:center
This I know.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.931 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:14.182 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B]
They've done it!

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:16.309 position:50% align:center
Kusano Mukaibara High
School has just received

00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.395 position:50% align:center
their all-time best score
and currently stands

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:19.813 position:50% align:center
in first!

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.815 position:50% align:center
What a performance,
don't you agree?

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.650 position:50% align:center
Yes, and topping
their personal best

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.276 position:50% align:center
should give them a little boost.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.946 position:50% align:center
We expect great things from
them in the coming year.

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.656 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Next up in
this second half is a team

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.449 position:50% align:center
aiming for the
Grand Prix finals,

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:34.703 position:50% align:center
the noteworthy Yokohama
Super Global High School.

00:16:34.786 --> 00:16:37.664 position:50% align:center
What kind of performance
will they give us today?

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.582 position:50% align:center
It seems that Yokohama
High has altered

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.334 position:50% align:center
their free skate routine
for today's eighth

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:43.253 position:50% align:center
competition in the series.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.713 position:50% align:center
Huh?!

00:16:44.796 --> 00:16:45.839 position:50% align:center
[COMMENTATOR B]
Interesting.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.507 position:50% align:center
They aren't breaking any rules,

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.967 position:50% align:center
but considering the
amount of time it takes

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.094 position:50% align:center
to polish a routine,
it's typical to skate

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:53.471 position:50% align:center
the same program
throughout a series.

00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:55.640 position:50% align:center
No kidding.
This is like suicide.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:58.935 position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
it might just show

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:01.479 position:50% align:center
how much confidence they have.

00:17:01.563 --> 00:17:02.564 position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:05.650 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.538 position:50% align:center
What the hell was that?

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.081 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] Do they have
some kind of side gig

00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.624 position:50% align:center
doing nighttime entertainment?

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:33.887 position:50% align:center
Is this allowed?

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.055 position:50% align:center
Guess so.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.890 position:50% align:center
Otherwise, they wouldn't
still be skating.

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.058 position:50% align:center
That was tricky.

00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:39.601 position:50% align:center
Pulling this on all of us now.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.863 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:08.838 position:50% align:center
Wow, okay, and now the skaters

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:11.341 position:50% align:center
are encouraging the
audience to clap along.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:13.343 position:50% align:center
We've never seen
anything like this before!

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:25.480 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER B] Ms. Abe,
is this even still considered

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:26.690 position:50% align:center
skate-leading, or?

00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:28.274 position:50% align:center
Oh, sure, they're
still executing

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.484 position:50% align:center
the required elements.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.403 position:50% align:center
A better question is,
are we witnessing

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:33.029 position:50% align:center
the birth of a new trend?

00:18:39.619 --> 00:18:41.204 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.675 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
I was so right!

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.845 position:50% align:center
Since when did this become
such an aloof sport?

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.222 position:50% align:center
I want more people
to watch figure skating!

00:18:59.305 --> 00:19:01.224 position:50% align:center
And love it like I do!

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:02.726 position:50% align:center
So this is the plan.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:05.186 position:50% align:center
I'll win them over with fun!

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.688 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:08.940 position:50% align:center

Meet our signature style!

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:30.879 position:50% align:center
Ah! You guys are amazing!

00:19:30.962 --> 00:19:33.673 position:50% align:center
Love you Rui, Kakeru,
Banri, and Iori!

00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:38.094 position:50% align:center
Well, what do you
think, Kiriyama?

00:19:38.178 --> 00:19:40.722 position:50% align:center
Honestly, I'm finding
it hard to judge.

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.932 position:50% align:center
There's no doubt
it was entertaining,

00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.851 position:50% align:center
and they're good enough
on the elements,

00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:47.145 position:50% align:center
but at the same time,
it's just so--

00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:48.938 position:50% align:center
Unexpected, and they've
taken advantage

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.273 position:50% align:center
of the scoring.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:51.483 position:50% align:center
Fascinating.

00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:55.362 position:50% align:center
[JONOUCHI]
Wow.

00:19:55.445 --> 00:19:57.072 position:50% align:center
Guess they're really
gonna get away with it.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:19:59.240 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] But what happens now?
Was that allowed?

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.076 position:50% align:center
They haven't broken any rules.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:02.744 position:50% align:center
The fault's in how
they're written.

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.871 position:50% align:center
That little sneak Kuonji
was only pretending

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.581 position:50% align:center
to compete against
Himekawa when all

00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:08.583 position:50% align:center
he actually cared about
was showing everyone

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:10.335 position:50% align:center
what his team could do.

00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:14.798 position:50% align:center
And maybe he involved Kogahara
just to stir things up. Huh.

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.259 position:50% align:center
[KUBOTA] The performance
by Kuonji's team gripped

00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:21.429 position:50% align:center
the audience's heart,
there's no denying it.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:23.765 position:50% align:center
They obviously got high marks
on the entertainment portion

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:24.891 position:50% align:center
of the score--

00:20:24.974 --> 00:20:27.519 position:50% align:center
in fact, they're
unrivaled on that.

00:20:27.602 --> 00:20:31.272 position:50% align:center
However, due to their
occasional technical mistakes...

00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:39.572 position:50% align:center
...they couldn't
beat Himekawa's team.

Great job, Himekawa!

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.300 position:50% align:center
You and your team
ended up taking third,

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.511 position:50% align:center
but no one will forget your
free skate performance,

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.304 position:50% align:center
which was truly phenomenal.

00:21:03.388 --> 00:21:04.931 position:50% align:center

Thank you very much.

I'd be lying if I said
that I had no regrets,

but I'm proud that I've
been able to introduce

a new way of performing
to the sport

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:14.107 position:50% align:center
of skate-leading.

to wrap things up.

of this segment.

isn't over yet, is it?

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:33.877 position:50% align:center
Right!

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.962 position:50% align:center
And here's some fun,
breaking news for your fans.

00:21:36.046 --> 00:21:39.174 position:50% align:center
Kuonji will now be commentating
for the Grand Prix finals!

00:21:39.257 --> 00:21:40.425 position:50% align:center
Gonna be fun!

00:21:40.508 --> 00:21:41.885 position:50% align:center
What?

00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:43.178 position:50% align:center
[AKIMITSU] Oh, my gosh, do
you think he lost on purpose

00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.429 position:50% align:center
so he could do that?

00:21:44.512 --> 00:21:45.930 position:50% align:center
Nah. You kidding?

00:21:46.014 --> 00:21:47.682 position:50% align:center
He would've figured
out some way to do

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:48.892 position:50% align:center
both simultaneously.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.771 position:50% align:center
I thought I'd try doing
all three at one time.

00:21:52.854 --> 00:21:54.773 position:50% align:center
Don't you think that'd
be so much cooler?

00:21:54.856 --> 00:21:56.566 position:50% align:center
Maeshima, you called it.

00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:57.942 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI]
That's uncanny.

00:21:58.026 --> 00:21:59.819 position:50% align:center
Has he already recruited you
for his team next year?

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:02.447 position:50% align:center
Yeah, right, shut up.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.116 position:50% align:center
Who knows?
I can't predict the future.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.585 position:50% align:center
Hey, Shinozaki!

00:23:38.668 --> 00:23:40.378 position:50% align:center
You who shares
my princely title.

00:23:40.462 --> 00:23:41.296 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Your what?

00:23:41.379 --> 00:23:42.422 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
I have a proposal.

00:23:42.505 --> 00:23:43.798 position:50% align:center
Wanna hold a birthday
event together?

00:23:43.882 --> 00:23:45.133 position:50% align:center
--[SHINOZAKI] Seriously?
--[KUONJI] I know!

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:47.177 position:50% align:center
We'll gather ten people
and celebrate every month.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.262 position:50% align:center
--[SHINOZAKI] That sounds--
--[KUONJI] We're so in sync!

00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:50.472 position:50% align:center
--[SHINOZAKI] Sure.
--[KUONJI] Yay!
