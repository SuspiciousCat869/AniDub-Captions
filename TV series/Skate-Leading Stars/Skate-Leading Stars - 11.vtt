[SASUGAI]
Skate-leading.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:19.269 position:50% align:center
Five skaters expressing
themselves in unison on the ice.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.646 position:50% align:center
The stage is all set
for Ionodai to appear

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.107 position:50% align:center
in their second Grand
Prix finals in a row,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.775 position:50% align:center
and, most importantly,
of course,

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.153 position:50% align:center
for the long-awaited
revenge of brilliant me.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:30.697 position:50% align:center
Hayato Sasugai.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.657 position:50% align:center
My injury's healed up fine.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.285 position:50% align:center
But not enough for me
to keep competing.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:39.164 position:50% align:center
So, I can't beat my older
brother, Reo Shinozaki, alone.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.790 position:50% align:center
But my team can.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.167 position:50% align:center
And it's time.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.295 position:50% align:center
Today, we'll take that final
step towards victory.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.090 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Welcome back to
the Boys' High School

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.344 position:50% align:center
Skate-Leading Grand
Prix Series finals!

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.095 position:50% align:center
The place is buzzing
with energy at this point

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.097 position:50% align:center
in the competition,
with the short program

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.766 position:50% align:center
wrapped up and
the first three teams

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.517 position:50% align:center
about to begin their free skate.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.189 position:50% align:center
Give me an update!

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:06.524 position:50% align:center
The last team of the
first half is skating now.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.567 position:50% align:center
[SEKIDA]
And Adachi's team?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.902 position:50% align:center
They're third in
the second half,

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:11.237 position:50% align:center
so there's still time
before they skate.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.489 position:50% align:center
Oh, good.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.740 position:50% align:center
[STAFF A] But man, high
schoolers these days are

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.200 position:50% align:center
freakin' amazing.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.036 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
A clean performance!

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.872 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] As expected
from them--perfection!

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:22.665 position:50% align:center
Looks like the average
difference in the timing

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.543 position:50% align:center
for the start of each
move was .08 seconds.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.796 position:50% align:center
The difference in pose
position was .13,

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.215 position:50% align:center
so those are both
pretty good numbers!

00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:31.883 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
This is the final combination!

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:40.225 position:50% align:center
--[CROWD cheers]
--[TAKAI] They did it!

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:41.476 position:50% align:center
Not a single mistake!

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.978 position:50% align:center
Chutei University Kamimaezu!

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.022 position:50% align:center
Well, that's the
Mirroring Twins for you!

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:48.817 position:50% align:center
And the other team members
were right there with them!

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.695 position:50% align:center
We can definitely expect high
scores for this performance!

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:56.658 position:50% align:center
[chuckles] First time or not,
you sure do seem comfy

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.536 position:50% align:center
behind that microphone, Kuonji.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.579 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Now, for the scores
we've been waiting for!

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.750 position:50% align:center
136.96 total!

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:08.545 position:50% align:center
Chutei University Kamimaezu
has set a personal best

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.714 position:50% align:center
at these Grand Prix finals!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.215 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
I'm not surprised.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.050 position:50% align:center
Being able to pull out their
best at this crucial moment

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:15.927 position:50% align:center
is just further proof
of their talent!

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:17.929 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] They've jumped ahead of
the current first-place team,

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:20.348 position:50% align:center
Eimei Academy,
to take the top spot!

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:23.226 position:50% align:center
All we have left are the three
schools in the second half!

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.477 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
That's right!

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:26.104 position:50% align:center
We'll start off with the
favorite, St. Clavis,

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.606 position:50% align:center
and their "Top of Kings,"
Shinozaki, at the helm,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.151 position:50% align:center
followed by Kogahara
High and Ionodai.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.028 position:50% align:center
The lineup's full
of teams to watch!

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.612 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] The second half of
the free skate will begin

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.822 position:50% align:center
momentarily!

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.782 position:50% align:center
Which team will grasp
victory in the end?

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:39.492 position:50% align:center
We'll have that answer soon!

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.216 position:50% align:center
We're live at
Makuhari Ice Arena,

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.926 position:50% align:center
where the Boys' High
School Skate-Leading

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.512 position:50% align:center
Grand Prix Series
finals are being held,

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.431 position:50% align:center
and there are only
three schools left to skate

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.850 position:50% align:center
in the free skate portion
of the competition.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.268 position:50% align:center
And as always,

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.228 position:50% align:center
I'll be covering play-by-play
with color commentary

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.813 position:50% align:center
by Noa Kuonji.

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:33.398 position:50% align:center
Thanks so much for having me.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.067 position:50% align:center
They're smoothing the ice now,
preparing for the performances

00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:39.029 position:50% align:center
of the three teams who will
skate in the second half.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:41.031 position:50% align:center
Since we have some time,
let's recap

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.158 position:50% align:center
what happened in
the competition so far.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:44.367 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
Great!

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.827 position:50% align:center
The first-place finisher
in the short program

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.121 position:50% align:center
was no surprise:
last year's champions,

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.665 position:50% align:center
the emperors, St. Clavis Gakuin!

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.584 position:50% align:center
They are exceptionally
consistent.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.668 position:50% align:center
It's remarkable.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:54.919 position:50% align:center
Throughout the entire series,

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.755 position:50% align:center
they've never given up
the top spot.

00:04:56.838 --> 00:04:58.840 position:50% align:center
At this point, it no
longer seems possible

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:00.717 position:50% align:center
to imagine this team losing.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.927 position:50% align:center
Next, in second place, was the
team that just finished

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.388 position:50% align:center
their free skate, Chutei
University Kamimaezu

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:06.723 position:50% align:center
High School.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.058 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] As expected,
the schools that regularly

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.642 position:50% align:center
make finals are strong.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.644 position:50% align:center
The Ishikawa brothers'
specialty is particularly

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:12.979 position:50% align:center
well-suited to
the short program,

00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:15.273 position:50% align:center
allowing them to skate
to their strengths.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.275 position:50% align:center
They were then followed
by Kogahara High School

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.110 position:50% align:center
and Ionodai High School.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.987 position:50% align:center
And those are the standings
after the first half

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.614 position:50% align:center
of the free program.

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.949 position:50% align:center
What are your thoughts about
these results, Kuonji?

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.493 position:50% align:center
Well, it doesn't come
as a surprise

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.579 position:50% align:center
that Chutei University High
has received a top score.

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.122 position:50% align:center
But it means the winners
will have to beat

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.874 position:50% align:center
either Chutei High
or one of the teams

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.918 position:50% align:center
that still has to skate
in the second half.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:36.753 position:50% align:center
And for Kogahara and Ionodai,

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:38.463 position:50% align:center
I'm afraid that might
end up being too high

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:39.964 position:50% align:center
of a hurdle for them to clear.

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.091 position:50% align:center
What are you saying?

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.384 position:50% align:center
In order for one of
those two schools

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.260 position:50% align:center
to wind up in first place
at the end of this,

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.137 position:50% align:center
they'll have to figure out
how to beat Chutei High's

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.223 position:50% align:center
total combined score from
both the short program

00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:49.599 position:50% align:center
and the free skate.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.393 position:50% align:center
Here's the thing,
even if you added up

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.478 position:50% align:center
all the impressively high
scores they achieved

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.897 position:50% align:center
this season, that total
is still just barely shy

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.065 position:50% align:center
of Chutei High's.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.608 position:50% align:center
Which means they'll
also need to skate

00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.486 position:50% align:center
their all-time best performance
in order to win today.

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.863 position:50% align:center
Right. They'll have to
defeat their past selves.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.574 position:50% align:center
What's cool is there is
a general expectation

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.910 position:50% align:center
that both schools
will do just that.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.329 position:50% align:center
Though, of course, we can't
rule out St. Clavis,

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:12.914 position:50% align:center
now, can we?

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:14.582 position:50% align:center
In other words,
we're most likely in

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.334 position:50% align:center
for a bumpy ride today!

00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.086 position:50% align:center
The second half of the
free skate performances

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.546 position:50% align:center
are about to begin!

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.341 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A] The six-minute
practice has now concluded.

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.927 position:50% align:center
The second half of the
free skate will soon begin.

00:06:26.011 --> 00:06:27.929 position:50% align:center
Keep in mind that
we're scheduled last.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.681 position:50% align:center
Make sure to keep your
bodies warmed up.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:32.392 position:50% align:center
Yeah, yeah, we know.
It's not our first rodeo.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.561 position:50% align:center
--Attitude!
--Jonouchi.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.147 position:50% align:center
How's your stomach feeling?
Doing okay?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.398 position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, it's all good!

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.316 position:50% align:center
I took some meds, too,
just in case.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.532 position:50% align:center
Steady, don't get too fired up.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.950 position:50% align:center
I know what I'm doing.

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:50.702 position:50% align:center
Gotta keep my blood
pumping at a good pace

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:53.079 position:50% align:center
so I'm ready to bust
out there and kill it!

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:54.622 position:50% align:center
Whatever you say, man.

00:06:54.706 --> 00:06:56.332 position:50% align:center
You guys get what
this is, yeah?

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.667 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.336 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO] Skate like we
always do, and we can win.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.046 position:50% align:center
--But that doesn't--
--Hey, we said, we know.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:02.464 position:50% align:center
Don't worry, we're
not too nervous

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.090 position:50% align:center
or too relaxed about this.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.383 position:50% align:center
You have to trust us.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:06.426 position:50% align:center
Maybe.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.802 position:50% align:center
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:07.886 --> 00:07:09.721 position:50% align:center
[KURAYOSHI]
Maeshima's, like, staring at us.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.440 position:50% align:center
Let him look.
He knows he can't beat me.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.234 position:50% align:center
Remember to make
those little adjustments

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:25.028 position:50% align:center
from the last notes I gave you.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.489 position:50% align:center
--Still know what they are?
--Sir!

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.574 position:50% align:center
The time you're about to spend
on the ice is precious,

00:07:29.657 --> 00:07:30.992 position:50% align:center
and no one else can
take that away,

00:07:31.076 --> 00:07:33.995 position:50% align:center
so don't forget that.
This time belongs only to you.

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.538 position:50% align:center
Go out and give it your all!

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:36.831 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.834 position:50% align:center
[AJIKATA]
All right! Let's do this!

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.419 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Himekawa.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.588 position:50% align:center
About yesterday.

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.090 position:50% align:center
We meant every word we said.

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.885 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Thank you for your patience.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.679 position:50% align:center
The second half of the
free skate competition

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:51.888 position:50% align:center
will now begin.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:57.018 position:50% align:center
Wow, this year's
Grand Prix Series

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.478 position:50% align:center
is finally down to
the last three teams

00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.813 position:50% align:center
of the free skate.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.606 position:50% align:center
What conclusion will
be waiting for all of us

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.899 position:50% align:center
at the end?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.109 position:50% align:center
[ANNOUNCER A]
Skating fourth.

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.361 position:50% align:center
Niigata Prefectural
Kogahara High School.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.209 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.420 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Kogahara High is
skating with Himekawa

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.130 position:50% align:center
in the single lead position.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.506 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
It's a standard tactic.

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:27.966 position:50% align:center
The ace racks up
the major points

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:29.759 position:50% align:center
while the other members
steadily build a base

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.470 position:50% align:center
by fulfilling the
basic requirements.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.764 position:50% align:center
May be simple, but it's
a proven strategy.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:36.057 position:50% align:center
Huh, interesting.

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:37.976 position:50% align:center
Makes it hard to improve
on their personal best

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.060 position:50% align:center
by much.

00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:45.775 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] I used to set a
limit on my own abilities.

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.736 position:50% align:center
I thought I knew
what I could do.

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:52.073 position:50% align:center
But that day, something
important shifted in me,

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:53.658 position:50% align:center
and I knew could go further.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.578 position:50% align:center
That's why I switched teams.

00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:58.413 position:50% align:center
I thought it could be
helpful to spend time

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.457 position:50% align:center
reexamining myself
under the direction

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.500 position:50% align:center
of my old coach.

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:06.504 position:50% align:center
When I joined my current team,
I was fully prepared.

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.381 position:50% align:center
I'd abandoned them once before.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.675 position:50% align:center
I didn't think they'd accept
me again so easily.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.803 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI] It's like a dream
to get the chance

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.013 position:50% align:center
to go to the finals.

00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.182 position:50% align:center
I'm grateful. I really am.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.725 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] I never thought
my team would say

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.226 position:50% align:center
something like that to me.

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:26.316 position:50% align:center
[SATO] Himekawa, skate to
your heart's content.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.526 position:50% align:center
Our one job is to support
our ace and lead,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.737 position:50% align:center
and to make sure you look good.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.739 position:50% align:center
You haven't been skating
full-out, though.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:34.282 position:50% align:center
You hold back for our sakes.

00:09:34.366 --> 00:09:37.285 position:50% align:center
It's our bad that we made
you feel you needed to.

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.703 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
No. That's not--

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.955 position:50% align:center
What were you looking for when
you transferred here?

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:44.626 position:50% align:center
A chance to fight Maeshima
and the other aces, right?

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:47.128 position:50% align:center
Now's your chance to show
us who our ace really is!

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.130 position:50% align:center
We've been practicing
extra to get ready, too!

00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:50.256 position:50% align:center
We can do it!

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.717 position:50% align:center
Give us all you've got.
We'll be there!

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.554 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA] But if I fail,
everything we've worked

00:09:56.638 --> 00:09:58.640 position:50% align:center
so hard for will be lost.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:01.559 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Himekawa! Let's do it!

00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.687 position:50% align:center
[AJIKATA] Don't worry about us,
we can keep up!

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.271 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
And even if you didn't jump--

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.232 position:50% align:center
[SHUNOBON]
We'd do it by ourselves, anyway!

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:13.738 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
What's this?

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:14.989 position:50% align:center
They've changed their
routine to include

00:10:15.073 --> 00:10:16.991 position:50% align:center
consecutive jumps
by the whole team!

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.243 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
What a nice move!

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:20.578 position:50% align:center
As Himekawa's in the air
with his quadruple jump,

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:22.580 position:50% align:center
his teammates match
him with triples!

00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:25.667 position:50% align:center
I'm impressed-- that's really
difficult to pull off!

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.293 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
Remember what the coach said?

00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:29.004 position:50% align:center
This time belongs only to us!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.221 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] They did it!
The difference here is striking!

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.765 position:50% align:center
Their whole performance
has gotten a lot sharper!

00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:43.101 position:50% align:center
They really are way better
than they've been up to now.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:45.770 position:50% align:center
So, this is what
Himekawa's capable of.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.105 position:50% align:center
Man, this sucks.

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:50.316 position:50% align:center
Now he's thrown off
my calculations.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.651 position:50% align:center
Though, to be fair,

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:53.570 position:50% align:center
that's only if the others
can keep up with him

00:10:53.653 --> 00:10:54.696 position:50% align:center
till the end.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:07.834 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
We can do it.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.795 position:50% align:center
One more move and I will have
proved myself at nationals!

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.138 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
A quadruple Axel!

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:21.639 position:50% align:center
He landed it perfectly!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.017 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] And his teammates
are standing firm!

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.226 position:50% align:center
[SATO]
We can do it!

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.227 position:50% align:center
[IGARASHI]
We can do it!

00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:27.103 position:50% align:center
[AJIKATA]
We can do it!

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:28.063 position:50% align:center
[SHUNOBON]
We can do it!

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.439 position:50% align:center
[HIMEKAWA]
This is all ours.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.815 position:50% align:center
We're gonna win it!

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:34.861 position:50% align:center
They actually did it.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:46.414 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
There it is!

00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.416 position:50% align:center
Kogahara High gave us
a flawless program!

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.585 position:50% align:center
A wonderful performance!

00:11:50.669 --> 00:11:52.420 position:50% align:center
Their ace, Himekawa's
performance was one

00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:53.588 position:50% align:center
for the books.

00:11:53.672 --> 00:11:55.215 position:50% align:center
Though, his teammates
definitely carried

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:56.508 position:50% align:center
their own weight!

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:59.052 position:50% align:center
It was so very "One for all,
and all for one!"

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.303 position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:12:00.387 --> 00:12:01.554 position:50% align:center
Their improvement from
the middle to the end

00:12:01.638 --> 00:12:03.348 position:50% align:center
was pretty remarkable.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.684 position:50% align:center
I've never seen Himekawa
skate like that.

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.143 position:50% align:center
What about the points, though?

00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.687 position:50% align:center
How much will they be
able to get, you think?

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.897 position:50% align:center
Damn it, I can't even get
over how cool that guy is!

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.024 position:50% align:center
Wait, was that an actual
compliment from you?

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.609 position:50% align:center
No, it wasn't a compliment!

00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.861 position:50% align:center
I'll send him packing, anyway!

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.072 position:50% align:center
[SASUGAI] We can only
hope it'll be that easy.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.117 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Ah, it looks like
the scores are coming!

00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:29.708 position:50% align:center
82.45 technical and
57.08 performance

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:32.794 position:50% align:center
for a total of 139.53.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.504 position:50% align:center
Kogahara High School
has surpassed

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:36.965 position:50% align:center
their personal best by
leaps and bounds today!

00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.050 position:50% align:center
And, they've managed to
beat Chutei University

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:40.927 position:50% align:center
High's previous top score.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.304 position:50% align:center
Which means, they've just
jumped into the lead!

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:45.140 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI] Oof, now Ionodai
finds themselves

00:12:45.223 --> 00:12:47.308 position:50% align:center
in an even more
challenging predicament!

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.810 position:50% align:center
Of course, this isn't
an easy score to beat,

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:50.145 position:50% align:center
no matter who you are!

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.814 position:50% align:center
It's going to be a struggle,
even for St. Clavis!

00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.036 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:08.121 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Wow, I'm still
blown away by this team's

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.415 position:50% align:center
huge score;
what about you, Kuonji?

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:11.791 position:50% align:center
They've increased
their personal best

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.251 position:50% align:center
by a heck of a lot today.

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:16.004 position:50% align:center
Seriously! Those guys exceeded
all my predictions

00:13:16.087 --> 00:13:17.297 position:50% align:center
and then some!

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.549 position:50% align:center
So, St. Clavis has no room
to be careless now.

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:22.552 position:50% align:center
To top Kogahara's score,
St. Clavis Gakuin

00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.763 position:50% align:center
will need to aim even
higher than their series

00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:26.306 position:50% align:center
average free skate score.

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:29.017 position:50% align:center
In other words, a single mistake
could cost them the win.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.894 position:50% align:center
And remember,
Shinozaki's already shown

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:32.687 position:50% align:center
he needs work on the
entertainment aspect

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.230 position:50% align:center
during this series.

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.067 position:50% align:center
Compared to his technical score,
his performance score's low.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.985 position:50% align:center
Keep in mind, though,
we are talking about

00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.529 position:50% align:center
a very high level,
overall, here.

00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:43.865 position:50% align:center
But if he doesn't overcome this,

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.951 position:50% align:center
the unlikely could suddenly
become his new reality.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.209 position:50% align:center
If we stay here, we'll be in
the way of the next team.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:55.377 position:50% align:center
C'mon, let's go.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.461 position:50% align:center
Yes, sir!

00:13:57.754 --> 00:13:59.005 position:50% align:center
Himekawa.

00:13:59.089 --> 00:14:01.216 position:50% align:center
You really are amazing.

00:14:01.299 --> 00:14:03.718 position:50% align:center
But... I guess it's too bad.

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:14.479 position:50% align:center
Well, they scored much
higher than expected,

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.523 position:50% align:center
so our path to two consecutive
wins has become

00:14:16.606 --> 00:14:18.233 position:50% align:center
less smooth. But--

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:19.734 position:50% align:center
We know, it doesn't matter.

00:14:19.818 --> 00:14:21.319 position:50% align:center
We'll do this our way.

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:23.279 position:50% align:center
With calm precision,
like always.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.739 position:50% align:center
And that's how we'll win.

00:14:24.823 --> 00:14:26.241 position:50% align:center
That's right.

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:29.244 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki, you just
do your thing.

00:14:29.327 --> 00:14:31.913 position:50% align:center
Take the lead where it's
appropriate, and we'll follow.

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:32.997 position:50% align:center
Got it?

00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.918 position:50% align:center
"Same as always" isn't exactly
the best direction.

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.044 position:50% align:center
But it's so Taiga.

00:14:38.128 --> 00:14:39.129 position:50% align:center
Oh, for sure.

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.631 position:50% align:center
You think that's gonna
be good enough?

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:43.591 position:50% align:center
Might wanna focus on
collecting those points,

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:45.176 position:50% align:center
or we'll fly right past you.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.095 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] It's embarrassing
watching you try to bluff.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.180 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO] Yep.
The more you boast now,

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:50.473 position:50% align:center
the more foolish you'll feel.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:52.225 position:50% align:center
I don't suppose you guys agree--

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.445 position:50% align:center
Well, there's something to
be said for team solidarity.

--Yeah.

00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.787 position:50% align:center
It's time. Let's go, guys.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.796 position:50% align:center
Look how relaxed they are.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.673 position:50% align:center
Yeah, their confidence
is off the charts.

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.508 position:50% align:center
Skating perfectly
100% of the time

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.260 position:50% align:center
is impossible at
this level, though.

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:30.096 position:50% align:center
Doesn't matter. They have to.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.556 position:50% align:center
That's just Himuro.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.476 position:50% align:center
Shinozaki wasn't even
listening to any of that.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:36.561 position:50% align:center
He was already in the zone.

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:38.855 position:50% align:center
That's fine. Bring it on!

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.774 position:50% align:center
I mean, it wouldn't be
interesting otherwise!

00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.693 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
Ah, here they come now.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.695 position:50% align:center
They took the top in
both the short program

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:49.115 position:50% align:center
and free skate at all three of
their competitions this year.

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:51.826 position:50% align:center
They're coasting toward
a second consecutive win.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.244 position:50% align:center
But Kogahara High
might be giving them

00:15:53.328 --> 00:15:55.455 position:50% align:center
a run for their money
with that performance.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.917 position:50% align:center
It's the first real obstacle
they've had to face so far.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.627 position:50% align:center
Will they be able to
push that aside to win

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.087 position:50% align:center
the laurels a second time?

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.006 position:50% align:center
All eyes are on
St. Clavis Gakuin!

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.841 position:50% align:center
This actually feels pretty good.

00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:08.635 position:50% align:center
We've got a goal,
we've got a strategy,

00:16:08.718 --> 00:16:10.679 position:50% align:center
and the audience
is here for all of it.

00:16:10.762 --> 00:16:13.348 position:50% align:center
Just don't go crazy like
Ionodai's red dog, huh?

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:15.600 position:50% align:center
Stick to the formula
that we know works.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.521 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Let's go!

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:21.898 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Now, let's see
what kind of performance

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.900 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis Gakuin
brings us today!

00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:27.112 position:50% align:center
[music playing]

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:32.242 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
The music starts slow and moody,

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.536 position:50% align:center
but notice how sharp
everyone's movements are!

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:36.162 position:50% align:center
I'm already impressed.

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:38.623 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] There's also
Shinozaki's swordsmanship.

00:16:38.707 --> 00:16:40.542 position:50% align:center
It looks to me like they've
borrowed a few techniques 

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.293 position:50% align:center
from rhythmic gymnastics.

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.212 position:50% align:center
I mean, I've never
seen anything like it.

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:45.630 position:50% align:center
Look at him,
he's even doing jumps

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:47.632 position:50% align:center
while holding his
sword like it's nothing.

00:16:47.716 --> 00:16:49.384 position:50% align:center
His technique is impeccable.

[CROWD cheering]

00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:01.688 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
Wow, this guy really is amazing.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.567 position:50% align:center
Yamashita and I
resisted at first,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.778 position:50% align:center
when Shinozaki and Kurayoshi
both joined the club.

00:17:08.862 --> 00:17:10.405 position:50% align:center
It doesn't make sense!

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.865 position:50% align:center
Why hand them first
string without even

00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:13.783 position:50% align:center
testing them on
second string first?

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.369 position:50% align:center
And to put Fujiwara and
Matsumoto on reserve!

00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.288 position:50% align:center
Are you trying to say
they should be starters?

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:20.165 position:50% align:center
C'mon! The second-string
guys have worked their

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.167 position:50% align:center
butts off to get here
and you know it!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.752 position:50% align:center
This call is really unfair!

00:17:23.835 --> 00:17:26.421 position:50% align:center
This comes from the coach.

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.757 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO]
Still not gonna accept it?

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.675 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] Let's have a quick
match against them, then!

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:33.178 position:50% align:center
It'll be easier to decide
on things after that.

00:17:36.181 --> 00:17:39.059 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA]
In the end, we lost. Badly.

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.778 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
Listen.

00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.197 position:50% align:center
I don't really understand
what "entertainment" is.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.784 position:50% align:center
I'm here to try and
learn about that.

00:17:55.867 --> 00:17:57.952 position:50% align:center
So, I'm in your hands.

00:17:58.036 --> 00:17:59.204 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA]
Then it hit me.

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:00.622 position:50% align:center
He'd been called a
genius and defeated

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.208 position:50% align:center
national-level skaters,
but he was still

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.876 position:50% align:center
trying to learn something.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:09.631 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] From that day on,
there was a shift.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:13.927 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA] We learned
Shinozaki's techniques

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.137 position:50% align:center
and adopted them as our own.

00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.264 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] It was strange,
but once we did that,

00:18:18.348 --> 00:18:20.058 position:50% align:center
the practices that
had sucked before

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.768 position:50% align:center
actually became fun.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.144 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA] We could tell
that we were improving

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:24.771 position:50% align:center
every single day.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:27.357 position:50% align:center
And it made all of us so proud.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.650 position:50% align:center
[MICHINAGA] We're the only
ones who could skate

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:29.901 position:50% align:center
what Shinozaki wanted!

00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.569 position:50% align:center
[YAMASHITA]
Which feels awesome!

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.326 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:40.829 position:50% align:center
That's amazing!

00:18:40.912 --> 00:18:43.039 position:50% align:center
Having all five of them
do consecutive jumps!

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.000 position:50% align:center
Plus, their timing and
the height of their jumps.

00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:46.459 position:50% align:center
It was all perfect!

00:18:46.543 --> 00:18:49.212 position:50% align:center
But most of all, to be able
to keep up with Shinozaki?

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:51.297 position:50% align:center
The other four are
remarkably skilled!

00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:56.636 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Shinozaki catches
the sword beautifully!

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.930 position:50% align:center
[HIMURO] Yamashita and Michinaga
have both improved,

00:18:59.014 --> 00:19:02.017 position:50% align:center
just as I planned.
Shinozaki, too-- 

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.686 position:50% align:center
It wasn't that he didn't know
how to be an entertainer.

00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.604 position:50% align:center
He's just a perfectionist,
so he wasn't ready

00:19:06.688 --> 00:19:08.523 position:50% align:center
to show the world until
he was satisfied

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.191 position:50% align:center
with it himself.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:12.027 position:50% align:center
Take his natural
athleticism and the level

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.612 position:50% align:center
of technique he
cultivated in singles,

00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:17.490 position:50% align:center
add in a genuine connection
with the audience,

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:20.201 position:50% align:center
and what you get is
irresistible charisma!

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:34.549 position:50% align:center
[SHINOZAKI]
This feels good.

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:38.636 position:50% align:center
Being out here with
a strong team.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.723 position:50% align:center
Skaters who can
play at my level.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:44.434 position:50% align:center
I still don't think it's the
greatest performance.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:47.604 position:50% align:center
But if I stop worrying
about the others

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.815 position:50% align:center
and give 100%...

00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:52.817 position:50% align:center
...then I might be able
to reach the kind of heights

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:54.402 position:50% align:center
I've been hoping for.

00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:59.324 position:50% align:center
So keep following my lead.

00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:04.662 position:50% align:center
[CROWD cheering]

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:10.085 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI] Wow! A combination skill
with all team members!

00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:11.586 position:50% align:center
[KUONJI]
What a feast of moves!

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.130 position:50% align:center
No one watching could take
their eyes off for a second!

00:20:14.214 --> 00:20:15.799 position:50% align:center
Just mesmerizing!

00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:17.801 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
And now, for their final jump...

00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:21.471 position:50% align:center
That was beautiful!

00:20:36.736 --> 00:20:38.071 position:50% align:center
Incredible!

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:41.157 position:50% align:center
St. Clavis Gakuin gave us
a remarkable performance,

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:43.368 position:50% align:center
and it ended with
quite a flourish!

00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:44.619 position:50% align:center
That was stunning.

00:20:44.703 --> 00:20:46.413 position:50% align:center
If any one of them had
made a mistake during

00:20:46.496 --> 00:20:48.289 position:50% align:center
that difficult
combination at the end,

00:20:48.373 --> 00:20:50.375 position:50% align:center
it could have thrown
off the whole thing.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.378 position:50% align:center
But... They all skated
perfectly, in unison.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:56.214 position:50% align:center
It really was something
special to see!

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.924 position:50% align:center
That was the kind of
performance that could only

00:20:58.008 --> 00:21:00.093 position:50% align:center
come from St. Clavis Gakuin,

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.637 position:50% align:center
where every skater is
exceptionally talented!

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:08.935 position:50% align:center
This is great.

[CROWD cheering]

00:21:25.285 --> 00:21:26.453 position:50% align:center
[TAKAI]
Look at this score!

00:21:26.536 --> 00:21:30.707 position:50% align:center
A technical of 83.67, a
performance of 57.17,

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.710 position:50% align:center
for a total of 140.84!

St. Clavis Gakuin has just
achieved the highest

score in the history
of the series!

00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:39.507 position:50% align:center
That being the case,
they've jumped ahead

of Kogahara High to
take the top spot!

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.013 position:50% align:center
There's little doubt now of
their second consecutive win!

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.806 position:50% align:center
There's only one thing
left that could stop them,

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.350 position:50% align:center
and that's the performance
of the last team
