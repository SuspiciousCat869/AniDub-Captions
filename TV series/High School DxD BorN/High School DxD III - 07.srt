You don't think you've won yet?

00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,779
Be honest. Your imagination
is pretty weak,

160
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,881
so you like clothes that
leave very little to it.

Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh.

Issei prefers the gentle sloping

Yeah, but we're too smart

Seriously. Akeno can
be such a pain.

186
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,985
[ISSEI] I'm sorry.
It was all because of me.

187
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:55,421
It was actually the perfect
way to relieve a little stress.

188
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,925
However, Vali is
a different matter.

Coming and going as he
pleases in my territory.

190

[ISSEI] I know he wasn't
trying to start any trouble.

191
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,099
He even told me to cool my jets.

192
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,402
Be that as it may, I still need
to send the report up the chain.

193
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,272
I certainly don't intend to
trust Vali completely in this,

194
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,440
but there's something
about Diodora's attitude

195
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,309
that doesn't sit well with me.

196
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,046
I don't care how strong
he's supposed to be.

197
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,682
He wants to take Asia away.

You feel responsible for
bringing Asia into this world.

201
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,894
Blaming yourself
changes nothing.

202
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:39,733
Plus, Asia told me how happy she
is to be living here with us.

203
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,035
I'm glad she sees
things that way,

204
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:46,339
but then I think about
everything that she lost and...

205
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,874
Well, that means one thing.

206

We're all going to have
to work to make sure

she deserves.

for the rest of the household.

[SHALBA] I was hoping
both Sir Zechs and Odin

would be eliminated during
Loki's brazen assault.

222

It would seem a
heathen god has limits.

223
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,299
But, Loki's one of the major
deities in the Nordic religion;

224
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,068
which means whoever
took him out of the fight

of the heir to the
Glasya‐Labolas family

in Diodora Astaroth's
devil power.

they're related, after all.

290
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,005
[SIR ZECHS] I see.
Then perhaps Rias's report

291
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,207
on Vali's warning factors
into this somehow;

292
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,577
which, of course, assumes
it isn't disinformation.

Or, maybe they're not as

We should head out ourselves.

a direct order to work with you.

Just let the rest of us deal
with these terrorist scumbags.

would harm my household.

you stop this nonsense!
