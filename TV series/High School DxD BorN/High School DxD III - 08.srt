00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,505
[ISSEI] Asia. Hold on
just a little longer.

[ISSEI] Comin' to save
you as fast as I can.

[DIODORA]
I knew you would follow me.

7
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,593
That's why I put together
this little welcome party.

8
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,227
Piss off!

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,830
[DIODORA]
Now, it's time to play our game.

10
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,401
Unfortunately, today's Rating
Game has been cancelled.

11
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,370
Of course, you
already knew that.

12
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,806
So, we'll play my game instead.

13
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,710
Should you refuse to play,
or lose, Asia will become mine.

[ISSEI grunts]

15
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,843
[DIODORA] You'll have to
fight two separate battles,

16
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,411
simultaneously.

17
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,381
On the right path, two rooks
and eight pawns await.

18
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:04,518
The battle on the left will be
against my queen and bishops.

19
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,253
You can split your forces
any way you see fit.

20
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,422
Issei, Koneko,
Xenovia, and Gaspar,

21
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,224
take out his forces
on the right.

22
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,226
Ten of them against
the four of us?

23
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,296
Don't forget that Issei absorbed
all eight of our pawn pieces.

24
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,664
So, as far as power
is concerned,

25
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,866
we have a slight advantage.

26
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,468
[DIODORA]
Then let the game begin.

27
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh, man! Here they come!

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,811
all of my pawns have already
been promoted to queen.

29
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,478
I like to hedge my bets.

30
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:36,282
[RIAS] Ha, ha. I knew you
weren't one to fight fair,

31
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,685
but this is a new
low, even for you.

32
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,526
Just a queen and two bishops?

33
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,761
They must have a lot of
confidence in themselves.

34
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:50,296
[RIAS] Xenovia, I need you
to keep those rooks busy.

35
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,232
[XENOVIA]
Fine.

36
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,967
I was made for fights like this.

37
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:58,639
[RIAS] Koneko, work crowd
control on those pawns.

38
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,575
[RIAS] Issei, give Gasper a
quick taste of your blood.

All right! We're cocked,
locked, and ready to rock!

41
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,518
[RIAS] Time to level
the playing field, Issei.

42

[ISSEI gasps]
Huh?

Hang on a sec, are you
sure that's okay?

44
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,961

Promotion to queen, bitches!

to your vulgar technique.

Yeah. Thanks asshole.

that seals away any feelings

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,610
[RIAS] Issei! I can't believe
you'd ask her out like that

160
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,778
right in front of me!

161
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,497
It only shows

162
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:41,371
there's room in Issei's
heart for my love.

163
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,849
[RIAS] I don't want to hear that
from someone who has a sudden

164
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,885
wellspring of power after
being promised one measly

165
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:48,088
[AKENO] I'm not gonna
think of him as "your man,"

166
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,123
until after you've slept with
him and sealed the deal!

167
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,725
[RIAS] I sleep with
him all the time!

168
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,694
Last night was no exception.

169
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:55,095
In bed together,

170
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,664
He didn't stop touching
my breasts the whole night.

171
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,900
[AKENO] Issei tosses and turns
a lot when he's unconscious.

172
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,737
Yeah, well, how many of
you have kissed him twice?

173
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,742
Jealousy. It truly is
women's kryptonite.

174
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,777
[DIODORA'S QUEEN] I demand
you stop this nonsense!

175
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,280
You ignore me and fight
amongst yourselves over a boy?

176
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,716
[RIAS, AKENO]
Back off!

177
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,185
[DIODORA'S QUEEN screams]

178
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,927
Nice. Looks like we've won.

179
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,062
As I'd expect from
our king and queen.

180
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,197
One hell of a double
attack finisher!

181
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,265
Word.

182
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,881
‐‐[RIAS] This isn't over, Akeno.
‐‐[AKENO] Right, right.

183
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,182
[RIAS]
Listen, I'm serious!

184
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,117
[AKENO giggles]
So am I!

185
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,421
I think you and I are going
to need to have a little chat

186
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,157
about boundaries after
we've rescued Asia.

187
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,892
I have no objections, Rias.

188
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,861
Asia is like a little
sister to me as well,

189
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,797
so let's focus on getting
her back for now.

190
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:06,399
Only the king and his
two knights are left.

191
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,969
[RIAS] It's unorthodox to send
your queen out to the front.

192
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,303
Why keep knights in reserve?

193
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:14,207
[FREED] Yo, yo, yo!
Long time no see, suckers!

194
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:18,344
Yes! Yes! I'm hard
to kill, that's a fact.

195
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,447
As you can see, I'm still
totally alive and kicking!

196
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,416
What are you doing here?

197
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,851
After our last encounter,

198
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,754
I was scooped up by
that whack‐job, Vali.

199
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:30,123
To make a long story short,
the Chaos Brigade picked up

200
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,392
the psycho‐priest free agent
standing in front of you.

201
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,828
And that's why you're
here as Diodora's knight?

202
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,396
His knight?

203
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,064
[laughs]

204
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,432
[FREED]
I ate 'em both!

205
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,467
They were finger‐lickin' good!

206
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,236
Gross, dude.

207
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,238
[KONEKO] Okay. I think
I might actually puke.

208
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:48,875
[laughing]

209
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,876
[AKENO, RIAS gasp]

210
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:55,448
[FREED continues laughing]

211
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,283
That's nasty.

212
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,756
[FREED] Since we're
all old friends here,

213
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,958
let me share a tidbit
of gossip with you.

214
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,393
It's a tasty secret about
Diodora's household.

215
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,196
You know, all those pretty
young girls you just beat up?

216
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,165
Every one of them was
a well‐respected nun

217
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,134
before Diodora got his
greasy mitts on 'em.

218
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,435
A couple of 'em
were even saints!

219
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,405
Diodora the explorah loves
bringing passionate holy women

220
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,808
down to the depths of hell
with smiles and sweet talk.

221
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,209
That's how the freak gets off.

222
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,245
[FREED laughs]

223
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,749
Then Asia's just
another conquest?

224
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,952
there was a spoiled
highborn devil brat.

225
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,755
He saw a holy woman that
was as pretty as a peach.

226
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,524
Blonde, petite. I'm talkin'
totally his type.

227
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,993
But, the woman was a guarded
treasure of the Church,

228
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,462
so he knew there was no
way he could kidnap her

229
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:45,098
and get away with it.
So, the clever devil brat

230
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,433
came up with a plan.
If the people of the Church

231
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,236
saw her healing an injured
agent of Hell like him,

232
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:53,907
then they would excommunicate
her, so he took a chance.

233
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:59,479
Sorry. I was thinking, I don't
regret saving Diodora back then.

234
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,381
What the hell, man?

235
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:05,451
What are you telling
me here, you mutant psycho?

236
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,954
This is no time to be reckless.

237
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,489
[FREED] Once she hit
rock bottom in despair

238
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,292
over the Church's betrayal,
he'd snatch the girl up

239
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,795
when she was at her lowest
and make her his completely!

240
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:18,832
Ravishing both body and soul.
A man's gotta have a vice!

241
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,301
And Diodora loves breaking
the will of little young girls

242
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,303
like her more than
anything else!

243
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,471
[ISSEI]
Shut the fuck up!

244
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,874
You should save
those feelings of rage

245
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,910
for your upcoming
battle against Astaroth,

246
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,244
Oh, come on, man!

247
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,313
You expect me to let him live?!

248
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,416
I will face Freed.

249
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,118
Kiba.

250
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:41,054
Let me put a stop
to his filthy talk.

251
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,488
[FREED]
Look what we have here!

252
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,158
It's the pretty boy knight
who used his scary sword

253
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,428
to cut me down last time
we met! But, no hard feelings.

254
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,833
I got this bodacious body
upgrade because of you!

255
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,335
The super invincible
mutated monster Freed is

256
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,270
coming to getcha,
Mister Beauty Mark!

257
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,206
You wanna throw down,
I'll throw down, Nancy!

258
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,976
We'd all prefer that
you ceased to exist.

259
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:13,253
Oh, come on! When the hell
did you get so strong?

260
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,489
Well, it won't matter soon.
You chumps don't stand a

261
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,224
snowball's chance
in hell of beating the

262
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,193
big shots pulling the strings.

263
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,629
Perhaps, but you should
have saved your last words

264
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,865
for the god of death.

265
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:25,932
[FREED groans]

266
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,535
[ISSEI]
Diodora.

267
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:34,174
Come out, you douche hole!
You hear me?

268
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,881
Asia! Hey!

269
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,315
I knew you'd come.

270
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,952
[DIODORA laughs]

271
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:48,188
[DIODORA] What took
you guys so long, huh?

272
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,523
You should've seen her face

273
00:14:49,523 --> 00:14:53,193
when I told her the
particulars of my plan.

274
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:56,597
Her expression was
absolutely priceless!

275
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,999
You're a real scumbag,
you know that?

276
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,634
[DIODORA]
I never get tired of it!

277
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,903
My favorite is the moments
when a woman of faith

278
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,938
and conviction
gives in to despair!

279
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:09,109
[DIODORA laughs]

280
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,177
That's enough, dickweed!

281
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:17,083
Dear Asia still clings to hope.
She still has her dear friends.

282
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,320
Especially you, Big Bad
Red Dragon Emperor.

283
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,988
Of course, I'm certain
he remembers

284
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,423
the fallen angel Raynare.

285
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,691
[ISSEI gasps]

286
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:29,563
had killed poor little Asia,
I had planned to off Raynare

287
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,431
and give Asia an Evil Piece,

288
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,234
and I mean both literally
and euphemistically.

289
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,036
You are disgusting!

290
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:39,439
I was caught off guard when
the Red Dragon Emperor,

291
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,443
or a reasonable facsimile
thereof, interfered in my plan.

292
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,478
I made the costly
mistake of waiting,

293
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,615
assuming a weak devil like
you would die instantly.

294
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,217
And to add
insult to injury,

295
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:54,621
Rias comes in to snatch
Asia up into her peerage.

296
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,358
[RIAS] You were behind it
all from the very beginning!

297
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,426
[DIODORA] But, don't worry.
I've forgiven you.

298
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,128
After all, being
part of your club

299
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,531
is the reason she's gotten
her hopes up so high.

300
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,300
She'll drop into the
deepest despair imaginable

301
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,470
once I've killed her friends
in front of her very eyes.

302
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,173
Asia is still
a virgin, isn't she?

303
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,142
I don't want the Red Dragon
Emperor's sloppy seconds.

304
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,243
[ISSEI]
Shut your mouth.

305
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,012
[DIODORA]
I do rather enjoy the idea

306
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,714
of stealing her away
from you, though.

307

Our own custom version
of Prima Nocta.

308
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,287
the mere thought of taking
Asia as she calls out your name

309
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,022
is absolutely delicious!

310
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,324
I said shut up!

311
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,994
