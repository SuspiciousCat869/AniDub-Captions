00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,402
[ISSEI]
It's simple.

2
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,539
I just wanted to protect her.

3
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,276
it doesn't matter if
we have a contract.

4
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,245
I'm bound to her just the same.

5
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,049
The way she holds herself,
standing dignified and strong,

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,785
her long crimson hair
flowing in the breeze.

7
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:56,089
She is my master.
I will serve her.

[ISSEI]
My Ruin Princess.

00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,805
[AKENO] You are the only one
who can bring my friend back.

10
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,174
[ASIA]
You're fighting to free her!

11
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,911
[ISSEI] I'd go to hell and
back to bring her home.

12
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,346
[AKENO] You'll have to
beat her in combat.

13
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,186
[ISSEI] After everything
she's done for me,

14
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,254
I can't leave her behind.

15
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,255
Wake up!

[ISSEI groans]

17
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,329
But more importantly, I did it.

18
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,599
And your boobs get
to stay perfect.

19
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,434
Oh, Issei.

20
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,308
[RIAS]
Can I ask you something?

21
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,911
Be honest. Are you
glad that you met me?

22
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,816
[RIAS]
I'm very happy here.

[ISSEI groaning]

24
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,921
[RIAS] No matter what,
it's going to be okay.

25
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,290
I will do everything in
my power to protect you.

00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,464
[ISSEI groaning]

27
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,702
[RIAS]
Issei.

28
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,639
You just saved my life.

29
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,439
Thank you.

30
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,945
[ISSEI]
Wake up!

31
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,481
Whatever! I like you and I
don't care what your name is!

32
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,383
I like you for who you are!

33
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,787
Rias, I... I love you.

34
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,456
[RIAS]
Next time, do your job well

35
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,525
whether there's a reward or not.

[gasps]

39
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,773
Great job today.
I was very impressed.

40
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:37,511
[RIAS] My name is Rias
Gremory, and I'm a devil.

41
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,045
[ISSEI]
Rias, please!

42
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,480
[RIAS]
You're mine now.

43
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,049
Nice to meet you, Issei Hyodo.

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,990
[ISSEI]
Rias!

46
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,993
[ISSEI]
I understand.

47
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,729
I know what I've gotta do now.

48
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,332
But... I'm so afraid
of hurting you.

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,838
[ISSEI] I just wanted
to be your protector.

50
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,558
[ISSEI]
Not on my watch.

51
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,562
[ISSEI]
If I don't put a stop to this,

52
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,997
then Loki gets exactly
what he wants!

53
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,333
Please! Stop it, Rias!

54
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,770
Don't let him win!
You're better than that!

[gasps]

56
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,410
[ISSEI]
I won't let you down.

57
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,846
[ISSEI]
I'll do whatever it takes.

58
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,981
Nothing is gonna stop me.

00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,016
[ISSEI]
I'll do whatever it takes.

60

Nothing is gonna stop me.

61
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,822
[ISSEI]
I'll always save you.

62
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,359
I'm your pawn, after all.
It's my job, right?

63
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,697
[ISSEI] That's right.
I am Rias Gremory's pawn!

64
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,900
[ISSEI]
Rias.

65
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:16,977
[ISSEI]
Wake up!

66
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,854
Issei?

67
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,057
[RIAS]
It's you!

68
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,896
Thank you. My darling.

69
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,698
You saved my life.

70
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,070
Rias! You're you again, right?

71
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,939
I was so worried!

72
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,179
[ISSEI]
Asshole.

73
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,081
You're gonna pay
for what you've done.

74
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,451
Using my body. Using my face!

75
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,687
You're goin' down.

[ISSEI gasps]

79
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:08,995
It morphed.

80
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,599
[ROSSWEISSE]
I'm relieved you're all safe.

81
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,102
when you guys suddenly popped
out of thin air like that.

82
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,140
Us too. But Rias and Issei
are still stuck in there.

83
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,210
Loki somehow managed to get his
hands on a powerful fragment

84
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,547
left over from Issei's
transformation.

85
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,182
So he has to fight
his exact duplicate?

86
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,585
Do you think Issei will
be able to beat himself?

87
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,756
Don't know. For now,
all we can do is believe.

88
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,525
If there's anyone who can
beat himself, it's Issei.

89
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,493
Let us pray for his success.

90
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,595
You're right.

91
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:45,532
[XENOVIA] You have to stay
strong for her, Issei.

92
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,702
[ASIA] I believe in you both.
Fight with all your heart.

93
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,606
[AKENO]
Come back to us.

[EVIL DRAGON roaring]

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,017
We've gotta do something
soon, or else we're toast.

96
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,252
[ISSEI]
Loki was able to take advantage

97
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,722
of my deepest, darkest
insecurities,

98
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:12,158
and found the same kind of
weakness in Rias's heart.

99
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,594
You got a plan?

100
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,828
[ISSEI]
Mh‐hm.

101
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,898
[ISSEI]
That's right. I've got a plan.

102
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,199
I'm gonna get super pissed off

103
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,536
and totally flip out
on this jabroni!

104
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:26,106
No matter what happens,
I'll keep trying.

105
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,610
[DDRAIG]
Welsh Dragon. Balance Breaker!

106
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,579
[ISSEI] I straight‐up
refuse to let her down!

107
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,982
So, uh, what's that?

108
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,619
Think of it as an evil piece
of downloadable content,

109
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,286
but still in beta.

110
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:44,090
I transferred those additions
to the piece inside of you.

111
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,793
And since this is the
trial run for the process,

112
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,895
any results have yet
to be determined.

113
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,263
But assuming there
are no defects,

114
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,899
it should enhance your
special characteristics.

115
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,236
It responds to the strength
of the end user's will.

116
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,707
[ISSEI]
Promise me.

117
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,176
Promise you'll stay the
strong and regal woman

118
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,845
you've always been.

119
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:11,752
that's kept hidden from
everyone, it doesn't matter!

120
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:16,790
[ISSEI] You'll never have
to worry about that again!

121
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,026
If it ever becomes too
much for you to handle,

122
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,328
I'll be there to
pick you back up!

123
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,679
[ISSEI]
You okay?

124
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,282
Yeah, I'm fine.

125
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,886

The field's dissipating.

127
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,124
What the hell's going on?

128
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,728
[DDRAIG] We're being pulled
into some kind of vortex

[ISSEI]
What's going to happen to us?

I'm not a self‐aware
encyclopedia, y'know.

132
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,204
I know. You don't
have to be a dick.

133
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,774
[DDRAIG] Hush. Can't
you sense his approach?

134
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,057
Great Red. Sucker's huge!

135
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,627
Of course. He's the
Dragon of Dragons.

136
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,231
[DDRAIG]
The Dragon of Dreams.

137
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,900
Another chance like
this may not come along.

138
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,669
We should follow his lead.

139
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:36,803
Okay.

140
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,355
Where are we?

141
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:59,225
Dunno. We were on this
beach before I realized it.

142
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,827
How strange.

143
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,033
Poor guy. Battered and
bruised for me again.

144
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:11,204
Yeah, it hurts, but these
injuries are no big deal.

145
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,440
As long as we're together,
I can put up with a lot.

146
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,682
[ISSEI]
What's up?

147
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,059
[RIAS] I don't want you all to
myself, or anything like that.

148
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,295
I'm not the jealous type.

149
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,699
At least, I never thought
that was the case.

150
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,801
But you're so close to Asia.

151
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,337
And... the way the rest of the
girls throw themselves at you.

152
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,841
I was so terrified of
becoming an afterthought.

153
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,376
But now you've shown
me how you really feel.

00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:52,973
[AKENO]
Mh‐hm.

160
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,008
You sure took
your sweet time.

161
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,176
Akeno.

162
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,548
is beating that fake me
in the Twilight Zone.

163
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,149
You kicked your own ass?

164
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,451
I've come to expect
no less from you!

165
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,088
[ISSEI] I think so,
but it's all kinda hazy.

166
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,824
My memory's been fuzzy
since the mind control.

167
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:14,060
Wow. What happened here?

168
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,995
Uhh.

169
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:17,564
We're just happy you're
home safe and sound.

170
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,033
Me too. Thanks, you guys.

171
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:23,904
the worst was going to happen,
and you'd never make it back!

172
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:27,107
Now that that's over.
What's next?

173
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:33,246
I'm pretty surprised
those kids made it back

174
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,815
from the Dimensional Gap.

175
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:37,818
to witness something
well worth the trip.

176
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,085
[AZAZEL] The Red Dragon
Emperor's encounter

177
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:42,956
So that was your game
plan all along, huh?

178
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,158
[VALI]
Hmph. Yeah, sure.

179
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,226
[AZAZEL chuckles]

180
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:50,463
Ha.

181
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,198
Yeah.

182
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,368
[SIR ZECHS] Azazel just
contacted me with good news.

183
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,938
It seems Rias has
returned home safely.

184
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,339
[GRAYFIA]
How wonderful!

185
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,977
I don't know how I'll ever repay
Issei for rescuing my sister.

186
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:08,281
Issei didn't do it with the
thought of a reward in his mind.

187
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,850
He's always been
the honest type.

188
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,921
and keeps moving full steam
ahead, straight as an arrow.

189
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,361
[ISSEI]
Ddraig!

190
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:25,131
since I've manifested
myself in this form.

191
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,901
You're right. Does that mean
I'm dreaming right now?

192
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,270
[DDRAIG]
I have some big news for you.

193
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,072
Lay it on me.

194
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,407
[DDRAIG] Aside from
the dragon transformation,

195
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,378
it seems another possibility for
growth has presented itself.

196
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,980
[ISSEI]
What does that mean?

197
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,115
[DDRAIG]
I don't really know for sure.

198
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,117
But you live with
a bevy of beauties,

199
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,020
so what's one more cock‐tease?

200
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,155
Hey! No fair!

201
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,594
Akeno's squeeze‐bag!

202
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:58,298
Sweet! The bed's never
been this crowded before.

203
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,502
[RIAS] After everything
that's happened,

204
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:04,404
the girls wanted
to stay extra close.

205
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,473
Good morning. Sleep well?

206
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,645
[ISSEI] Good morning.
Yeah, I slept like the dead.

207
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:16,149
I feel bad for causing so much
trouble and worry for everyone.

208
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,118
There's really nothing
to be embarrassed about.

209
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,453
None of that was your fault.

210
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,156
[RIAS]
It's strange.

211
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,391
I can remember bits and pieces.

212
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:30,430
[RIAS]
The details are all foggy,

213
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,966
but I remember the warmth.

214
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,400
The phantom memory
of that feeling

215
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,402
still lingers in my chest.

216
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:39,973
What about you?

217
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,977
I got nothin'.
I'm sorry, really.

218
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,681
It's fine. You mean
the world to me.

219
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,017
I'm happy being with you
just the way you are.

220
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,959
[RIAS] That's right.
That's how it should be.

221
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,961
[ISSEI] I don't really
get what's going on,

222
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,663
but I know one thing for sure!

223
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:07,233
Rias's boobs are the tits!
Nipplage in my face!

224
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,340
Welcome home!
Hope you had a nice trip!

225
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,976
Looks like travel suits you.

226
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,744
[FATHER laughs]
Such a pleasant surprise

227
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,680
your family owns
a travel agency!

228
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,583
And were gracious enough to
give us a trip around the world

229
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:24,250
as a gift for opening our home!

230
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,519
Good to see you, Irina!

231
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,988
[ISSEI chuckles]
The trip provided a great way

232
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,523
to mask our time
in the underworld.

233
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:32,292
Welcome home!
I'm so glad that you're back!

234
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,760
‐‐[MOTHER] Hi, Asia!
‐‐[FATHER] Oh, Asia, dear!

235
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,530
[FATHER]
We missed you most of all!

236
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,534
It's true. Hardly a day went by
where we didn't ask ourselves,

237
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:43,537
"What's Asia up to now?" or
"I wonder how she's doing?"

238
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,272
Well, as you can see,
I'm doing just fine!

239
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:48,542
And you can thank Issei
and the rest for that.

240
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,243
I'm so grateful!

241
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,412
[laughs] Please, dear.
It's nothin' to cry about.

242
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,380
Sweetie, we didn't mean
to get you worked up!

243
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,549
[ASIA]
Oh, no, I'm sorry!

244
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:57,117
It's sweet that they treat Asia

245
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,384
like one of their
actual children.

246
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,720
While my place as their real son

247
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,655
continues to shrink
in the distance.

248
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,557
[MOTHER] Can you blame us?
I mean, take a look!

249
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:05,191
Asia is just so much cuter!

250
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,162
I'd take Asia as our
daughter in a heartbeat!

251
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,097
Thanks! It's just...

252
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:13,266
I never knew my
real mom and dad,

253
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,401
so hearing you both say
something that generous

254
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,570
makes me really happy.

255
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,304
You can think of us
as your real parents

256
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,773
from here on out, if you'd like.

257
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:23,043
Thank you, mom.
Thank, you dad.

258
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,511
[ISSEI]
That's right.

259
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,480
Family. That means
you're not alone.

260
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,183
We're all in this together,
no matter what comes at us.

261
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,453
Now let's make sure to
look after each other.

262
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,756
Okay then. It's a deal!

263
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:43,129
would you extend your
hospitality to our new friend?

264
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,331
It's a pleasure to meet you.

265
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,434
[ISSEI chuckles] Mom and Dad,
I'd like you to meet Rossweisse.

266
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,736
She's, uh...

267
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,337
She's a new teacher
at the school,

268
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,773
and since my father
renovated your home,

269
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,440
I knew there was enough room.

270
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,509
Huh?

271
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,146
It's a summary of the benefits
package for servants

272
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:04,551
[ROSSWEISSE] No way! The
insurance premium's so cheap!

273
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:06,486
And no term life
policy mumbo jumbo!

274
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,422
Valhalla never offered dental
or paid vacation days!

275
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,290
I know.

276
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,525
If Rias ever needed work,

277
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,293
she'd do really well
as an insurance rep.

278
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,596
She's actually buying a
Valkyrie on the cheap.

279
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,364
And the devil's whispers
were woven with temptation.

280
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:19,866
I could learn a lot from her.

281
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,635
[IRINA, AKENO laugh]

282
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:22,869
[RIAS]
So, what do you think?

283
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,338
Sign up with Team Gremory
for the big win!

284
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:27,307
The underworld would
be glad to have you!

285
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,676
You're really going make
her one of your evil pieces?

286
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,277
That's a pretty unusual
choice, isn't it?

287
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,882
Right now, Rias and I are the
only wizard‐type spellcasters

288
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,751
our squad has on the roster.

289
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:39,485
She complements our style.

290
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,487
[ISSEI]
I think Koneko's right.

291
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,490
would be best utilized
in long‐range attacks.

292
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,459
I'm thinking artillery support.

293
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,697
Perhaps the Norns themselves

294
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,533
spun the thread of fate
that led me to your house.

295
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,334
Ever since our first meeting
in the underworld,

296
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,836
things just seemed right.

297
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,609
[ROSSWEISSE]
Due to the Gremory family's

298
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,310
record of financial solvency,

299
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,479
and the top‐tier health
insurance and pensions plans,

300
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,682
I feel like I finally
have a secure future

301
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:11,284
now that I've become a
devil in your service.

302
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:15,255
Everyone, I look forward to our
joyous days of working together.

303
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,457
And so, Rossweisse
is part of our crew.

304
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,792
She's officially
our second rook,

305
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,894
and newest member
of Team Gremory.

306
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,630
the whole thing seemed more
casual than I expected.

307
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,666
[XENOVIA]
I prefer them short and sweet.

308
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,634
It was the same for me as well.

309
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,771
[ROSSWEISSE laughs]
This is a dream come true.

310
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:32,639
You can take your crummy
job and shove it,

311
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,307
you prune faced old pervert!

312
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,577
Now all your pieces
