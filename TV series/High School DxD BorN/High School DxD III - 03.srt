1
00:00:35,214 --> 00:00:37,517
[KUROKA] I only sent
a fraction of my chi out,

2
00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:38,582
and yet you still came running.

3
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:41,585
I'm glad you can still
feel our sisterly bond.

4
00:00:41,585 --> 00:00:42,653
What do you want?

5
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:45,389
My time is precious,
so spill it.

6
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,591
[KUROKA] There's no
need to be rude, honey!

7
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:48,960
I just heard it
through the grapevine

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,795
that a big party was going down.

9
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:55,699
but you know what they
say about curiosity and cats.

10
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:32,063
This isn't like Koneko!

11
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:35,433
Then again,
girl's been actin' weird.

12
00:02:35,433 --> 00:02:37,068
[RIAS] She's really been
pushing herself lately

13
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,804
and having to come to grips
with some personal issues.

14
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,640
[RIAS]
How are you feeling?

15
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,875
[KONEKO]
Useless.

16
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,609
[RIAS] Well, you're
not one to give up,

17
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:48,813
so I'm sure you'll be fighting
at full strength very soon.

18
00:02:48,813 --> 00:02:50,648
I hate missing out on training.

19
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,716
We all know that, but the
training would be worthless

20
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:55,186
if you're not healthy enough
to get something from it.

21
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:59,023
how strong Kiba, Xenovia,
and Akeno have become.

22
00:02:59,023 --> 00:03:01,659
Even that lazy horn dog
has made progress.

23
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,228
Meanwhile, I feel left
further and further behind.

24
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:08,166
Gasper's even gotten
more powerful lately,

25
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,168
and I don't have
Asia's power to heal people,

26
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:12,670
so what's left for me?

27
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,839
Be fair. You'll improve too.

28
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,042
Yeah, unless things
continue like this.

29
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,011
Then, I'll just be obsolete.

30
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,013
How can a rook
be the weakest?

31
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:25,516
I'd never forgive myself
if I held you back.

32
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:28,953
[KONEKO] But I don't want to
have to use my nekomata powers

33
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:30,789
to catch up.

34
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,223
I'm so afraid to use them.

35
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:34,258
Afraid to be like her.

36
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:35,794
I won't!

37
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:42,266
I refuse to let
that happen again.

38
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:45,103
[ISSEI] I had no idea.
That sucks balls.

39
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:49,808
Sadly, Koneko will have
to overcome by herself.

40
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:52,743
We all have struggles
we must face alone.

41
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:55,646
[ASIA] I haven't seen Issei in
a while. I wonder where he is.

42
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:58,016
Rias seems to
be missing as well.

43
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:01,019
Ah. Please escort
them in, Barkiel.

44
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,022
[gasps]

45
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,857
[AZAZEL] Y'know,
for a crotchety old bastard

46
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:08,026
from the Northern wastes,
you're not looking too bad.

47
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:11,129
[ODIN] I like what your
husband's done with your hair.

48
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:12,063
[SIR ZECHS]
Charming.

49
00:04:12,063 --> 00:04:13,865
It's been too long, Lord Odin.

50
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:16,935
How we've missed your
casually homophobic banter.

51
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,569
[ODIN]
Greetings, Sir Zechs.

52
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,139
and let me thank you
personally for your invitation.

53
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:23,141
Lord Odin,
mighty God of the North;

54
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:24,943
you honor us with this visit.

55
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:27,711
I expected more
from you, Leviathan.

56
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:27,711
A pretty young
thing such as yourself

57
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:31,582
shouldn't be in
drab clothing like that.

58
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:32,984
This is a party, isn't it?

59
00:04:32,984 --> 00:04:36,187
Good point!

60
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:39,958
Mirurun mirumiru spiral!

61
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:47,065
Oh my. What the
hell just happened?

62
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:48,933
[LEVIATHAN] Well, have you been
living in a cave or something?

63
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,702
This is a magical girl outfit;
they're totes the rage.

64
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:54,806
How'd you like to
stroke Odin's beard?

65
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:57,008
Please keep in mind why
we made the voyage, milord.

66
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,110
You're here
representing Valhalla!

67
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,579
Must you always be
the downer in the room?

68
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:03,181
It's that kind of
attitude that keeps you

69
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:05,016
from getting a
hero for yourself.

70
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,217
[gasps]

71
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,854
[cries]

72
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:12,123
I may be just an ugly Valkyrie
who's never had a man,

73
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,724
but at least I won't die alone

74
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:15,059
what with living
in the underworld.

75
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,594
[ODIN]
Sorry about her.

76
00:05:16,594 --> 00:05:19,130
This ball of neuroses
is named Rossweisse.

77
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,933
My highly capable,
but depressing, assistant.

78
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,268
That's why she can't find a man.

79
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:26,770
[MICHAEL] Allow me to apologize
for keeping you waiting.

80
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,908
Odin, All‐father of the Norse!

81
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:33,878
Looking as hale and hearty
as ever, Your Excellency.

82
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:37,882
[AKENO] Did she come as
part of Michael's entourage?

83
00:05:37,882 --> 00:05:40,218
[ASIA] Who'd figure we'd run
into her in the underworld?

84
00:05:40,885 --> 00:05:43,654
[KONEKO] So, like, what
are you doing here, Kuroka?

85
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:44,722
[KUROKA]
Seriously?

86
00:05:44,722 --> 00:05:46,791
I came back for you, Shirone.

87
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,859
When things went south,

88
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,660
I had to drop
everything and run.

89
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,629
I couldn't take you with me.

90
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:52,163
[RIAS]
Kuroka.

91
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:55,934
I had a feeling that Koneko
knew that weirdo cat‐lady.

92
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,235
[RIAS]
They're sisters.

93
00:05:57,235 --> 00:05:59,037
Hey‐oh! Kitty‐cat!

94
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:00,771
It's the Chaos Brigade!

95
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,040
[KUROKA]
What is it, Bikou?

96
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,875
[BIKOU] Two rats are
veiled in the shadows.

97
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,210
You perceived them, yes?

98
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,816
we can easily detect interlopers
by the mere flow of their chi.

99
00:06:11,816 --> 00:06:13,651
Rias, you're here, and pervy?

100
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:16,287
Kuroka. Koneko is a
member of my household,

101
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:19,123
and we Gremorys always
look out for our own.

102
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,425
[KUROKA] Your household?
Like that matters.

103
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,962
She and I are sisters,
first and foremost.

104
00:06:23,962 --> 00:06:26,998
I'm not going to give her to you
just because you "deign it."

105
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:28,166
[ISSEI]
Hey, monkey dick!

106
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,701
How's my buddy Vali doing?

107
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,670
[BIKOU chuckles]
He's fine.

108
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,974
That cretin is the
Red Dragon Emperor.

109
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:38,676
[KUROKA] Oh! So he's
the super titty freak

110
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:43,214
Damn right! Though I consider
myself more a connoisseur.

111
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,016
I still don't get
what you want.

112
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:48,386
I wanted to invite you to
join Orphis and Vali and me.

113
00:06:48,386 --> 00:06:50,789
After all, cutie
pie, as my sister,

114
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:53,057
you have the same
killer power in your blood.

115
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:54,793
I won't leave.

116
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,796
I've found my place as
a part of Rias's family!

117
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,464
Koneko's one of us, and we're
not just gonna hand her over.

118
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:03,134
I guess we'll just have
to take her from you then.

119
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,937
[BIKOU] Personally, I'm
excited you intend to resist.

120
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:08,472
I can't imagine a finer way
to consume some time.

121
00:07:08,472 --> 00:07:10,341
Why would they
want to take up time?

122
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:13,244
[SIR ZECHS] Devils, gods, and
fallen angels have seen the

123
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:16,414
lessons of the past, and chosen
to live together in peace.

124
00:07:16,414 --> 00:07:18,349
But the Chaos Brigade chooses
to fan the flames of war...

125
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,184
[BIKOU] We decided to kill
two birds with one stone,

126
00:07:20,184 --> 00:07:23,922
as the saying goes, and thus
lured your female friend out.

127
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:26,057
Vali ordered us to
escort a certain VIP

128
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:28,759
to your quaint
diplomatic congregation.

129
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:35,066
if there are no objections,
please sign the pact monument.

130
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,869
[KUROKA] Apparently,
he had a couple issues

131
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:39,971
with tonight's get‐together.

132
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,273
[LOKI]
Objection!

133
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,208
I'm surprised
he waited this long.

134
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,879
[ODIN]
You arrogant fool.

135
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,182
I am the Norse god,
Loki. Greetings.

136
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:53,217
All right!
Now we got a party!

137
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:56,120
[SIR ZECHS] Lord Loki, you may
be the Norse god of mischief,

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,756
but that gives you no right
to cause problems here.

139
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,992
[LOKI] Seeing Odin,
our great All‐Father mingling

140
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:02,760
with lesser
mythologies causes me

141
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,129
to suffer indescribable
torment, Sir Zechs.

142
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,232
Leave, Loki. If you return
to Valhalla immediately,

143
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:11,002
I'll forgive you for
this public affront.

144
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:13,838
Really? You can
shove your forgiveness.

145
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,174
Oh great, another
man without manners!

146
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,876
[LOKI] If he chooses
to sign an alliance

147
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,878
with the other mythologies,
it will make things

148
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,847
incredibly difficult for me
to set Ragnarok into motion!

149
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,516
The lyrics are different
but the song sounds the same.

150
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:29,253
Look kid, you're just a clown
working for the Chaos Brigade.

151
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,956
[LOKI] Working for? No.
Working with? Yes.

152
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:34,258
But I admit this
op was my idea.

153
00:08:34,258 --> 00:08:37,061
Now, let me introduce
you to my beloved son!

154
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,936
Something's gone wrong!
The council is under attack!

155
00:08:44,936 --> 00:08:46,170
Heh!

156
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:49,540
Huh?! That can't be good.

157
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,176
It's a little barrier
I put on the forest

158
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:54,112
to keep us all trapped
together for a bit.

159
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,214
[BIKOU]
Okay, Red Dragon Emperor.

160
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:57,816
Show me your power!

161
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,155
[ISSEI thinking] These
guys aren't jerking around!

162
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:06,324
[TANNIN]
Would you mind if I cut in?

163
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:08,292
[ISSEI]
Hell yeah! Tannin's here!

164
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:11,830
[DDRAIG] He must have followed
my power's energy signature.

165
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,067
You emit enough power
to make tracking simple.

166
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:19,337
Plus there was something about
Issei that was bothering me.

167
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,538
[ISSEI]
Might wanna get used to that.

168
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,006
[BIKOU]
The previous dragon king?

169
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:23,607
Oh, you've piqued my interest!

170
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,910
Go ahead, monkey.
You know you wanna.

171
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,279
Flying Nimbus!

172
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,982
Extend! Ruyi Bang!

173
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:36,520
[laughs]

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,622
I haven't had this
much fun in ages!

175
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:39,958
Look at him go!

176
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:41,425
His firepower is way
amped up compared

177
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:43,461
to what he whipped out
while we were training!

178
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:45,864
Ha! Son Goku!

179
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:47,899
This is proving to
be quite entertaining!

180
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,001
[KUROKA] The monkey king
and a dragon.

181
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,602
They're gonna have a blast.

182
00:09:51,602 --> 00:09:55,073
Now then, are you gonna hand
over my baby sister or not?

183
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,174
That a "no"?

184
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,642
Fine. Guess I gotta kill ya.

185
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:00,644
[TANNIN]
Kids! I have a plan!

186
00:10:00,644 --> 00:10:05,316
While I slap this monkey around,
you guys pound that pussy!

187
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:09,053
Are you the Red Dragon
and his master or not?

188
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,023
Dude, it's a bit more
complicated than that!

189
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,557
[RIAS thinking]
Kuroka is a major threat,

190
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:16,494
but I don't want to fight
her in front of Koneko.

191
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:17,595
[KONEKO]
Just stop!

192
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:19,530
Look, it's fine;
I'll come with you.

193
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,166
[RIAS]
You don't get to do that!

194
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,236
But first, you have to let
my friends leave unharmed.

195
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,972
You are my servant,
retainer of my household,

196
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:31,109
and my friend!
Leaving me is not an option.

197
00:10:31,109 --> 00:10:33,044
[KONEKO]
My sister is too strong.

198
00:10:33,044 --> 00:10:35,446
I know what she can
do better than anyone.

199
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,517
[RIAS]
Don't worry.

200
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:42,453
To protect you, I'll fight
her with everything I've got.

201
00:10:43,454 --> 00:10:46,991
I understand Shirone's
true potential better

202
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,392
than a bitch like
you ever could.

203
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:52,430
I'll show you how to
kick ass "sage art" style.

204
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,699
No, I don't need
that power, not ever.

205
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:58,970
I don't want my strength to
come from other people's pain!

206
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,006
Do you not understand
how much you hurt your sister

207
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,474
when you chose to
drown in your own power

208
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:05,143
and leave her behind?

209
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:07,278
When you ran away after
murdering your master,

210
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,547
this brave girl saw hell.

211
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:14,285
having feelings was a
luxury she couldn't afford.

212
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:14,285
[RIAS] Koneko had
been abandoned by you,

213
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:19,290
betrayed by the only person
she thought she could trust.

214
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,192
And when the other
devils despised her,

215
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:23,494
tried with all their might
to bully her into leaving,

216
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,563
she was completely alone.

217
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:28,332
You've lost the right
to demand anything of her.

218
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,601
Rias, thank you.

219
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,536
That's the reason I've
always tried to show her

220
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:35,506
the finest things
life has to offer.

221
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:39,043
I'm going to stay,
so, leave Kuroka.

222
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:41,345
I don't want to go
with you, all right?

223
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:43,214
é\My name is Koneko Tojo.

224
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:46,217
I'm choosing to live
my life with my master,

225
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,451
and that's final!

226
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:50,388
It seems she's decided
to stay on as my rook,

227
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:52,356
where she's loved,

228
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:55,093
because we treasure
family in my house.

229
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:59,363
I will never allow you to lay
so much as a finger on her!

230
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:02,766
That speech inspired me
into a full on chubby!

231
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:07,538
You'll have to go through me
to get to these hot ladies!

232
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:12,176
[KUROKA] Hmph! Even though you
know there's no way you'll win?

233
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:13,411
What an idiot.

234
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:14,712
It's go time.

235
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,616
Hey. What the fog?

236
00:12:20,718 --> 00:12:22,320
Wait, what's
wrong with you two?

237
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,222
[KUROKA] My magic mist
is wicked effective

238
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:26,324
against devils
and spirits and such.

239
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:28,492
Shocking, it doesn't work
so well on dragons, though.

240
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:29,593
[ISSEI]
You bitch!

241
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:31,029
[KUROKA] I watered
down the poison,

242
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,763
so they won't be
killed any time soon.

243
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:36,367
Plus, it's a lot more fun
to watch them die slowly.

244
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,337
[roars]

245
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,388
[grunts]

246
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,626
[BARKIEL]
This girl is off‐limits, pup.

247
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,596
Oh look, a hero.

248
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,732
[gasps]

249
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,270
[AJUKA]
You left yourself open.

250
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,638
[LOKI]
Beelzebub?

251
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,143
[SIR ZECHS]
Well played.

252
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,577
Are you hurt Akeno?

253
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:46,126
Impressive attack,
but still useless.

254
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:48,261
Boosted Gear, go!

255
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,665
[ISSEI]
Huh?! Oh, come on!

256
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,134
[TANNIN]
As I thought.

257
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,469
Yo, gramps!
What's goin' on here?

258
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,405
[DDRAIG] This is the result
of your training with Tannin.

259
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,875
You'll have to decide
if you want to power up

260
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,377
or to Balance Break.

261
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,846
So are you telling me
I might be able

262
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,680
to do a Balance
Breaker right now?

263
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:07,680
But you won't be able
to kick out the jams

264
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,153
using your Balance Breaker
without a radical catalyst.

265
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,454
[ISSEI]
Radical catfish?

266
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,422
[DDRAIG]
The rest is up to you, boy.

267
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,192
Hey, just telling me that
doesn't make me know

268
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,793
what I'm supposed
to do all of a sudden.

269
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,496
The mighty
Red Dragon Emperor will die

270
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,565
without ever activating
his Sacred Gear?

271
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,200
He doesn't have the balls!

272
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,735
[gasps]

273
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,905
[RIAS]
Issei!

274
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,308
If you do,
the poison's gonna spread.

275
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:42,748
If you keep this up,
she's going to kill you!

276
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,886
Why does Vali have
a rage boner for this kid?

277
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,521
How could he make
anyone retreat from anything?

278
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,291
[ISSEI thinking] Damn!
This is how it always goes.

279
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,260
When I helped Asia,
or when I saved Rias.

280
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,429
In the end, I crap out.

281
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,300
I'm a failure.
I don't deserve anything!

282
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,969
I let Asia die once.

283
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,305
I made Rias cry once.

284
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,973
If I can't save them
the first time around,

285
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,342
then what kind of
legendary dragon am I?

286
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,978
Issei, no!

287
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,680
[ISSEI thinking]
Why can't I unleash my power

288
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,516
unless someone gets hurt?

289
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,251
It's so frustrating

290
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,354
because all I want
to do is protect them!

291
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:24,457
[ISSEI] I don't really care
if you're her sister or not.

292
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:28,661
and that's the kind of
bullshit I just can't handle!

293
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,931
[KUROKA] Now I really
feel bad for Shirone.

294
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,499
Some mud covered
Lancelot‐wannabe loser

295
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,368
is enough to creep any girl out.

296
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,871
It makes my skin crawl.

297
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,873
Issei is my friend.

298
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:43,543
Even though I've got a
legendary dragon's power in me,

299
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:44,777
I can't do a damned thing.

300
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,379
Talk about a disappointment.

301
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,816
I must be the most useless,
talentless devil of all time.

302
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,319
most Red Dragon
Emperors get obsessed

303
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,389
with their power and wind up
going completely insane.

304
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,360
It seems my sister
has followed their lead.

305
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,529
Sure, they have power,
but they've lost control.

306
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,932
And once that happens,
it's too late.

307
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,903
but you may be the least
douchebaggy Red Dragon Emperor

308
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:11,504
that has ever existed.

309
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,639
That's why you're
kind of a total wimp

310
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,675
compared to the rest of them.

311
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:17,410
But I believe you're
the type of dragon

312
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,778
we can be mildly proud of!

313
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,747
D'you mean it? For real?

314
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,950
[DDRAIG] Kick out the jams
using your Balance Breaker

315
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,618
without a radical catalyst.

316
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,288
[ISSEI thinking] Of course!
So that's what he meant!

317
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,790
The sleeper has awakened.

318
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,658
[ISSEI]
Okay, guys. I think I know

319
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,829
what might help me crank
this up to the next level.

320
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,998
I can beat her
with my Balance Breaker.

321
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:42,114
But first. I'm gonna
need your help, Rias!

322
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,257
What do you need Issei?

323
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,705
I'll do anything in
my power to assist you.

324
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,074
In that case,
let me poke yo titties.

325
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,944
[RIAS]
Oh, jeez...

326
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,013
Well, if that's what it's
gonna take to get you going,

327
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,014
then have at it.

328
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,681
[gasps] I got the green light?

329
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,719
I'm pushing that nipple
back deep in there, babe.

330
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,054
Let's rock and roll!

331
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,962
Do it quickly, please!

332
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:10,797
This feels a little ridiculous.

333
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,266
[TANNIN] What do you
think you're doing?

334
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,234
I need you to fend them
off long enough for me

335
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,036
to poke Rias's
funbags, all right?

336
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,405
[TANNIN]
In the middle of a battle,

337
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,240
you want to poke her breast?

338
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,508
They want to kill you!

339
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:24,344
This is no time to
try reaching second base!

340
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,221
No it's not about that!

341
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:28,047
I'm gonna poke nip to
charge my Balance Breaker!

342
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,350
[TANNIN] Were our training
sessions that useless?

343
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,186
Wow, you really are an idiot.

344
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:40,260
Have you ever seen
this kind of tactic before?

345
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,096
Rias Gremory just whipped out
her license and registration,

346
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,832
and put 'em on display
for the Red Dragon Emperor!

347
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,301
I must see this!

348
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:50,404
[gasps] Hey,
leather face! Problem!

349
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,939
[TANNIN] What is it?
Did something go wrong?

350
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,841
[ISSEI] The right can
or the left can?

351
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,109
Which one do I choose?

352
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,544
[TANNIN]
You simpleton!

353
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,546
They're exactly the same!

354
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:02,015
Just do what you're
gonna do already!

355
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,283
What? This is serious, man!

356
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,352
There's no way in hell
they're both the same.

357
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,920
It's deal or no deal.

358
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,456
I'm pushing the buzzer
for the first time ever!

359
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,927
Lives are at stake here, dude,
so give me a real answer!

360
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,362
Rias? Any thoughts?

361
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:19,499
Just poke both of them at the
same time, you horny moron!

362
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:24,904
That's the best advice
I've ever been given!

363
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,442
Get ready. I'm comin'.

364
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,844
[AZAZEL] If you press them,
they cry out.

365
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,613
[ISSEI thinking]
If I press them, they cry out!

366
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:42,956
Oh no.

367
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,458
It works!

368
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,327
You've finally
boosted your power!

369
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,266
[DDRAIG]
Welsh Dragon... Balance Breaker!

370
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,400
You are the worst.

371
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,236
A Red Dragon
Emperor perv deluxe.

372
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,344
[ISSEI] Balance Breaker
Boosted Gear Scale Mail!

373
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:08,415
My power was unleashed by
poking my master's headlights!

374
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,384
[DDRAIG]
Congratulations, partner!

375
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:13,119
But I'm not looking forward
to what you're going to use

376
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,455
this hand for
when we're done here.

377
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,957
[TANNIN] Mass perversion aside,
you've finally done it!

378
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,993
Your energy
signature is radiant!

379
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,262
Heheh... Things are
starting to get interesting!

380
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,299
Now, say hello to my
mix of sage and demon magic!

381
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,566
Try some.

382
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:32,639
Huh?

383
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,475
[ISSEI]
Is that all you got?

384
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,578
No! You damn brat!

385
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:53,960
[ISSEI]
Don't make my friend cry.

386
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,329
You feel me?

387
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,599
[ISSEI]
If you come after Koneko again,

388
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,937
It won't matter if you're
a woman or her sister.

389
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,273
You are my enemy.

390
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,641
Eat me, jerk!

391
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,444
What are you doing?

392
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:13,647
You became so excited
you lost perception.

393
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:17,551
Huh? Loki's not here. Why not?

394
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,253
Indeed. Pardon the pun,

395
00:20:19,253 --> 00:20:22,221
but we don't have any
more time to monkey around.

396
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:32,098
[SIR ZECHS] So then, you fought
his accomplices in the forest.

397
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:35,068
[RIAS]
Yes, Bikou. Kuroka, too.

398
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,371
[SIR ZECHS] And did they
leave our Koneko unharmed?

399
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:40,274
She had a bit of a shock,
but she's fine.

400
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:44,978
Koneko is a member of my
esteemed household, after all.

401
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:47,180
Then I made the right
decision giving her to you.

402
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,516
You've become a true master
over your household, Rias.

403
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:50,617
I'm very proud.

404
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,225
Now that's what
I call a crazy day.

405
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,996
After angry gods and giant
wolves, it's nice to relax.

406
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,364
And it was good to see Irina.

407
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:07,033
Seems like she's doing well.

408
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,568
That's unbelievably awful.

409
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,505
It can't be easy, looking at
your sister as an enemy.

410
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:14,474
Like it or not,
you can't erase family.

411
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:16,576
Yeah, don't I know.

412
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,645
That's why.

413
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,747
I've decided
not to focus on it.

414
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,750
Instead I'll focus
on getting stronger.

415
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,787
All right! That's the
positivity I like to hear!

416
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,507
[RIAS] Hi, Issei.
Looking for something?

417
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,500
Hey Rias,

418
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,499
I was going to take a bath,
then got separated from Kiba,

419
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:46,568
and now I'm lost.

420
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:48,570
I was just heading
that way myself.

421
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,572
Why don't you tag along with me?

422
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:53,474
So, hey, uh, do you mind
if I ask you somethin'?

423
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:56,510
How did you figure
out right off the bat

424
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,412
that I was gonna
chase after Koneko?

425
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:03,084
Besides, it is my job to always
keep an eye on my servants.

426
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:05,353
Has anybody ever told
you you're the best?

427
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:07,556
Through thick and thin, you're
always looking out for us;

428
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:09,090
trying to keep us
safe and happy.

429
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:15,897
[AZAZEL] Looks like the
storm has passed, for now.

430
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:20,134
to teleport Loki and Fenrir to
a rather far away destination,

431
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:22,403
but it is a temporary solution.

432
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:25,006
[MICHAEL] Yes, I feel certain
he will press the issue again.

433
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:27,475
This was only the beginning.

434
00:22:28,677 --> 00:22:30,579
[ODIN] As leader of
the Norse pantheon,

435
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,947
I take full responsibility.

436
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,177
would get out of hand
traveling with Odin.

437
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:11,512
I'm the Valkyrie
Rossweisse.

438
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:12,947
[SAJI]
You seein' what I'm seein'?

439
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:15,817
That's one Valkyrie
I'd like to ride!

440
00:24:15,817 --> 00:24:19,087
Business suit, suit of armor,
or birthday suit, I am down!
