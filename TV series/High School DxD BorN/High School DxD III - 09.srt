I remember that.

Issei's using the power
that he stole from Vali!

I don't know.

[VALI] I had a feeling it
was the Juggernaut Drive.

[RIAS]
Vali, why are you here?

203
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:19,740
I sensed a change
in Issei's power.

204
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,142
I wanted to see what it was.

00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,745
Is that him down there?

206
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,181
It looks like your servant had
an incomplete transformation.

207
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,917
Do you know if there's any
way to change him back?

208
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,118
[VALI]
In an incomplete state,

209
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,921
there is a chance it
will happen naturally.

210
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,491
But if not, he'll use up
his life force until he dies.

211
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,161
[ARTHUR] Either way,
you should be worried;

212
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,496
his life is most
certainly in danger.

213
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,534
[ARTHUR] Oh yes, we happened
to cross paths with her

214
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,070
while we were moving through
the Dimensional Gap.

215
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,772
[BIKOU]
That is one lucky girl.

216
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,340
She would have been exposed
to the void, if not for us.

217
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,342
A body cannot withstand
that kind of pressure

218
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:00,246
and will usually dissipate
into the nothingness.

219
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,316
[RIAS] If we tell him
that Asia is safe,

220
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:06,186
Issei should be able to
regain control over himself.

221
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:10,290
Merely approaching him will kill
you. I won't stop you, though.

222
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,992
I will go with you!

I won't let you die.

Hm?

00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:27,173
I'm begging you to do whatever
you can to save Rias and Issei.

Can you with the power of
the White Dragon Emperor?

strong enough?

contain his power a bit.

[ALBION] You have to touch the
opponent to use Divine Dividing.

I don't recommend
that right now.

Yeah. An eye for an eye.

I envy the infinite
and long for the dream.

I shall become the White Dragon

that masters the
path of domination.

315
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,740
Issei. My Issei is back!

316
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,411
What's that?

317
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,647
Something that
was inside of him.

318
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:46,226
[grunts]

319
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:48,161
‐‐Welcome back!
‐‐Welcome back!

320
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:48,829
Nice moves!

321
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:49,663
Issei!

322
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:50,597
How do you feel?

323
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,533
[ISSEI]
Okay. I think.

324
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,436
You guys, um, hey.

325
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,905
[ISSEI gasps]
Asia!

326
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,174
[KIBA]
Vali and his allies rescued her.

327
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,177
It was a chance
thing, that's all.

328
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,580
[ISSEI]
Asia! Asia!

329
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,584
Issei?

330
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,685
What happened?

331
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:12,819
Asia! You're o‐‐

332
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,688
‐‐Asia! Oh, Asia!
‐‐Um.

333
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:17,658
‐‐I thought you were gone.
‐‐Xenovia, I'm okay. I swear it.

334
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,860
‐‐You're alive!
‐‐Xenovia, I'm okay. I swear it.

335
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,829
Oh, Asia. We'll be
friends forever, won't we?

336
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,498
‐‐Like forever forever, though?
‐‐Of course.

337
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,770
Then you can't leave me
like that ever again, okay?

338
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,407
I won't. I'll always
be here for you.

339
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,476
[XENOVIA sobbing]
Asia!

340
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:37,544
I know.

341
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,214
[VALI]
Issei Hyodo. Take a look.

342
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,183
[ISSEI]
Huh?

343
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,418
That is what I wanted to see.

344
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,459
[RIAS]
It can't be.

345
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,328
[VALI]
Dragon of Dragon.

346
00:19:55,328 --> 00:20:00,400
He is often called DD,
the true Red Dragon God Emperor.

347
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,401
Great Red.

348
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,403
[ISSEI]
Great Red.

349
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:07,207
He chooses to live in
the Dimensional Gap,

350
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,310
and flies around for
all eternity in there.

351
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,679
Orphis wants that, as well.

352
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,881
My goal is to defeat him.

353
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,983
[ISSEI]
For real?

354
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,554
To become the true
White Dragon Emperor.

355
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:23,289
The White Dragon God Emperor.

356
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,359
Someday, I'll take
down the Great Red.

357
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,998
[ORPHIS] Great Red.
It's been a while.

358
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,667
[ISSEI gasps]
Who is that?

359
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,902
I didn't see her until just now!

360
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:40,406
The dragon god of infinity,
Ouroboros Dragon.

361
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,675
Wait, what did you say?

362
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,476
No, the bad dragon is her?

363
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:46,580
So, that's the leader
of the Chaos Brigade?

364
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,984
[ORPHIS] One day. One day soon
I am going to obtain my silence.

365
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,955
[VALI]
Tell me something, Issei.

366
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:57,791
[VALI]
Do you want to defeat me?

367
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,495
I still don't want you dividing
Rias's or Akeno's boobs in half.

368
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:04,698
Actually, I don't want you
dividing anyone's boobs.

369
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,266
[laughs]

370
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,869
You are such a
bizarre little man.

371
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,638
Get strong, Issei.
Don't you let me down.

372
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:17,310
We should probably head back.
Come on, let's go home, now.

373
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,379
Yeah! Let's roll!

374
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:22,583
[KUROKA yawns]

375
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:28,288
[KUROKA] Welcome back.
Did you find Great Red?

376
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,624
Only for a moment,
but we did, yes.

377
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:31,992
[KUROKA]
That's all?

378
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,528
[ARTHUR] Well, a few other
things happened, too.

379
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:35,596
[KUROKA gasps]

380
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:42,636
Cattleya, Creuserey, and Shalba.

381
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,572
The honorable blood of the of
the previous great devil kings

382
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:49,976
ran through them. They should
have lived honorably as well.

383
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,979
[BIKOU] Why did you choose to
save the Red Dragon Emperor?

384
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,981
That's rather unlike you.

385
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,418
It was only a whim.
Nothing more than a whim.

386
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:04,958
[VALI] And perhaps, it isn't
actually over yet.

387
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,794
Remember this, Issei Hyodo.

388
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,963
Look, um, I'm such an asshole.

389
00:22:09,963 --> 00:22:12,866
I didn't mean to make things
difficult for you again.

390
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:13,934
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,871
You are the absolute best.

392
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:21,041
Yeah! You are the absolute
best servant that I have!

393
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,577
Score! And you have
the absolute best‐‐

394
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:24,377
[RIAS]
Issei?

395
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:25,445
[ALL gasp]

396
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,113
Issei!

397
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:30,517
[VALI] Remember that what
you consider to be peace,

398
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:32,853
can often be painful for others.

399
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,788
[RIAS]
Issei!

400
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,481
To go see Vali. Now.

401
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,051
[LOKI] The twilight of the
gods is fast approaching.

402
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:13,554
Oh, yay, he finally
came to pick me up!

403
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:15,689
[AZAZEL] You still
haven't done it yet, right?

404
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:16,923
I know what's going on.

405
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,892
Even if it means you
have to lie to yourself,

406
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,761
you always try
so hard, don't you?
