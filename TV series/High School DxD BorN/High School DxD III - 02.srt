00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,303
[ISSEI]
Holy balls!

2
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,174
Wow, this place is enormous.

3
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,043
This where your family lives?

4
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,077
[door opening]

5
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,346
Welcome home, My Lady.

6
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,515
We have been
awaiting your return.

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,383
You may follow me inside.

8
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:29,816
[ASIA]
Issei, I'm really nervous!

9
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,886
I wasn't expecting this
to be such a big deal.

10
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,756
[MILLICAS] Rias! Rias!
You're finally home!

11
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,390
I've missed you, Millicas!

12
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,360
My, you've gotten big
since the last time I saw you.

13
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,529
Who's this half‐pint?
Your brother?

14
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,899
Millicas is the son
of my older brother Zechs.

15
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,234
So that would
make him your nephew.

16
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,936
Now be a good boy
and say hello.

17
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,471
[MILLICAS]
Okay!

18
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,207
[MILLICAS]
My name is Millicas Gremory.

19
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,609
It's a pleasure to meet you.

20
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,578
Hehe! So cute!

21
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:58,812
Devilish looks
and good manners.

22
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,747
Talk about a prince charming!

23
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,349
Wait... If this squirt
is Sir Zechs's kid,

24
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,686
just who in the hell
did he knock up?

25
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,587
[GRAYFIA]
Excuse me.

26
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,354
Please, won't you come in?

27
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,593
Rias and her friends
are finally here!

28
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,662
[VENERANA] My, my!
Such poor behavior!

29
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,330
[ISSEI thinking]
This chick is bangin' hot!

30
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,333
I want one of
those for my harem.

31
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,234
Issei.

32
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,505
Finding a carpet that matched
the drapes was a pain,

33
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,773
please try to not drool on it
while staring at my mother.

34
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,775
Your mom?

35
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,410
It's a pleasure
to see you again.

36
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,313
It's been far too long,
Lady Venerana.

37
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,350
You sound so different, Akeno.

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm so delighted to
meet all your new friends!

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,623
I am Rias's mom,
Venerana Gremory.

40
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,257
[ISSEI thinking]
Figures she's a milf.

41
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,326
I mean, we're in hell,
why wouldn't she be hot?

42
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:49,596
[VENERANA] Excuse me, darling,
but are you Issei Hyodo?

43
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,396
[ISSEI]
Yes, ma'am!

44
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,398
How do you know my name?

45
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,534
[VENERANA]
I take it upon myself

46
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:55,335
to look into
my daughter's suitors.

47
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,003
A mother worries, you know.

48
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,707
And if Rias Gremory's virginity
is going to anyone, it's me!

49
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,476
Oh crap!

50
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:03,220
You know to be honest,
I don't think I made the best

51
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,545
first impression
with your husband,

52
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,647
or really anyone
else I've ever met.

53
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:09,015
[chuckles]
You're perfectly fine, dear.

54
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,652
Besides, my husband
didn't do too well, himself.

55
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:13,520
He should have picked
the boy Rias liked

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,788
as her fiancé to begin with.

57
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,723
Mother, stop!

58
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,392
[VENERANA] I believe it's
time we all sat down for dinner.

59
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,695
Rias, dear, would you
show everyone the way?

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,898
Okay.

61
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,502
[LORD GREMORY]
Welcome everyone.

62
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:31,772
please think of this as
your home away from home.

63
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,739
[ISSEI thinking]
Man, I'm starving,

64
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:37,477
I don't want to embarrass Rias
with horrible table manners.

65
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:49,756
Eh‐heh... Hm?
What's wrong with you?

66
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,326
in such a big room is
really freaking me out.

67
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,929
I can't even taste what I'm
putting in my mouth right now!

68
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,401
[ISSEI thinking]
Koneko?

69
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,803
[LORD GREMORY] I have been
meaning to ask you, Issei.

70
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,937
Uh, yes?

71
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:06,372
Tell me, how are
your parents doing?

72
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,709
They said thanks
for the new house.

73
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,010
I think they're
trying to break in

74
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,845
all the new rooms
while I'm here.

75
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,346
I'm happy they are enjoying it.

76
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,516
However, the castle
I proposed originally

77
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,750
would have been much nicer.

78
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,751
Wait, a castle?

79
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,419
Father, I explained this.

80
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,454
You cannot force
our culture onto others.

81
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,758
but they really could
have used those fifty maids.

82
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,826
Fifty?

83
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:32,398
would undoubtedly distract
Issei from his real priorities.

84
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,936
Thus, my daughter put
her foot down yet again. Haha!

85
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,506
Welp, guess I can put that
fantasy on the "no hope" list.

86
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:41,708
[LORD GREMORY]
And one more thing, Issei.

87
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,109
Uh, yes, sir?

88
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:48,014
From now on, I want you to
think of me as your own father.

89
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,916
Darling, your actions
are premature.

90
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,086
There is an order to these
things that must be followed.

91
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,989
[RIAS] Honestly, you two!
You're killing me!

92
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,894
[sighs]

93
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,569
I don't know
what was weirder,

94
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,771
the things Rias's parents
were saying to me,

95
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,840
or the way Koneko was
acting during dinner.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,810
And this bedroom.

97
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,546
It's so huge I'm starting
to feel inadequate.

98
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,947
[knocking]

99
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,550
[ISSEI]
Come in!

100
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,853
[ASIA] We aren't bothering
you, are we, Issei?

101
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,154
No, what's up?

102
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,994
[ASIA] I can't sleep in such
a large room all by myself!

103
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:37,731
Having this much luxury,
makes us quite uncomfortable.

104
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,965
You understand, right?

105
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,034
Look, I understand,
but church or not,

106
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,704
any normal person would
feel uncomfortable here.

107
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,139
You'd really rather sleep
with me than by yourselves?

108
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:48,509
Yeah, is there a problem?
The bed's huge;

109
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,443
we won't even touch each
other while we're sleeping.

110
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,013
Touching each other's not
the issue, it's being boxed in.

111
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:56,149
Crap! Gasper!
How's he handling this?

112
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,985
Oh, don't worry,
he's perfectly fine.

113
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,054
I checked on him
before we came here.

114
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,691
[GASPER giggles]
This place is awesome.

115
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,959
Well I guess if it's not broken,

116
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,994
there's not really a
reason to try to fix it.

117
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,730
Like our current
sleeping arrangement,

118
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,665
which you really
should get past already.

119
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,867
Training starts tomorrow,
so get some rest.

120
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,068
Good night!

121
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,203
Well, there's no way
I'm gonna get any sleep.

122
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,209
[ISSEI gasps]
Hey, Xenovia! Wake up!

123
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,579
Come on! I can't breathe!

124
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,113
This is not how
I imagined winding up

125
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,716
between your thighs
would be, Xenovia!

126
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,185
Please wake up!

127
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,496
an important guest today
and will not be in attendance.

128
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,700
[RIAS] It would seem
my brother is busy as usual.

129
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,636
Fortunately Governor‐General
Azazel filling in.

130
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,972
He has proven
more than capable.

131
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,208
Imagine that fallen angel acting
as a glorified babysitter.

132
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,043
And watching
young devils, at that.

133
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,245
It's comical, don't you think?

134
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,114
I bet the joke's on us.

135
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,095
[AZAZEL] All right.
Looks like everyone's here.

136
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,031
Let's cut to the chase: I've got
a twenty human world day regimen

137
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,535
We seriously have
to train for that long?

138
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:24,037
[AZAZEL] That's right, Issei,
and you get to go first.

139
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,512
Hey, who summoned the
old dragon from yesterday?

140
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,980
I did. He's your personal
trainer these next three weeks.

141
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,649
Huh?!

142
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,651
This will be my first
time training someone

143
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,219
who wields Ddraig.

144
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,523
Your primary concern here is to
pull out your Balance Breaker.

145
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,825
And... if you survive,
that's a bonus!

146
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,827
[ISSEI] Why is "not dying"
always a perk?

147
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:47,828
[ISSEI cries out]

148
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,863
Issei!

149
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,997
[ISSEI]
Do I have to?

150
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,833
Oh, get it together.

151
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,102
Right, I forgot. Our king
becomes a full‐blown dominatrix

152
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:00,040
If only she was doing the
"whipping" instead of this guy.

153
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,878
Aaah! This sucks!

154
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,818
[AZAZEL] Question, are you
the brains of your team,

155
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,053
or the brawn?

156
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,822
Answer: a good king
is both and neither

157
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,991
'cause they know when
to fight, and when to lead.

158
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,325
Realizing the
difference comes from

159
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,161
using your pieces
to their fullest.

160
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,635
[AKENO] Why are you here?

161
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:31,638
It's been quite a while, Akeno.

162
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:33,674
I'd rather you
not say my name.

163
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,308
[AZAZEL]
You are a fallen angel.

164
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,277
You have to come
to terms with that.

165
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,245
Once you claim dominance
over your heritage,

166
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,883
you will finally be able
to create true lightning.

167
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,185
You never answered my question.

168
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,788
I cannot refuse an order
from the Governor‐General.

169
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,190
He asked me to come train
my daughter, so here I am.

170
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,593
[AKENO] Do you know
why I wear these clothes?

171
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,228
[AKENO] It's my way
to show the world

172
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,231
I renounce everything
you represent.

173
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,601
Because you are
no father of mine.

174
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,807
[AZAZEL]
Hone your Balance Breaker.

175
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:10,276
Once you've whipped it out,
keep it up as long as you can.

176
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,823
[AZAZEL] I have
assigned you a teacher

177
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,125
to further your swordsmanship.

178
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,394
Hmph. Thank you
for agreeing to train me.

179
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,798
[XENOVIA]
Holy Sword Durandal!

180
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,376
is fickle in whom it
chooses as its wielder.

181
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,886
[AZAZEL] Taming it is
a sheer matter of will.

182
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,258
[AZAZEL]
I'd call you a gentle giant

183
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,193
if you weren't so
small and jittery.

184
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,329
Seriously, while you
may think you lack talent,

185
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,232
it's your timid nature
that's really holding you back.

186
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,400
Simple fix, though.

187
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,302
Go out where people can see you.

188
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,204
That is the first step.

189
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:14,007
[GASPER] I'd rather die
than take this first step.

190
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,046
[AZAZEL] If you wish
to release the power

191
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,882
you have sealed within...

192
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,989
[AZAZEL] ... stop playing cat‐
and‐mouse with your identity.

193
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,124
That's the only way
you'll get stronger.

194
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,029
[KONEKO]
Balls.

195
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,935
[AZAZEL] Here's the
thing about Twilight Healing.

196
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,304
It's completely dependent
on the user's ability.

197
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,306
If you're good enough,
you can release the aura

198
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,208
from your whole body
and heal your friends

199
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,910
even when they're far away.

200
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,214
[ASIA thinking]
I'm going to do my best...

201
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,949
For you, Issei!

202
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,757
[ISSEI pants]
That was close!

203
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,826
[TANNIN] It seems you were
able to avoid it this time.

204
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,027
[ISSEI]
Hey, don't sell me short!

205
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,829
Three days in,
you haven't burned me yet!

206
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,231
I'm starting to think you
don't live up to the hype!

207
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,465
I would hate to disappoint.

208
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,802
So, how about I crank up
the firepower for you?

209
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:30,751
[crashing; ISSEI screaming]

210
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,919
[TANNIN]
I'd say that's enough for today.

211
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,825
Thank you. You are
truly wise and powerful, sir.

212
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,331
[SAIRAORG] Getting bent
over's not the worst thing

213
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,500
when it comes to enduring
Tannin's training.

214
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,805
But I'd expect nothing less
of the Red Dragon Emperor.

215
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,840
Who are you? Wise guy.

216
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,043
[SAIRAORG] Just a spectator.
I came here to see

217
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,479
how much you've improved
since your battle with Riser.

218
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,015
I had hoped for better.

219
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,984
Ah, well. You're just a kid.

220
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,451
But here, Let me give
you a piece of advice.

221
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,559
[SAIRAORG] Being number
one takes some balls.

222
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,078
[ISSEI] Rias!
I've missed you so much!

223
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,048
while I was getting knocked
around by that dragon.

224
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,383
Each night, I longed
for your soft body pillows

225
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,921
as I lay my head
down on a long, hard log!

226
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,155
[RIAS]
Issei.

227
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,557
I'm very proud of you.

228
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,859
You've grown so strong
since you've been away.

229
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:48,394
Yeah, it's all well and good
that he's got more endurance.

230
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,297
Unfortunately, he never
manifested his Balance Breaker.

231
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah. I suck.

232
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,201
[AZAZEL] Don't worry, kid,
we'll find a good way

233
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,403
to ease your
performance anxiety.

234
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,506
Performance what now?

235
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,976
[AKENO]
Oh, you're all here.

236
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,444
[RIAS] Yes, everyone but Koneko.

237
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,213
[AKENO] She's getting
some much needed rest.

238
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,582
[ISSEI] I heard she fainted
during her training.

239
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:10,083
That's not like Koneko.

240
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,585
I wonder what could have
happened to her.

241
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:15,121
She added extra curriculum to
the training regimen I gave her.

242
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,290
The stress was more
than she could handle.

243
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,392
The poor thing.

244
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:22,162
I have to get ready
for tonight's reception.

245
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,297
I'll send someone for you later.

246
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,299
There are going to be a
lot of different clans there!

247
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:29,169
[ASIA] We're really invited
to a fancy reception?

248
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,137
[RIAS]
More like we're enlisted.

249
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:34,107
My brother has assigned us as
guards for VIP, because things

250
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,276
tend to get messy when high
ranking devils meet up.

251
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,044
That's politics for you.

252
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,013
Everyone will be watching us,

253
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:43,083
so we have to be on
our best behavior, guys.

254
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,451
[ISSEI]
Joy, other devil houses.

255
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,254
I bet even their servants
could kick the crap out of me.

256
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,192
Who cares?
I'm getting stronger by the day!

257
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:55,061
And next time I see that guy,
I'm gonna punch him in the dick!

258
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,665
This must be
Koneko's room.

259
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,200
[knocking]

260
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,137
Hey, you sleeping?

261
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:06,372
Don't say anything if you are.

262
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,977
[ISSEI thinking]
I shouldn't wake her.

263
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:13,179
I'm glad to see she's okay.

264
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,921
[RIAS] As the saying goes,
the cat's out of the bag.

265
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,222
[ISSEI]
Rias.

266
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:25,291
[RIAS] The reason she
pushes herself like that,

267
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,560
is because she's
fighting against

268
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,629
her own power and existence.

269
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,031
Wow, talk about melodramatic.

270
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:34,000
A long time ago, there
were two nekomata sisters.

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,268
Oh yeah, I've heard nekomata

272
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,103
are like cat spirits
or something.

273
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,673
[RIAS] The two were
orphaned and homeless,

274
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,241
but they had each other.

275
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,408
As long as they were together,

276
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,311
they had someone
they could depend on.

277
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,281
Eventually, both cats
were picked up by a devil.

278
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,251
In time, the elder sister
became their servant,

279
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:55,321
and finally had a
chance at a good life.

280
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,690
But by turning into a devil,

281
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,459
her hidden power
began to over flow.

282
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,496
[RIAS] Having lost control,
she killed her master,

283
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,331
and vanished without a trace.

284
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,034
[RIAS] She became
a dangerous stray

285
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,137
that decimated an
entire pursuit force.

286
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,575
Fearing that the younger sister
would follow in these footsteps,

287
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,543
the devil community
set out to dispose of her

288
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:19,112
before another
catastrophe could occur.

289
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,647
However, my brother intervened,

290
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,316
and was given
dominance over her.

291
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,451
Zechs then assigned her
to my service in hope

292
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,421
that I would fill poor
girl's life with happiness.

293
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,091
But first I had to
give her a name.

294
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,193
This feels like it's
gonna be a big reveal.

295
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,461
[KONEKO]
It's me, numbnuts.

296
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,598
[RIAS] Koneko.
You should be resting.

297
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:41,167
Sorry for worrying you.

298
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,204
No surprise from the most
powerful Nekoshou clan member.

299
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,106
But still, don't push it.

300
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,641
I don't care from
whom you're descended,

301
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,743
you have to take
better care of yourself.

302
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,656
[KIBA] I've never seen
this many Satan‐class devils.

303
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:04,625
At least, not in
one place, anyway.

304
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,426
It is pretty incredible.

305
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,629
Just be careful not to
offend anyone tonight.

306
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:10,196
Especially you, Issei.

307
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,798
[ISSEI] Why am
I getting singled out?

308
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,502
[ISSEI]
'Sup, Akeno?

309
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,738
Hi, Issei.
You having a good time?

310
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,041
I just realized that
I never asked you

311
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,243
what kind of personal
training you got to do.

312
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24,711
It wasn't anything special.

313
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,048
[ISSEI thinking] I guess when
you get to be as strong as her,

314
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,518
there's not anything that
really needs improving.

315
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:39,826
Same to you, Sona. Welcome.
How is your training camp going?

316
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,061
[SONA]
All right.

317
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,428
How's it hanging, Hyodo?

318
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,764
You getting on, or getting off?

319
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,165
Can't it be both?

320
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,700
So did training kick your ass?

321
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,703
No way, dude. You and I
may've had the same teacher,

322
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,104
but I took him to school!

323
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,106
There you are, Sona!

324
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,741
Oh, great, my sister's here.

325
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,843
[RIAS] It's been a
long time, Lady Serafall.

326
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,314
I see you brought the Red
Dragon and everyone else, too!

327
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,716
Uh, hey...

328
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,085
I know that Michael
should be arriving soon,

329
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,319
but what about the others?

330
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,789
I stuck Barkiel
on security duty,

331
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:11,525
and according to him,
Odin is not far out either.

332
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:13,527
[SIR ZECHS]
He's assigned to guarding Odin?

333
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,830
Some of the other Norse Gods
have a bug up their ass

334
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,765
about the alliance
he's made with you guys.

335
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,333
So I sent him an escort,

336
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,603
though he probably
wanted a prettier one.

337
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,539
Yes, it seems there are always
those who resist progress.

338
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,508
Yeah, but the problem
is that the Chaos Brigade

339
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:30,243
is recruiting those
same people as we speak.

340
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,346
[SONA] We're almost
to the waiting room now.

341
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,415
Let's hope we won't
be in there long.

342
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,850
A bunch of young,
hormonal devils

343
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,451
stuffed into one room together?

344
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,220
We'll be lucky
if we get out alive.

345
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,555
True, that.

346
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,257
[SEIGVAIRA]
If you've got a death wish,

347
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,126
I'm happy to fill it, Zephyrdor.

348
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,460
[ZEPHYRDOR]
"Filling" is my job.

349
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,663
Like I said before,
if you want a virginpurgin'.

350
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:50,864
I'd volunteer.

351
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:51,732
What's their deal?

352
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:54,801
[RIAS sighs]
Right on cue.

353
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,202
[SAIRAORG]
At least we've come to expect

354
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,438
this sort of thing
after all these years.

355
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,406
[RIAS]
Hello, Sairaorg.

356
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:02,609
I'll give a warmer
welcome later.

357
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,413
Don't dishonor the Agares family
by humoring him, Princess.

358
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,450
We all know he's the
Glasya‐Labolas problem‐child.

359
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,219
Shit talk like that
gets you a muff blunt.

360
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,421
I know it's strict,
but that's your only warning.

361
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,825
If you want to push it, I'd be
happy to show you the door.

362
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,364
Ha! I'm not afraid
of Bael trash!

363
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,336
Don't worry,
you're all right.

364
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,638
[ASIA]
Uh, thank you.

365
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,306
That was nuts!

366
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,709
A fine showing by the
next Bael family head.

367
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,945
No shock, though.
He is my cousin, after all.

368
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:39,813
[SAIRAORG]
Seriously.

369
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:42,683
That's why he knew
about the fight with Riser.

370
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:46,219
Sairaorg is also ranked
number one among young devils.

371
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,389
[RAVEL]
Um, hey. Red Dragon Emperor.

372
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:50,791
It's been a while.

373
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,593
Oh wow, the fried
chicken's little sister.

374
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,728
That's Ravel Phoenix
to you, mister!

375
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:57,463
This is why
I hate inferior devils.

376
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,232
Uh, how's your brother doing?

377
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,402
Ha. Not well, he's been
depressed since the fight.

378
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,304
But I guess, maybe
he shouldn't have acted

379
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,707
like he was hot stuff to
begin with, or whatever.

380
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,909
You know what they
say about pride and falls.

381
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,944
Heh heh. Geez, you're
awfully hard on him.

382
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,246
Especially for someone
serving as his bishop.

383
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,682
When he lost, I was
removed from serving my brother

384
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,883
and placed in my mom's house.

385
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,519
Since she never
enters into games,

386
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,887
I can do whatever I want
because I'm a free bishop now.

387
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,657
I didn't even know
that was an option.

388
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,760
Anyway, I would
like to offer you this

389
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,261
as a token of friendship.

390
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,463
Shouldn't you keep it
for your alone time?

391
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:34,300
That is normally a gift
for a high‐class devil.

392
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,402
You, boy who thinks he's
the Red Dragon Emperor,

393
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,771
are an inferior devil at best.

394
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,840
Therefore you should
gratefully accept the offer!

395
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,409
That's way too formal a thing
to call a schmuck like me.

396
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,245
So why don't you call
me Issei instead

397
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,713
considering that's
my actual name?

398
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,550
[coughs] Very well then,
I will give you the pleasure

399
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,284
of being called
Lord Issei from now on.

400
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:51,818
That sound good?

401
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,319
Still weird.

402
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,788
Now that that's
out of the way.

403
00:20:54,788 --> 00:20:56,757
Let me make you an
offer you can't refuse.

404
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:57,924
How about the next time we meet,

405
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,459
I give you a
mouthful of my teas?

406
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,727
Uh...

407
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,596
[RAVEL]
Uh! What I meant was...

408
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,430
Lately I've been
making my own cakes,

409
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,832
and they go great with tea.

410
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,368
[RAVEL] Maybe next
time you can try them.

411
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:12,639
I need to greet the other
guests, so I gotta go. Bye!

412
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,642
Wait, what? I thought
Xenovia was hard to read,

413
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,511
but that chick's way worse.

414

00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,018
[gasps] Koneko!

416
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,693
[ISSEI]
Aw, crap!

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,565
Okay, I know
she's going down on it.

418
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,300
Okay now what floor?

00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:44,404
I saw you freak out,
and I wanted to check on you.

420
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,039
Koneko bolted out of
the room all of a sudden,

421
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,541
so I was trying to follow her.

422
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,576
It seemed like she
was chasing something.

423
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:52,312
We can look for her together
and leave the others here.

I don't want to make a
scene if we don't have to.

Yes, thank you so much.

Okay. I know where Koneko
is, and there's no time to lose.

I'm sure I felt it.

been a hot minute.

00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:07,748
[ODIN]
Long time no see.

and we're not just
gonna hand her over.

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,787
[KUROKA] I'm glad you can
still feel our sisterly bond.

436
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,689
[ISSEI] In that case,
let me poke your titties.

You're the worst.

00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,058
I won't leave!

00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:20,861
I've found my place as
a part of Rias's family!
