1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,810
[LOKI] Well, well, well, what do
we have here? Lovely red hair.

2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,612
Judging by its hue and her age,

3
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,582
she must be the devil
king's little sister.

00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,521
[AKENO]
Don't do this! Rias!

5
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,625
Issei. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,595
I'll fix this.

7
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:07,768
[SONA] Rias. Do you think
this is what he'd want? Move!

Odin, you sly bastard,

10
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,519
sending these young pups
Thor's warhammer was a shrewd,

11
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,454
albeit risky
proposition. Fenrir!

12
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:31,525
I have a new chew toy
for you. It's over there.

00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,293
[roars]

00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,327
He broke loose!

15
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,361
Watch out!

16
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,869
[LOKI]
That sigil. What is this?

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,439
The magic chains of Gleipnir?
What's going on?

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,576
I might've had something
to do with that.

19
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,244
[KONEKO]
Kuroka.

20
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,146
Looks like you've
accepted your power.

21
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:56,349
What a relief your ears and tail
have finally made an appearance!

22
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,885
Maybe, but I will never
be like you, Kuroka.

23
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,421
I suppose we'll just
have to wait and see.

24
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,824
We are a violent species,
and peace isn't a big part

25
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,661
of our genetic makeup.
You'll see. One day.

26
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,530
[LOKI] I can't believe
a lowly cat devil

27
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,397
would dare betray Loki!

28
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,767
What now?

29
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,774
[ARTHUR] Salutations. My name
is Arthur, of the Vali team.

[KONEKO gasps]

31
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:26,613
We will be taking custody of
Fenrir from this point forward!

32
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,214
[LOKI]
And why would you do that?

33
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,716
[KUROKA]
Apparently, Vali has a hard on

34
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,619
for his fangs since
they can devour gods.

35
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,855
The Holy Royal Sword,
Collbrande.

36
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,791
Even a god as powerful as
you cannot scratch it.

37
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,561
[LOKI] Tell your master he
will regret this decision.

38
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,830
Suck it! The only one
regretting things here is you.

39
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,170
Fare thee well, everyone. Ta‐ta

40
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,404
Oh, and sis?

41
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:54,508
[KUROKA] I'm in a
bit of a rush today,

42
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,210
but I'll come back for
you again sometime.

43
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,914
Damn you, White Dragon!

44
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,550
You were after Fenrir
from the very beginning!

Oh great. You're alive now?

00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,756
[ISSEI]
Yeah, thanks to a parting gift

from a sweet little Phoenix!

49
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,959
Thought it was some
sorta gem or whatever,

50
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,595
and didn't bother opening it!

51
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:20,433
Right, got sidetracked! Hey,
jerk! Time to get hammered!

Not so fast, creep!

Damn you, Red Dragon!
Damn you, Odin!

When do I get to meet the great
creator of rockin' boobage?

[LOKI]
A plague on your houses!

May you suffer
greatly before death.

that somewhere before?

So, does that mean it's over?

74
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,706
Good work, Saji, really.

75
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:34,274
Thanks a lot.

Uh... Hey, you know,
it's no big deal!

I just did things like
in training, that's all.

78
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,915
All this smiling's startin'
to make me nervous.

was just one punch?

00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,473
[SAIRAORG] It was, but
seems like you already had

89
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,342
things under control
here anyway.

90
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,644
You must be pretty strong!

00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,813
Yeah! I guess.

00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,081
I'd like to fight in a

To find out who's number one!

We don't plan to lose that
fight.

Should be a lot of fun!

Agreed! Then, I look forward

97

to a balls‐out power battle
against you one day.

98
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,562
[ROSSWEISSE]
It's odd.

99
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,930
I wonder where they took Fenrir,

100
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,698
and what they plan
to use him for.

101
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,127
You and me both.

102
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,848
I've got no idea what Vali
needs with a giant wolf.

103
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,974
[ARTHUR] Such is the power of
the last fragment of Excalibur.

104
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,343
The sword of total control.

105
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,012
[VALI]
Sorry, Loki.

106
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,748
But when I saw
Fenrir, I thought,

107
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:48,882
"Hey, I wouldn't
mind having a dog."

108
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,023
You may think you've got
a handle on your new power,

109
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:01,628
but soon, that will
all change. Very soon.

110
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,135
[ODIN] It was fortunate we had
the Red Dragon Emperor there.

111
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,840
A tremendous amount of power is
needed to capably wield Mjolnir.

112
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,742
The kid saved me the trouble.

113
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,812
[MICHAEL] But Lord Loki was
an important god in your fold.

114
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,781
What if he has allies?

115
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,685
[ODIN] The times change,
and we must change with them.

116
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,853
[RIAS] Thank you once
again, Mom and Dad.

117
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,022
We're off. Bye, Millicas!

118
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,991
But you only just got here!

119
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,559
Do you have to leave already?

120
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,161
I'm sorry, Millicas,
but yes, we do.

121
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,664
Lady Rias is incredibly busy.

122
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,633
We can't be greedy and
keep her to ourselves.

123
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,035
Okay, guess you're right, Mom.

124
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:44,538
Whoa! That's his mom? No way!

125
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:45,672
Seriously?

126
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,674
So Grayfia is Sir Zechs's wife!

127
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,742
[ASIA]
Huh...?

[ISSEI]
Um, Koneko?]

130
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,185
[KUROKA]
We are a violent species,

131
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,856
and peace isn't a big part
of our genetic makeup.

132
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,026
She's wrong. I'm here,
and I've found peace.

133
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:10,864
[AKENO laughs] I would have
never expected Koneko

134
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,933
to get so friendly with Issei.

it would've been impossible
to imagine, but look!

Right? It's adorable!

So, I have a request.
Hear me out.

138
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,845
Maybe... Could I borrow
Issei for just one day?

00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,548
He's not a pair of shoes!
Be serious.

You plan on telling
him the truth.

00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,756
Yes. I think I'm ready to
come to terms with it now.

For the most part.

Once again, Issei
steps in to rescue

Yes, mine as well.

[AKENO] Mother, what can
I do? I want to be strong.

149
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,163
[XENOVIA] All that training made
me forget about the real foe.

150
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,533
It's bizarre! Maybe they
give us this much

151
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,102
homework as a punishment
for going on vacation.

Not yet. We aren't alone.

Suck my ass!
There's still so much to do!

Training camp is no excuse
for unfinished homework.

If it were, that would

Time to play a little catch‐up.

Mom and Dad're both on vacation.

161
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:48,629
I thought I'd be able to coast
by without any real effort!

162

[sighs] Besides, I've got
bigger things on my mind

than a buncha stupid math!

164

When I was training,
I tried to shut down

I could get stronger.

166
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,940
But spending all that
time sweating with young,

167
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,275

realize the truth.

I even had a fantasy

172
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,955
that I was talking to a giant

[ISSEI]
No. Sorry about that.

00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:01,201
I feel bad making you
help with my homework.

192
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,937
No problem at all. I was
in that class last year.

193
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:08,274
But now, in return,
I get to ask a favor.

There's something
I'd like to do.

[gasps] No, not at all.

00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,668
The way you're staring at me
makes me feel embarrassed.

You hate this outfit, don't you?

Actually, just the opposite.
It's really doin' it for me!

from my boyfriend‐for‐the‐day.

Which sounds kinda
nice, doesn't it?

Yeah, that sounds great!

00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:51,785
All right! Then let's
go have some fun!

[ISSEI] She's so cute
when she gets that excited.

00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,390
So then. Where to?

211
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,359
Well, what do people
do on a dates?

212

Hey! I gave her permission
to go on a date.

I thought they'd go to
get lunch or something!

But no walking arm in arm!

221

Gaspie, if you see
something happen,

make sure you stop it in time.

This mask won't make that easy.

Wow. Our friends
are crappy spies.

Don't look now, but I
think we're being followed.

00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,328
Then let's make a break for it!

After this little Loki debacle,
I've come to a realization.

00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:55,068
To withstand future attacks,
we must strengthen our forces.

263

A fact further compounded
by just how new our relationship

is with the gods
of this country.

And that's why we had
Barkiel escort him

He knows the region well and
has the best beard of us all.

Why weren't you there when we
actually needed you around?

You were the one who left mother

a Shinto shrine.

311
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:26,286
One day she found a fallen angel
who'd been injured in battle.

312
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:30,757
They fell in love, and
before long, I was born.

313
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:34,027
Because of the scandal, the
Himejima family disowned us,

314
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,562
and kicked us out on our own.

315
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:39,099
So we left to start a quiet life
together with my father,

316
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,267
the fallen angel.

317
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:46,239
Naturally, those days of peace
didn't last very long.

318
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,408
When my black wings
started coming in,

319
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:52,312
I had no idea people would hate
them as much as they did.

320
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:56,650
What kid thinks their neighbors
are going to try to murder her?

321
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,053
My mother tried desperately
to shield me from them.

322
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,191
She died protecting you?

323
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,661
[AKENO]
Mm. Life suddenly changed.

324
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:12,232
I spent my days running from
those who hunted me. Too long.

325
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:17,504
In the end, I was just a child.
And children have their limits.

326
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:20,674
When both my spirit and body
failed to go any further...

327
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:24,578
[RIAS] You can die alone,
or you can live for me.

328
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,651
[AKENO] Rias showed up
and saved my life.

329
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,654
So that's how you guys met.

330
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,189
I needed to tell you everything
about my history.

331
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:39,593
That way, I could finally try
and put it all behind me.

332
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:41,061
But I can't do it!

333
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,229
The jerk tossed us aside
to fend for ourselves!

334
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,466
There's no way I can call
that bastard 'father'.

335
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,803
Hold on, look.
He may be a bit uptight,

336
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,838
but he doesn't come
across as a bastard.

337
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,273
Maybe he couldn't make it.

338
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,808
I don't care what
could've happened.

339
00:17:54,808 --> 00:18:00,446
because he wasn't there when
we needed him! It's too late.

340
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:05,752
[AKENO] I don't know! I don't
know anything anymore!

341
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,354
What I said back at the hotel.

342
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,657
That's how I honestly feel.

343
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,392
Please.

344
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,459
I want you.

345
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,396
[ISSEI]
Oh man... I want to.

346
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:20,601
But no, this isn't what
Akeno needs right now.

347
00:18:20,601 --> 00:18:23,704
Touch me. Make me forget.

348
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,305
[gasps]

349
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,409
You're the only person I
trust enough to ask.

350
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,311
[gasps]

351
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:37,584
Wait. What's going on?
Are you seeing this?

352
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,554
[AKENO]
I was lonely.

353
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,855
[ISSEI, AKENO gasp]

354
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,327
[AKENO] I think your wings
are really neat, Daddy!

355
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:52,198
They're black, but also soft
and shiny, kinda like my hair!

356
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:55,368
[BARKIEL] You think so?
Thank you, Akeno.

357
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:59,606
[AKENO] Hey, Mama? Do you
think Daddy is proud of me?

358
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,374
[SHURI]
Yes, of course.

359
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:04,745
[AKENO] I'd like it better
if he was always here with us.

360
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:07,514
[SHURI] You can't do this.
She's just a little girl!

361
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,851
Please stop, her father and I
love her more than life itself!

362
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:12,485
[SPECIALIST A]
How unfortunate.

363
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,221
It seems your heart has been
tainted beyond recovery

364
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,624
by the darkness and evil
of the fallen angel.

365
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,926
I'm afraid it can't be helped.

366
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:22,863
Leave Mama alone!

367
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:26,867
No! Mama!

368
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,938
‐‐[BARKIEL] Akeno.
‐‐[AKENO] Don't touch me!

369
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:35,375
You should've been here
to protect me and Mama!

370
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,879
If you hadn't been gone, Mama
would still be alive right now.

371
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,614
Those people told me!

372
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,950
It's all 'cause my father
is a fallen angel!

373
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,753
They said all fallen
angels are bad people.

374
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,691
None of this is fair!
I hate stupid black wings!

375
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:57,097
I hate you! I hate everyone.
I hate everything.

376
00:19:57,097 --> 00:20:00,200
[AKENO] I knew at the time it
wasn't Barkiel's fault,

377
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,270
but I couldn't keep myself
from blaming him.

378
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,710
I'm pathetic, weak, and
that's why I'm always alone.

379
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,846
What I really wanted was
for my Dad to be around

380
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:15,782
more than he was. I wanted
him to pat me on the head,

381
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,719
and tell me everything
was gonna be all right.

382
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,787
I wanted to play
with him more.

383
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,422
I want...

384
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,926
I wanted just a little more
time in that life together.

385
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:28,529
I wasn't ready for it to end.

386
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:31,998
[ISSEI]
Akeno.

387
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,569
A dream?

388
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,504
Yeah, I guess so.

389
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,706
Doesn't really matter.
But thanks to you,

390
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:42,509
I think I can finally come
to terms with my past.

391
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,512
Come on.
I didn't do anything.

392
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:49,449
[ISSEI] That sensation just now.
I've felt it before.

393
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:51,017
During my training.

394
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:54,888
[AKENO] I'm so sorry, Issei.
I don't know what came over me.

395
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:56,990
Well, I need to go
make dinner now.

396
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,426
It isn't easy subbing in for
your mother, you know.

397
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:15,475
[ODIN] Yes. I was able to meet
with most of the local gods.

398
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:19,379
I also went to the titty
bar and made it rain!

399
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,382
So you admit why you really
came all the way out here.

400
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,418
Odin, sir. It's almost time.

401
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:27,888
Akeno?

402
00:21:32,826 --> 00:21:36,296
I thought you might want
to take a lunch box.

403
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,632
I'm in charge of cooking
this week, so...

404
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,967
I see. I'm grateful.

405
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,578
[ISSEI] Hell yeah!
I thought I smelled pot roast!

406
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:54,548
I haven't made this
dish in a long time.

407
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,517
You can have a taste
if you'd like one.

408
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:57,951
Cool. I would like!

409
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,920
Here. Say, "Ah."

410
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,723
Uh. Ahh.

411
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,963
Thank you. For everything.

412
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,101
[BARKIEL]
Look at that.

413
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,746
Tasty.

414
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,818
[BARKIEL]
Just like Shuri used to make.

415
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,682
Has anyone told you
about this, yet?

416
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:11,117
Girls our age are having
secret affairs with boys.

417
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,454
Yes. You're the reason
I'm here, Asia.

418
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,623
Of course. Issei's
always like that.

419
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:20,594
so I was worried something
had happened! But this?
