1
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,104
[AZAZEL] Mind if I ask
you a couple of questions?

2
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,175
I don't mean Issei.

3
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:45,411
I'm talking to you,
Welsh Dragon.

4
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,175
[SIR ZECHS] Still nothing?
That's unfortunate.

5
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,677
[AZAZEL]
Yeah, we haven't been able

6
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,211
to bring him out of his coma.

7
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,313
The kid's devil power
is replenishing,

8
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,516
and his body's
healing up all right.

9
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,585
It would seem that his
extent of his injuries

10
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,687
go deeper inside, though.

11
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,921
[SIR ZECHS]
Deeper inside?

12
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,359
[KIBA] He's never had such
an intense transformation.

13
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,495
Seems for now, our only
option is to wait it out.

14
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:47,668
Issei's suffering because
of me. I'm so sorry!

15
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,537
No one's blaming you.
This isn't your fault.

16
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,438
She's right, Asia.

17
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,208
Any blame goes to those
Chaos Brigade jerks!

18
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,944
[AZAZEL]
Hmm.

19
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,747
Huh. Hey Asia, I got a question.

20
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,282
[ASIA]
Uh‐huh?

21
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,250
[AZAZEL] You still haven't
done it yet, right?

22
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,788
I'm talking about what
you worked on in training.

23
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,556
[ASIA gasps]

24
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,926
[AZAZEL] Because of his
incomplete transformation,

25
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,562
it seems apparent that
the dragon inside of Issei

26
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,698
is malfunctioning.
The fact that his arm

27
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,568
is still in dragon form,
only serves to prove the point.

28
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,506
[RIAS] If that's the problem,
then how do we start fixing it?

29
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,840
[AZAZEL]
Asia's Sacred Gear

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,510
might present a solution
to our conundrum.

31
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,377
[RIAS]
Might is the operative word.

32
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,246
Will Asia be in any danger?

33
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,348
I honestly couldn't tell you.

34
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,883
No way!

35
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,820
It is a possibility,
but it's not inevitable.

36
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,491
[ASIA] I'll do it.
I at least have to try.

37
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,327
Are you sure Asia?

38
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,329
Issei promised he'd
always look out for me,

39
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,397
and he kept his word
by beating Diodora.

40
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,933
Now it's my turn
to look out for him,

41
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,868
and there's no way I'm
gonna just give up!

42
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,803
I owe him more than that.

43
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,944
[RIAS]
I have full faith in you.

44
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,953
Your training up to
this point has focused

45
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,655
on healing from a distance.

46
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:18,692
This time distance doesn't
matter, it's about depth.

47
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,926
[ASIA]
What do you mean?

48
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,530
[AZAZEL] Issei needs your
help healing the wound

49
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,931
deep in his heart.

50
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,843
Do you really think
it's a good idea

51
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,645
to leave Asia all
alone in there?

52
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:43,517
we have no way to determine how
powerful the force would be.

53
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:44,785
And as long as that's the case,

54
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,820
it's not safe to be
in the same area.

55
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,990
You're not gonna let her go
through with it, are you?

56
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,058
[RIAS] I'd be lying to
you if I said this

57
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:57,330
didn't scare me to death,
but it's my duty to trust Asia.

58
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,949
[ASIA]
My darling Issei.

59
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:18,051
I treasure you
above anyone else,

60
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,486
and you've always
been there for me.

61
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,925
[ASIA] Cheering me up
whenever I'm feeling down.

62
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,328
Put yourself in harm's way
to protect me from danger.

63
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,531
I'm so grateful for you.

64
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:33,567
And I thank God for this
opportunity he's given me.

65
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,901
I'm thankful for this chance

66
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,337
to pay you back
for all you've done.

67
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,811
[ASIA] So, please!
Please open your eyes!

68
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,880
Come back to me, Issei!

69
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,454
[ISSEI gasps]

70
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,558
[ISSEI]
Huh?

71
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,663
That's weird. Normally when
I wake up, Asia's not alone.

72
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,966
Hang on. What happened to
her shirt? Did I do that?

73
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,869
[gasps]
Is this a dream?

74
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,637
You're awake again!

75
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,641
Issei, I'm so sorry!

76
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,143
It's fine.

77
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,380
[ASIA] You're all right!
Thank goodness.

78
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,782
I was so worried.

79
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,920
[ISSEI] Wait, I was in a coma?
And you brought me out of it?

80
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,922
Thank you for saving my life.

81
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,423
[ASIA] I couldn't bear
the thought of my life

82
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:33,426
without you in it.
Now, come with me.

83
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,430
If you're feeling up to it.
Everyone's anxious to see you.

84
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,834
Of course. I feel like a
douche making everybody worry.

85
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,938
But first, Issei.

86
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,006
[ISSEI gasps]

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,521
I love you, Issei.
More than life itself.

88
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,824
I've never been so sure
of anything before.

89
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,191
[ISSEI]
Uh, uh, uh.

90
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,828
[AKENO giggling]
So passionate.

91
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:10,764
I feel bad walking in on
such a private moment.

92
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,501
Oh! Hey, guys!
Didn't notice you there.

93
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,504
It looks like Asia has won
today's battle for Issei.

94
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,506
Yes. It would seem that way.

95
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,674
[ISSEI laughs]

96
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,676
[ASIA giggles]

97
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm serious though! I'm super
grateful for what you did!

98
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,650
[ASIA] No, Issei. Really,
there's no need to thank me.

99
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,151
[ISSEI] Of course
I'm gonna thank you.

100
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,119
Are you all right, Rias?

101
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,490
Of course. I'm fine.
Okay, everyone!

102
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,959
Now that Issei
has gotten better,

103
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,994
it's time to
celebrate with a feast!

104
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,063
[ALL]
Your wish is our command!

105
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,532
[SIR ZECHS] Our recent encounter
with the Chaos Brigade has made

106
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:46,933
one thing abundantly clear.

107
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,003
The Old Satan Faction
has fallen into ruin.

108
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,005
Apparently, Vali never
thought of them as comrades

109
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,475
in the first place.
Just a means to an end.

110
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,010
Great Red.

111
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,581
[AZAZEL] Orphis intends to kick
him out of the Dimensional Gap.

112
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,883
Thus, Vali's interests
lined up with hers.

113
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,184
As it stands now,

114
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:07,087
the lines between the
worlds remain stable,

115
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,824
and have done so ever since
Great Red was confined there.

116
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,594
But, if somehow he
were to be freed,

117
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,029
then the world as we
know it could be in jeopardy.

118
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,098
No matter the cost,
we can't let that happen.

119
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,634
When Loki attempted
to destroy time and space.

120
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:23,169
Perhaps a tiny fissure between
the worlds was created.

121
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,605
And that was
enough of a window

122
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,607
through which Great
Red could appear.

123
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,042
At least, this is
what Ajuka believes.

124
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:32,979
Loki, huh? A real pain in
the ass from beginning to end.

125
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,818
[LOKI] That accursed
Ouroboros bitch,

126
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,787
with her unnecessary meddling.

127
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,556
However...

128
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,062
[SOLDIER]
Huh? What's this?

129
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,799
[EVIL SPIRIT screams]

130
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,001
[LOKI] Certain options
are still available.

131
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,738
The kind you'll feel in
the marrow of your bones.

132
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,540
Red Dragon fool.

133
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,776
You and your beloved
Ruin Princess will suffer.

134
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:09,249
[ISSEI groans] It's so good
to finally be back home again!

135
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:12,185
[ISSEI] It's weird to think
I was asleep for three days.

136
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,921
I feel kinda bad you guys
missed school because of me.

137
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:18,692
I told the school that we would
be spending a few days overseas

138
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,894
for a practice match, so our
absence has been excused.

139
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,629
I'll just let them
know our return flight

140
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,097
was delayed due to
weather or something.

141
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,932
[ISSEI] So, your solution
to the problem is to lie.

142
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,669
What kind of occult club
even has practice matches?

143
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,204
The entire excuse was
predicated on a lie.

144
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,239
There are other
problems besides that.

145
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,811
[ROSSWEISSE sobs] It's no fair!
How could Lord Odin be so cruel?

146
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,980
I stupidly thought he returned
to take me back home,

147
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,348
and instead he sends me
into battle! I did it,

148
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:45,852
no complaints. And when
it was all over and done with?

149
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,187
He's gone back to Valhalla

150
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,724
and left boring old
Rossweisse behind!

151
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,859
[IRINA] He probably had a
load of admin to wade through

152
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,195
after such a mega conflict!
I'm sure he'll come back

153
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,897
‐‐soon to pick you up!
‐‐You don't get it!

154
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:01,101
and now he's returned to Asgard

Then I'll be the ditzy valkyrie
who wasn't up to the task

156

They're gonna
demote me for sure!

158
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,310
I felt terrible when I saw
Odin leaving her behind

159

choice but to bring her home.

160
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,848
If she's always
acting like this,

how can you really blame
old what's‐his‐beard?

162

Cuz right now she's
totally Queen Buzzkill.

163
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,888
She'll be fine. And if
the Asgardians decide

164
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,724
not to take her back,
I have an idea.

165
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,158

able to help Issei get better.

00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,926
I guess. Is that it?

184
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,396
While you were unconscious,
I had a nice little chat.

185
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,132
Went through a few things with
your buddy living inside you.

186
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,768
Inside me? Y'mean Ddraig?

187
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,837
The same.

188
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,205
[DDRAIG]
What does the Governor‐General

189
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,107
of fallen angels want from me?

190
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,809
[AZAZEL] I needed to
ask you about the power

191
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,811
Issei released at
the end of the fight.

192
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:53,379
[DDRAIG] It was a skill that
until now had remained dormant.

193
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,783
A volatile technique
called Juggernaut Drive.

194
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,719
[AZAZEL] That maneuver
is expressly forbidden.

195
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,086
It's dangerous
to forcefully vent

196
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,122
the power sealed in
a sacred treasure.

197
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,356
[DDRAIG]
Yes, and when activated

198
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,491
it will temporarily give
the user enough power

199
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,762
to make the gods envious. But
the price is the user's death,

200
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,832
or a drastically reduced
lifespan, at the least.

201
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,167
Swear to me! Promise
that you won't tell Asia

202
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,070
any of that, no matter
what happens!

203
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,505
I'm wondering how
you were even able

204
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:22,809
without knowing it was in your
wheelhouse in the first place.

205
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,812
[DDRAIG]
My partner's despair and anger

206
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,380
surpassed their critical limits,

207
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,117
and Juggernaut Drive was on
the other side of the threshold.

208
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,119
[AZAZEL]
Hm?

209
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,455
[DDRAIG] Some outside force
was controlling Issei's

210
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,360
emotions at the time. Who or
what it was, I'm uncertain.

211
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,963
[ISSEI] Outside force?
What'd he mean?

212
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,098
[AZAZEL] So you don't know
what he was talking about?

213
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,768
[ISSEI]
No. Not a clue.

214
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,069
[AZAZEL]
That's what I thought.

215
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,838
[ISSEI]
Hmm. What now?

216
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,907
Try not to worry
about it too much.

217
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,110
[ROSSWEISSE] Rias was
kind enough to give me

218
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,946
a place to stay
sans rent, but I refuse

219
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,948
to lounge around
like a freeloader.

220
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,819
I can help keep the
place tidy as thanks.

221
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,988
What? This is from Valhalla?

222
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:11,224
Oh, yay! He finally
came to pick me up!

223
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,464
I wonder where Koneko is.
It's not like her to be late.

224
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,166

I wasn't expecting you.

230
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,918
Have you finished practicing
for the festival?

231
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,987
[ISSEI] Yup. I swung
by to pick up my bag.

232
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,224
Ah. I hadn't realized
it had gotten so late.

233
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,459
And what's keeping
you here after hours?

234
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,394
Nothing important.

235
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,231
[ISSEI] You seem like you're
worried about something.

[RIAS scoffs] What have
I got to worry about?

237
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:57,170
Don't know. That's why
I asked, but sometimes,

238
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,339
I think I see depression
masked by beauty.

239

Uh. I'm sorry about that.
I just made things weird.

240

No. If anything, I find your
concern to be quite touching.

hard, don't you?

00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,127
It's true. I saw.
He was an exact double.

310
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,462
His aura and scent were both

311
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,330
practically
identical to Issei's.

312
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,199
His scent?

313
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,801
[KONEKO] If the real
Issei wasn't standing

314
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,203
right in front of me when
I saw his doppelganger,

315
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,305
I wouldn't have even
noticed the difference.

316
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,507
How can you be so certain that

317
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,609
Loki was responsible
for the attack?

318
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,845
Because, the cocky little
prick took credit for it.

319
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,782
You're telling me you placed
a curse on Rias Gremory

320
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,850
and the Red Dragon Emperor?

321
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,621
[LOKI] I lost to the dragon boy
due to last minute interference.

322
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,857
Luckily for me, I'm the kind of
fellow who thinks on his feet.

323
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,559
And with my new plan in tow,

324
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,295
I thought it the right time for
the prodigal son to return.

325
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:19,299
You impudent brat. Did you
choose to attack children

326
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,535
because you're no match
for Sir Zechs or myself?

327
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,504
Come, brazen old fool, think.

328
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,171
I am a proud Norse god.

329
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,372
Why would I waste my energy

330
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,575
doling out vengeance
on a few young devils?

331
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,444
What are you planning,
you self‐righteous bastard?

332
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,581
[LOKI laughs]
It's already too late.

333
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:38,685
The twilight of the gods
is fast approaching.

334
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,854
But, the reason I placed a
curse on those two children

335
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,290
couldn't be simpler. The devil
king sent his own little sister

336
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,860
to fight his battle for him.
Then you placed Mjolnir,

337
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,763
along with your hopes, into the
hands of her oafish consort.

338
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:53,567
And you shall reap the harvest
of the poor choices you've sown!

339
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,635
Loki!

340
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:00,741
[AZAZEL]
When he had finished speaking,

341
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:03,510
he placed a magical
barrier over himself.

342
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,412
The act of a true coward!

343
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:09,449
Sometimes the psychological
approach can be more effective

344
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,619
than merely defeating
an enemy in combat.

345
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,689
I suffered with
it for a long time.

346
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,291
But, I still don't really
understand why Loki

347
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,793
would go through
all this trouble.

348
00:19:19,793 --> 00:19:23,196
He wants the twilight of
the gods. Ragnarok.

349
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,266
The ultimate end to
existence as we know it.

350
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:29,269
Excuse me, but where's Issei?

351
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,838
[AZAZEL] Rossweisse is
debriefing him upstairs.

352
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,474
[ISSEI]
A curse?

353
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:38,344
Apparently, he was able to
place a curse on you and Rias

354
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,214
before being taken into custody.

355
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,448
[ISSEI]
But, what does that mean?

356
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,417
Curses lay siege
to a person's heart,

357
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,452
gnawing away at
it piece by piece.

358
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,455
They cling to doubts lingering
in the depths of your soul.

359
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,257
Doubts you've forgotten about,
or worse,

360
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:54,260
doubts you never even realized
you had in the first place.

361
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,663
Loki used those buried
feelings against you.

362
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,465
[gasps]

363
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:02,703
Have you remembered something?

364
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,938
[ISSEI]
Yeah, one of my deepest fears.

365
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:06,272
[ROSSWEISSE gasps]

366
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,809
[ISSEI]
It's true. I'm scared.

367
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,879
Afraid of finding out what
the girls really feel about me.

368
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:17,350
It's not that I don't
believe them. It's just.

369
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,720
I've been burned before.

370
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,955
We're here for you, but if
you're not ready to talk,

371
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:22,923
there's no pressure.

372
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:24,658
Sorry. I can't.

373
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:27,293
No, I should be the
one to apologize.

374
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:29,530
But, I was following orders
to confirm the veracity

375
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,497
of Loki's words,
and they ring true.

376
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:34,668
But wait, you said Rias
was cursed as well.

377
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:37,571
How could someone
like her have any doubts?

378
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,972
You would have
to ask her directly

379
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,907
if you wished to find out.

380
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,910
Or, the doubt could be buried
so deep within Rias's psyche,

381
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,647
she doesn't even
realize it's there.

382
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,248
[ISSEI sighs]

383
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,487
[ISSEI] With the graceful
way she carries herself,

384
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:57,290
and eyes that pierce your soul.
She's the smartest,

385
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,626
most beautiful girl
in the entire school.

386
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,294
How could any doubt
live in the heart

387
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:03,530
of someone so
absolutely perfect?

388
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,465
I have to help her.

389
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,769
[AZAZEL] How're you
holding up, Sir Zechs?

390
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,037
[SIR ZECHS]
I am the devil king first,

391
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,839
and a concerned brother second.

392
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,543
I will conduct myself according
to my station in this matter.

393
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,579
[AZAZEL] Glad you're
keeping a clear head.

394
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,380
[SIR ZECHS] Per our last
message from Asgard,

395
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,382
it will be a rather long time
for them to break through

396
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,586
Loki's barrier; which is
a luxury we don't have.

397
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:27,387
[AZAZEL]
We just need to get him to talk.

398
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,656
Find out exactly where
Rias has been moved.

399
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,058
My sources say she's been
taken to the Dimensional Gap.

400
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,627
Dimensional Gap?

401
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,362
Isn't that where Asia
was sent by Diodora?

402
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,732
I have searched the kingdoms
of gods and devils alike.

403
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,067
It is the only
remaining possibility.

404
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,402
[XENOVIA]
So, if we can get there,

405
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,871
we should be able to
save Rias, right?

406
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:48,942
doesn't behave according to
our laws of time and space.

407
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,012
If Vali hadn't stumbled across
Asia at that precise moment

408
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:55,448
while traveling, we could
have lost her in there forever.

409
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,886
[AZAZEL] Simply put,
being thrust into the Gap

410
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,322
is more often than
not a death sentence.

411
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,792
Then, how are Vali and
his friends able to do it?

412
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,728
[AZAZEL] The Chaos Brigade
is a diverse assortment

413
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,730
with members from all factions.

414
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,600
They must be using a method
still unknown to our coalition.

415
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,738
It could be possible. We'd have
to lock existence on this plane.

416
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,340
We could use this world
as a beacon of sorts.

417
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:22,809
Koneko.

418
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:27,013
[ISSEI] We don't have a choice.
I need to contact your sister.

419
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,616
Do you need Kuroka
for some kind of plan?

420
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,421
To go see Vali. Now.

421
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,715
[VALI] The ones involved
with the red or white dragon

422
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,651
have never had a good life.

423
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:13,486
Don't you believe this
to be destiny as well?

424
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:16,456
Who cares! Destiny shmestiny.
I do what I want.

425
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,892
I'll just change it if it
doesn't work out for me.

426
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:20,827
Rias! Is that really you?
