1
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,237
Boobs!

2
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:37,771
Issei.

3
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:38,739
Ooh! Issei.

4
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,640
Hi, Issei.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,641
Hello, Issei.

6
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:44,244
[ISSEI blusters] It's like
a rack‐centric smorgasbord!

7
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,546
I don't know where to start!

8
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,282
[RIAS] Why don't you start
with something prime?

9
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,217
Touch and squeeze all you want.

10
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,485
Don't forget these!

11
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,820
Let me be your second course.

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,422
I can cater to all of your
depraved appetites!

13
00:00:56,422 --> 00:00:57,724
Please, go on.

14
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,060
I can do it if I close my eyes.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,395
But it feels so embarrassing!

16
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,365
Don't get carried away,
but you can touch them.

17
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:08,569
Then they're going to be
used to feed our babies!

18
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,704
Well okay, this is
my kind of dilemma!

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,339
[FEMALE VOICE] Uh, would
you please go out with me?

20
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,375
[ISSEI]
Of course. Why wouldn't I?

21
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,143
[ISSEI thinking]
Wait, whose voice was that?

22
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,478
[FEMALE VOICE]
You're so cruel.

23
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,348
Have you forgotten?
You and I dated once.

24
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,219
[ISSEI thinking]
What the crap? Yuma?

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,188
[YUMA]
Yuma. It means "dusk."

26
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,791
because that's when
I planned to kill you.

27
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,126
The perfect time for death.

28
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,228
Would you die for me, Issei?

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,329
[gasps]

30
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,506
[ISSEI sigshs]

31
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,174
That's weird. I haven't
thought of her in forever.

32
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,713
[giggles] Morning, you!

33
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,848
Uh... Hey, Akeno.

34
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,550
Hello, handsome.

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,118
[AKENO moans softly]

36
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,419
[AKENO]
Does my body feel nice?

37
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,687
Pressed up against yours?

38
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,856
[ISSEI] Uh‐huh.
As if you had to ask.

39
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,392
[AKENO]
Of course. I like it too.

40
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:09,329
I think we should get to
know each other even better.

41
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,164
[ISSEI thinking]
Know each other even better?

42
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,366
At this point, there's only
two ways to make that happen.

43
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,503
And I don't have an X‐ray
machine, so that can only mean.

44
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,805
[RIAS]
Akeno!

45
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,908
Care to explain how you
ended up in Issei's room?

46
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,443
[ISSEI]
Morning?

47
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,445
I'm just trying to
develop an intimate bond

48
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,881
with my cute little Issei here.

49
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,755
[RIAS]
"My Issei"?

50
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,891
And when exactly did you
become the master of his soul?

51
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:35,488
[AKENO] I'm not his master,
but I am his senior.

52
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,659
It's my duty as an upperclassman
to take care of him.

53
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:43,797
Clever girl. But alas,
you've exposed yourself.

54
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,566
Exposed...!

55
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,901
Just five more minutes, 'kay?

56
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,514
We've still got plenty of time
to stay here in bed, Asia.

57
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:53,362
Good.

58
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,599
Then I'm going to
snuggle up closer to you for

59
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,410
a little bit longer, if that's
not too much to ask, Issei.

60
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,444
Nighty night.

61
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,846
[sighs]

62
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,785
I'm getting tired of you trying
to put your greedy hands

63
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,287
on what is rightfully mine!

64
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,389
A taste here and there
doesn't hurt anyone.

65
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,692
Now stop being so stingy!

66
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,829
[RIAS] And we just finished
remodeling the house!

67
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:18,431
Your behavior is
unacceptable! Yah!

68
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,402
Nice try... Not!

69
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,871
[ISSEI] Come on girls.
Pump the brakes! Just Relax!

70
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,841
Wait, you remodeled? Huh?!

71
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,210
When the hell did this happen?!

72
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,405
Yeah. I'd say I was surprised.

73
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,876
to find a six‐story palace
with three basements.

74
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,012
I never even had a
clue that Rias's father

75
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,548
was some kind of big‐deal
construction magnate.

76
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,818
He transformed our home
into a Tony Montana wet dream,

77
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,854
[MOTHER] And I can't
believe we slept through

78
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,989
the entire
remodeling process, too.

79
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,925
Talk about convenient!

80
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,793
The kitchen is so big now,

81
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,429
with plenty of room
to move around.

82
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,633
It's spacious enough for a few
other activities, eh honey?

83
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,035
[MOTHER] Stop that,
you old letch you!

84
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,870
I'd be glad to help you out!

85
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,905
Somehow, devil power
fades in comparison

86
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,608
to my mom and dad's ability
to roll with the punches.

87
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,944
[ASIA]
We're off for school!

88
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:49,382
The remodeling has really put
some bounce in our steps!

89
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,751
[ISSEI thinking]
Not just your steps!

90
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,753
I'm still psyched that we
expanded to make room

91
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,556
for such a sexy
stable of babeage!

92
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,091
[gasps]

93
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,927
[thinking]
Why her? After so long?

94
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,929
Is something wrong?

95
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,698
Hehe! Everything's fine.

96
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:10,837
[ISSEI] Asia!
Asia, I want you to know

97
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,539
I'll do whatever it
takes to protect you,

98
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,940
no matter what it may cost me!

99
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,909
[ASIA]
Oh. Thank you, Issei.

100
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,911
That's very sweet.

101
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:20,013
[AKENO] My, my...
You're still feeling feisty

102
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,882
after everything we
shared this morning?

103
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,886
My mind was wandering,
thinking of some strange stuff.

104
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,154
[XENOVIA]
Strange? Like making babies?

105
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,692
In fact, nothing could be
further from the truth.

106
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,493
It's still too early
in the morning to put up

107
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,428
with this pervert's stupidity.

108
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,030
Wow. I'm standing right here.

109
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,099
Come on, we can all
keep making fun of Issei

110
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,403
Don't worry, you can still try
to manipulate Asia's feelings

111
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,938
on the walk to school, okay?

112
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,940
I'm trying to bend all of
your feelings to my will!

113
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,677
But for you, Big Red,
I would sacrifice my very life!

114
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:51,945
I know you would.

115
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,114
You've already
proven that to me.

116
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,685
[AKENO] Pick up the pace,
Shogun of Harlem.

117
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,486
Otherwise we'll be
late for school.

118
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,588
Yeah, Akeno's right.

119
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,189
Let's get going, Asia!

120
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,791
[ISSEI]
Wait up!

121
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,028
[RIAS thinking]
How strange.

122
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,996
I've never been
the jealous type.

123
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,032
But seeing him
hold her like that.

124
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:16,537
Suddenly, it feels like,
like he's so far away.

125
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,706
So dish. I bet you've got
lots of cool things planned out

126
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,643
I've never had such
a long break before,

127
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,778
so I'm feeling
kind of unprepared.

128
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,047
Me too. I also don't
know what I'll do.

129
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,749
OMG, I'm the same way.

130
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,951
But this is your first
summer off ever, right?

131
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,019
Last day of school,
you jive‐ass suckahs!

132
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,888
And you guys know what
that means:

133
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,089
Sexy summertime!

134
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:38,592
Babes in bikinis at
the beaches and pools!

135
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,528
My spy‐dork sense is
tingling with anticipation!

136
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:42,629
[KIRYUU]
So the perverted trio

137
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,497
is keeping their summer
schedule open?

138
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,133
And what's this
"perverted trio" junk?

139
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,237
We only need one creep with
glasses and Motohama's our dog!

140
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,607
Hmph! Don't lump me
in the same category

141
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,942
as that spectacled freak.
It insults me.

142
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,045
Motohama's glasses can
accurately measure the size

143
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,248
of a woman's bust in the time it
takes to finish this sentence!

144
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,687
Hehe. I'd say you're
packing a very respectable 36C.

145
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,054
Ha! Hate to break it to you,

146
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,524
but you're not the only
one with that technique.

147
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:13,594
You've got scouting
sight as well?

148
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,796
Now then, gentlemen,
what do we have here?

149
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:16,930
[ISSEI]
Stop it!

150
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,798
I see!

151
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,099
You see what?

152
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,567
[KIRYUU] Length is...

153
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,736
The width is..

154
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,538
At peak performance...

155
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,673
Her scouting level
is over nine thousand!

156
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,808
Oh snaps!

157
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,009
The gloves are off!

158
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,011
Now I'll gauge the
size of your areola!

159
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,213
Shut your yap
and do it, if you can!

160
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,014
[MATSUDA]
Stone cold.

161
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,149
Scout skill standoff!

162
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,985
[KIRYUU]
You're a very lucky girl, Asia!

163
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,788
Your boyfriend is
smuggling serious kielbasa!

164
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:42,746
Really?

165
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:43,882
[XENOVIA]
Kielbasa smuggling?

166
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:46,560
Sounds like an issue that should
be relegated to the authorities.

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,195
[KIRYUU]
I mean his big dick!

168
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,131
Stop trying to warp
their young minds!

169
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,568
While you calculate dongs,
I'm'a pick up a fly girlfriend!

170
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:56,770
And I'm definitely
gonna serve up your defeat!

171
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,873
[ISSEI]
Girlfriend, huh?

172
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,109
I had one, I guess,
but she ended up murdering me.

173
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,148
[ISSEI thinking] Why am I
thinking of such bad memories?

174
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,551
And why did I dream of her last
night?

175
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,186
You seem kinda out of
it today. Are you all right?

176
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,056
All good, thanks.
So, tell me Kiba...

177
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,559
[ISSEI] ... have you got
anything special planned

178
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,026
for over the break?

179
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,996
We do! I forgot this is
your first time with us Issei.

180
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,799
Well, what about you, Koneko?
What are you going to do?

181
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:29,814
[door opens]

182
00:09:29,814 --> 00:09:31,137
[RIAS] It looks
like everyone is here.

183
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,075
[ISSEI] Going home
to the underworld?

184
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,610
Well, naturally!

185
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,011
Summer's finally here.

186
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,213
This is a yearly tradition.

187
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,215
Is everything
all right, dear?

188
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,318
But when you said you were
going back home all of a sudden,

189
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,153
I was afraid that
meant leaving me behind

190
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,122
and never coming back again!

191
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,692
Hmm. Cloying
neediness is so hot.

192
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,159
Now stop worrying.

193
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,662
I plan to keep you around
for a few dozen millennia,

194
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,263
at the very least!

195
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,966
I would never leave you
behind. Understand?

196
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,835
Yeah. I got you.

197
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:05,071
We'll all head to the
underworld tomorrow morning.

198
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,307
And it's a long trip,
so bring a book or something.

199
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,876
[ASIA]
Wait, did you say all of us?

200
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,978
[RIAS] Masters and servants
must always be together.

201
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,148
Going to the underworld
while I'm still alive

202
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,885
but I wouldn't feel anything
if I were already dead!

203
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,887
So then, starting tomorrow
morning, we're gonna spend

204
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,257
our vacation in the same hell
I once tossed infidels into?

205
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:28,795
For a once‐believer
turned devil, that's irony.

206
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,997
I'll be going along as well.

207
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,767
[RIAS]
When did you get in here?

208
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,903
if you didn't notice
my presence until just now,

209
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,339
then you've still got a
lot of training left to do.

210
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,776
I'll tell Matsuda and Motohama
that the Occult Research Club

211
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,978
is heading out of town
to a secret training camp.

212
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:52,085
[ASIA] I never expected
to go to hell on a train.

213
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,287
[ISSEI] Last time, we went
courtesy of Grayfia's magic.

214
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,989
Then we came back on griffins.

215
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,357
It was pretty sweet.

216
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,293
[AKENO] Well this is a
proper trip, and all new devils

217
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:03,063
should enter the world through
the appropriate channels.

218
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,337
Hey, Koneko? Your lunch
is gonna get cold, y'know.

219
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,206
What is it?

220
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,742
Nothing. Nothing to worry about.

221
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,780
[ANNOUNCER] We will soon arrive
at the Sitri Domain terminal.

222
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,248
Sitri domain?

223
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,984
[chuckles]

224
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,852
[SAJI]
Yo! Hyodo!

225
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,089
[ISSEI] Saji!
Student Council Prez and VP!

226
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,157
[RIAS]
Good to see you, Sona.

227
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,894
to give us a ride
on the Gremory train,

228
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,462
I thought I'd see how
you were before we got off.

229
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,264
Fine, if not a bit anxious.

230
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,700
Perfectly understandable.

231
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,268
After all, this is no
ordinary trip home.

232
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,805
You're heading out to train in
the underworld too, right bro?

233
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:45,930
Huh?

234
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,830
[XENOVIA]
Up to now,

235
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,075
we've only been told we're
accompanying Rias on break.

236
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,077
Oh, well. I'm about to
go and work my butt off

237
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,412
so that the next
time we meet up,

238
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,081
I'll be a lot stronger
than you, got me Hyodo?

239
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,817
Saji. It's time to go.

240
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,719
All right. See ya!

241
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,087
Goodbye and good luck.

242
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,356
Goodbye. See you again soon.

243
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,831
since we dropped off
Sona and her entourage.

244
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:15,068
Goes to show you how
big the underworld really is!

245
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,838
[ANNOUNCER] We will soon arrive
at the Gremory domain terminal.

246
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,873
All right! It's about time!

247
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,808
[giggles] Just take a look.

248
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,343
[gasps]

249
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,412
[XENOVIA] Wait, do you
mean that all that land?

250
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,282
[AKENO] Yes. This all belongs
to the House of Gremory.

251
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,918
[ISSEI] Really?
It's freakin' huge!

252
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,353
[KIBA] If you were
to compare it to Japan,

253
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,388
they own roughly the
size of its main island.

254
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,323
[ISSEI]
Whoa! Ahh!

255
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,025
[screams]

256
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:40,794
[XENOVIA]
Why did we stop?

257
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,029
[ANNOUNCER] The emergency
brake has been activated.

258
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,532
How strange! I wonder why
someone stopped the train.

259
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:48,101
Who knows? Whatever
happened, I'm cool with it.

260
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,036
We could even do it again!

261
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,171
[GASPER]
Ow, my neck.

262
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,840
Did we get into an accident?

263
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,276
A few VIPs will be
gathering here soon.

264
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,245
Maybe the stop was
a security precaution.

265
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,247
What VIPs?

266
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,216
Looks like we might be
stuck here for a while.

267
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:06,887
I'm gonna go take a peek. Ciao!

268
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,856
[sighs] One of the
representatives of Asgard

269
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,558
will be joining us
for a conference.

270
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,259
[ISSEI]
What's an ass guard?

271
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,862
[KIBA] They're the forces
behind Norse mythology.

272
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,131
Asgard's the home
of the Viking gods.

273
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,000
Then there's Olympus
from Greek mythology,

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,168
and the legendary
Mount Meru in Asia.

275
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,571
It's more than just
Angels and Devils.

276
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,106
Don't have
to tell me twice.

277
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,108
Was that guy who escaped
with Vali one of 'em?

278
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,442
Son Goku or something?

279
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,547
this conference we're going
to is about the Chaos Brigade!

280
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,116
That's right.
Terrorist countermeasures.

281
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,484
Asgard is joining our alliance.

282
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,922
[thinking] Vali, I will
kick your ass next time.

283
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,189
Something's wrong.

284
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,365
[groans]

285
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,034
[ISSEI]
Where are we?

286
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,869
[KIBA]
Forced teleportation?

287
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,270
[ASIA]
Where is Rias?

288
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,872
[AKENO]
I don't see her.

289
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,440
[GASPER]
Azazel's missing too!

290
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,042
Be quiet!

291
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,347
[XENOVIA]
That's not good.

292
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:13,286
[roaring sound]

293
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,287
A dragon?

294
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,372
So I'm going to assume
this guy isn't friendly.

295
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,107
Duh! Ya think so?

296
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,210
Koneko, watch out!

297
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,015
[grunts]

298
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,651
[GASPER]
Koneko!

299
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,588
[roars]

300
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,223
You have to run!

301
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,534
[AKENO] Since Rias isn't here,
it is my duty to take the lead!

302
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,002
Kiba! Xenovia!

303
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,137
Do whatever you can
to distract the dragon.

304
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,373
Issei, focus on activating
your Sacred Gear!

305
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,375
Asia, protect Koneko!

306
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,212
I will give orders to
coordinate our response!

307
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,047
You got it, Akeno!

308
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,982
Let's rock some Boosted Gear!

309
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,351
[DDRAIG] Boost!

310
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,286
[ISSEI]
A little help here!

311
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,056
[AKENO] I love
dishing out punishment!

312
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,691
[XENOVIA]
Hey Scale‐y, over here!

313
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,699
It was able to
deflect Durandal?

314
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,268
[grunts]

315
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,038
Koneko,
please just stay still!

316
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:41,374
You got it! Sword Birth!

317
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,651
[DDRAIG]
Boost!

318
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:59,359
I'm still powerless! I haven't
generated enough energy

319
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,994
to take this thing down yet!

320
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,162
[DDRAIG]
Boost!

321
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,469
[AKENO thinking]
Why does it keep reacting

322
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,371
to Issei's Sacred Gear?

323
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:14,440
[GASPER]
I, I have to do something.

324
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,145
I've got to! After all...

325
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,615
...it's my
responsibility as a man!

326
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,718
Nicely done, Gaspar!

327
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,289
Uh. He's unfrozen, bro.

328
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,291
I'm sorry!
He's too scary!

329
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,559
I can't keep focused!

330
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,360
[DDRAIG]
Explosion!

331
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,495
[ISSEI]
Awesome!

332
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,264
Time to strike! Attack!

333
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:42,302
Dragon Shot!

334
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:47,440
You're kidding!

335
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,675
No way!

336
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,215
‐‐[ASIA] Leave him alone!
‐‐[GASPER] Watch out, Issei!

337
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,050
‐‐[XENOVIA] Hold on!
‐‐[KIBA] We're coming!

338
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,254
[AZAZEL]
Stop! That'll be enough.

339
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,226
You guys are here?
Dude. What the hell?

340
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,763
[ISSEI] This dragon is a devil?
That's awesome!

341
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,098
Thought I recognized you Ddraig!

342
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:15,335
[DDRAIG] Yes.
Good to see you again Tannin.

343
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:18,238
And you apparently
know each other?

344
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,642
[AZAZEL] Blaze Meteor Dragon.
A. K. A. Devil Dragon Tannin.

345
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,144
Vassal to the former
Dragon Emperor.

346
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,779
He allowed himself
to be turned into a devil,

347
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,814
for reasons I don't feel
like going into now.

348
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,382
[KIBA] A dragon
that's become a devil?

349
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,284
[ISSEI] Just how balls‐out
powerful can you get?

350
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,586
[AZAZEL] The big guy's
come down to help out

351
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,087
with your training, children.

352
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,690
Is it special training
with a full‐on montage?

353
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,825
[TANNIN] Hmm... I don't
know what that means.

354
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,461
But Sir Zechs
asked me to come help.

355
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:45,331
And from what I've seen, each
one of you needs a lot of work.

356
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,432
[AZAZEL]
Hmm...

357
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,569
I hope he didn't
hurt you too badly.

358
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,337
I never wanted
to play a trick on you.

359
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,107
I was against the
ambush ploy from the start.

360
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,309
But my big brother
can be rather insistent.

361
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,379
[AZAZEL] I can sum up why
your retinue isn't improving.

362
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,481
Besides a tendency
towards spoiling them,

363
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,750
you act with uncertainty.

364
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,118
What uncertainty?

365
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,687
I wanted to gauge
the kind of power

366
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,689
you could muster when surprised.

367
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:11,324
And trust me, I learned plenty.

368
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,226
This fight showed me what
kind of training regimen

369
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:16,763
Exactly the plan a fallen
angel would come up with.

370
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,566
I'll do whatever it takes
to make you kids stronger!

371
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,635
I am your teacher, after all.

372
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,469
Were you in on this too, Ddraig?

373
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,405
Why didn't you pipe up
if you knew him?

374
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,340
[DDRAIG] I have lived
for years beyond counting,

375
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,743
and learned that those who
spoil Charades are the worst.

376
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:30,844
[ISSEI]
Wait, Charades?

377
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:35,582
Tannin wasn't even using one
thousandth of his strength.

378
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:38,318
I can't very well take you
all home scraped up like that.

379
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,420
So it's time for
our obligatory bath!

380
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,456
[GASPER] No, really! It's fine!
I can just go in later!

381
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,326
We're both boys, so what're
you so embarrassed about?

382
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,729
[ISSEI]
Gaspar, you're a dude,

383
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:50,496
so you don't need
to cover up like that.

384
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,798
It's making me uncomfortable!

385
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,399
What seriously?

386
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,435
I never thought you'd
noticed me in that way.

387
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,170
[ISSEI]
Dude, not even!

388
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,840
[AKENO] Oh, Issei! You shouldn't
be sexually harassing

389
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,474
poor sweet Gaspar like that!

390
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,344
[ISSEI] Akeno? Whoa!
The girl's bath is up there?

391
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:06,346
[ISSEI thinking] That means
a heaving heaven of hot hooters

392
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,781
is just a few feet away!

393
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,883
This is better
than good, it's great!

394
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:12,519
Underworld hot springs
for the win!

395
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,420
Add a bottle or three of sake,

396
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,624
and this hot spring
would be paradise!

397
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,459
Say, I've been
meaning to ask you.

398
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,326
What's up?

399
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,896
Tell me, Rias' melons‐‐

400
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:25,165
have you got any
good squeezing in?

401
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,535
Yes sir! With this hand here,
my form was flawless.

402
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:32,506
So... you ever pushed
in a girl's nipple like so?

403
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:34,440
No, not yet, sadly.

404
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,745
[sighs] So you still haven't
poked her protrusions yet.

405
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,681
You can't just poke
lightly either, boy.

406
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,448
You gotta really
get it in there.

407
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,484
The feeling of your
finger being enveloped

408
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,487
by funbag flesh is unparalleled.

409
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:48,789
[ISSEI thinking]
It can't be real.

410
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,792
My finger buried in bosom?

411
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:55,529
Nipples aren't the bell of a
front door, you damn deceiver!

412
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,799
True, but in a way the two
are actually quite similar!

413
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,636
If you press them,
they cry out, "No!"

414
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,204
[gasps]

415
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:06,439
No!

416
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:10,777
[ISSEI] I had no idea.
I've always thought that boobs

417
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,614
were there to grope,
suck or to squeeze.

418
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:16,750
My world's brand new. Limitless.

419
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,620
Like the wool has
been pulled from my eyes.

420
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,623
And you're still just a kid,
the future's bright.

421
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,257
But never forget.

422
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,426
Jubblies have
infinite potential!

423
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,629
I've already learned so much!

424
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:30,931
And I swear to you,
I will continue my training!

425
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,333
I wanna poke a
pink piñata right now!

426
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,868
[AZAZEL]
Good! Never give up!

427
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:38,839
You let those bra balloons
know who's the boss!

428
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,607
[ISSEI]
Yes. I swear!

429
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:44,911
Once Issei gets passionate about
something, he doesn't give up!

430
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,280
Hey. Can I ask you something

431
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,949
about the fight we
were in earlier today?

432
00:20:48,949 --> 00:20:50,617
What's that?

433
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:54,555
It's Koneko. She was so
careless. That's not like her.

434
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,389
Yeah. That was weird.

435
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,725
But she hasn't been acting
like herself at all today.

436
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,694
So you noticed
it as well, huh?

437
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,863
[GASPER]
Should we say something?

438
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:06,032
No. She'll be back
to normal soon.

439
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,608
It seems like
some special training

440
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,910
is just what Xenovia
was looking for.

441
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:22,282
[AZAZEL] I can sum up why
your retinue isn't improving.

442
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,317
Besides a tendency
towards spoiling them,

443
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,986
you act with uncertainty.

444
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:26,987
[RIAS thinking]
I don't know what I could be

445
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:28,955
that uncertain about.

446
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,857
Wanna share
what's on your mind?

447
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:34,060
I do wanna apologize
for forcing you to step in

448
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,862
and take the lead today, though.

449
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,998
[AKENO] Don't worry.
It was my duty as your Queen.

450
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,333
[RIAS] I know that.
I also noticed that your plans

451
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,335
led to a combo
attack with Issei.

452
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:43,704
Should I be jealous?

453
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,906
[chuckles]
To tell you the truth,

454
00:21:45,906 --> 00:21:49,309
that was one of the few moves
I hadn't been scheming.

455
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,479
So you say,
and it's over, now.

456
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,748
I guess so.

457
00:21:57,584 --> 00:21:59,419
I think it's about
time to get out.

458
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,859
[BIKOU] Hey babe!
Sorry to keep you waiting.

459
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:07,628
[KUROKA] You're late, Bikou.

460
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:09,996
I've gotten so bored
from lounging around here.

461
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,799
when confirming
things with Vali.

462
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,736
That said, we should go see him.

463
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,872
He gets outright cantankerous
if he has to wait too long!

464
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:20,373
[KUROKA]
Well, Vali is one thing,

465
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,875
but I don't really
care about Loki.

466
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:24,044
Now, you shouldn't
say such things, Kuroka.

467
00:22:24,044 --> 00:22:25,912
Just think of this
as part of the job.

468
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,581
[KUROKA] There's only
one thing I care about,

469
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:31,652
and that's getting
my little sister back.

470
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:34,688
I know you'll wait
for me, Shirone.

471
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,849
[ISSEI] This is not how
I imagined winding up

472
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,784
between your thighs
would be, Xenovia!

473
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:13,053
[SAIRAORG] I know it's strict,
but that's your only warning.

474
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:16,122
[RAVEL] You, boy who thinks
he's the Red Dragon Emperor,

475
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,691
are an inferior devil at best.

476
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:19,560
Therefore you should
gratefully accept the offer!

477
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,827
[RIAS]
Oh, get it together!
