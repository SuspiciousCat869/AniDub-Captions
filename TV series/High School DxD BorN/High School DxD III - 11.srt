1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,470
[ISSEI]
I'll go see Vali. Now.

2
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,046
[SIR ZECHS sighs]

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:50,717
I understand how you feel Issei,
but that's impossible.

4
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,153
[ISSEI] Why, cause he's
in the Chaos Brigade?

5
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,589
You don't think I
already know that?

6
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,525
But, if it'll work,
then what are we waiting for?

7
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,495
[SIR ZECHS] Our very way of
life is under constant siege

8
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,831
by those terrorists
in the Chaos Brigade.

9
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,767
The underworld was
attacked again, yesterday.

10
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,268
[gasps]

11
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,203
The casualties from
this most recent assault

12
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,805
are still being tallied.

13
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,240
Families and friends from
every corner of the realm

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,577
are left grieving for
the departed tonight.

15
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,212
We can't associate
ourselves with such filth.

16
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,382
Collusion with the Chaos Brigade
to save the devil king's sister?

17
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,451
The people would
stand against me.

18
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,722
If the public heard about our
collaboration with Vali Lucifer,

19
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:31,825
in no time at all. Shalba
Beelzebub would find a way

20
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:35,195
to spin the civil
unrest to his advantage.

21
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:39,499
This decision could affect the
stability of the underworld.

22
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,835
[ISSEI] I don't mean to
sound disrespectful, sir.

23
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:46,540
But, you know your duty.
Please let me do mine.

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,610
I'll do whatever it
takes to rescue Rias.

25
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,745
Or, at least die trying.

26
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,114
Did you not hear me?

27
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,616
I respect your
position on the issue

28
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,785
because of the potential for
revolution and that stuff,

29
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,555
but Rias need me.
That's enough.

30
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,892
[AZAZEL]
Hold on, Issei.

31
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,495
Just think. Are you ready
to give up being a devil?

32
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,858
[IRINA]
Give up being a devil?

33
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,594
[AKENO] What exactly
are you telling us?

34
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,831
Try to keep up. The Devil King
can say you kids went rogue,

35
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,633
and remain blameless.

36
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,735
If you kids go rogue and
attempt to rescue Rias,

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,870
it's no longer Sir
Zechs's problem.

38
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,739
It's not that simple.

39
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,441
[AZAZEL] Should things go bust,
you can still cover your ass.

40
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:04,778
And if that's not good enough,
I can take care of the kids.

41
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,879
[ISSEI]
Like how?

42
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,914
[AZAZEL]
Hmph. If worse comes to worst,

43
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,517
I can see to it that they're
all made fallen angels.

44
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,590
What!?

45
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,287
Then, you can just scapegoat
any backlash on me,

46
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,356
the acting Governor‐General.

47
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,693
A false‐flag operation could
quell any potential discontent.

48
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,361
A drastic gamble.

49
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,996
This may sound odd
coming from an agent of

50
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,998
the Holy Church who
was turned into a devil.

51
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,033
Is something like
that even possible?

52
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,469
You're a fallen angel because
you were a regular angel

53
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,037
who fell from grace.
But a devil?

54
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,773
I don't know where
to start with that.

55
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,675
I hate long division.

56
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,745
The point is, we're just talking
worst case scenario here.

57
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,048
if you kids bring Rias
back safe and sound.

58
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,884
Yes.

59
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,652
If she's trapped in
the Dimensional Gap,

60
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,454
then we have a narrow
window of time to rescue her.

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,489
Your decision?

62
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,791
[ISSEI]
Please, Sir Zechs!

63
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:55,028
[ISSEI] I don't want to quit
being a devil, your lordliness.

64
00:04:56,396 --> 00:05:00,634
Look. I have to help her,
even if it means punishment.

65
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,538
I will accept it willingly
after I've saved Rias!

66
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,372
And then I'll take
it like a man.

67
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,043
Please, sir. I'm begging you.

68
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,650
He won't be alone. We owe Rias
too much to abandon her.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,852
We're fully prepared to
sacrifice anything we can

70
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,821
to bring her home safely.

71
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,656
Rias took me in when
I had no one else

72
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,526
and treated me like a little
sister. There's no way

73
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,461
I can sit back and do
nothing while she suffers.

74
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,431
Sir Zechs, I remember making a
promise the day you put me under

75
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,635
your sister's care. I intend
to make good on it.

76
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,638
I swore I'd protect her
with my life, if needed.

77
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,005
She gave me a forever home.

78
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,508
Rias Gremory gave
me a new lease on life,

79
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,777
taking me in when I thought
I'd lost everything.

80
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:46,547
We're all ready, sir.
Just give the word.

81
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,682
[SIR ZECHS gasps]

that can happen? Ragnarok?

You really think
she's gonna show up?

If I call for her, she'll come.
There's no doubt about it.

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,989
[KUROKA giggles]

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,859
[KUROKA] First you tell me to
piss off, then you call for me.

93
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,695
Is somebody a little indecisive?

94
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,496
Not quite.

95
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,864
I have a favor to ask.

96
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,501
[gasps]
What's a boy like you want?

97
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,802
I don't think it was a good idea

98
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,470
to let Issei and Koneko
go wait out there alone.

99
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,640
I'd rather avoid the
potential misunderstandings

100
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,909
that arriving in a large
group might convey to them.

101
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:51,512
We're keeping an eye out
for further developments.

102
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,913
And if anything arises...

103
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,517
We can jump straight there
in a moment's notice.

104
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,920
For now, we'll just have to
see how the negotiations go.

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,922
I'm sorry, were you
being serious?

106
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,058
Yeah. It's important that
I meet with Vali now.

107
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,594
Aww, it's adorable when
a little bitch like you

108
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,931
tries to be forceful. Okay,
I'll consider helping you out.

109
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,034
I'll agree, on one condition.

110
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,069
Shirone has to come
back with me.

111
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,972
[KUROKA]
How is that surprising to you?

112
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,707
I've tried to get
her back before.

113
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,609
Besides, what other
bargaining chip

114
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,778
are you bringing
to the negotiation table?

115
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,681
Right? They say one good
turn deserves another.

[KONEKO, ISSEI grunt]

117
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,053
Not a chance. I can't do that.

118
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,823
Koneko is my friend, and I
don't plan to give her up.

119
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,091
[KUROKA]
Oh? That's too bad.

120
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:41,061
So, uh. Is there a
second thing you want?

121
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:45,566
You were the one that asked
me for a favor, remember?

122
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,467
That's it.
The negotiations are over.

123
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,103
Can't believe you called me all
the way out here for nothing.

What's up, kid?

00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:04,985
I know that I'm asking for
a lot, but as things stand,

it's the only shot
I've got left! Take me!

I gotta meet up with Vali!

Guess someone grew a

This is starting to bore me.

So yeah, feel free to
jump in whenever, Vali.

You guys listened in the whole
time?

It's unsafe for a lady,

to be unescorted at night.

to say, Wiseguy?

you if it wasn't important.

along and found me,

314
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,809
I would've had to walk the
earth alone as a pariah.

315
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,379
Or even worse, I might've
died on the streets.

316
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:31,184
When I was dying in pain.
When I was consumed with hate,

317
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,821
you took me in;
saved me twice over.

318
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,322
You've got to wake up!

319
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:40,260
Please, try to remember!
Remember my voice!

320
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,296
[AKENO]
My face!

321
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,698
Come back!

322
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,438
[gasps]
Rias?

323
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,514
Issei.

324
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,084
I'm here!

325
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,788
[gasps]
Rias?

326
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:11,558
[gasps, screams]

327
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,426
[ISSEI grunts]

328
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,360
What's wrong?

329
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,432
[RIAS screams]

330
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,454
[gasps]

331
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,323
I'm guessing that trick's new.

332
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,758
It looks like a less
protective version

333
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,459
of Issei's balance breaker!

334
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,729
How can that be?

335
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,264
[KONEKO] Her armor.
It gives off the same aura

336
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,466
as Issei's did when
he went berserk.

337
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:57,771
[LOKI] I lost to the dragon boy
due to last minute interference.

338
00:18:57,771 --> 00:19:01,775
Luckily for me, I'm the kind of
fellow who thinks on his feet.

339
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,845
[AKENO]
Loki. Is this what he meant?

340
00:19:06,747 --> 00:19:08,348
[KIBA yells]

341
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,352
[ALL gasp]

342
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:17,758
Kiba! Xenovia! Rias!
Please, you've gotta stop!

343
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:21,828
[AKENO gasps] You have
to get a grip on yourself!

344
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,196
Rias!

345
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,197
[AKENO screams]

346
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,199
[KONEKO]
Asia, get down!

347
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,834
I've gotcha!

348
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,737
Akeno! Are you gonna be okay?

349
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,506
Yes. Issei.

350
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,308
Please save Rias from herself.

351
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,212
I've been thinking of what
Arthur said. About how the

352
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,182
Dimensional Gap is greatly
affected by our hearts.

353
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,750
If that's true, then
you are the only one

354
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,451
who can bring my friend back.

355
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,687
Do you mean it?

356
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,957
But, How am I
supposed to save her?

357
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,193
You'll have to beat
her in combat.

358
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,761
[gasps]
No way!

359
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,200
That's impossible! I don't
wanna risk hurting her.

360
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,536
You're asking too
much of me, all right?

361
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:06,507
There's no way! And I'm supposed
to live with myself after that?

362
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:10,511
I understand how painful
this must be for you, I swear!

363
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:15,481
With that said. She needs
you now more than ever.

364
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,851
The only thing she wants
is for you to rescue her.

365
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:18,919
[gasps]

366
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,890
But, that can't be okay.

367
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:30,764
[ISSEI] No. It just feels wrong.
I would never fight Rias.

368
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:31,998
Don't you get it?

369
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,236
[ASIA] Don't think of
it like that, Issei.

370
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,938
[ISSEI]
Asia.

371
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:39,573
[ASIA]
It's like this.

372
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:41,508
You're fighting to free her!

373
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:45,946
All right.

374
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,806
Let's get it on.

375
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:15,275
Big Red.

376
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,545
[ISSEI yells]

377
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,516
[DDRAIG] Welsh Dragon
Balance Breaker!

378
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:24,585
[ISSEI]
Geronimo!

379
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,723
[ALL grunt]

380
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,324
Why's everything getting dark?

381
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,759
The field's down!

382
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,561
It's from the power
of their attacks!

383
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:37,297
Looks like they've disrupted
the stability of the rift!

384
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,364
[ASIA gasps]

385
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,741
[ASIA gasps, screams]

386
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,309
[XENOVIA]
Asia!

387
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,577
[ASIA screams]

388
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:51,812
[XENOVIA]
Asia!

389
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,750
[ASIA]
I believe in you.

390
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,986
You'll definitely
come back, won't you?

391
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,588
Both of you.

392
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,024
[AKENO]
Rias.

393
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:09,062
[LOKI laughs]
It's already too late.

394
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,898
The twilight of the
gods is fast approaching.

395
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,635
No! It's not over!

396
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,837
[ISSEI] Because I
need her in my life.

397
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:19,439
Because she's so
important to me.

398
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:35,527
[ISSEI]
I will fight! I promise!

399
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,048
[ISSEI] If I don't
put a stop to this,

400
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:10,817
then Loki gets
exactly what he wants.

401
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:13,720
[XENOVIA] You have to stay
strong for her, Issei.

402
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,055
[ASIA]
I believe in you both.

403
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:18,592
Fight with all your heart.

404
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,827
[AKENO]
Come back to us.
