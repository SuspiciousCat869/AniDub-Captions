1
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,481
This seal won't
last much longer.

2
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,283
Sure won't.

3
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,880
[AZAZEL] Odin's gonna head back
up north to retrieve Mjolnir.

4
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,315
Says we'll need it
in the coming fight.

5
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,519
And while it's great that Ajuka
teleported Loki out of our hair,

6
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,354
he'll only be restrained
for about a day,

7
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,791
and you can bet he's gonna be
pissed when he gets back here.

8
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,893
One day? That's it?

9
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,862
[AZAZEL]
Yep, and when that happens,

10
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,397
we're not gonna have any choice
but to fight him head on.

11
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,433
Because if the Devil
King class members

12
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,202
elect to attack Loki outright,

13
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,904
it could result in another
large‐scale war,

14
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,639
which wouldn't be
good for anybody.

15
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,474
That's far too risky.

16
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,610
[AZAZEL] Plus, it would
play into Loki's hand.

17
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,512
He wants to bring
about Ragnarok,

18
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,247
and the Chaos Brigade
wants pandemonium.

19
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,884
A war like that would further
all of their goals.

20
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,319
It'd be the beginning
of the end, kiddos.

21
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,321
Nothing would survive.

22
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,758
If Loki gets out before
Mjolnir arrives, we're screwed.

23
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,349
Seems that way.

24
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:16,653
Yeah, I think we need
to go talk to my brother.

25
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:20,767
You want to act as a
diversion for Loki?

26
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,336
[AJUKA] I hope you understand
I can only teleport about

27
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,572
ten people at once.
That's not much.

28
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,676
I'll only be able to send
one or two more later.

29
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,678
You won't have reinforcements.

30
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,348
Yes, I'm well aware of
the danger involved.

31
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,852
That's really sweet. But, don't
think you're the only volunteer.

32
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,754
[door opens]

33
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,656
[RIAS gasps]

34
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,626
[LEVIATHAN]
Right, Sona?

35
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:48,595
[SONA] The three of
us would like to offer

36
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,598
our services in this as well.
If that's not a problem.

37
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:55,401
I tried to talk her out of it,
but she wouldn't listen.

38
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,003
Then again, this
whole mess with Loki

39
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,905
is kind of our fault
to begin with.

40
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,474
So our little sisters being
assigned clean up duty

41
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,243
shouldn't get much objection.

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,311
Won't look like we're playing
favorites, either.

43
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,614
It's not like there's
time to object anyway.

44
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,651
That said, there's two people
we've already decided on.

45
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:15,856
[MICHAEL]
Yes. The first one...

46
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,959
[MICHAEL] I have no doubt
she will be an asset

47
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,561
to you in this endeavor.

48
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,295
As you wish.

49
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,533
I will be in attendance
as well. For Asgard.

50
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,301
Since we all seem
to be in agreement,

51
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,436
prepare yourselves
to depart shortly.

52
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,807
Buy as much time
as you possibly can.

53
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,809
[RIAS] I'm sorry that we
can't bring you with us,

54
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,343
but it's just too dangerous.

55
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,680
You'll be safer here
with the defense force.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,816
Oh, of course. Listen, Issei.

57
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,418
Please be careful,
and come back safe, okay?

58
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,953
Hey, don't worry about me.

59
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,823
You just focus on having fun
with the other devils, cool?

60
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,357
[ASIA]
Right.

61
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,426
This feels like old
times, doesn't it?

62
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,495
Yeah. Well, kind of, anyway.

63
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,998
It might seem weird coming from
a devil, but try to be careful.

64
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,366
I was about to say
the same thing to you!

65
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,434
[XENOVIA]
Huh?

66
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,537
[ROSSWEISSE] Guess I'll
introduce myself to the team.

67
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,607
[ROSSWEISSE] I should have known
things would get out of hand

68
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,342
traveling Odin. I'm the
Valkyrie Rossweisse.

69
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,711
[SAJI]
You seein' what I'm seein'?

70
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,680
That's one Valkyrie
I'd like to ride!

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,983
Business suit, suit of armor,
or birthday suit, I am down!

72
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,652
[ISSEI, SAJI groaning]

73
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,986
Would you look at the time.

74
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,555
Down boy.

75
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,591
Okay, kids. Just try to
be careful out there.

76
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,426
The time has come.

77
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,664
Right. These are Phoenix Tears.
Unfortunately, this is all

78
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,866
we could obtain on
such short notice.

79
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,434
[SIR ZECHS]
They may not look like much,

80
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:39,640
Especially since you won't have
a bishop's healing powers.

81
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,542
Thank you. That's a good idea.

82
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,777
Just remember to keep
your guard up out there.

83
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,045
[RIAS]
We will.

84
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,951
[KONEKO] I won't let
you leave me behind.

85
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,654
Won't let me?
That's not your call.

86
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,722
Please, I need to do this.

87
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,062
I'll allow it.

88
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,832
[KONEKO]
Hey, Blue Balls.

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,506
If I was scared, what
would you say to me?

90
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,007
[ISSEI]
That you're fine.

91
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,476
You're not alone
anymore, Koneko.

92
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,813
I'll be right there to protect
you if anything goes wrong.

93
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,618
I gotta say I'm
impressed, Issei.

94
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:28,454
she won't be able to deny
her feelings much longer.

95
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,056
Whoa! We're just friends!

96
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,092
Will you protect me?

97
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:37,664
I'll be counting on that resolve
of yours to get me through.

98
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,933
I won't let you down.

99
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,569
[AJUKA]
All right. Off you go.

100
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,011
[SAJI] I dunno 'bout you,
but I'm not diggin' this.

101
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,446
We just finished training,
and we're fighting a god?

102
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,748
That's nuts.

103
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,983
But still. I'm fightin'
for Sona here,

104
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,852
and there's no way I'm
gonna let her down.

105
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,621
[ISSEI]
I feel ya, man.

106
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,590
Sona wants to make a school
in the underworld.

107
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,826
A place where even low‐level
devils are welcome,

108
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,427
so they can play
the rating game.

109
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,063
Wow. That'd be cool. Although...

110
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,932
I don't get how that
has anything to do

111
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,466
with fighting Loki.

112
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,835
[SAJI]
A lot of devils hate her idea

113
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:17,037
because it goes against
the class system.

114
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,005
They're not big on
any kinda change.

115
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,441
[ISSEI] Guess there's no
rags‐to‐riches for devils.

116
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,510
[SAJI] Yeah, and mixing
with other mythologies

117
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,078
will only open even more minds.

118
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:30,016
If Loki has his way, her goal
doesn't have a chance in hell.

119
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,452
Don't pun me.
Anyway, I'd be down

120
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,521
for teaching kids at that
kinda school, y'know?

121
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,056
If you teach girls' gym.

122
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,092
[laughs] Maybe so,

123
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,662
but that's why I'm standing
in this nightmare right now.

124
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,130
I don't care if they're
a god or a stuck‐up devil.

125
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,833
I swear I'll own anyone
who gets in our way!

126
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,870
Yeah, and I'll be
right there with ya.

127
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,737
[RIAS]
He's coming!

128
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,772
[SAJI, ISSEI grunt]

129
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:07,888
[LOKI] Well, that was annoying.
Not to mention rude.

130
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,189
[ROSSWEISSE]
Hear me, Loki!

131
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,925
Attacking the All‐Father
is unforgivable!

132
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:16,863
you should file your complaint
through the proper channels!

133
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,166
[LOKI] And who will
"unforgive" me? You? Please.

134
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,237
Talented, though you may be,
you cannot challenge a god.

135
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,807
You were always
such a spoiled brat.

136
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:32,078
I was hoping for better in
the opening act of Ragnarok.

137
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,251
[ROSSWEISSE]
Fenrir!

138
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,028
And his runts Hati
and Skoll, too.

139
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,030
Could this get any worse?

140
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,165
[chuckles]

141
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,177
[RIAS]
The Midgard Serpent is worse.

142
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,146
It's one of the
Five Dragon Kings!

143
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,850
[IRINA] Did we plan on there
being legendary monsters?

144
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,253
No we didn't. Though, I really
should've known better.

145
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,255
[SAJI] Hey, guys!
We're surrounded, now!

146
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,057
[RIAS]
Will you suck it up?

147
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,660
Our families are counting
on us to keep Loki at bay,

148
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,862
so that is exactly what
we are going to do!

149
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:26,099
Touching sentiment, but I must
tell you it will never work.

150
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,769
[roars]

151
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,005
Yeah! It's time to put
our training to good use!

152
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:32,706
Rias!

153
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,074
[RIAS, SONA]
Mm.

154
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:39,212
[BOTH] Promotion to Queen!
Balance Breaker!

[DDRAIG]
Welsh Dragon Balance Breaker!

156
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,889
[LOKI] Oh, my, the
Red Dragon Emperor.

157
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,625
And yet I'm still
disappointed.

[ISSEI]
Sticks and stones, dude.

160
00:09:55,694 --> 00:09:56,963
Three weeks I trained
for crap like this,

161
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,899
and that's the best you've got?

Hey, no problem at all.

167

[KIBA]
Taste my Sword Birth!

169
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,760
[ISSEI] Man, Kiba and Xenovia
have gotten a lot stronger.

170
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,631
But so have I! Dragon Shot!

171
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,100
Down you go.

172
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:38,038
[RIAS] Figures we'd be left
with the biggest one.

[AKENO]
Pathetic, I barely did anything!

175
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:51,785
You know what they say about
playing with fire! Mirror Alice!

176
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,191
[SONA]
That's Tsubaki's Sacred Gear.

177
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:00,226
When the Mirror Alice
shatters from taking a hit,

178
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,997
it reflects the attack back at
the enemy with twice the power.

179
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,398
[RIAS]
Thanks for the heads up.

180
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,935
could spell big trouble for
an offensive team like mine.

181
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,172
[SONA] Desperate times.
Planned to save it for a game.

182
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:16,009
I see. Well then, I'm happy
to return the favor for you!

183
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,245
Well, as long as we're
feeling generous...

184
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,791
Okay, so it's resilient.

185
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,926
Good thing we're only
trying to buy time.

186
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,997
Cause beating this thing
is way out of our paygrade.

187
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,800
You're always such an optimist.

188
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,969
[ROSSWEISSE]
Don't underestimate these dogs.

189
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,371
Their bite is much
worse than their bark.

190
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,707
[IRINA]
That's what I wanted to hear.

191
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,908
No reason to hold back!

192
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,744
Irina! Remember,
you're still only human!

193
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,112
These guys have you outclassed!

194
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,315
I think you're mistaken.
How 'bout I show you...

195
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,250
the new me!

196
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,222
So that was unexpected.

197
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,257
[ISSEI]
Since when is she an angel?

198
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:08,762
It's kind of a long story.
All right, bad dog!

199
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,463
Now, by the blessing
of Lord Michael.

200
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,498
I have been reincarnated
as an angel to provide

201
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,870
divine retribution and holy
wrath, so repent! Amen!

202
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,274
[ROSSWEISSE grunts]
I guess these two

203
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,810
can't take a hit as
well as their dad!

204
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,045
Yay, me!

205
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,814
Did she say... "reincarnated?"

206
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,984
[ISSEI] Angel or not, she
hasn't changed one bit.

207
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,520
We'll take care of Fenrir,
you get the other mutt!

208
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,924
[ISSEI] It's you and me, Koneko.
We got this. Let's put him down!

209
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,259
[KONEKO]
Word.

210
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,115
They have done rather well
for a group of weaklings.

[gasps]

212
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,987
[SAJI] You underestimated us!
Big mistake!

213
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,455
[LOKI] The only thing big
is your talk, little boy.

214
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,157
[SAJI] You need to work
on your comebacks, man.

215
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:11,958
They're pretty lame.

216
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,159
[LOKI]
Noted.

Saji! You bastard!

219
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,198

Pay attention!

[ISSEI]
Koneko.

224
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,181
[KONEKO] Don't worry,
I've got it under control.

225
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,050
I will master this power.

226
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,086
My fear will not define
who I am anymore.

227
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,488
You said you'd protect me.

228
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,127
[KONEKO]
But I can protect you, too!

229
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,196
I can do this!

230
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,266
[ISSEI yells]

231
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,469
[AKENO]
Wow. I never imagined Koneko

232
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,906
would become that strong
just by accepting herself.

233
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:03,977
Well, if she can
do it, so can I!

234
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,947
[AKENO] I am the daughter of
Shuri and Barkiel Himejima.

235
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,949
A fallen angel.

236
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,555
But also, I am the devil queen
of Rias Gremory. Akeno Himejima!

[RIAS]
You did it!

241
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:40,013
You finally put it behind you.
I'm so proud.

242
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,028
I smelled teenaged angst.
How disgustingly cliché.

243
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,998
Lord Loki. It isn't
too late to apologize.

244
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,399
The All‐Father may
still forgive you.

245
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,902
But before, you said
I was "unforgiveable".

246
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,537
And why should I be
the one to apologize

247
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,372
when he is clearly in the wrong?

248
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,575
You leave me no choice!

254

[ISSEI] It's that kind of talk
that makes you my best frenemy!

255
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:35,201
Oh, please.
This can't hold me.

256
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,338
But how? Why didn't it break?!

257
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:42,042
[SAJI] Azazel gave me an
upgrade this past month.

258
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:46,146
Now all the Vritra‐Type Sacred
Gears are at my disposal!

259
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:50,083
Ah. So, these are the Vritra
Dragon's dark flames.

260
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,720
And even a god can't shrug
off my cursed power

261
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,424
[SONA] Perhaps you should have
had higher expectations of us.

262
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,393
Just give it up, Loki.

263

[ISSEI]
Hot damn. I should have known

264
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:08,068
Azazel'd pull out all the stops.
All right! You're done!

265
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,537
[LOKI]
Such outstanding arrogance!

00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,144
Lord Loki, stop!
Please, I beg you!

267
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,514
At this rate, you'll destroy
not only the underworld,

268
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,448
but the mythological
worlds as well!

269

This is the dawning of Ragnarok.

Hey, what happened?

Loki made us his bitches.
You gonna take that?

back up and fight?

00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:43,189
It's not the worst plan
I've heard today.

310
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,592
You know, I can think of
much worse ways of dying.

311
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,360
At least I'll be by you.

312
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,662
[gasps]

313
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:53,534
You shouldn't say
things like that.

314
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,367
[ISSEI yells]

315
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,736
[LOKI]
Pathetic.

316
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:59,673
[RIAS] Reviving everyone used
all of the phoenix tears.

317
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,408
We won't survive another
of Loki's attacks.

318
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:07,347
[gasps] Yes, I understand!
I've got good news, guys!

319
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,182
[ISSEI]
The hell is that?

320
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,655
[ROSSWEISSE] It's the mighty
Thor's weapon of choice.

321
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:19,225
the god of thunder rains
down divine punishment.

322
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,493
[LOKI]
Mjolnir?!

323
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,930
[ROSSWEISSE]
Right. Odin sends a message.

324
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,533
Give Mjolnir to
"The Red Dragon Emperor.

325
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,802
He's the only one there
powerful enough to wield it."

326
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:29,703
[ISSEI]
No shit?!

327
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,806
I'll kill you all!

328
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:34,541
[SAJI]
Where you goin'?

329
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:35,408
All yours.

330
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,210
[ISSEI]
Badass!

331
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,381
[ISSEI]
It's hammer time!

332
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,448
[ISSEI yelps]

333
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,918
[ISSEI screams]

334
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:46,853
Issei, no!

335
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,623
[KIBA yells]

336
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,899
[ISSEI groaning]

337
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,634
[RIAS]
Issei!

338
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,976
[RIAS] Hang in there!
You'll be okay! Come on!

339
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:16,983
I'm... so sorry. I almost
had him. My bad... Rias.

340
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,653
I hope one day you'll
be able to forgive me

341
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,287
for letting you down like this.

342
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,489
Issei, please.

343
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:26,860
[ISSEI] You've gotta go.
Save yourselves.

344
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,796
No way! I'll help you, Issei.

345
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:34,635
You won't be alone.
I won't let you die here!

346
00:20:34,635 --> 00:20:39,405
You're going to be okay. Issei!

347
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,810
The... hammer... [groans]

348
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,647
We need it.

349
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,682
[RIAS gasps]

350
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,721
No. He can't.

351
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:57,490
Did the pervert not make it?

352
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,263
[ROSSWEISSE yells]

353
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:12,839
[AKENO panting]
He can't be gone.

354
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,253
[RIAS] Wake up, Issei.
I told you to wake up!

355
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,381
Oh, Rias.

356
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,786
You're gonna die! Bastard!

357
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,521
[IRINA]
How dare you?

358
00:21:27,521 --> 00:21:29,422
[KONEKO yells]

359
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,057
[KIBA yells]

360
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,662
[ROSSWEISSE]
He was the only one of us

361
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:38,899
strong enough to wield Mjolnir.

362
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,568
We don't stand a
chance without him.

363
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:45,839
Loki is going to kill us
for sure. I'm so useless.

364
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,875
No, please. Not him.

365
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,611
[groans]

366
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:53,714
[LOKI] None of you should
be getting this worked up.

367
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:57,684
After all, Ragnarok will
rejoin you with him soon.

368
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,891
I will not let you
die here alone.

369
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:08,629
How dare you, Loki? You monster.

370
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:11,431
You thought you could
take what's mine?!

371
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,839
[RIAS] I don't give a damn
about your Ragnarok.

372
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:24,054
I swear, even if the
world does end today...

373
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,348
And even if every last drop
of my blood boils away.

374
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,717
You will pay for
what you've done.

375
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,386
I will take you down with me!

376
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,483
[AKENO]
Mother, I want to be strong.

377
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,953
[ARTHUR] My name is
Arthur, of the Vali team.

378
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,188
Looks like you've
accepted you power.

379
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,658
Do you think this is
what he'd want? Stop!

380
00:24:17,658 --> 00:24:19,492
I will develop a new
skill to bust out

381
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,827
in addition to Dress Break!
