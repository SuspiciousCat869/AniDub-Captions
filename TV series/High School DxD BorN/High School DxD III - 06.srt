I'm back in school.

My whole summer break was wasted
on the boot camp from hell.

Ah! What the hell
was that for?!

Lucky my foot ain't a cap!

We were s'posed to see

We were gonna be dudes on
the dunes and you flaked!

[ISSEI] I didn't have a
choice! I told you guys,

11
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,459
I had to go to training camp
with the Occult research club!

[KIRYUU laughs]
Well, what do we have here?

That's what I'm talkin' about!

[IRINA] Oh, hi, Issei!
I didn't see you there!

Yo, why's my future baby‐mama

We've known each
other forever!

We were childhood friends
so we go way, way back!

30
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,232
[XENOVIA]
Looks like you had a safe trip.

31
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,367
I didn't think we'd see
you again so soon!

you. Oh, come here!

[IRINA]
What's the matter?

00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,676
Sorry, it's just the cross
hanging around your neck.

35
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,277
It hurts us.

Oh! That's right!

I forgot the crucifix
hurts devils. Forgive me?

I'm kinda freaking out. Wasn't
she a member of the church?

00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,590
That's right. I wonder why
she transferred here, too?

Great, you've already

Have you had a good
first day of school?

00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,233
[IRINA] I have!
Thank you so much, Rias.

Everyone's so nice!
I'm really happy to be here!

00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,639
Wait, do you know
what's going on, Rias?

46
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,707
[AZAZEL] It's not that
complicated, kid.

Oh, great, Azazel's here.

48
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,511
I figured I should
come say hello

49
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,446
to your new transfer
student, too.

50
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,448
After all, she's here
since Michael thinks

51
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,283
the rest of us aren't
strong enough.

against the Chaos Brigade.

Hey, we did work
pretty well together.

Sure, it'll take getting
used to, but it'll be fun.

you guys don't have to
worry about a thing!

As a reincarnated angel,

I'll protect you with
Lord Michael's blessing!

How did that even happen?

[AZAZEL]
With God dead and all,

64
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,745
there's no way for new
angels to be born.

65

So they've gotta be made now,

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,616
kind of like the fallen
angels and devils do.

[IRINA]
This is how it works.

68
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,587
A high‐level angel
is ranked as a "King".

69
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,555
The king commands
its "Brave Saints,"

70
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,023
which rank from
"Queen" to "Ace,"

71
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,925
and there's everything
in between.

you guys are like
a deck of cards.

A whole house of
cards to choose from.

00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,499
Which one did you get assigned?

77
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,735
I was hoping someone
would ask me that!

I am a rank Ace.

on this prestigious position

for Lord Michael's deck.

What a joy! Such a blessing!
Lord Michael, thank you!

It's nice to see Irina
so full of purpose.

Lord Michael must have
done a lot for her.

life still has direction.

can relate to that.

to feel at home.

I gotta say, our house is
starting to fill up like crazy!

00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,402
I wonder what my
parents will think

when they see not one
new girl, but two.

Don't know why I'm crying.

96
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,517
I should be used to this by now.

97
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,986
It's not like any other man
has wanted me by his side,

98
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,089
so why should my own boss?

Don't be like that. I'm sure
he'll be back real soon.

Oh, yeah, me, too! Once the
titty bars have a special event,

101
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,597
he'll be the first one in line!
Maybe I should apply

102
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,600
to be a dancer so he'll see
me and realize he forgot me!

But then he'll be like, "get
that old lady off the stage

duke it out to see who's best.

Huh?

I can't believe it!

That's right. I am the
first devil you saved

by using your sacred gear, but I
never got to introduce myself.

My name is Diodora Astaroth.

Honestly, I never expected
to reunite with you

135
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,816
in the underworld. I wanted
to speak with you then,

136
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,753
but there was such a commotion,
I missed my chance.

137
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,988
So I have come to pick
up where we left off.

00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,923
What? "Left off?"

139
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,059
[DIODORA]
For us to have met twice,

00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,462
in the world above,

Yo, douche‐nozzle, keep
your lips to yourself!

Clearly, we are bound by fate,

and so I must take
you as my bride.

Great Devil Beelzebub

is a descendent of
the Astaroth family.

147
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,914
And Diodora is the
heir to that title.

I didn't realize you two
were acquainted, Asia.

Actually, it's quite the
surprise for me, too.

Poor girl.

exiled from the church;

which then got her mixed
up with the fallen angels.

wanted to introduce himself,

00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,070
so he didn't linger or anything.

156
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,875
Diodora was pretty sheltered and
can be a bit socially awkward.

157
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,812
I'm sure he was just excited
to see the girl who saved him.

158
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,947
Ignore him, and he'll go away.

159
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,582
Okay, I'll do that.

160
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,883
[knocking]

161
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,821
Hey, we're all set up
downstairs for the party.

162
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,857
Perfect timing.
Are you guys ready?

163
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,827
[ASIA]
Yeah! What's wrong, Issei?

164
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,897
Huh! Ah... Nothing. Hey, if that
pretty boy bothers you again,

165
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,567
don't worry about it.
I'll send him packin'!

166
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,835
Thanks!

167
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,572
I wanted to thank you.
I'm happy to be here.

168
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,808
Y'know, I used to think of
devils as my sworn enemies.

169
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:05,078
So I hunted them mercilessly,
and I would've killed you all.

170
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,213
I really hope this
stays in past tense.

171
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,984
Lord Michael said we should
put the past behind us

172
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,986
and work together
for a better future.

173
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,755
Which is great,
because I'd much rather

174
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,623
be friends with you anyway.

175
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,259
I'm honored to represent
the church here.

176
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,928
Let's make our
communities proud!

177
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,600
It's nice to see
youthful idealism.

178
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,802
Our sides've been fighting
each other too long.

179
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,237
Some still won't
approve, though.

180
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,808
But you kids put that aside to
stop a pissy god's rampage.

181
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,577
It was an excellent
demonstration

182
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,679
of what's possible
if we work as one.

183
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,815
I want to thank you all
for what you represent.

184
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,051
nearly dying sounds like
it was almost worth it.

185
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,086
Yeah, almost.

186
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,021
C'mon. It worked out in the end.

187
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,123
The real travesty is that there
weren't any fallen angels

188
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,025
around to make my
team look good.

189
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,629
[AKENO] Not true.
There was a fallen angel.

190
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,264
And it fought,
united with a devil.

191
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,333
Yes, she did.

192
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,236
You're right. I'm mistaken.

193
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:07,941
And I know one guy who'd
have been proud to see it.

194
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:11,244
[RIAS] We were all proud.
And still are.

195
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,213
[AZAZEL] On that note,
good news Issei!

196
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,882
[AZAZEL] I had some
business to take care of

197
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,686
Found out you've become
quite the celebrity there.

198
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,054
[ISSEI]
Celebrity like how?

199
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,657
Wow! That's wonderful
news, Issei!

200
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:27,227
He did use Mjolnir to crush
Loki and save all of Hell.

201
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,162
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

202
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,131
They made a documentary
to showcase our

203
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,668
brave hero's greatest hits.
And then it went hell viral.

204
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,638
In that case,
let me poke yo titties.

205
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,706
[ISSEI]
My power was unleashed

206
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,843
by poking my
master's headlights!

207
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,278
So, uh, not just basic
groping, but like...

208
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,982
I... can... suck on dem tittays?

209
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:54,020
This is for Rias and her
mammoth love melons!

210
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,722
[AZAZEL]
The fans especially love it

211
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:57,123
when you make
heroic exclamations

212
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,291
about things like boobies.

213
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,695
[AZAZEL] You are now known
as the Breast Dragon Emperor.

214
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,897
You're kidding!
Tell me you're joking.

215
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,099
[AZAZEL]
The kids love you most of all.

216
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,201
They sing songs about you
around their school yards

217
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,336
called "The Grabbin' Dragon."

218
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,238
Just kill me...

219
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,920
[IRINA]
Ooh, pick me!

220
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,189
I want to do the treasure hunt,
put me down for that!

221
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,226
All right. The next competition
is the three‐legged race.

222
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,896
[DDRAIG cries]

223
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,898
[ISSEI]
C'mon, Ddraig, cheer up.

224
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,100
[DDRAIG] I am one of the
two heavenly dragons!

225
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,468
The name Red Dragon Emperor
used to strike fear

226
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,906
[ISSEI] Look, I'm
embarrassed, too, okay?

227
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:48,408
[DDRAIG] But now I'm the
"Breast Dragon Emperor"!

228
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:52,378
All hail "Grabbin'
Dragon"! [cries]

229
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,249
[ISSEI sighs] Who knew Ddraig
would be so sensitive?

230
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:00,821
Hasn't he ever heard that all
publicity is good publicity?

231
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,123
And as if I didn't have
enough to worry about,

232
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,760
that dude from Asia's past
has gone full blown stalker.

233
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,496
He missed his chance,
why won't he let it die?

234
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,190
Then again. I'm no better.

[ISSEI gasps]

236
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:16,134
That hole in your
armpit an air vent?

237
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,401
[ISSEI]
Don't tell me.

238
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:18,970
Wait, what? There's no hole.

239
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,139
[KIRYUU]
That's half our tripod!

[ISSEI groans]
That was dirty, even for you!

241
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:27,946
Only one‐and‐a‐half
legs to go. Any takers?

242
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,380
Asia?

243
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,949
[KIRYUU]
Done deal!

244
00:12:34,452 --> 00:12:36,287
[IRINA] You ready to
do this, Xenovia?

245
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:39,257
[XENOVIA] You bet.
Show me what you've got.

Why am I impressed?

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:47,131
Man, those chicks
don't slow they roll,

250
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:51,435
You're right! They keep it up,
they'll motorboat themselves!

251
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:53,304
With their pistons
pumping so hard,

00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:55,439
it's impossible for us

[SAJI] Ah. Y'know,
I shoulda seen that coming.

263
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:16,460
So that your festival
event, or what?

264
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,497
No, I'm doin' the three‐legged
race with Asia.

265
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:22,300
Well, aren't you just the
luckiest son of a bitch?

266
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,969
I got stuck in the
bread eating contest.

267
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:28,206
Saji. Shouldn't you
be doing something?

268
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:30,308
Seeing as you represent
the student council,

269
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:33,344
I expect you to win your
race. Get back to work.

Wow, Asia!

You had quite the growth

but can you please let go?

Oh! Yeah! See you later.

save Asia from face‐planting

into second base.

hurt, are you?

00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:03,101
[ISSEI] Wait, I can grope her
if I give her a heads up?!

308
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,169
How about we give
this another shot?

309
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:07,438
What's the point?
I'm just gonna slow you down.

310
00:15:07,438 --> 00:15:11,610
C'mon. I can't do this without
you! We gotta be together.

311
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,044
You really mean that?

312
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,613
Sure do, it's you and me.

313
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,415
And we're gonna take
this one step at a time.

314
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:19,951
[ASIA]
Okay.

315
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:22,921
[ISSEI] Outside, inside,
outside, inside,

316
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,290
outside, inside,
outside, inside.

317
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,662
[ASIA]
Issei. I want to thank you

318
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:32,931
for everything
you've done for me.

319
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,967
Without you, I wouldn't
be getting married today.

320
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,538
[MOTHER cries] Oh, Asia!
A beautiful bride!

321
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,305
[ISSEI]
Wait, Mom? Dad?

322
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:45,076
I'm so happy to see you
moving on with your life.

323
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,412
You deserve to be happy,
don't worry about us.

324
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:51,950
Uh... Wait a sec.
What is this?

325
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,417
[MOTHER]
Don't be like that, Issei.

326
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:56,087
Don't you have something to
say to the blushing bride?

327
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,623
She is like a little
sister to you, isn't she?

328
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,559
[ISSEI] You can't just
spring this on me.

329
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,161
I mean... Who's the groom?

330
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:06,497
[DIODORA] Don't worry, brother.
I will make Asia happy.

331
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:08,432
After all, I am super rich.

332
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,736
so I'm clearly the best thing
that's ever happened to her.

333
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:13,337
Are you ready, my love?

334
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:15,974
"I do." With those
words, you'll be mine,

335
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,008
and I'll whisk you away.

336
00:16:17,008 --> 00:16:19,077
I am. Goodbye, Issei.

337
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:21,245
I'm leaving with Diodora
to get hitched.

338
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,081
Thanks for everything,
but I don't need you

339
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:26,084
[ISSEI] As you're platonic
older brother figure,

340
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:30,321
I can't let you
marry that asshole!

341
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:33,457
Are you awake?
Did you have a bad dream?

342
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:34,425
It seemed like it.

343
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,260
You could say that.

344
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:41,099
I dreamt you were getting
married and leaving me.

345
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,067
How could you do
something like that?

346
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:47,071
It was just a dream, Issei,
you're okay. I'm not leaving.

347
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,641
And don't worry! I'm not
getting married yet, either.

348
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,242
You really mean that?

349
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,578
I think I'd die from
loneliness without you.

350
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:56,347
I do. There's no way
I could live with myself

351
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,082
if I caused you
that kind of pain.

352
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,718
That's... great.

353
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,588
[RIAS]
Mm. What's going on?

354
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,123
Rias?

355
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:06,658
[ASIA, RIAS gasp]

356
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:10,461
[ISSEI]
Oh. Whe did she get here?

357
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:12,330
[RIAS]
Koneko?

358
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,098
Meow.

359
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,035
[ISSEI]
Not to beat off a dead‐horse,

360
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,070
but I'm so glad you're
not getting married.

361
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,640
As long as she rejects
the proposal.

362
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:28,613
Love letters to be exact. All
sent by one Diodora Astaroth.

363
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:30,448
He's sent me something
every single day

364
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,316
since we bumped into
him in the street.

365
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:35,219
Movie tickets, dinner invites,
stuffed animals, chocolates,

366
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,121
flowers, car keys, the works.

367
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:38,623
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:41,292
You don't have to apologize
for a little crush.

369
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,628
Poor thing doesn't know
the way to a woman's heart.

370
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:46,330
What the hell's his problem?
He's a legit stalker!

371
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:50,068
It was bad enough he
proposed. Now this?

372
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,806
Anyway... How about
I get rid of these?

373
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,340
I would appreciate it.

374
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,176
Well, we kinda need
to get practicing

375
00:17:58,176 --> 00:17:59,477
for the sports festival.

376
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,279
[RIAS]
Of course. Have fun.

377
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,614
[BOTH]
We will!

378
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:14,158
[RIAS] That expression.
Does he like....? [gasps]

379
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,561
What am I thinking?
Issei's always like that.

380
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,830
I shouldn't be worried.

381
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:23,535
[BOTH] In, out, in,
out, in, out, in, out!

382
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,304
Great! You guys
look really good.

383
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,808
[ASIA] I feel bad we made
you help us practice.

384
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,612
But we're not done.
Go for a light jog this time.

385
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,314
Cool. You ready
for this, partner?

386
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,617
Hello?

387
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,851
What's up?

388
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,352
You first.

389
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:46,357
I was thinking, I don't regret
saving Diodora back then.

390
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:48,660
He's the reason I'm
in Kuo Academy.

391
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,428
Where I found the
Occult Research Club,

392
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,164
and met all of my
friends, and you.

393
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:55,667
The people I love
more than anything.

394
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:59,604
If I hadn't saved him back then,
I wouldn't have any of you.

395
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,840
And when I think
about it like that,

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,243
I feel so happy about
the whole thing.

397
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:09,347
And we're always going
to be together, Asia.

398
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:10,915
Yeah.

399
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,652
That was so tender.

400
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,354
Irina? How long have
you been here?

401
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:19,558
A bit. Xenovia told me yesterday
that the school grounds

402
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,392
are really lovely in
the early mornings.

403
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:25,229
I never expected to see
such beautiful friendship!

404
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,898
Your affection could
only be the product

405
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,901
of God and Lord Michael's will.

406
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,469
Amen!

407
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,305
[ASIA sighs]
I am worn out!

408
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,675
Let's get changed
and take a break.

410
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,680
[ASIA] What are you doing?
Is something the matter?

411
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,583
Asia. I found something out.

412
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,951
Has anyone told you
about this, yet?

413
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:50,221
Girls our age are beginning to
have secret affairs with boys.

414
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:50,855
[ISSEI]
Huh?

415
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,691
No, I didn't know that.

416
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,293
[XENOVIA] We should have what's
called a "Devil's Threesome."

417
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,828
I've heard of that... maybe?

418
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,830
Look, I don't know what
you think that means,

419
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,232
but trust me on this, you're
wrong on so many levels.

420
00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:02,967
Asia. There isn't much time.

421
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:07,205
We'll have to do this quickly if
we want it to remain a secret.

422
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,407
I didn't realize we were
on some sort of deadline!

423
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:13,244
The devil's threesome will also
improve your three legged race.

424
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:14,278
It's the rule of threes!

425
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,247
Does not apply to that!

426
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:19,651
If we can't do it with
friends, why bother?

427
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,985
Yeah.

428
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:22,654
That's why we should
do it together!

429
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,924
Yeah, uh! That makes
sense I think?

430
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,892
[ISSEI] No. None of
that makes sense.

431
00:20:27,892 --> 00:20:29,628
[XENOVIA]
Let's get started, then.

432
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,563
I'll benefit from this
as well by training

433
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,897
my baby‐making skills.

Hold on! You wanna do this here?

435
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,668
First off, you got your
terminology wrong,

436
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,902
you want to ride the tricycle,

which would be a
dream come true! B...!

438
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,606
It's not the first time
you've tried this.

439
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,842
You get off on situations
like this, don't you?

440
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:44,809
Never mind, I don't
want to know...

441
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,010
[XENOVIA]
Your turn, Asia.

Right. My turn.

00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,849
I don't know if I'm
ready for this yet.

I won't be showed up by

[XENOVIA sighs]
Oh wow, being touched by you

451
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,439
feels completely different
than when I touch myself.

Keep going.

give ourselves to you.

Do whatever you want.

[ISSEI gasps]
"Do whatever I want"?

That's my favorite sentence

protect Asia!

00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:38,930
You guys never came back out,

461
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,799
so I was worried
something had happened!

462
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,366
But this?!

463
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:44,002
[ISSEI]
U‐Uh... Irina!

464
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,037
Geez! At least do it in bed!

465
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:49,007
who knows what diseases
you could catch here!

466
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,609
[ISSEI]
Valid.

467
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,477
[KIBA]
A rating game?

468
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:55,547
[RIAS]
That's right. More specifically,

469
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,348
it's a tournament designed
to test and rank

470
00:21:57,348 --> 00:21:59,718
the power of the next
generation of devils.

471
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,886
It was supposed to be held
over the summer break,

472
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:04,923
but then Loki attacked, and
you all know how that ended up.

473
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,925
No, I don't wanna,
I'm too scared!

474
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,893
If this game's meant to rank us,

475
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:12,030
does that mean we'll be
going up against Sairaorg?

476
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,766
Yes, and he's one favored
to win the championship.

477
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,368
With good reason, too,
he's on a whole other level.

478
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:20,772
we're not paired up against
him in the first round.

479
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,775
They've already chosen
the brackets. That's whack.

480
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,878
That's right. We're fighting...

481
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:28,780
Diodora Astaroth.

482
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,381
[BOTH gasp]

483
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,482
[ISSEI]
Diodora...

484
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,584
[ASIA]
Uh...

485
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:35,854
Fuck that guy.

486
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,879
So how 'bout it, Issei?

487
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,081
Don't you think looks
amazing on me?

488
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:14,786
Oh, deal with it already.
He's way more into my girls!

489
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,120
[KONEKO]
Do you like this look?

490
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,457
No, so many mixed emotions!
Not, like you!

491
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,825
It's my turn, now.
