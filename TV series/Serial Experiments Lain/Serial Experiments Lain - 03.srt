1
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,708
You've heard of a girl named Lain, right?

2
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,791
Lain of the Wired.

3
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,458
Are your parents away on vacation or something?

4
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,458
I called the number you
gave me, but no one answered.

5
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:19,250
I'm not lying.

6
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:23,458
No, I don't think you're lying. I checked.

7
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,166
You're Lain Iwakura, all right.

8
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,208
Your address and phone number check out.

9
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,166
It's late, so I'm going to
have someone take you home.

10
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,208
But next time, I want you to talk to me.

11
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:39,375
Keeping quiet is a bad idea,
even if you weren't involved.

12
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,041
For crying out loud...

13
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,375
Lain, I'm sorry!

14
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,208
This is all <i>our</i> fault. Are you okay, Lain?

15
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:56,250
Are you all right, Lain?

16
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,833
A...

17
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,666
What is it, Lain?

18
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,125
A... ri... su.

19
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:10,208
Arisu! Come on! We're going home.

20
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,666
Lain...

21
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,791
Arisu!

22
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:18,208
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Lain...

23
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,833
Tomorrow... Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

24
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,250
I'm sorry!

25
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,083
So do you want to head home, too?

26
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
A... risu.

27
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:50,541
You have a key, right?

28
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,750
Yes.

29
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,125
Message...

30
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,791
There are no messages for Lain.

31
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,458
Good night, Navi.

32
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,833
Good night, Lain.

33
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,916
Don't you think it's embarrassing
for a junior high-schooler...

34
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
...to oversleep and be late for school?

35
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:38,166
Mom... About last night...

36
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,625
Hm? What about it?

37
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,666
Never mind.

38
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,833
Lain.

39
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:36,750
Lain.

40
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,708
Lain.

41
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:47,333
It's me, Lain. You can hear me, can't you?

42
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,791
Who's there?

43
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,500
You are not alone.

44
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:03,375
--'Morning!
--Good morning!

45
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,833
Oh, my god!

46
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,750
Was he cute?

47
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:11,291
Yeah, they wouldn't show his face on TV!

48
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,916
Well...

49
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,625
Oh, you were screaming the
whole time. Did you even see his face?

50
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,458
Well, yeah, but...

51
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,166
I was a little--

52
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,500
You were too scared to look.

53
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,916
Lain!

54
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,375
Lain, did you get in trouble yesterday?

55
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:32,666
Come on, it wasn't really our fault.

56
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,208
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

57
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,666
Right, Arisu was closest to the guy!

58
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,166
So, was there blood splattered all over?

59
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,958
Yeah...

60
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,583
Tell them!

61
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,291
--Come on!
--Arisu!

62
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,333
But that's not all.

63
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:59,791
If you look at the Psyche as a mere
processor, you lose sight of the whole.

64
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,708
As a multi-purpose information terminal,

65
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:05,708
the Navi has come into wide
use even among grade-schoolers.

66
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:10,958
However, activity within the
Wired is currently limited by the machine.

67
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:15,333
The Psyche can dramatically
increase the performance of any Navi.

68
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:19,833
There was no reason for me to
stay in the real world any longer.

69
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:26,708
In the real world, it didn't
matter if I was there or not.

70
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:34,416
When I realized that, I was no
longer afraid of losing my body.

71
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,250
Who is Lain?

72
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,375
Huh?

73
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,625
Who is Lain? Who is Lain?

74
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,458
Who is Lain?

75
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:49,958
There's something wrong with us!

76
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,916
We saw someone <i>die</i>
right in front of us yesterday,

77
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,750
but we're acting like it's
something we saw in a movie.

78
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:05,750
I know we were there last
night, but it didn't seem real.

79
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,583
I guess it's like that for me, too.

80
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:13,125
I don't think you should
take it so seriously, Arisu.

81
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,833
No, that's not what I mean.

82
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,125
I'm saying it's strange
that we <i>can't</i> take it seriously.

83
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,750
Right, Lain?

84
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,083
Huh? What?

85
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:26,125
What's <i>that,</i> a love letter?

86
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,583
No <i>way</i> !

87
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,291
N-No! I don't <i>think</i> it is, anyway...

88
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,250
Let us see! Let us see!

89
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:35,041
Come on, don't be stingy! Show us!

90
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,208
Stop that! It's mean!

91
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,833
A brown paper envelope, huh?

92
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:43,125
What's written on it?

93
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:49,500
--Huh?
--What the heck is <i>this</i> ?

94
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,541
Talk about boring!

95
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,458
I knew it.

96
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,625
Psyche...

97
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,791
You've got it all wrong!
Somebody peeped at my voice mail!

98
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,541
I can't believe it!

99
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,708
As the relevant clauses were
not in the résumé we received,

100
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:58,041
we are currently discussing how
to handle it. As for your company...

101
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:03,333
I love kissing. Just kissing
is enough to make me happy.

102
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,833
You heard about that kid pulling
a stupid stunt on Accela, right?

103
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:10,000
Looks like the black market
supplier is freaking out.

104
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,750
You can't find it anywhere now.

105
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,500
Rumor has it that the Psyche chip is
mass-produced in factories in Taiwan.

106
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:22,791
Rumor also says that it was
designed by a group called the Knights.

107
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:26,875
But I'm not sure if these "Knights" even exist.

108
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,416
In the Wired, there are a
lot of urban legends like that.

109
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,166
Dying feels so good!

110
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,333
I feel accelerated...

111
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,375
What the--? There's someone in my room!

112
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:43,541
It's a little person like a kid
in a red and green striped shirt!

113
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:49,166
I can't move in my bed! It's
standing by my door, watching me!

114
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,916
Help me!

115
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,291
I have a picture of you with your secret lover.

116
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,833
I just want to do business. What do you say?

117
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:05,750
If you don't buy it, I'll leak this
image data to your company's server.

118
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,791
You'll be famous all over the Wired.

119
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,333
Lain, why won't you come here?

120
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,833
Lain has new mail.

121
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,583
Navi--

122
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,500
How's it going, Lain?

123
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,791
Gotten used to your new Navi?

124
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,666
Something wrong?

125
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,500
Do you know what this is?

126
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,541
No.

127
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,458
I thought...

128
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,208
I thought you'd know, Dad.

129
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,291
I said I don't know.

130
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,166
Come on, why not?

131
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,875
No... I can't...

132
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,583
Why not? I love you.

133
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,250
Lain!

134
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:15,291
Where you been lately?
I haven't seen you around.

135
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,291
I...

136
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:23,000
What the--? Damn, you're sure
going for the "little girl" look today...

137
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,125
Let's have another rave, okay?
I'll leave the planning to you.

138
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,458
--Why're you trying to act so tough?
--Excuse me.

139
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,250
Look who's talking!

140
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,750
Do you know what this is?

141
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,500
I-Is that a <i>Psyche</i> ?!

142
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,125
Wha--

143
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,375
No way!

144
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,791
I've never seen one before!

145
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,708
W-Where did you buy it?

146
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,458
You know what this is?

147
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,416
What're you saying?

148
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:17,833
With that installed, I could get full
access to the Wired with even <i>this</i> !

149
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,250
How do you use it?

150
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,125
Talk about lame!
You don't even know <i>that</i> ?

151
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,208
Can I buy it off you? Can I?

152
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,041
Moron! Like <i>you</i> could buy something like that!

153
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,333
What kind of Navi do you have?

154
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,333
I'm not really sure. It's a Tachibana.

155
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:37,875
Their newest model, I think.

156
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,125
<i>Awesome</i> !

157
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,958
Have you gotten inside it?

158
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,833
You in eighth grade? Ninth?

159
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,083
Eighth.

160
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,833
Then you've taken Basic Information, right?

161
00:18:56,916 --> 00:19:00,916
A Navi's basic motherboard
layout is in the textbook.

162
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:06,958
You connect it to the board,
opposite the main processor.

163
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:12,291
It intercepts the original data
and manipulates it on its own.

164
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,416
Using it is easier than building a model kit.

165
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,166
You just need to watch
out for static electricity.

166
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,083
Oh. Thanks.

167
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,666
Hold it!

168
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,416
Information isn't free, not in
the Wired or in the real world.

169
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,125
How much you gonna charge? How much?

170
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,666
Uh...

171
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,750
You're Lain, aren't you?

172
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:43,916
I saw you once. In the Wired.

173
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,291
You saw me? In the Wired?

174
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,875
You were totally different
then than you are now.

175
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,041
Most people take on a
personality in the Wired...

176
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,416
...that's different than what
they have in the real world,

177
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,208
but yours are total opposites.

178
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,583
No <i>way</i> !

179
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:09,250
You were here when that idiot
started shooting, too, weren't you?

180
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,458
What are you planning?

181
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,500
What... What should I do for you?

182
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,166
Go out on a date with me!

183
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,708
Moron.

184
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,458
But not like you are now.

185
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,500
I want the <i>wild</i> Lain.

186
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,791
I-I'm just kidding!

187
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,291
But if you feel like it sometime...

188
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,291
What're you talking about?!

189
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,291
Hey...

190
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,041
Forget about it! Let's go!

191
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,458
Sure!

192
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,791
What's so great about <i>you</i> ?

193
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,708
Uh... Excuse me?

194
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,541
Are you here to see someone?

195
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,166
Who are you?

196
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,833
You never saw us.

197
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,833
W-What...? I'll call the police!

198
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:25,250
We're not here, you see.

199
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,375
H-Hey...

200
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,583
W-What the <i>hell</i> ?

201
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,875
Mom, if they show up again, call the cops!

202
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,000
Are you listening, Mom?

203
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:52,666
Damn it...

204
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,166
W-What're you doing, Lain?

205
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:23,500
What are you doing?
Why are you dressed like that?

206
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,500
Well, I heard that you have to
watch out for static electricity.

207
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:32,333
So I thought it'd probably be
safest if I took off my clothes.

208
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,208
A-Are you kidding?

209
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,416
Welcome home, sis!

210
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:10,791
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

211
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:24,000
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

212
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:39,291
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

213
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:45,791
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

214
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:52,958
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

215
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:53,958
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

216
00:23:54,041 --> 00:24:01,625
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

217
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:02,958
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

218
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:12,125
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

219
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:18,666
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

220
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,125
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
