1
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,958
I'll tell you, but it's just between you and me.

2
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:46,958
I'll tell you what's happening
in this society, what's beginning...

3
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,166
...just because you don't know about it.

4
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,541
No, that's not it.

5
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,083
I'm just watching.

6
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:42,166
I mean, the <i>me</i> in the Wired is...

7
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,833
Right. She's becoming less and less like me.

8
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,125
I don't really know.

9
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,750
Huh? Who?

10
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,125
Sis?

11
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,291
My sister's been acting different lately.

12
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,750
I... I'm not sure.

13
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,541
Right.

14
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,791
Fine, suit yourself.

15
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,791
I know.

16
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:42,708
The real world and the
Wired are attached end to end.

17
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,083
I can exist <i>anywhere</i> .

18
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:52,625
No matter where my body is, I can
send my consciousness anywhere I want.

19
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:29,541
It's time for the EMA Motor Consortium banquet.

20
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,208
Right.

21
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,625
Mail.

22
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,708
I'll be down in three minutes.

23
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,583
Very well.

24
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,791
What game do you want to play <i>this</i> time?

25
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,083
Try some of <i>this</i> ...

26
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,250
That's right, you morons...

27
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,708
I'm better than you bozos!

28
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,708
The real world isn't real at all.

29
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,708
Lain?

30
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,833
Are you okay?

31
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,041
Why do you ask?

32
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:39,375
Lately, you've been... slipping again, Lain.

33
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:49,625
We... We wanted to make you happy,
so we've been taking you out with us.

34
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,125
That's what we were trying to do. Honest.

35
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,625
But if you weren't happy, I apologize.

36
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,958
No! That's not it...

37
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,458
Of course I was having fun...

38
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,333
I've had a great time.

39
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,083
Glad to hear it.

40
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,291
Arisu!

41
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,416
Yeah?

42
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Um... Thanks. Thanks for worrying about me.

43
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,708
That's what friends are for, right?

44
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,375
See you.

45
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,541
This afternoon, the firewall
of the Information Bureau's...

46
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,333
...Information Control Center was
cracked and destroyed by some party,

47
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:11,166
and information in the Wired
Network is currently in disarray.

48
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,541
This news report is being
sent out at this moment,

49
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:22,833
but please be aware that it may
arrive tomorrow, or possibly yesterday.

50
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,000
Looks like it was the Knights.

51
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,083
"Knights"? Who's that?

52
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,708
"Knights." The Knights of the Eastern Calculus,

53
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:36,833
said to have great influence in the Wired.

54
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,958
Members comprising the group: unknown.

55
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,458
They are not only involved in
mere information manipulation,

56
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,041
they also are involved in the
development and distribution...

57
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,208
...of illegal information devices.

58
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,750
I hear somebody's after Lain!

59
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,333
Lain? Who's that?

60
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:56,375
Lain. Search has no matches.

61
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,166
I haven't seen Lain around lately.

62
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,875
Who the hell is Lain?

63
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:00,958
A girl.

64
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,125
A <i>girl</i> ?

65
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:03,166
She's powerful!

66
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,291
How?

67
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,458
Her metamorphosis. Her will. Her power.

68
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,750
The light in her eyes. Her existence.

69
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,291
Hey, can I ask you something?

70
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,750
What?

71
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,958
You wouldn't happen to be
a Knights member, would you?

72
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,041
Just a minute!

73
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Delivery, ma'am!

74
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,416
Let me get my stamp.

75
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,958
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to keep you waiting so long.

76
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,000
That's okay, ma'am.

77
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,916
Okay, here's my stamp.

78
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,666
What is it?

79
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,250
That Navi.

80
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,000
That's a new model, right? I wish I had one.

81
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,291
I bought it with money from my home job.

82
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:04,416
Even working at a job like this,
I'd never be able to buy one of those.

83
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,291
Here you are.

84
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,791
Well, keep working for it.

85
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,333
Sure thing.

86
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,250
Yeah, you're right...
If I don't work hard, I'll never...

87
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:19,041
If you have trouble with anything,
let me know. I can teach you.

88
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,416
You'll teach me?

89
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,250
Sure. I'm pretty good.

90
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:29,041
So this is how you seduce
bored housewives, huh?

91
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,583
No, I just...

92
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,208
Well, maybe a little.

93
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,875
I'm home!

94
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,208
Well, thanks.

95
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:50,875
Mom, can I go over to Kinya's to play later?

96
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,541
If you're going to play a game,
can't you just do it over the Net?

97
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,250
He's gonna teach me how to play it!

98
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:05,125
The Wired and the real
world are one and the same.

99
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,125
W-What?

100
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:35,041
Ms. Lain Iwakura.
Would you please come with us?

101
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,291
We won't force you. This is a request.

102
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:48,625
We have no intention to harm you physically.

103
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,625
Who are you?

104
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:02,958
If you come with us, we'll tell you.

105
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:18,458
I... I don't want to be here.
You understand that, don't you?

106
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:22,041
Just look at all I can do! Look!

107
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:26,833
I'm breaking the barrier
between the real world and the Wired.

108
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:32,500
Come on, I think I'm plenty qualified.

109
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,125
Let me into the Knights!

110
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,958
You're impressed, huh?

111
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,375
I tracked you down all by myself!

112
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,208
This is your dedicated
top-secret channel, right?

113
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,291
Come on, make me one of you!

114
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,500
W-Who are <i>you</i> ?!

115
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:42,791
"Tachibana General Laboratories Shinbashi Office"

116
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,833
Could you come here for a minute?

117
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:08,041
I can't seem to get the main office's
firewall to recognize this machine.

118
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:11,541
I've done everything
I can on the app end of things.

119
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:21,708
I guess it's hopeless
with an old machine like this.

120
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,583
But I've always used this thing...

121
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:29,750
I just can't work up the interest
to switch over to a new Navi.

122
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,666
Not at my age.

123
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,375
If I were as young as you, though...

124
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,666
That jumper there.

125
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:52,666
Try removing this jumper
and that one over there.

126
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,666
Sorry, could you do it for me?

127
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,833
Authorized.

128
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:29,750
L-Lain? You're one of the Knights?!

129
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:35,125
You <i>are,</i> aren't you, Lain? I had no idea!

130
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,791
Moron.

131
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,375
W-Wait! Please!

132
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:45,166
That game you've been playing
with those kids lately is the <i>greatest</i> !

133
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,541
But I have an even <i>better</i> idea.

134
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:54,791
So, please! Make me one
of you! Make me a Knight!

135
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,541
Please, make me one of you!

136
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:03,458
Some say that the Wired doesn't
have political borders like the real world.

137
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,041
But there are far too many...

138
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:11,541
...nonsense-spouting anarchists or idiots
who think that pranks are a revolution.

139
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:16,916
But the Knights don't
seem to be either of those.

140
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,041
Knights...

141
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:24,625
I don't know how much of
what you do is intentional.

142
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:29,541
Your presence in the Wired is highly unnatural.

143
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:35,375
And the Knights seem to
have a special interest in you.

144
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:40,500
I... I don't... I don't
understand what you're...

145
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:45,833
The Knights... You've been in
direct contact with them at some point.

146
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:49,291
But I... I don't...

147
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:54,958
At any rate, it looks like they
want to use you for something.

148
00:17:55,041 --> 00:18:00,708
We believe that is something that
must be prevented, no matter the cost.

149
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:06,083
W-What... are you? <i>Who</i> are you?

150
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:20,375
Your secret's safe with me. You bet!

151
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:25,208
You believe in Deus, right?
I'll follow your lead.

152
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:30,833
But is it true? Is God really in the Wired?

153
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not ready to believe that yet.

154
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,416
But if you let me join you,
I'll be able to learn more.

155
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,125
<i>Then</i> I'll believe!

156
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,333
Is that you?

157
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,416
You came!

158
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,791
You came for me!

159
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,250
My name...

160
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,291
It's meaningless to know my real name.

161
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,916
I, and those gentlemen there, have no name.

162
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,875
Tell me.

163
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:10,041
Lain Iwakura, are you and the
Lain of the Wired one and the same?

164
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,708
Who are you?

165
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,708
I... I'm...

166
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,958
Are your parents your real parents?

167
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,458
Huh?

168
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,625
Is your sister your real sister?

169
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:28,291
W-What are you saying? O-Of course they are...

170
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:32,000
When is your father's birthday?

171
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,000
Dad's... His...

172
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,833
What about your mother's birthday?
When did your parents get married?

173
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,625
Did they meet, or was it arranged?

174
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:46,875
Th-That's... I...

175
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,875
Why don't you know? You never asked?

176
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:55,041
You've never celebrated a birthday in
your family? Not since you were little?

177
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,041
Well?

178
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,791
When were you born? Where?

179
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,916
I... What does it matter? It...

180
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,291
You don't know? You don't know anything?

181
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,875
Are you okay? You don't know anything.

182
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,416
Shut up, damn it...

183
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,750
Who cares about that crap?
Like any of it matters...

184
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,458
You're Lain of the Wired?

185
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,333
So what if I <i>am</i> ?

186
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:47,458
If you're here without a device,
you know that the border between...

187
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,833
...the real world and the Wired
is starting to crumble, don't you?

188
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:52,791
So?

189
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,875
We believe that to be dangerous.

190
00:20:56,958 --> 00:21:00,375
Sounds interesting.

191
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,625
Move it.

192
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,583
What's the big idea?

193
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,208
<i>You</i> are what's dangerous.

194
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:21,375
Karl!

195
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:34,291
It's as she said.
Something interesting is beginning.

196
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,416
We should just watch from the sidelines.

197
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,666
Shou!

198
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,458
Yeah, Mom?

199
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,916
Let me play, too!

200
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
Are you done with work?

201
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,041
You bet!

202
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,291
I'm the greatest!

203
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:57,083
I'm gonna get ya, Shou!

204
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,708
See? Say your prayers!

205
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,375
Watch this!

206
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:09,250
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

207
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:22,458
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

208
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:37,750
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

209
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:44,250
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

210
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:51,416
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

211
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,416
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

212
00:23:52,500 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

213
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,416
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

214
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:10,583
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

215
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:17,125
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

216
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:22,583
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
