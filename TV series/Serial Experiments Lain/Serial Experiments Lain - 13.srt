1
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:46,291
I... I'm confused again.

2
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:49,833
Am I here? Or am I there?

3
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,833
Over there, I'm everywhere. I know that.

4
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,625
I'm connected there, after all.

5
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:57,541
Right?

6
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,583
But where is the real me?

7
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:05,375
Oh, right... There <i>is</i> no real me.

8
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,916
I only exist inside those people
who are aware of my existence.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,416
But this <i>me</i> that's talking right now...

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,125
It's me, isn't it?

11
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:21,541
This me that's talking...
This <i>me</i> ... Who is it?

12
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,083
Arisu!

13
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,166
A body doesn't mean anything to you, right?

14
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,916
Arisu...

15
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,500
No!

16
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:19,708
I mess up everything
I try to do for you, huh, Arisu?

17
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,666
Honest, I...

18
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,625
Arisu! Arisu!

19
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,625
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

20
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,833
Arisu, I'm sorry...

21
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,541
I'm done.

22
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,208
Hey, you didn't clean your plate.

23
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,750
She says she's on a diet.

24
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,291
Tell the whole world, why don't you?

25
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,875
Oh, I might get a package today. It's C.O.D.

26
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,250
If it comes, pay for it, okay?

27
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,375
Computer parts again?

28
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,333
Hey...

29
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes?

30
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,958
No, it's nothing.

31
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,666
Arisu!

32
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,958
Arisu! We're going out tonight, right?

33
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,958
Cyberia! Cyberia!

34
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,875
Oh. Sure, why not?

35
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,458
I'd better mail her, then.

36
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:14,625
Arisu? Mail <i>who</i> ?

37
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:31,041
Oh, don't tell me you want
<i>her</i> to come along again...

38
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,166
"Her"?

39
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,250
Chisa?

40
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,875
Yeah. Chisa Yomoda.

41
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,875
Arisu, you talked us into
taking her to Cyberia once,

42
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,625
but it's like she just didn't care.

43
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,833
Inviting her is pointless.

44
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,958
--Oh, I get it...
--Huh?

45
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,125
It's nothing.

46
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,333
I just thought of something strange.

47
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,208
Something strange?

48
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,208
If you don't remember
something, it never happened.

49
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,458
Don't remember?

50
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:11,583
If you aren't remembered, you never existed.

51
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Who are you talking about?

52
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,250
Who are you talking about?

53
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:21,125
Like I said. Nobody.

54
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,333
C'mon, we'd better hit the books.

55
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,000
Arisu!

56
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,208
Go!

57
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,916
Man, I gotta do it <i>again</i> ?

58
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,250
C'mon, one more time!

59
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,541
Hurry up!

60
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,708
Wait for me!

61
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:50,000
You're such a sucker!

62
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,500
Mail?

63
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,625
What is it?

64
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,958
Who's that girl?!

65
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,750
I don't know.

66
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,958
<i>Now</i> what?

67
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,333
Hey, nice machine!

68
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,666
Mine's pretty tricked out, too.

69
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,291
C'mon! Hurry!

70
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,625
C'mon! C'mon!

71
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,166
Mom's waiting!

72
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,083
Okay, okay... 'Bye.

73
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,291
Let's go!

74
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,666
Wait! Shoot for it again!

75
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,291
Hurry up, Taro!

76
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,166
No fair! Shoot for it again!

77
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:45,708
I'll quit. I'll quit that dump.

78
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,333
The crap they make me do...

79
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:51,666
They all underestimate me...

80
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,541
Oh, well.

81
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,708
I'm gonna quit... I'm gonna quit!

82
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,916
I'm gonna quit!

83
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,541
I'm gonna quit today for sure!

84
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:51,208
"What isn't remembered never happened."

85
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:56,041
"Memory is merely a record."

86
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:07,416
"You just need to rewrite that record."

87
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,250
Is that true?

88
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,791
Why are you crying?

89
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,916
Because you deleted yourself
from everyone's memory?

90
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,333
But isn't that what you wanted?

91
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes, but...

92
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:43,000
No one is dying, and no one is being hurt.

93
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,375
And no one hates you.

94
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,375
Yes, but...

95
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:55,333
Dead people's information isn't
leaking out of the Wired anymore.

96
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:05,666
So Lain doesn't need
to be anywhere anymore.

97
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,041
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

98
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,166
You sound just like him.

99
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,291
Him?

100
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,791
That man never existed now.

101
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:21,333
Even if he does, he won't get any
ideas into his head about being God.

102
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:24,250
I'm nowhere now...

103
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,875
If I'm nowhere, who am I?

104
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,375
Where am I?

105
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,625
You yourself said it.

106
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,625
The Wired isn't an
upper layer of the real world.

107
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,083
That's what that man was mistaken about.

108
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,416
A network is a field to pass along information.

109
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,791
Information doesn't stand still there.

110
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:51,458
Information functions by always being in motion.

111
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,416
Really?

112
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:00,583
People's memories aren't just personal
or one part of the history of humanity.

113
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,958
No, not even the shared unconscious.

114
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:09,583
Do you think that humans could
create something that could store...

115
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:13,916
...memory that's that vast?

116
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,333
The Wired was just
connected to something else...

117
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,208
But where was it connected to?

118
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:29,083
Do people really need to know that?

119
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,583
Look at how far they've come without knowing.

120
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:40,750
The human world creates
and prays to its various gods,

121
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,625
and humans convince themselves,
"This is how the world is."

122
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,083
I don't like how you're saying this.

123
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,625
Either way, it's Lain that's saying it. Me.

124
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,500
You understand that, right?

125
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,583
Oh, right... Lain was never a person, was she?

126
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,958
Lain is omnipresent, existing everywhere.

127
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,833
Lain watches quietly.

128
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:18,208
Right, Lain is God!

129
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,458
No...

130
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,750
You're wrong!

131
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,791
It'd be so much easier if you became God.

132
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:30,041
I think it'd be a lot easier than being a human.

133
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,708
You wouldn't have to do anything.
Just stand there and watch.

134
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,583
No one would look down on Lain.

135
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,625
No one would hate Lain.

136
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,958
That's...

137
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:57,458
Hey, Lain... Let's start everything
over again from the beginning!

138
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,958
I mean, you <i>did</i> go and
reset everything, after all...

139
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,625
Stop it!

140
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,458
Then what <i>are</i> you, Lain?

141
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:41,166
I... I...

142
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,666
Where am I?

143
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,708
Come, Lain.

144
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,958
Dad?

145
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:27,041
You don't need to wear that anymore, Lain.

146
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,833
Dad, do you know?

147
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,625
What?

148
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:41,458
I... Everyone, I...

149
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,291
You love them?

150
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,416
Isn't that right?

151
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,416
Lain, I'll make us some nice tea next time.

152
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,458
Hey, with some madeleines!
Definitely. They're great!

153
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,625
So memories aren't
only of the past, <i>are</i> they?

154
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:23,500
They can be of right now, or even of tomorrow...

155
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,500
Unbelievable!

156
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,958
Isn't it? But hang on a second...

157
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:38,333
I listened to what you had to say.

158
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,041
Very patiently, I might add.

159
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:44,125
I get to pick the curtains
for the bedroom, right?

160
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,958
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,166
Anything you say.

162
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,041
All right, then. That's a good student.

163
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,583
Something wrong?

164
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,250
No.

165
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,750
Sorry, could you wait here a minute?

166
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,583
Hey, what're you--

167
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,708
Hello.

168
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,791
Hello.

169
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,416
Have we met before? We <i>have,</i> haven't we?

170
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,416
Did you go to the school
I was a student teacher at?

171
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,666
No, that can't be it...

172
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,500
Let me think...

173
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,708
Pleased to meet you.

174
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,500
Huh?

175
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,833
Pleased to meet you. We haven't met before.

176
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,833
Oh. Well, I'm pleased to meet you, then.

177
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,416
I'm Arisu.

178
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,333
Strange name, huh?
I'm kind of embarrassed about it.

179
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,750
What's yours?

180
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,083
Lain.

181
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,750
Lain...?

182
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:24,625
--A friend of yours?
--No, I thought she was someone else.

183
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,875
Well, goodbye, Lain.

184
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,375
Maybe we'll run into each other again someday.

185
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,583
'Bye.

186
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,333
'Bye, Lain.

187
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,583
You're right. We can see each other anytime.

188
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:16,416
I'm here, so I'll be with you forever.

189
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,708
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

190
00:22:54,791 --> 00:23:07,958
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

191
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:23,250
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

192
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:29,750
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

193
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:36,875
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

194
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:37,875
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

195
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:45,541
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

196
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,916
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

197
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,083
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

198
00:23:56,166 --> 00:24:02,625
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

199
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:08,083
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
