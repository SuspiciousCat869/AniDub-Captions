1
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,125
What are you scared of?

2
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,833
Just try it for a little bit.

3
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,416
"Cyberia?

4
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,083
"Cyberia?
I don't come here because I <i>want</i> to."

5
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,208
"10,000 yen?! What a rip-off!

6
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,000
"10,000 yen?! What a rip-off!
The going price is only around <i>4,000</i> !"

7
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,333
"We call it Accela.

8
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,708
It's not exactly a drug,

9
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:59,750
but you have to jump through
the same kind of hoops to get it."

10
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:57,083
"I feel... accelerated."

11
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:47,750
"Hurry up, come to me."

12
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,125
No, that's not it.

13
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,416
I don't have any mail...

14
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,708
I don't get it...

15
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,416
Oh.

16
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,625
I thought somebody was here.

17
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,166
Who?

18
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,625
Your imaginary friend.

19
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,791
Or something like that.

20
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,125
You're gonna be late again.

21
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,041
Lain!

22
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,833
Good morning.

23
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,333
G-Good morning.

24
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,208
See what I mean? It <i>couldn't</i> have been her.

25
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,291
You think so? But...

26
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,583
What?

27
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,625
Cut it out. I feel sorry for her.

28
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,833
It's nothing. Come on, let's go.

29
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,666
Okay.

30
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,208
But...

31
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,166
Oh, let it go.

32
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,375
Have you gotten any more mail?

33
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,041
Mail?

34
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,708
From Chisa.

35
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,333
Oh, <i>that.</i> No, I haven't gotten any more.

36
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,041
You got that prank mail, too, Lain?

37
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,208
What?

38
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,875
Really?

39
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,583
I was just curious.

40
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,125
Huh?

41
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:51,416
You know, maybe she
<i>does</i> look a little like her...

42
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,500
Lain, what were you doing last night?

43
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,291
Huh?

44
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,250
Yeah, yeah!

45
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,166
Come on, I'm telling you it wasn't her!

46
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,791
I guess not. She doesn't look like her at all.

47
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,833
What?

48
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:12,250
There was a girl at Cyberia last
night who looked <i>just</i> like you, Lain.

49
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,625
Cyberia?

50
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:20,333
We finally worked up the
nerve to go there last night.

51
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,875
Come on, it wasn't such a big deal.

52
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:25,166
Oh, right, <i>you</i> were the
one who was all nervous!

53
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,875
Oh. It's a club. Young people go there at night.

54
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,958
There was a girl there who
looked a little like you, Lain.

55
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,750
Last night, I...

56
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,833
We know. It wasn't you.

57
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,333
We didn't get a good look at her,

58
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,791
but she had on these wild clothes,
and chewed people out left and right.

59
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:55,083
Yeah, it was like she was your total opposite.

60
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,666
But she <i>did</i> look like her...

61
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,625
Hey, I know! Let's take her with us next time!

62
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,125
You want to make sure, huh?

63
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,875
Cut it out! You're just making fun of her.

64
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:13,625
I bet when a girl like Lain goes to
a club, her personality does a 180!

65
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,583
Oh. Maybe Lain would liven up a bit.

66
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,833
Right! Let's go, Lain!

67
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,833
It might be fun.

68
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:27,791
You'd have more fun if you
were a little more sociable, Lain.

69
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,333
Right, Lain?

70
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,625
Accela, a type of smart supplement,

71
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:41,208
uses nano-mechanisms to oscillate
at a specific frequency within the body,

72
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,750
triggering the secretion of a specific hormone.

73
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:50,416
It is said that when secreted,
this hormone affects the time-sense...

74
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
...of the human mind, making it seem
as if one's awareness is accelerated.

75
00:10:56,333 --> 00:11:01,083
Not only the consciousness, but the
workings of the brain itself are altered,

76
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:07,125
multiplying the brain's operational
capacity by two to twelve times.

77
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:13,208
The nano-mechanism itself is destroyed
by digestive juices within 24 hours,

78
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,875
but it is unknown how long its effectiveness...

79
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,666
"Let's have fun at Cyberia tonight!
--From Arisu"

80
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,833
"I'll pass on tonight."

81
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:02,083
"Everyone is connected."

82
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,416
Is this your place?

83
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,333
Great! I have a delivery for you.

84
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:46,416
I'll start unloading it.
Could you get the gate for me?

85
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,375
Could you sign this, please?

86
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,666
This thing is <i>so</i> cool!

87
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,500
Huh?

88
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,500
I wish I had one of these...

89
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,208
Thanks.

90
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,000
All this is yours?

91
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,125
I'm not sure.

92
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,833
Then you don't know what this is?

93
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,041
It's a top of the line Navi!

94
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,125
Fully loaded, too!

95
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:31,208
With this kind of horsepower,
you can move around freely...

96
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:35,666
...without any stress at all, even in the Wired.

97
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,333
I use a home-brew system, myself.
It doesn't hold a candle to this.

98
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:45,833
No, it's not like that. I don't
know anything about it, either.

99
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,041
You will soon enough.

100
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,875
Have a good one.

101
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,166
Your Navi came, right?

102
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,666
Get that mess cleaned up
soon, all right? It's in the way.

103
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:43,166
I'll set it up for you after dinner.

104
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,416
This Navi's good enough that
<i>I'd</i> want to take it for a spin.

105
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,083
Dad...

106
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,416
I want you to set it up now.

107
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,250
Hey, why are you in such a hurry?

108
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,750
Lain...

109
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,416
I'll do it.

110
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:13,916
You can't keep using
that children's Navi forever.

111
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,208
For communication, you need a powerful system...

112
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:23,750
...that will mature alongside
your relationships with people.

113
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,791
Understand, Lain?

114
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,666
Come here.

115
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,000
Register yourself as the machine's user.

116
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,000
Try talking to it.

117
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,208
Hello, Navi.

118
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,583
Now this Navi's yours, Lain.

119
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,375
You can show off to your friends now.

120
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,166
Oops.

121
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,958
Hey, Mika. Something wrong?

122
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,166
Navi, do I have mail?

123
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,791
Lain has no mail.

124
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,125
"Lain, where are you?
Everyone's waiting! You've got to come!"

125
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,541
"Why won't you come?"

126
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:13,625
Okay, turn left at that corner!

127
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,750
Then go straight ahead.

128
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,250
See it?

129
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,333
Yeah.

130
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,958
We're in the basement! Got it?

131
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,083
Hey! You!

132
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,041
You're blocking the stairs.

133
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,333
Sorry.

134
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,250
If you do it <i>that</i> way...

135
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,500
...you'll get spotted by the
Info-Guard Center right off the bat!

136
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,083
What's the big deal? I'd just be attacking it.

137
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,333
Hey, next time we go over
to that game center, let's...

138
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,750
What took you so long, Lain?

139
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:00,375
You're usually in bed now, aren't you, Lain?

140
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,791
Lain, don't you have anything
better to wear out at night?

141
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,166
We'll pick out something a little
more grown-up for you next time, Lain.

142
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,500
You think she'd look good in grown-up clothes?

143
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,916
Reika!

144
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,291
Hey...

145
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,458
What?

146
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,833
I guess the girl we saw really wasn't Lain...

147
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,291
That's what I've been telling you!

148
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,166
Lain doesn't dress like that or talk like that.

149
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,500
She doesn't look like that, either.

150
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:37,166
Did she really look like me?

151
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,666
Yeah! I was <i>positive</i> it was you!

152
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,333
Oh.

153
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,833
What the--?!

154
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,875
He's got a gun!

155
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,041
Help me!

156
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,208
--Juri!
--Juri!

157
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,125
Lain!

158
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:39,375
What's she doing?

159
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,833
--Reika, take care of Juri.
--Arisu?

160
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,500
Arisu!

161
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,458
What're you looking at?

162
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,916
Lain, what're you doing?
Let's get out of here! Hurry!

163
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,583
Lain!

164
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:00,708
Lain! Lain!

165
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,708
Go away!

166
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,625
Why are you making me do this?!

167
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,250
What right do you have?!

168
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:22,708
I just wanted to clear my head, that's all!

169
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,666
I don't know anything about it!
Leave me out of it!

170
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,458
You're that scattered god's--

171
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,291
I don't want anything to do with it! Nothing!

172
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,750
The Wired can't be allowed
to interfere with the real world!

173
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,583
I don't want anything to do with it!

174
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:39,250
Who the hell <i>are</i> you?!

175
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,541
L-Lain...

176
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,791
I don't want anything to do with it...
Don't want anything to do with it...

177
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,208
Don't want... I don't want...
Don't want anything to do with it...

178
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,666
Don't want anything to...

179
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,750
Don't want...

180
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,291
Don't want anything...

181
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,958
Don't want anything to do with it...

182
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,666
Don't want... Don't want
anything to do with it...

183
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,500
I don't want--

184
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,041
No matter where you go,

185
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:09,083
everyone's connected.

186
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:08,541
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

187
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:21,750
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

188
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:37,041
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

189
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:43,541
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

190
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:50,708
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

191
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:51,708
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

192
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:59,375
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

193
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,708
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

194
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:09,875
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

195
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:16,416
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

196
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,875
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
