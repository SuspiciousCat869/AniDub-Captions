1
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:45,208
If people can connect to one another,
even the smallest voice will grow loud.

2
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,416
If people can connect to one another,
even their lives will become longer.

3
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,083
So...

4
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,958
Lain? I'm coming in.

5
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,125
Lain?

6
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,583
Thanks.

7
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:35,166
But I already verified
that register a long time ago.

8
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,916
That's hilarious!

9
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,541
Right...

10
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,833
I can't wait for the
next-gen protocol to come out.

11
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,166
When it does, I could...

12
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:57,333
Why are you guys so nice to me?

13
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,791
No, that's not what I think.

14
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,541
It's just a little strange.

15
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,916
I don't have many friends.

16
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,541
Thanks, Knights.

17
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,333
Yeah, right!

18
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,750
"Connect"

19
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,958
Hard at work studying, I see...

20
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,958
Listen, Lain...

21
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,666
It's like you're going
back to your old self lately.

22
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,041
Come hang out with us again sometime.

23
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:45,000
Life's depressing when
you're alone all the time!

24
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,708
I know, but I'm not alone.

25
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,708
Huh? Who's with you, then?

26
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:51,666
Everybody comes to see me.

27
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,125
No, that's not right...

28
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,000
Maybe I go to see <i>them</i> .

29
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,041
What? The Wired, you mean?

30
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:04,416
A net-pal isn't the same as a real friend.

31
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,166
Reika sure is an old fogey
when it comes to some things, huh?

32
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,125
Yeah, an old fogey!

33
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,916
So what if I am?

34
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,375
Anyway, Lain, what kind of
sites have you been hanging out at?

35
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,666
It's a secret.

36
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,541
Oh, acting high and mighty, huh?

37
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,291
Come on, tell us!

38
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,833
Hey, this'll look good!

39
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,166
No way! You should just give up!

40
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,125
I think <i>this</i> one's better.

41
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:37,166
No way! <i>This</i> one's better! Right, Lain?

42
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,041
Hey, let's go to that store
we went to the other day.

43
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,208
They say they're having a 30-minute
all-you-can-eat ice cream special today.

44
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,166
I'm hungry!

45
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:02,500
Huh?

46
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,958
What? What is it?

47
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,666
What's with that kid?

48
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,916
Beats me.

49
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,250
Come on, let's go!

50
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,083
Let's go, Lain.

51
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,041
Lain, what's--

52
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,708
No <i>way</i> !

53
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,125
What <i>is</i> that?

54
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,083
What the...?

55
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,708
Lain? That's--

56
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,625
You've certainly been coming home early lately.

57
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:03,833
Now it's <i>Lain</i> who's staying out late.

58
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,541
Do you think you'll get
that college recommendation?

59
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,125
Speak of the devil.

60
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,458
A strange phenomenon appeared
in the skies above Tokyo today.

61
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:37,166
People in the area who observed
it report being deeply unnerved by it.

62
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,166
Was this a malicious prank?

63
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,125
Was it merely a natural
phenomenon, or was it a deliberate act?

64
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,666
Hello, Navi.

65
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,291
Hello, Lain.

66
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,833
Connect to Wired.

67
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,041
So you're Lain, huh?

68
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,166
You're somethin' else, to be able
to translate your real world form...

69
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,083
...so well here into the Wired.

70
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,125
Stupid Cheshire Cat wannabe...

71
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:30,250
"Wannabe" nothing. At my
user level, this is the best I can do.

72
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,583
Most people can only manage ears.

73
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,875
I'm <i>way</i> better than them, don't you think?

74
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,250
Shut your hole. Just give me the information.

75
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:44,166
I helped Lain... This is gonna
make me a hero with the local users.

76
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,833
You're more noise than signal...

77
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,791
Tell me about the game that all
the grade-schoolers are playing.

78
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,333
A <i>game</i> ? There's all kinds of kids' games.

79
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,166
Moron.

80
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,250
You've got a hunch that tells you it's a game?

81
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,916
To a kid, anything can be a game.

82
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,458
So you called up the search result...

83
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:11,333
Now I get it. This man might know the answer.

84
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,541
The child-killer scientist.

85
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,166
You live up to your reputation, Lain!
You searched him on your own!

86
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,666
In the real world, he's just an old man
waiting to die in a private hospital ward.

87
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,041
I helped you.

88
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,833
A little.

89
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,875
Ask him about KIDS.

90
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:54,500
I already know. You're not
much of a guide, Cheshire Cat.

91
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:01,166
Now it's <i>your</i> turn, Professor Hodgeson.

92
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,958
Tell me all about it.

93
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,750
You look very lifelike, young lady.

94
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,625
What's "KIDS"?

95
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,625
It's so peaceful here...

96
00:13:53,708 --> 00:14:01,375
I want to relax here until
my body rots in the real world.

97
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,583
You know what's happening, don't you?

98
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,166
What's "KIDS"?

99
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,416
Time passes so beautifully here...
And quietly, as if it will last forever.

100
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,666
Show me the experiment data from
15 years ago, Professor Hodgeson.

101
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:24,750
I never meant to put the children in any danger.

102
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:30,791
I'm not talking about 15 years ago.
The game that all the kids are playing   <i>now</i> ...

103
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:34,333
...it's reproducing your experiment, isn't it?

104
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,250
Somebody dug it out of the trash can.

105
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:42,875
I thought I had erased all the data.

106
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,916
Tell me about the Kensington Experiment.

107
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:57,583
Psi, parapsychological ability,
is present in most children,

108
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,708
although very faint in most.

109
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,875
It's nothing as outrageous as ESP.

110
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:14,708
It's just good intuition, or enough
physical ability to bend a coin.

111
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,375
What're these that are attached to their heads?

112
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,458
We called them Outer Receptors.

113
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,375
That's what receives the Psi.

114
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,500
This is KIDS.

115
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,458
Individually, their Psi may be weak,

116
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,875
but if I could collect their power...

117
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,666
What were you expecting?

118
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,875
Something beyond imagining.

119
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,875
That's what I wanted to see, young lady.

120
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,958
What did you make them do?

121
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:51,125
Science isn't merely about proving hypotheses.

122
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:53,458
That's what I believed.

123
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,500
That's not what I mean...!

124
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,875
So, you didn't give any thought to the children.

125
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,875
As you say.

126
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,458
It was the KID System that converted the weak...

127
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,541
...electromagentic waves of the
brain received by the Outer Receptors,

128
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:14,833
and enhanced the functions
of a specific area of the brain.

129
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,500
That is what KIDS really is.

130
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:32,083
When the children's Psi was combined,
how much energy was generated?

131
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,375
Stop it...

132
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,000
Enough!

133
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,416
I smashed KIDS to pieces so
that it could never be rebuilt.

134
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:58,125
But its schematics found
their way onto the Wired...

135
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,583
...and eventually coalesced somewhere.

136
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:05,500
Someone found them.

137
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,333
And updated it so that it could manifest...

138
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:14,416
...phenomena without Outer Receptors.

139
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,708
If it can influence these new
children to that extent as an <i>emulation</i> ...

140
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,458
...I'm forced to acknowledge their talent.

141
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,291
Is that all you can think about?

142
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,583
You don't care about the children?

143
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,375
No matter how much I punish myself,

144
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:35,708
those children won't return to the real world.

145
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,958
And there's even less that
I can do about this current group.

146
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,500
Talk about self-centered.

147
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,916
So who's using it now?

148
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,583
Young lady...

149
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:53,125
All this talking has worn me out.

150
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,708
It was nice meeting you.

151
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,916
I don't know what you plan to do in the Wired...

152
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,833
...or what sort of being you're trying to become,

153
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:07,000
but you're powerful. Incredibly powerful.

154
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:13,583
If there really <i>is</i> a god here in
the Wired, you're a blessed child.

155
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,000
I... I'm not...

156
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,291
I wonder where the power of the
rogues that run the KIDS emulation...

157
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:26,750
...and this other kind of power come from?

158
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,833
Rogues?

159
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,375
If you'll excuse me, then...

160
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,291
I'm a little tired.

161
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:41,208
My body's time has run out.

162
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:46,166
My wish has come true.

163
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,125
Knights...

164
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,166
Shut up!

165
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:37,041
Who <i>are</i> you people?
Why did you try to tell me all this?

166
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:45,416
Was I just your toy? Is this all a game?

167
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,333
What do you want to use the children for?

168
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,125
Are you just doing it for kicks?

169
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:57,291
You'll do anything if you can
do it and if you think it'll be fun!

170
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,708
Then you're just a bunch of losers!

171
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,875
Aren't you going to speak up?
Isn't anybody going to answer?

172
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,125
Them...!

173
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:03,791
Now I get it!

174
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,541
You!

175
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,333
You're Knights, right?

176
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:33,083
You <i>are,</i> aren't you? You're Knights, right?

177
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:38,333
Please get down.

178
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,458
W-What the hell was that?

179
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:49,125
The coolant system in your room.

180
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:56,791
They must've planted a parasite
bomb in your coolant system.

181
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,000
It almost sounds like
you're saying you didn't do it.

182
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,375
It wasn't us.

183
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,708
Who was it, then?

184
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,625
Who did it?!

185
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,166
The Knights.

186
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:08,833
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

187
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:22,041
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

188
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:37,333
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

189
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:43,833
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

190
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:51,000
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

191
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,000
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

192
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:59,666
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

193
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,000
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

194
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:10,166
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

195
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:16,708
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

196
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:22,166
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
