1
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:45,083
Why? Why won't you come?

2
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,500
I wish you would come here...

3
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,291
Look! Look at that!

4
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,625
"Why you have to do that...

5
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:43,625
...is something you
should figure out for yourself."

6
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,458
Gotcha!

7
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,041
Hey, cut it out!

8
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:58,666
Why?

9
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,791
Don't!

10
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,541
What's the problem? Don't play hard to get!

11
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,583
Come on, let's go someplace happy.

12
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:25,125
"I...

13
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,458
...don't need to stay in a place like this."

14
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,750
What the <i>hell</i> ?

15
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,083
What happened?!

16
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:59,458
W-We don't know anything!
W-We've got nothing to do with this!

17
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,208
--She came outta nowhere...
--Oh, no...

18
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,833
Damn it...

19
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:33,041
"If you stay in a place like this...

20
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,000
...you might not be able to connect."

21
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,541
What a racket...

22
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,583
Can't you be quiet?

23
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:27,166
"Everybody, hurry..."

24
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,916
Juri, don't make such a big deal about it.

25
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,625
Yeah, it's just some stupid prank.

26
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,583
B-But...

27
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,791
It'll be okay.

28
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,791
Lain?

29
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,000
Did you get one, too?

30
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,625
Get what?

31
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,625
Mail!

32
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,291
Mail?

33
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,958
From Chisa Yomoda!

34
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,333
I... I'm not very good with computers.

35
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,583
You should at least check your mail once a day.

36
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,333
Well, it's up to you, I guess.

37
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,958
Lain's such a baby.

38
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,458
Why is she crying?

39
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:38,333
Because she got mail from
Chisa Yomoda, that's why!

40
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,500
Chisa? Who's that?

41
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,125
She was in class D.

42
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,416
She killed herself last week by
jumping off a building in Shibuya.

43
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,375
Come on, the teacher told everybody!

44
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,375
It's not just Juri.

45
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,583
Lots of people have
gotten mail from her this week.

46
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,041
But she's...

47
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:00,916
Right. You shouldn't be
getting mail from a dead girl.

48
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,500
But there it is.

49
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,958
"What's it like when you die?"

50
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,208
"It <i>really</i> hurts! :)"

51
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,791
"Powering up... Working..."

52
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,875
"Just a little longer..."

53
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,333
Log in.

54
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,916
Who are you?

55
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:04,375
Lain. Please say your name.

56
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,041
La-i-n.

57
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,833
Accepted.

58
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,000
You must be Lain.

59
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:19,166
Lain has mail.

60
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,958
From who?

61
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,000
Chisa Yomoda.

62
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,791
Do you wish to read your mail?

63
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,541
"Hello, how are you?"

64
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,250
Hello...

65
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,208
...how are you?

66
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:57,708
Lain, I walked home with you
just once. Do you remember?

67
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:05,083
I have only given up my body.

68
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:11,125
By doing this, I can explain
to you that I am still alive.

69
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,458
I wanted to let you know this,
Lain, so I sent this mail to you.

70
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,791
Do you understand?
It's okay if you can't right now.

71
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:25,291
You will all understand soon. <i>Everyone</i> will.

72
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,500
Why did you die?

73
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:34,583
Rumor at school has it
that this is prank mail,

74
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:39,625
but I want you to know that it isn't, Lain.

75
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,541
Why? Why did you die?

76
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,500
"God is here."
 

77
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,166
"God is here."
God...

78
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,833
...is here.

79
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,500
Huh?

80
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,875
"God..."

81
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:25,833
I ate lunch late today. I'm done.

82
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
Mom?

83
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,541
Yes?

84
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,041
I got mail.

85
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,541
From a girl who killed herself last week.

86
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,916
What is it, Lain?

87
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,208
It's certainly unusual to see you in here.

88
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,458
I...

89
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:05,291
I was wondering if you
could buy me a new Navi...

90
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,000
Finally caught the bug, huh?

91
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:16,375
You're in junior high now.

92
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,041
Your friends are leaving you in the dust, right?

93
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:22,041
I keep telling you that you
should use a better machine.

94
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,708
You know, Lain, in this world,

95
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,958
whether it's here in the
real world or in the Wired,

96
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:40,083
people connect to each other,
and that's how societies function.

97
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:52,291
Even a girl like you can make
friends right off the bat, Lain.

98
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,083
There's nothing to be afraid of.

99
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,875
I wonder why your mother
can't understand that...?

100
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,916
I'm not scared.

101
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,791
But why bring up your Navi all of a sudden?

102
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,833
There's a friend I want to see.

103
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,708
--What happened?
--Damn it...

104
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,083
We apologize for the
inconvenience, ladies and gentlemen.

105
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,375
The train is currently
stopped due to an accident.

106
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,250
What?

107
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,916
Was someone hit?

108
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,916
I can't believe this...

109
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,958
Miss Iwakura.

110
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,666
Miss Iwakura.

111
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,916
Yes, Ma'am.

112
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,708
This will be on the test.

113
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,083
"Come to the Wired as soon as you can."

114
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:25,791
"Come to the Wired as soon as you can."

115
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,000
Chisa...?

116
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,791
Where are you?

117
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,583
Wait!

118
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:11,250
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

119
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:24,458
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

120
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:39,750
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

121
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:46,250
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

122
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:53,416
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

123
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,416
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

124
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:02,083
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

125
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,416
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

126
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:12,583
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

127
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:19,125
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

128
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:24,583
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
