1
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,083
Oh, okay... So <i>that's</i> how it works.

2
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:40,500
I had no idea the world was this simple.

3
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:45,416
I always thought the world
was such a big and scary place,

4
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,583
but once you figure it out, it's all so easy.

5
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,833
See? I told you it would be.

6
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,291
That's terrible, Lain!

7
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't believe you just said that!

8
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,625
Lain...

9
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,208
I know, but it's true!

10
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,875
--That's the first <i>I've</i> heard of it!

11
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,541
--What does it mean?
--That's the first <i>I've</i> heard of it!

12
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,500
--What does it mean?
--Acting all high and mighty again, huh, Lain?

13
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,250
That reminds me, Juri.

14
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,916
What?

15
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:58,666
"You should just rewrite bad memories."

16
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,250
But that's...

17
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,250
"You should just rewrite bad memories."

18
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,583
But that's--

19
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,875
Unbelievable...

20
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,750
Aw, c'mon...!

21
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:23,166
People only have substance
within the memories of others.

22
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,000
That's why there were all kinds of me's.

23
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,250
There weren't a lot of me's,

24
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,208
I was just inside all
sorts of people, that's all.

25
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,000
Really... No kidding?

26
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,833
Come <i>on,</i> Taro, who are you talking to?

27
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,041
W-What's up?

28
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,833
You know, I...

29
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,916
I kissed an angel.

30
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,541
Taro...

31
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:17,250
Lain... Lain...

32
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,541
Lain...

33
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,541
Lain... Lain... Lain...

34
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,333
Lain...

35
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,791
Lain... Lain...

36
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:39,291
Protocol Seven is expected to allow
the seamless sharing of information...

37
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:45,125
...between the Wired and the real world.

38
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,208
And now, the following message...

39
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's all love Lain! Let's all love Lain!

40
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,750
Let's all love... Let's all...
Let's... Let's... Let's...

41
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:03,458
All the functions of the
human body, without exception,

42
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:08,791
can be put into words and
described in materialistic terms.

43
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,041
The body is nothing but a machine.

44
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:16,583
If the physical limitations of the
body restrict mankind's evolution,

45
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,958
it would be as if the fall of
the species called "man"...

46
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:23,458
...had already been decided
by a God that doesn't even exist.

47
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,833
The information etched inside
humans isn't only that which...

48
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,000
...they themselves have acquired as individuals.

49
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,958
This species called man is
connected to his predecessors,

50
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:35,541
and information has accumulated within him.

51
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:41,083
If that information isn't shared,
it's meaningless. Mere <i>data</i> .

52
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:45,083
Mankind can evolve. Evolve by their own power.

53
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:50,541
But to do that, they must
first know what they truly are.

54
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,291
What do you think <i>you</i> are?

55
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,958
Originally, people were connected to each other.

56
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:01,083
All I've done is to make
things as they once were.

57
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,791
That's what you have done, Lain.

58
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,375
So you can do anything you want.

59
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:58,875
I thought you quit smoking.

60
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:07,833
Why is this happening? We did
exactly what we were told to do!

61
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,708
It means that our client wasn't
the only one who thought that...

62
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,166
...those computer geeks playing
"secret society" would be trouble.

63
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,291
What do you mean?

64
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,916
Our client was in contact with Masami Eiri.

65
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:27,375
No, maybe Eiri was behind it all.

66
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,250
Enough about Eiri, okay?

67
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,625
The guy's dead.

68
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,958
He's not dead.

69
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,416
Whether he had a body or not never mattered.

70
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,208
It never mattered.

71
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,416
Are you serious?

72
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,541
Payment for services rendered, huh?

73
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,958
You've been using us, <i>haven't</i> you?!

74
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,666
Interpret it any way you like.

75
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,958
You want us to leave town, huh? And go   <i>where</i> ?

76
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:54,291
I suppose a place with no power
lines that isn't covered by a satellite.

77
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:59,083
There's no place like that
on Earth, and you know it!

78
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:04,250
If you're going to run, you'll
have to find a place like that.

79
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,458
What's going to happen?

80
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,666
What are you planning to do...

81
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,583
...by connecting the Wired to
the real world without any devices?

82
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:23,291
Something wonderful is going to happen.

83
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,125
I'm looking forward to it. Aren't  <i>you</i> ?

84
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,166
What the--?

85
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,833
What's wrong?!

86
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,541
What are you seeing?!

87
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,833
Hey!

88
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,416
"Iwakura"

89
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,708
Lain?

90
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,666
No...!

91
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,958
This is Lain's room?

92
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,333
Lain?

93
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,500
L-Lain!

94
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,083
A... risu?

95
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,666
What did you do?

96
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,291
Nothing.

97
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:07,000
I've just been watching.

98
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:08,750
Watching what?

99
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,416
I... I thought I had gone crazy.

100
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,416
But I didn't!

101
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,583
Lain! Why did you leave only me?

102
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:32,500
Why did you only leave <i>my</i> memories alone?

103
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:37,541
Why do I always have to
remember all those horrible things?!

104
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:42,875
Do you hate me that much, Lain?

105
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,208
I... I can't take this!

106
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,916
No... You've got it all wrong, Arisu.

107
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,208
I didn't want to hurt you.

108
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,125
Liar! Look at what you've done!

109
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,541
But <i>you're</i> okay, aren't you, Arisu?

110
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:10,166
You were my friend, even
without connecting with me, Arisu.

111
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,000
What are you saying?

112
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:18,291
You're my only friend, Arisu.

113
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,000
Even without connecting with me.

114
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,916
"Connecting"? W-What do you mean?

115
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:30,458
Connecting to me... And everyone...

116
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,458
S-Stop!

117
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:35,250
I love you, Arisu.

118
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,458
Do you know what you're saying, Lain?

119
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:43,541
Humans were originally
connected at an unconscious level.

120
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,541
I reconnected them, that's all.

121
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,541
Lain, you...?

122
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,250
I don't do anything.

123
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,333
It doesn't matter which is
real, this side or the other...

124
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,666
I was in both.

125
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,291
I'm a program designed
to destroy the barrier...

126
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,583
...between the Wired and the real world.

127
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,416
You're a <i>program</i> , Lain...?

128
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,666
You and everyone else,
Arisu, you're just applications.

129
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,958
The truth is, you don't <i>need</i> bodies.

130
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,833
You're wrong.

131
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,750
I don't really understand what
you're saying, but I think you're wrong.

132
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:58,083
Your body's cold, but you're alive, Lain.

133
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,250
Mine, too. See?

134
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:14,583
See? My heart...

135
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,291
...it's beating.

136
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,083
Beating... Beating...

137
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,541
But why? Why's it beating like that?

138
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,666
Because I'm scared.
It's pounding because I'm scared.

139
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,625
But you're smiling, Arisu.

140
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, I guess I am. But I'm scared.

141
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,583
I've always been scared. I wonder why?

142
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,541
I wonder why?

143
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,333
Because she's afraid of losing her body.

144
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,583
All sensations are caused
by impulses in the brain.

145
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,583
You just need to block the unpleasant impulses.

146
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:57,166
Select only the happy, pleasant ones.

147
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,166
Really?

148
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,958
Lain? Who are you talking to?

149
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:08,083
If you really love her, why
don't you connect with her?

150
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,500
I'm not sure.

151
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,208
Lain? Who are you talking to?

152
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,916
Lain!

153
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,833
You must have a bug.

154
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:21,708
Very well. I'll take my time and
give you a thorough debugging.

155
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,583
Come, Lain.

156
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:38,250
What I don't understand is <i>you</i> , God.

157
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,666
Y-You're... talking to <i>God</i> ?

158
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,083
What don't you understand, Lain?

159
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:52,208
What you did was to
remove devices from the Wired.

160
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,291
Phones... Television... The network...

161
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,250
Without those, you couldn't have done anything.

162
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:05,833
Yes. Those are things which
accompanied human evolution.

163
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,666
Humans who are further evolved than others...

164
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,916
...have a right to greater abilities.

165
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,916
Who gave you those rights?

166
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:24,791
The program that inserted
code synched to the Earth's...

167
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,041
...characteristic frequency
into the Protocol Seven code,

168
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,166
which would raise the collective
unconscious to the conscious level.

169
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,666
Did you really come up
with the idea by yourself?

170
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,500
What are you getting at?

171
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,333
No, it can't be... It can't be!

172
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,958
Are you telling me
that there really <i>is</i> a God?!

173
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,833
It doesn't matter.
With no body, you can't understand.

174
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:59,916
It's a lie! I... I'm omnipotent!

175
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I gave you a body here in the real world!

176
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,125
You were omnipresent, scattered
through the Wired! I gave you an ego!

177
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,791
You mean to say--

178
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:13,458
If that's true of me, what about <i>you</i> ?

179
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:17,291
I'm different! I--

180
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,958
The Wired isn't an
upper layer of the real world.

181
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,541
What do you mean?

182
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,458
Inside the Wired, you were God, all right.

183
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,541
But what about <i>before</i>
the Wired was created?

184
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,875
You're just an acting God,
standing in for someone...

185
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:51,250
...who was waiting for the
Wired to reach its current state.

186
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,208
An "acting" God?!

187
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,541
That can't be!

188
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,583
Arisu!

189
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,083
A body doesn't mean anything to you, right?

190
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,333
No!

191
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:07,916
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

192
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:21,125
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

193
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:36,416
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

194
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,916
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

195
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,083
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

196
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,083
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

197
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:58,750
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

198
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

199
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:09,250
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

200
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:15,791
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

201
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:21,250
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
