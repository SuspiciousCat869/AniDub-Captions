1
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:13,125
God is the one and only truth.

2
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,833
Yes. Me.

3
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,541
Isn't that right, Lain?

4
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,750
You're God?

5
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes. I'm God.

6
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:08,333
Why are <i>you</i> God? I don't understand.

7
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,458
You're dead, aren't you? A dead <i>human</i> .

8
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,708
Somebody like that can't be God, can they?

9
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:27,583
I realized that I had no need for a body.

10
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:32,083
To die is merely to abandon the flesh.

11
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,875
That's... That's just what Chisa said.

12
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,375
"I don't need to stay here."

13
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,125
I suppose she did, at that.

14
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:53,458
I caused the protocol that
governs the Wired to evolve.

15
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,041
Yeah. That's what you did.

16
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,166
But a protocol is just an agreement.

17
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:09,166
Yes, but I incorporated code
that operates on a higher phase.

18
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,833
So?

19
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,458
There is compressed
information mixed into the protocol.

20
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,375
What kind of information?

21
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,500
Human memories. <i>Mine</i> .

22
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:31,416
The thoughts, history, memories, and
emotions of the man named Masami Eiri.

23
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,833
What does that mean?

24
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,208
I can live forever as an
anonymous entity in the Wired,

25
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,708
and will be able to rule it with information.

26
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,416
What do you think a being
like that should be called?

27
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,791
A god.

28
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,958
There is no God.

29
00:05:56,458 --> 00:06:01,416
Yes. Even if I were an omnipresent
being and could influence others,

30
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,166
with no one to worship me, I'm no god.

31
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,708
But you had them.
Or <i>made</i> them, I should say.

32
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,083
Knights.

33
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:34,125
You no longer need a body, Lain.

34
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,375
That's a lie!

35
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,083
Talk about <i>lame</i> !

36
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,958
Some people are like that, I guess.

37
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,625
So I said, go ahead and do it.

38
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,916
Anyway...

39
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,166
--Hey, look at this!
--Isn't it <i>cute</i> ?

40
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,000
It was really cheap!

41
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:16,041
--At that place next door?
--Yeah, over there!

42
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,916
--Let's go, let's go!
--Today?

43
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,583
Sure, we don't have
anything after school today.

44
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,208
Hey, you're right.

45
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go!

46
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,000
Stand!

47
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:41,791
Bow!

48
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,333
All right, close your books.

49
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,750
I... I'm real...!

50
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm alive...!

51
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,041
I'm here.

52
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:26,375
Why is this happening?

53
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,000
Was it something I did?

54
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:33,833
I always tried to keep
something like this from happening.

55
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:39,000
I always tried not to say anything weird.

56
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,583
Can it be true...?

57
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:46,041
I'm not supposed to have a body?

58
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,583
That's right, Lain.

59
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,958
You're not needed in the real world.

60
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,291
I'm home.

61
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:22,791
Dad...?

62
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:26,583
This is goodbye, Miss Lain.

63
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,625
You must have figured it out
by now. Our work here is finished.

64
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,875
It was only for a short time, but
I know I didn't do enough for you.

65
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,833
You're now free to become anything you want.

66
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:46,625
No, you were free all along.

67
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:53,208
I wasn't given permission to
say goodbye, but I loved you.

68
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not that I enjoyed playing house...

69
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:06,708
Maybe I envied a being like you.

70
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,416
Goodbye.

71
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,625
Wait!

72
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,416
Don't leave me alone!

73
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:26,958
Alone? You're not alone.

74
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:34,166
If you connect to the Wired,
everyone will welcome you.

75
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,500
That's the sort of being you were.

76
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,250
I'm not alone.

77
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,208
Do you want to do anything, Lain?

78
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,416
This is your world, Lain.

79
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:29,625
Who are the Knights? They're the
ones who made the fake me, right?

80
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,875
I'm not sure.

81
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,625
No, it's possible.

82
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,791
They say you can trace the origin of the...

83
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:38,625
...Knights of the Eastern Calculus
back to the Knights Templar.

84
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,791
They've used that invisible human
network, the collective unconscious,

85
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:47,000
since long before the Wired was born.

86
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,583
What do you want to do, Lain?

87
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,041
Knights...

88
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,791
Who are the Knights?

89
00:13:56,875 --> 00:14:00,750
You really want to know, don't you, Lain?

90
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:06,625
The Wired's God is a god
because He has worshippers.

91
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,791
Hey, Taro... Let's go someplace else.

92
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,750
This place has gotten boring.

93
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,833
Yeah. Why not come over to my house?

94
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,291
You don't need to come, Masayuki.

95
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:47,958
What's the big idea?

96
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:52,333
Taro says he doesn't wanna
hang out with a little kid like you.

97
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,875
Wha--?

98
00:14:53,958 --> 00:14:56,250
You're as much a kid as I am, Myu-Myu!

99
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:02,583
It's okay for a girl! Everybody
knows that younger is better for girls.

100
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,208
Right, Taro?

101
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,833
What's that?

102
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:10,666
What's up, Taro? Is there
something on the Net News?

103
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,791
It's a list.

104
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:14,458
Huh? What kind of list?

105
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:19,583
What's a list of Knights
members doing on the Net News...?

106
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,875
Y-Yes?

107
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,458
Please remain silent.

108
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,250
W-Who are you?

109
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,875
Time to pay the piper, all right?

110
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,750
W-What do you mean?

111
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,875
Mom, I got killed!

112
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,083
Mom!

113
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:32,625
It's your turn, Mom! If you don't
hurry up, I'm gonna keep playing!

114
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,791
Okay, Mom?

115
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:39,041
I'm gonna take 'em out!

116
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,208
A series of suicides occurred
today all over the world,

117
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,916
and each country's
Information Control Ministry...

118
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,833
...and police departments have
begun investigating the cause.

119
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:56,458
Each victim was involved
in network-related work,

120
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,833
and sources tell us that it
appears that they were all members...

121
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:01,916
...of a fraternal order known as the "Knights."

122
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,875
Why did you do it?

123
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,916
It was a request from our client.

124
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You hunted down all the Knights in the world.

125
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,833
Our associates are now on
their way to dispose of them.

126
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,958
But why...?

127
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,875
The Wired can't be
allowed to be a special world.

128
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:19,958
It can only be a field that functions as
a sub-system to reinforce the real world.

129
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,458
But still...

130
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:26,958
You can't be allowed to
exist in the Wired, either.

131
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,500
But here you are, safe and sound.

132
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:35,791
Some god or whatever must be protecting you.

133
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,208
Masami Eiri's residual thought program...

134
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,291
...will eventually be
disinfected from the Wired.

135
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:51,791
Our client is working on a total
rewrite of the Protocol Seven code.

136
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,958
We have no need for gods.

137
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,666
Right. Not in the Wired <i>or</i> in the real world.

138
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:22,458
We still haven't figured out what you are.

139
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,958
But I love you.

140
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:39,166
Love certainly is a strange emotion, isn't it?

141
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,541
What will you do?

142
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,958
Well, let me think...

143
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:19,250
You don't have anyone to pray to you now.

144
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:26,541
I can't be a god, then.
But I haven't lost <i>all</i> of them.

145
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:32,000
If only one believer
remains, I can still be a god.

146
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,125
Who?

147
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:38,125
Come, now... <i>You,</i> Lain.

148
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:45,791
It's because of me that you can stay yourself.

149
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,833
You were originally born in the Wired.

150
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:55,541
The legend of the Wired.
The heroine of the Wired's fairy tales.

151
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,458
Liar.

152
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:08,041
The real world's Lain Iwakura
is merely a hologram of her.

153
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,666
A homunculus of artificial ribosomes.

154
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,583
You never had a body to begin with.

155
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,625
That's a lie.

156
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:25,083
A fake family. Fake friends.
Yes, it was all a lie.

157
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,083
That's a lie...

158
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,250
That's all a lie...

159
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:40,000
Poor Lain... She's all alone.

160
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,875
But I'm here. The man
who loves you is here.

161
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:49,666
You should be able to love me,
the man who sent you to this world...

162
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,875
I am your creator.

163
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,166
Love me.

164
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,958
All right, Lain?

165
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,375
The other...

166
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,125
The other me, she's...

167
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:13,833
That isn't <i>another</i> you. It's the <i>real</i> you.

168
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,916
Like it matters!

169
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:08,750
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

170
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:21,958
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

171
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:37,250
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

172
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:43,750
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

173
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:50,916
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

174
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,916
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

175
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,583
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

176
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:00,916
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

177
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:10,083
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

178
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:16,625
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

179
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:22,083
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
