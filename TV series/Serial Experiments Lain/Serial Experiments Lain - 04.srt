1
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:46,125
I don't need parents. Humans are all alone.

2
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,416
They're not connected to anyone at all.

3
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,958
How did it go?

4
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,958
Lain's acting funny.

5
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,333
It's nothing new, but still...

6
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,958
No, it's perfectly normal.

7
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,958
Huh? What're you talking about?

8
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,833
Mika, watch your tone with your father.

9
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,166
Is she right?

10
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,625
Yes.

11
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,625
Shit! Shit!

12
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,791
Shit!

13
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,541
Shit! Shit!

14
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you <i>want</i> ?!

15
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,041
What's going on?!

16
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,958
Shit! Shit!

17
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,375
Gotcha.

18
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:05,416
We have homeroom next hour, right?
Is that lucky, or what?

19
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,125
Don't you think it's strange that
they called a special staff meeting?

20
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,833
Do you think it's true, then?

21
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,500
What?

22
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:19,125
They say a high school
senior committed suicide.

23
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,041
S-Suicide?

24
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,125
It's not just at our school, either.

25
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,958
Somebody jumped off the roof of
their apartment building a while ago, too.

26
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,958
Hey, Lain.

27
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,208
Sorry. What is it?

28
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:44,333
I guess Lain wouldn't know anything about it...

29
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,625
The suicide, you mean?

30
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,625
You <i>know</i> about that?

31
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,041
Really?

32
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:52,750
I've just heard a little about it, that's all.

33
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,416
Where?

34
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,708
The Wired.

35
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,958
Right, you must've gotten the
hang of your new Navi by now.

36
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,125
You'll have to show it to me sometime.

37
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,625
Sure. But I'm modifying it a little right now.

38
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:10,958
Modifying it? I didn't know
you were into that hacky stuff.

39
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:16,125
You know, you've changed lately.

40
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:20,291
Really? You think so?

41
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,666
She has?

42
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,208
Yeah. I can't put my finger on it.

43
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,666
So, what sort of rumors
have you heard in the Wired?

44
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,083
Well... That it's some kind of game.

45
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,041
A game? A network game, you mean?

46
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,875
I don't really know. I don't play those.

47
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,166
But they say that all the
dead kids were hooked on it.

48
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,416
Guys sure like that stuff...

49
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,000
A game, huh? But why?

50
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,666
I...

51
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,666
Hey, don't wolf down
food like that! You'll choke!

52
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,125
I'm okay.

53
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,333
You mind if I go home?

54
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,250
Hey, you don't need to ask
our permission or anything.

55
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,833
You have plans?

56
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,375
I want to get home and
put my Navi back together.

57
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,583
It's still in bits and pieces.

58
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,875
You prefer a machine to your friends, huh?

59
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,250
Cut it out, Juri! Don't talk like that!

60
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,041
I'm not accusing her of anything.

61
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:25,250
Once you're done, you'll have to show us, Lain.

62
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,833
Sure.

63
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,083
Sorry.

64
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,208
She <i>has</i> changed.

65
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,541
I'm sorry!

66
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,625
Here.

67
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,583
No, it was my fault.

68
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,000
Sorry!

69
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,208
Log in. Lain.

70
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,250
Authorized.

71
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,083
Mail.

72
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:26,833
Voice mail.

73
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:29,333
Hello, Lain.

74
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:33,208
I couldn't figure out the answer
to your question by myself,

75
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,208
so I asked a colleague at the lab about it.

76
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:41,375
If that really <i>is</i> a Psyche
processor that you have,

77
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:47,583
then you should probably set the
oscillation to "variable" like you thought.

78
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:52,166
Navi motherboards are designed
to work with just about anything,

79
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,250
but you might run into some glitches.

80
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,791
Good luck.

81
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,250
If you need anything else, just ask.

82
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,041
JJ!

83
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,708
Yeah?

84
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,916
You know anything about that net
game that all the kids are playing?

85
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,875
Oh, you mean Phantoma?

86
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,958
Forget about it. An adult
like you wouldn't be into that.

87
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,833
Right, Lain?

88
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,000
No way...

89
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,958
Damn, are my ears playing tricks on me already?

90
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,458
I... I quit already!

91
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,500
Leave me out of it!

92
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,541
This isn't the Wired!

93
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,000
Why? Why is this happening?!

94
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,500
Wait, don't run.

95
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:40,166
Who <i>are</i> you?!

96
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,791
Are you a PK, too? Help me!

97
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,041
I can't go where you are.

98
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,208
What's going on?!

99
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,083
Stop screwing around!

100
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,708
Bullet charge! Gauge 5!

101
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,000
Die!

102
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,916
Die! Die!

103
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,958
Die!

104
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,625
Die! Die!

105
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,291
Die!

106
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,416
Die!

107
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,250
Die! Die!

108
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,583
Die! Die! Die!

109
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,250
Die!

110
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:58,791
I was scared, that's all.

111
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:05,708
I didn't know it was just
a little girl. It's not my fault.

112
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,666
I didn't even know her.

113
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,083
Phantoma is a game with a
dedicated client application...

114
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:19,041
...that lets you fight in the Wired.

115
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:25,458
I downloaded the app from an
illegal server to play it a little while ago.

116
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:32,375
For us, it had a dungeon-style
action game interface,

117
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,791
but I guess it had somehow gotten linked...

118
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,541
...to a tag game played by kindergartners.

119
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:49,000
You have mail.

120
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,666
Open it.

121
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,583
Hey, Lain. I didn't know you
were into stuff like Phantoma.

122
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,416
I checked around, but didn't find out much.

123
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,708
Anyway, the basic game isn't
all that unusual in the Wired,

124
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,708
so my guess is that they just modified that.

125
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:14,708
The problem is the part that lets
the programs connect to each other.

126
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,333
It looks like there's some
kind of weird hole in the protocol.

127
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,583
My buddies and I think that this
may be the work of the Knights, too.

128
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,625
Knights...

129
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,291
Lain?

130
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:40,916
Looks like you and the Wired
are getting along just fine now.

131
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,583
Yeah.

132
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,916
Let me give you one little warning.

133
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,625
Huh?

134
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,583
When it's all said and done, the Wired...

135
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,250
...is just a medium for communication
and the transfer of information.

136
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:58,625
You mustn't confuse it with the real world.

137
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,958
Do you understand what I'm warning you about?

138
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,541
You're wrong.

139
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,208
Huh?

140
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:18,666
The border between the two isn't all that clear.

141
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,958
I'll be able to enter it soon.

142
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:32,791
In full range. Full motion.
I'll translate myself into it.

143
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:37,500
Even with a top of the line
civilian Navi, you couldn't...

144
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,791
I can do it. I've modified mine.

145
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,541
A Psyche processor, huh?

146
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,333
But...

147
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,958
Don't worry. I'm still me.

148
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,000
Sometimes I wonder.

149
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:22,583
I waited for you for hours!

150
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,708
Why? Why didn't you come?!

151
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:34,750
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

152
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
Damn you!

153
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,875
This mail is a message of happiness!

154
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:49,791
By receiving this, you'll
be happier than anyone else!

155
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:54,500
In other words, the Knights
do not physically exist,

156
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,875
but are rather thought itself
that occurs within the Wired.

157
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:03,583
They can be thought of as a religion
that is spreading through the Wired.

158
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,666
Would you go out with me?

159
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,583
If you already have a boyfriend, I apologize.

160
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:15,500
If you love him, I'll give up on you. But if...

161
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:22,958
Please browse code: J946@5488AA97464.

162
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:28,666
Whoever gets this mail,
please help me, whoever you are.

163
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,625
You may not believe this,
but I'm always being followed.

164
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:44,333
Lain, why won't you come here?

165
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:37,541
Go away.

166
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,791
Go away!

167
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,708
Intruder interrupted.

168
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:11,291
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

169
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:24,500
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

170
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:39,791
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

171
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:46,291
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

172
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:53,458
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

173
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:54,458
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

174
00:23:54,541 --> 00:24:02,125
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

175
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,458
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

176
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:12,625
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

177
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:19,166
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

178
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,625
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
