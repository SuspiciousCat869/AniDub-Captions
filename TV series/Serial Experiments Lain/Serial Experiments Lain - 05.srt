1
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,125
If you can hear it, it is speaking to you.

2
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:53,333
And if you can <i>see</i> it, then it is your...

3
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:06,833
Mankind is a creature that
no longer evolves, is it not?

4
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:11,125
Compared to other animals, the
cancer rate in man is exceedingly small.

5
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:17,375
One theory says that man is a
neoteny, and is no longer able to evolve.

6
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:23,583
If this is true, then what an absurd
creature man has evolved into.

7
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:27,958
Not knowing what it is that drives them,

8
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,875
they keep their bodies merely
to satisfy the desires of the flesh.

9
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,291
They're worthless, don't you think?

10
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,875
That's all mankind is.

11
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,375
But it is no longer necessary to
remain a wretched human being.

12
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:56,333
Mankind has finally created
an exit whereby he may escape.

13
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,458
What do you mean?

14
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:05,250
The network. The Wired, Lain.

15
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,416
Who <i>are</i> you?

16
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,875
I'm God.

17
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,750
Wanna go get something to eat?

18
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,583
Hey, aren't you hungry?

19
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,416
Hey, wanna go to the pool next time?

20
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,625
Oh, man...

21
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,833
Tell me a story!

22
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,250
Come on, please!

23
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,791
Tell me a story, okay?

24
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:57,291
What kind of story would you like to hear, Lain?

25
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,500
Let's see...

26
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,583
Something I don't know about!

27
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,250
There is nothing that you don't know.

28
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,666
I can't tell you a story that doesn't exist.

29
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,541
You understand, don't you?

30
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,666
Well, how about this, then?

31
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,708
For every event, there is first a prophecy.

32
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,708
An event first comes into
existence when there is a prophecy.

33
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,666
Who? Who makes the prophecies?

34
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:46,625
Throughout Tokyo today, the VTCZX road
traffic information transmission system...

35
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,708
...sent out incorrect information.

36
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:54,291
Especially at congested intersections,
traffic signals interfered with the...

37
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:59,125
...auto-drive program in cars and
trucks, sending them out of control.

38
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,708
There was a fatality in Shibuya, Tokyo,

39
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,125
but the Information Ministry says
that the system is already back up,

40
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,041
and that such an accident
will never happen again.

41
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,458
Excuse me.

42
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,875
Huh?

43
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,541
Uh...

44
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,583
Mind if I hit on you?

45
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,041
Oh, shit...

46
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,458
Later!

47
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,041
H-Hey!

48
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,791
That little creep...

49
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:27,291
Damn it, this is gonna stain...

50
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:36,416
"The other side is overcrowded.
The dead will have nowhere to go."

51
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,166
W-What the heck is <i>this</i> ?

52
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,375
Some kind of bad joke...

53
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,833
What the hell...?

54
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:52,875
What's she doing?

55
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,958
Is she crazy?

56
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,125
Lain?

57
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,208
What's her problem?

58
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:03,333
The prophecy is being fulfilled, Lain.

59
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,916
But then it's not a prophecy...

60
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,083
No, it <i>is</i> a prophecy.

61
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:12,708
History is not merely a
linear collection of points that...

62
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,625
...we pass through on a timeline.

63
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,458
They are connected by a line.

64
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:25,125
No, perhaps it is more accurate to
say that they are <i>made</i> to connect.

65
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,416
By who? Who connects them?

66
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,583
Lain!

67
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,083
What did you do?

68
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:08,333
I had no idea. I guess you're pretty good.

69
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:12,458
I didn't know you could pull
off a hacky stunt like that already.

70
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,875
What're you talking about?

71
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,291
Playing innocent again, huh?

72
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,416
I really don't...

73
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,250
You didn't do it, Lain?

74
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,625
Do what?

75
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:31,041
The Information Control Bureau
of the Information Ministry...

76
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,916
...began investigating yesterday's
information network abnormality,

77
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,958
stating that it was
very likely a deliberate act.

78
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:43,000
With the network now a lifeline
for not only the city, but for society,

79
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:46,333
such an act is tantamount to...

80
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,291
Your total is 948 yen.

81
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,333
Out of 948 yen. Please, enjoy your meal.

82
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,666
Huh? There it is again.

83
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,166
Again?

84
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,125
What?

85
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,583
Spam. Indiscriminate mail.

86
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,041
I'm really getting tired of this...

87
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,625
"Fulfill the prophecy," right?

88
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,625
Is it a declaration of war by some cult group?

89
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:27,833
I asked some geeks I met on
the Wired about it a while ago.

90
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,250
They said it might be the Knights.

91
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,000
Knights? Who's that?

92
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:36,083
Some kind of super-hacker group.

93
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:40,333
But I thought hackers
don't usually work together.

94
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:46,250
True. But maybe this Knights
group really isn't a group at all.

95
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:52,250
They say they have a lot of power in
the Wired, and that they do a lot in secret.

96
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,958
So they're a secret society.

97
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,625
Geez, do they get their kicks out of this stuff?

98
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,083
I'm not sure why...

99
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,750
Huh?

100
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:08,375
...but something tells me that
they're not in it for fun or for money.

101
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:29,916
It's reasonable to see the Wired
as an upper layer of the real world.

102
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,041
In other words, physical
reality is nothing but a hologram...

103
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,041
...of the information that
flows through the Wired.

104
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,041
Mom?

105
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,458
This is because the body--the
activity of the human brain--is merely...

106
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:51,791
...a physical phenomenon caused by
synapses delivering electrical impulses.

107
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,250
I...

108
00:13:53,333 --> 00:14:01,750
The body exists only to
verify one's own existence.

109
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:05,750
Are you... Are you really my mom?

110
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,541
Are you?

111
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,291
Lain?

112
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,250
Huh?

113
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,625
Didn't I see you at Shibuya?

114
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,916
Forget it. It's nothing.

115
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,625
Thank you!

116
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,958
Hey, don't you think he's pretty cute?

117
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,250
How did it go with him?

118
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,625
Come on, you can tell us!

119
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:03,791
"Fulfill the prophecy!"

120
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,083
W-What? <i>What</i> prophecy?!

121
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,166
What's going on?

122
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,000
I usually have dinner with
Mom and Dad about now...

123
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,791
Wha--

124
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,333
What's happening?

125
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,333
I-Is someone there?

126
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,291
Come on, I know you're there.

127
00:18:52,625 --> 00:19:00,250
"Fulfill the prophecy!"

128
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,583
Are you my real dad?

129
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:26,166
It may be that what flows through the
Wired isn't merely electrical information.

130
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
Huh?

131
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,125
If we assume that it was the
development of electricity and phones...

132
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,208
...that brought about
the formation of the Wired,

133
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:40,083
then I have to wonder if another
world was created at that moment.

134
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,500
Uh...

135
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:46,166
Here in the real world,
God exists only as a concept.

136
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,666
But in the Wired, there may be
a sort of Deus-like embodiment.

137
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,333
God?

138
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,916
I don't know whether or
not it should be called a god.

139
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,583
But at the very least,
I think it has the same kind...

140
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,916
...of power that is written of in myths.

141
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,375
I think I may have talked with God.

142
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,416
It's possible that the Deus of the
Wired may already have enough power...

143
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,875
...to affect the real world in some instances.

144
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,458
Yes... In the form of prophecy.

145
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,500
Prophecy?

146
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,666
What's wrong?

147
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,041
It's nothing. Forget about it.

148
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,208
Who is it today?

149
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:09,208
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

150
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:22,416
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

151
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:37,708
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

152
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:44,208
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

153
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:51,375
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

154
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,375
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

155
00:23:52,458 --> 00:24:00,041
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

156
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,375
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

157
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:10,541
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

158
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:17,083
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

159
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:22,541
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
