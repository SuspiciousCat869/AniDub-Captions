1
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,458
Do you want to be hurt, too?

2
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:47,708
Do you want your heart to feel
like it's being scraped with a rasp?

3
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,500
If you do, don't look away, whatever you do.

4
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,583
Nobody knows if there is or not.

5
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:18,583
It doesn't matter to the
user if God exists in the Wired.

6
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,500
Just a second, Lain.

7
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,083
Let me take out this guy first.

8
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:30,625
What's so fun about this?
All you do is kill other players.

9
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:35,791
Nobody knows <i>what's</i> fun and <i>why</i> .

10
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:45,583
"Tachibana General Laboratories"
was written on the door plate.

11
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,375
A company as big as Tachibana
General Labs wouldn't do anything illegal.

12
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,083
I've heard some rumors, though...

13
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,916
Rumors?

14
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,666
Do you know how we're able to
exchange information in the Wired like this?

15
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,958
Oh, so you're testing me, huh?

16
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,625
You're talking about the IP.

17
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875
Sorry. You're right.

18
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,750
We aren't usually aware
of the protocol's existence.

19
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:29,666
But the current 6th-gen protocol
has reached its data throughput limit.

20
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,375
The 7th-gen protocol...

21
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,416
Yes. The 7th-gen protocol.

22
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,750
Big companies are the ones that're
making it into the new infrastructure.

23
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:45,666
To control the protocol is to
control the economy of the Wired.

24
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,291
I hear there's constant
sabotage attempts going on.

25
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,958
And the party behind it is...

26
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,583
Tachibana General Labs.

27
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,708
Sis?

28
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:34,041
Mom? Dad?

29
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,708
I...

30
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:43,958
A while ago, somebody asked me something.

31
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:49,708
"Are you Lain Iwakura?
Are your parents really your parents?"

32
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,125
Isn't that funny?

33
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,625
It's funny, isn't it?

34
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,541
People say the funniest things, huh?

35
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,208
Right?

36
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,666
--Good morning!
--'Morning!

37
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,083
Arisu...

38
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,750
Good morning.

39
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,041
W-What's wrong?

40
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,750
I don't believe it, but...

41
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:14,750
W-What?

42
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,291
Lain... You didn't do it, right?

43
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:21,000
D-Didn't do what?

44
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,583
She's just playing innocent!

45
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,791
Reika! You don't know that!

46
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,125
Lain, seriously... It wasn't you?

47
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,708
What... are you talking about?

48
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,375
Lain, in the Wired, did you...

49
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,750
No, forget about it.
It couldn't have been you, Lain.

50
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,791
I trust you. Okay?

51
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,458
Arisu...!

52
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,291
Arisu!

53
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:00,791
It's too dangerous.
Avoid approving any more bills.

54
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:05,583
I can't believe it! How can such a
nice guy be into such weird stuff?

55
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,583
There's an extremely serious bug in Protocol 6.

56
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,750
Damage caused by this may
prove disastrous in the Wired...

57
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,750
Every night, a small, child-like person in a...

58
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,000
red and green striped
sweater appears in her room...

59
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,333
When she was in high school,
that pop singer hit someone...

60
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,791
...with her boyfriend's car and fled the scene!

61
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,708
It's gotta be true! I heard it firsthand!

62
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,708
That building's a famous haunted spot.

63
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,333
If you look at a terminal at night,

64
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,708
internal mail shows up,
but there's nobody there!

65
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,791
The Knights don't exist! Some
American students started it as a joke!

66
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,291
Shut up! Who cares about any of that?

67
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,500
Don't you find it interesting?

68
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,333
Who's there?

69
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,166
You're looking for me, aren't you?

70
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,625
So God makes His grand entrance, huh?

71
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,958
How do you define "God"?

72
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,416
If it's the creator of the world, that's not me.

73
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,833
The all-powerful ruler of the world?
You give God too much credit.

74
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,333
Where are you?

75
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,833
But if you define God as one who
exists everywhere in that other world...?

76
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:16,458
If that's what you mean, then yes.
I suppose you could call me that.

77
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:20,583
I have only a slight influence on
the workings of the world, however.

78
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
Who the hell <i>are</i> you?!

79
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,250
I am you.

80
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:30,958
You must have realized that another
you has always existed here in the Wired.

81
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,958
You are merely a hologram of that other you.

82
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,125
You are just a body.

83
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,958
You... expect me to believe that?

84
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:45,833
That's impossible. It's crazy.

85
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,791
But you don't think that
the you in the real world...

86
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:53,333
...is the same as the one
standing here in the Wired, do you?

87
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:57,458
But I'm me...

88
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,041
"Lain is a Peeping Tom."

89
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:38,291
"Peeping Tom"

90
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,750
Arisu?

91
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,625
Arisu? Where are you?

92
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,000
"Don't worry about the rumors! Don't worry about it!"
Arisu? Where are you?

93
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,083
Arisu?

94
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,250
Arisu!

95
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,958
Arisu! Where are you?

96
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,625
Arisu!

97
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,166
Arisu, where are you? Arisu!

98
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,125
What did I do?

99
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,208
What did I do in the Wired?

100
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,541
What's the other me doing?

101
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:19,250
"Don't worry about the rumors!
Don't worry about it!"

102
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:14,041
Is it all right for you to
do this with a teacher?

103
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,291
N-No, it's not...

104
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,875
Why do it, then?

105
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:22,208
Because... I want to.

106
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:53,708
"Hey, do you know who Arisu Mizuki likes?"

107
00:15:56,416 --> 00:16:00,625
"Do you know who she's thinking
of when she plays with herself?"

108
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,041
It <i>was</i> you who told everyone?
The rumors were true?!

109
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,041
Lain!

110
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:16,000
You've been sitting there quietly,
watching me all along?!

111
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:21,375
You saw what I didn't want anybody to know!
When I didn't want anybody to see!

112
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:22,916
And when I...

113
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,083
Tell me it isn't true, Lain!

114
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,250
Lain!

115
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,916
You...

116
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,708
Who <i>are</i> you?

117
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,625
You're not me.

118
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,416
I'd never do what you do.

119
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,041
I...

120
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:35,708
Stop it! Why are you acting
like the part of me that I hate?

121
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,791
You...

122
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,458
I'm committing suicide!

123
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,166
Why? Why are you warm?

124
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,750
Why do I have to feel your body heat?

125
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,583
Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?

126
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,791
No!

127
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,958
You're wrong!

128
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,500
What <i>are</i> these things?

129
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,333
They're all you.

130
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:38,041
I said that you've always
existed in the Wired, didn't I?

131
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,541
You're the same as me.

132
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:42,708
You're omnipresent in the Wired.

133
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:49,666
Wherever anyone is, wherever
they go, you have always been there.

134
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,250
You've watched what they
didn't want others to see.

135
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,666
You've told everyone about it, that's all.

136
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,625
It was the right thing to do.

137
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:03,833
The Wired's information
should be shared, shouldn't it?

138
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,000
Everything you say is a lie.

139
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,833
Why is that?

140
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:22,333
Arisu and the others said that they
saw me in the Wired when I wasn't there.

141
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:25,500
As long as I'm aware of myself...

142
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:28,625
...my true self is inside of me!

143
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:34,125
You're telling me that these dupes are   <i>me</i> ?

144
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,875
What a load of garbage!

145
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,000
I...

146
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,750
If I'm really what you say I am, then...

147
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,291
Then what, Lain?

148
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:53,958
Their memories of being seen by Lain...
I could delete that information!

149
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,291
That's true. Give it a try.

150
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:03,250
You were born with that kind of power.

151
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,291
--Good morning!
--'Morning!

152
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,208
Lain!

153
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,916
Hey, Lain!

154
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,291
They forgot?

155
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,208
They really forgot?

156
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,333
Lain!

157
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,000
They did!

158
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,666
Arisu!

159
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,750
W-What?

160
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,541
Arisu!

161
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:10,458
Hey, I wanna go to Cyberia today!

162
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,458
C'mon, let's go!

163
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:13,541
I second that!

164
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,500
Wow, this sure is unusual...

165
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,541
Sure. We can get changed at
my place again and go from there.

166
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,208
Great!

167
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,125
Hey, what should I wear?

168
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,125
Stop it! <i>I'm</i> me!

169
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm over here!

170
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,958
--Come on, hurry up!
--Hey, wait for me!

171
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:52,416
That's right! Lain is Lain, and I'm    <i>me.</i>

172
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,375
Hello, Navi.

173
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,416
Hello, Lain.

174
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:30,416
I... I'm me, right?

175
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,083
There's no other me but <i>me,</i> right?

176
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:08,583
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

177
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:21,791
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

178
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:37,083
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

179
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:43,583
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

180
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:50,750
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

181
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:51,750
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

182
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:59,416
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

183
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,750
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

184
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:09,916
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

185
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,458
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

186
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:21,916
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
