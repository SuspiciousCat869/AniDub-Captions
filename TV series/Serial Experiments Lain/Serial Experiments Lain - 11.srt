1
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:18,250
"No, it's nothing as ambiguous as 'memory.'"

2
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,708
"But <i>you're</i> still there,
too, aren't you, you poor dupe?"

3
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,708
"Am I me?"

4
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,291
"Lain is Lain."

5
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,083
I wish you'd come here...

6
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,541
"I don't need to stay here."

7
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:49,500
You'll have to excuse me.
All this talking has worn me out.

8
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,458
I've never seen one before!

9
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:12,375
Lain Iwakura. Are you and the
Lain of the Wired one and the same?

10
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:17,083
I've seen you before. In the Wired.

11
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,166
"Tachibana General Laboratories'
Biochem Elementary Research Group...

12
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,708
...has announced that they
have mapped the human genome."

13
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,375
"Lain is a Peeping Tom"

14
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,000
"Masami Eiri Commits Suicide on Yamanote Line"

15
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,041
"Come..."

16
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,458
Poor Lain...

17
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:38,166
Hey, I'm Lain, aren't I?

18
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,500
No!

19
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,166
You're wrong!

20
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:54,833
That's right, Lain. You're
not needed in the real world.

21
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:58,250
I'm committing suicide!

22
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,000
Why? Why are you warm?

23
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:09,708
Why do I have to feel the heat from your body?

24
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:51,500
Yes. I'm God.

25
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,208
How could you...?

26
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,166
Lain, you'd have more fun if
you were a little more sociable.

27
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,916
She's changed, all right.

28
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,541
Are you okay?

29
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,166
Lately... You've been slipping
back to your old self, Lain.

30
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,166
Are you okay? Lain, I...

31
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:54,500
Lain, I'm sorry! It's all
our fault! Are you okay, Lain?

32
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,125
Glad to hear it.

33
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,166
"A loving heart is searching for you."

34
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,791
Are you tired?

35
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,833
Yes.

36
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:10,125
You really are incredible...

37
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,833
So, you've loaded an emulator
of that Navi into your own brain.

38
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,916
It's dangerous to subject yourself
to that much information all at once.

39
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,750
At your current capacity, you'll overflow.

40
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,625
Am I a machine?

41
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,500
Don't talk about me like I'm a machine.

42
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,625
I didn't mean to.

43
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,791
This is basically a software problem.

44
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,208
Lain, you're software.

45
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,750
You're not hardware.

46
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,916
Software...?

47
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,625
Yes. An executable program with a body.

48
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,083
Be quiet...

49
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,458
Be <i>quiet</i> !

50
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,750
Chisa...!

51
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:16,208
Chisa, we walked home together just once, right?

52
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:24,291
I understand. I finally
understand what you told me.

53
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,708
Lain...

54
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:37,291
It's easy to die, Lain.

55
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,041
Right?

56
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:08,250
There's nothing easy about dying.

57
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,166
Sure it is!

58
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,083
Lain, you already have
a tool that will let you do it.

59
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,750
What do you--

60
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,750
The safety's already off.

61
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:33,375
The trigger's heavy, so hold it with
both hands and pull it with your thumb.

62
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,750
A girl isn't strong enough.

63
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,708
What, you still want to stay in the real world?

64
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,916
Hey, that's not fair.
You called <i>me</i> here, remember?

65
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,208
I... I never...

66
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,458
Bodies are meaningless.

67
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,750
You're wrong.

68
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,416
Lain.

69
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,041
What <i>is</i> this?

70
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:16,333
I thought that maybe we could meet
after school and I could introduce you.

71
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,541
This guy's pretty cute!

72
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,208
And then those rumors
about you and that teacher...

73
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:29,333
I think if you get a boyfriend,
everyone will know they're a lie.

74
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,583
See you tomorrow. We'll talk about it then.

75
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,250
'Bye!

76
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,125
It's not a lie.

77
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,000
W-Who's there?

78
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,875
Who's there?!

79
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,750
Lain...?

80
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,000
W-What?

81
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:25,500
What's happened to you...? You...

82
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,958
It wasn't me.

83
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:39,416
I never peeked at your secrets, Arisu,

84
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,500
and I never sent those
secrets out onto the Wired.

85
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:50,333
It <i>was</i> you, Lain! I <i>saw</i> you!

86
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,333
That isn't me.

87
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:58,750
It looks like I'm not the
only me. Some other me did it.

88
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,291
What're you talking about?

89
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,875
You might not be the only Arisu, either.

90
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:13,958
But no matter how often I say
I didn't do it, you'll believe that I  <i>did</i> .

91
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,666
So I'll make it so that it never happened.

92
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,833
I've been working really
hard to be able to do that.

93
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,375
What do you mean?

94
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,541
I don't need devices anymore.

95
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,875
It looks like I've already
destroyed the border...

96
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,916
...between the Wired and the real world.

97
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,666
I can go anyplace I want to now.

98
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,750
So I came here.

99
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:45,791
I should be able to <i>undo</i>
something that happened!

100
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,458
Lain...

101
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,500
I...

102
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,125
I'm scared...

103
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,250
I'm scared...!

104
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,666
Arisu!

105
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,000
Arisu! Good morning!

106
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,083
Good morning.

107
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,291
What's up, Arisu? Why are you depressed?

108
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,208
Oh, is it that time of the month?

109
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,041
Hey, you ever hear of "delicacy"?

110
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,333
Come on, I was only...

111
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:48,666
Juri... I don't think I can
go through with it today.

112
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,916
Huh? Go through with what?

113
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,958
What? Didn't you send
me a CU-mail yesterday?

114
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,375
No, I didn't send you anything yesterday...

115
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,625
You're sure acting strange today, Arisu.

116
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,875
Arisu!

117
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,416
Oh, that teacher... He sure is hot!

118
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,416
Yeah! But rumor has it
that he's seeing an 8th-grader!

119
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,541
What, are you serious? That's gross!

120
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,000
Um... Listen, I...

121
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,541
What is it?

122
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:32,791
A-About that teacher... and me...

123
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,250
Is there something
between that teacher and you?

124
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,041
Do you like him or something?

125
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,958
Sorry, you're too late!

126
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,625
Yeah! He already has a girlfriend.

127
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,583
That's not like you, Arisu.

128
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:47,666
Yeah, she sure is acting strange today.

129
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,250
Lain! Good morning!

130
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,541
Hurry it up!

131
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,541
Come on, Lain!

132
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:26,208
Lain!

133
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,833
Lain, you...

134
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,958
Lain, you smiled...

135
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:12,208
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

136
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:25,416
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

137
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:40,708
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

138
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:47,250
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

139
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:54,375
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

140
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,375
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

141
00:23:55,458 --> 00:24:03,041
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

142
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,375
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

143
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:13,541
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

144
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:20,083
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

145
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:25,541
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
