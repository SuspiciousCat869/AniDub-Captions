1
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:46,166
If you want to be free of suffering,
you should believe in God.

2
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,750
Whether or not you believe in
Him, God is always by your side.

3
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:18,791
On July 4, 1947, a strange craft crashed
in the desert in New Mexico, America.

4
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:26,833
What it was has yet to be proven.

5
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:32,416
Conjecture has become fact,
and rumor has become history.

6
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,708
Who's there?

7
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:37,875
In 1984, a manila envelope arrived at
the home of TV producer Jaime Shandera.

8
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:43,833
The envelope, from an anonymous source,
contained a roll of undeveloped film.

9
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:50,250
The film contained what is
called the MJ-12 Document.

10
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:59,541
Roscoe Hillenkoetter, head of the
CIA at the time of the Roswell Incident,

11
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,458
was at the top of the list of 12 members.

12
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:05,416
It stated that these men concluded
a secret treaty with extraterrestrials...

13
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,041
...as a special organization
answerable only to the president.

14
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,875
It is now accepted that President
Truman's signature on the document...

15
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,541
...was in fact copied carefully
from another document.

16
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:26,125
Named as a member of MJ-12 was Vannevar Bush,

17
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,541
head of MIT's Department
of Electrical Engineering.

18
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,416
Connect to Wired.

19
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:06,208
How could I turn something that
<i>did</i> happen into something that <i>didn't</i> ?

20
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:09,750
Are you Lain? I see, I see...

21
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:13,500
I don't know you.

22
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,958
But you know <i>me</i> ...

23
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:22,125
The flow of information
doesn't always go both ways.

24
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:27,291
Since the moment of the Wired's
creation, you have always been here.

25
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,166
Here, you are free.

26
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,333
I'm trying to tell you that that's not me!

27
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,375
I suppose.

28
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,333
How long have we been here, then?

29
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:44,250
At the very least, we cannot have
been here since this world was created.

30
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,416
That has nothing to do with it!

31
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,250
If a being is remembered, that
proves that it's part of a record!

32
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,333
That's preposterous.

33
00:07:55,416 --> 00:08:00,375
How old do you think this
"Lain" girl is? She's still a child!

34
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,916
Let's not worry about me now, okay? I--

35
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:25,541
The memex memory expansion concept
unveiled by Vannevar Bush in 1945...

36
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,291
...was a system whereby
information recorded on microfilm...

37
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,375
...was projected onto a translucent screen.

38
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:39,041
What he envisioned was the
compression and rapid access of information.

39
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,166
Even before the advent of computers,

40
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,125
Bush had already created the
basis for our current multimedia...

41
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,416
...while he led the Manhattan
Project atom bomb experiments.

42
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,500
You forgot this.

43
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,583
You forgot this on the floor here yesterday.

44
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,875
If you don't need it, I'll toss it.

45
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,541
I left that here?

46
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,666
That's what I'm sayin'.

47
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,166
Conducting sensory
deprivation experiments using...

48
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,791
...Native American narcotics and isolation
tanks to probe the human unconscious,

49
00:09:54,875 --> 00:10:00,250
John C. Lilly believed his experiments
connected him to cosmic entities...

50
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,416
...by way of a communication network.

51
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,833
Lilly dubbed the beings
that guided him E.C.C.O.,

52
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,208
Earth Coincidence Control Office.

53
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,125
Afterwards, Lilly began work
on communication with dolphins.

54
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,416
Dolphins are creatures
which are able to conduct...

55
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,208
...wide-range networking in
the water via ultrasonic waves.

56
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,250
What?

57
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:54,708
You promised me earlier.

58
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,500
Promised what?

59
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:59,458
That you'd go out with me.

60
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,125
You said you'd go out with me!

61
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,833
W-What're you talking about?

62
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,125
Taro, is that true?

63
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,000
Did I?

64
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,375
You didn't! You didn't!

65
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:19,666
Even if I did, you aren't the you
I want to go out with right now, Lain.

66
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,916
Taro, you moron!

67
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,583
We're the same. I'm me. I'm the only me.

68
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,666
Awesome!

69
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,125
I can't believe you put
together something like this!

70
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:59,458
Oh, okay...! This syncs
up the parallel processors!

71
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:04,666
It's not pretty, but you can
keep on expanding it this way.

72
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,208
What're you using as coolant?

73
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,666
Taro...

74
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,708
Is this liquid carbon?

75
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,625
Sit down over there.

76
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,875
Damn...

77
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:24,833
I think you know what this is.

78
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,333
It's <i>you,</i> isn't it, Taro?

79
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,791
You're with the Knights, aren't you?

80
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,250
You're... the real Lain.

81
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:51,958
I don't know whether or not
there's another me in the Wired.

82
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:58,208
But there's <i>definitely</i> no
other me here in the real world.

83
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:05,250
The other one with a body
has only appeared in the club.

84
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,750
You only need to manipulate the
memories of the people there, right?

85
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,583
I... I can't...

86
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,416
Play track 44.

87
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,916
It's almost over, isn't it?

88
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,583
Finally.

89
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,666
So while we still can, we should...

90
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,333
Roger.

91
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,208
Now communicating.

92
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,958
Stop.

93
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,375
It's not me!

94
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:53,958
But I knew the data coming into
JJ's place had this kind of effect.

95
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,916
If I had installed this chip,
what would've happened to me?

96
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,833
Would I have killed myself? Gone insane?

97
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,666
I said I don't know!

98
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,625
There's no way a kid like me
could be a formal Knights member!

99
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,083
I'm just a--

100
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,791
I wonder what this will do?

101
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:22,500
I-It's non-volatile memory!
It'll overwrite existing memories!

102
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,666
What kind of memories?

103
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,083
I-I don't know.

104
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,083
The Knights aren't just
ordinary crackers, Lain.

105
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,791
There's something strange
about you. That's for sure.

106
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,541
That's why the Knights are so interested.

107
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,916
The Knights are users who are fighting...

108
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,958
...to make the one and only
truth there is into a reality.

109
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:05,625
I don't understand.
What do you mean, "one and only"?

110
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,750
Like I said, I'm not a formal Knights member.

111
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,708
They never explained it to me.

112
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:17,083
But it's true. The truth has
power <i>because</i> it's the truth.

113
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,083
And because it's the truth, that makes it  <i>just</i> .

114
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:24,541
It's persuasive, isn't it?
Don't you want truth like that?

115
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,458
I'm going.

116
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,791
Myu-Myu is jealous of you.

117
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,875
Taro...? Thank you.

118
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,791
You...

119
00:16:55,583 --> 00:17:00,083
Hey, this <i>is</i> a date, you know?
I'm a guy. I had to do that.

120
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:15,500
Ted Nelson, who studied
under the two cult pioneers...

121
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:19,250
...Vannevar Bush and John C. Lilly,

122
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:23,875
proposed a giant electronic library
in satellites in stationary orbit...

123
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:29,583
...which could be used at any
terminal on Earth via radio or phone lines.

124
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:35,208
He called this concept that
would make this database "Xanadu."

125
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:45,250
The Mongolian utopia where all
written cultures would never be lost.

126
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,541
This was Xanadu.

127
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:53,916
It was the concept of
Hypertext that would make it real,

128
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,625
and Ted Nelson's name would
go down in history as its originator.

129
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,291
Hello, Navi.

130
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:17,708
Click, click... Memory check...

131
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:23,125
Click, click, click...

132
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,791
That's... That's <i>me</i> ?

133
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,916
Yes. This is me.

134
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,916
Then who are <i>they</i> ?

135
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,250
I'm you, so I wouldn't know.

136
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,083
This is a lie.

137
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,625
It's a lie. It's all a lie.

138
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:40,166
Why are you doing this?

139
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:46,125
The Earth has its own
specific electromagnetic waves.

140
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,500
Between the ionosphere and the Earth's surface,

141
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:54,083
...there is a constant resonance at
a frequency of 8Hz in the ELF band.

142
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,083
This is called the Schumann Resonance.

143
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:08,041
The extent of the effect on
humans of these "Earth Brain Waves"...

144
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:14,750
...that the planet constantly
gives off remains unknown.

145
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,083
The Earth's human
population is approaching that of...

146
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,583
...the number of neurons in the brain.

147
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,750
Douglas Rushkoff proposes that
the consciousness of the Earth itself...

148
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:32,208
...might be awakened when all humans
on Earth become collectively networked.

149
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:40,000
The network's evolution
would follow a neural model,

150
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:44,000
and just as neurons within the
human brain are connected by synapses,

151
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:48,791
the Earth itself would become a neural network.

152
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:18,458
There is only one truth. God.

153
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,875
Yes. Me.

154
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:27,208
Masami Eiri, Chief Researcher
at Tachibana General Labs,

155
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:31,750
further developed the hypothesis
of a worldwide neural network.

156
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:36,125
His hypothesis proposed a
wireless network whereby all humanity...

157
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:41,291
...would be plugged in at an unconscious
level without the need for any device.

158
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:46,333
Furthermore, he encoded the
Schumann Resonance Factor...

159
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:51,375
...and inserted it into the 7th-gen
Wired Protocol on his own initiative.

160
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:59,083
Upon discovering this,
Tachibana General Labs dismissed Eiri.

161
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:06,083
One week later, Masami Eiri's body
was found on the Yamanote train line.

162
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:07,916
<i>I thought I was innocent,</i>
<i>but I'm being punished.</i>

163
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:21,125
<i>I didn't start this, but</i>
<i>I have to finish it somehow.</i>

164
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:36,416
<i>I can't say I didn't know about it,</i>
<i>but I don't remember taking part in it.</i>

165
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,916
<i>I get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly,</i>

166
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,083
<i>but I don't remember selling my soul cheaply.</i>

167
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,083
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

168
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:58,750
<i>Until I die and say goodbye...</i>

169
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,083
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

170
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:09,250
<i>...no one will ever catch me.</i>

171
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:15,791
<i>You probably don't know the eternal outlaws...</i>

172
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:21,250
<i>...who wander the distant night.</i>
