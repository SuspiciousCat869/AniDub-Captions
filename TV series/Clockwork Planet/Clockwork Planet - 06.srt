00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:20,333
If word gets out that
they're here in Mie,

165
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,083
I don't know what might happen.

166
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,916
[MARIE] Who do you mean?
Who're "they"?

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,375
People you don't want to cross:

168
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,333
military remnants from
the purged Shiga Grid.

169
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,666
[gasps]

170
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,250
[GOVERNOR] Thirty years ago,
there was a defect in Shiga,

171
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,291
one on a large enough scale that
necessitated the grid's purge.

172
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,875
[MARIE]
Yes, I know.

173
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,041
The fallout would have affected
all of western Japan,

174
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,208
so it was decided to go ahead
and conduct the purge,

175
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,750
rather than wait for the
Guild to perform repairs.

176
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,666
What you probably don't know
is that was actually a ruse.

177
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,750
The defect was the direct result
of electromagnetic research

178
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,500
that was being carried
out in Shiga.

179
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,333
But that's illegal!

180
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:01,083
Electromagnetism is banned now

181
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,875
because of its negative
effect on gears.

182
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,208
You're right.

183
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,541
It was a clear violation
of the national treaties.

184
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,250
During one of the
illegal experiments

185
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,500
they were conducting,

186
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,250
the electromagnetic waves
broke containment.

187
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,458
The entire city was disabled.

188
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,500
The Japanese government
couldn't let it be known

189
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,750
that they were in charge
of that research.

190
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,875
In order to cover up
their involvement,

191
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,750
they purged Shiga and pretended
as if it had never happened.

192
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,166
Afterwards, the scientists
and members of the military

193
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,333
who had been abandoned by the
government went underground.

194
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,791
They consolidated their power,

195
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,125
working from the shadows
to gain control of Mie

196
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,166
so they could cannibalize
Shiga's remains and

197
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,375
Mie's Clock Tower in order
to finish their pet project.

198
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,666
[MARIE]
So they were silenced

199
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,208
because it was discovered
they were conducting

200
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,666
illegal research on behalf
of the government.

201
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,500
Still, if you knew,

202
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,541
why didn't you go public
with all of this?

203
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,916
If I had done that,

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,291
Mie would have been
sunk like Shiga.

205
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,875
[gasps]

206
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,291
[GOVERNOR] The only way you can
negotiate with the government

207
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,833
is if you have
power of your own.

208
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,666
That's why the weapon is there.

209
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,791
It acts as a deterrent.

210
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,375
The national government knows
of the weapon's existence

211
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,041
and because they fear it,
they cannot purge Mie.

212
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,083
Both parties circle each other,

213
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,250
the principle of mutually
assured destruction

214
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,416
preventing either from acting.

215
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,291
[MARIE]
You say it's just a deterrent.

216
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,375
If that's really the case,
why is it ready to activate?

217
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,416
It's not!

218
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,791
[MARIE]
We saw it with our own eyes.

219
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,333
I assure you, it's ready.

220
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:33,291
[laughing]

221
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:34,875
Why are you laughing?!

222
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,666
[laughs]

223
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,666
You don't see the
absurdity of this, do you?

224
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,250
The weapon that was built
specifically to be a deterrent

225
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,583
and nothing more is
ready to deploy.

226
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,000
Given the timing,

227
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,208
it should be perfectly obvious
what's going on here.

228
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,458
And yet, the person
whose actions led

229
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,916
to the weapon's activation

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,833
is asking me why
it's been activated?

231
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:03,333
This is happening because
of you, Marie Bell Breguet.

232
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,708
[GOVERNOR]
Thanks to you,

233
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,458
the purge of the Kyoto Grid
was narrowly avoided.

234
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,000
The information you so
carelessly disseminated

235
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,750
cost the government badly,

236
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,208
both in money and in
the trust of the public.

237
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,833
So now they need an enemy,

238
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,833
one that will justify
their existence and

239
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,625
force the people to look to
them for safety and guidance.

240
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,291
With the activation
of that weapon,

241
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,125
Mie will become the enemy.

242
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,375
The government will crush us,

243
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,166
saving the country
from a rogue city

244
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,708
and becoming heroes in
the eyes of the people.

245
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,541
That's what this is all about!

246
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,791
[MARIE whimpers]

247
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,875
So, tell me, did it feel good?

248
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,083
Was it satisfying to reveal
the government's sins?

249
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,333
Are you happy now,

250
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,958
having outsmarted those
who tried to bury you?

251
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,000
You showed them, all right.

252
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,750
Was it worth it?!

253
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,375
I hope so, because your
stupid sense of justice

254
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,458
is going to get even more
people killed now!

255
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,416
Why couldn't you die
like they wanted you to?!

256
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,541
Instead, you had to play
the goddamned hero!

257
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,166
[HALTER] The information we
got from Meister Konrad

258
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,541
makes more sense now.

259
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,833
I researched the Initial-Y
Series unit as you asked.

260
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,208
We found evidence it was
moved from Kyoto to Tokyo.

261
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,291
What's more,

262
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,291
well, it seems Tokyo's military

263
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,875
is amassing nearly all their
forces in one location,

264
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,750
like they're readying
for a fight.

265
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:53,916
[HALTER]
I think we can guess

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,791
what Tokyo's military
is preparing for.

267
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,500
There's gonna be
a war before long.

268
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,000
What am I supposed to do?

269
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,708
You aren't responsible
for this, you know.

270
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:09,625
It started 30 years ago
with Shiga's purge.

271
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,333
[MARIE]
I know that,

272
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,458
but...

273
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,583
[HALTER]
But what, Princess?

274
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,291
Tokyo's military is going
after that weapon.

275
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,750
You want to stop the fight?

276
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,666
[MARIE] Should I just
sit back and watch?

277
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,625
[HALTER]
Well, hell yeah.

278
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,208
If two of your enemies want to
bash each other's heads in,

279
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,750
I say let 'em.

280
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,375
Makes your job easier.

281
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,875
This isn't a joke!

282
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:36,500
Just speakin' the
truth, Princess.

283
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,250
All right.

284
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,041
So, what's next?

285
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,458
[MARIE]
I don't know.

286
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,166
I'm lost.

287
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,083
So lost.

288
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,041
[MARIE cries]
This world of ours...

289
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,291
...is it worth fighting for?

290
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,125
Does it deserve to survive?

291
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,541
I've always hated knowing that

292
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,083
even if I'm doing
the right thing,

293
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,916
there are some
fights I can't win.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,958
But somehow, when
I was with Naoto,

295
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,458
things didn't
feel so hopeless.

296
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:18,666
Then I let him die, and
that hope died with him.

297
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,375
[MARIE grunts]
Useless.

298
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,541
I'm too small and weak
to do anything.

299
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:30,416
[MARIE cries]

300
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,208
[gasps]

301
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,375
[NAOTO]
Aw, damn, it's raining!

302
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,083
I thought we might get
a chance to dry off

303
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,833
once we were out of the sewer.

304
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,291
[RYUZU] Considering it will wash
away the filth of the sewer,

305
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,416
the rain might be
seen as a good thing.

306
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
However, if this weather
is the result

307
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,708
of insufficient maintenance,

308
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,666
the city's administrator
should be fired

309
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,666
for dereliction of duty as
well as soaking my clothes.

310
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,166
I don't enjoy being wet.

311
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,291
[NAOTO]
It's muggy and gross out here.

312
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:03,708
I thought rain was supposed
to cool things off.

313
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,166
[NAOTO]
Oh crap, it's Marie.

314
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,291
Maybe we should run away
while we have the chance.

315
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:08,583
Is it possible?

316
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,333
Have you finally
acquired the ability

317
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,583
to learn from your
mistakes, Master?

318
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,083
[gasping]

319
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,041
[whimpers]

320
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,166
[growling]

321
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,750
[NAOTO groans]

322
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,500
[NAOTO]
Jeez! What was that for?

323
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,666
Ow!

324
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,125
You stupid ass!

325
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,833
If you were alive, you could've
let me know sooner!

326
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,958
Coming, Master!

327
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,208
For daring to touch you,

328
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,291
I'll put her down like
the rabid dog she is!

329
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,458
[MARIE, NAOTO shouting]

330
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,666
[HALTER] Could you
all please calm down?

331
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,958
I'm getting a headache.

332
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,583
[MARIE] So, you gonna
tell me what happened?

333
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,083
During the fight, I realized
from the way sounds resonated

334
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,666
that there was ground beneath
the floor we were on.

335
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,666
So, I thought dropping down
there might be okay.

336
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,958
[RYUZU] It was not okay,
it was reckless.

337
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,750
You were lucky the
air was breathable

338
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,333
and the oxygen wasn't
sucked from your lungs.

339
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,333
Still, if you hadn't had such a
capable servant to assist you,

340
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:05,916
I doubt you would have lived.

341
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,666
[NAOTO] Anyway, there was this
weird old guy living down there.

342
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,083
He turned on an elevator
and sent us back up.

343
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,500
There you have it. End of story.

344
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:15,875
Hang on a second.

345
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,291
So when you let yourself fall,

346
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,041
you didn't think you
were going to die?

347
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,041
Huh? No, of course not.

348
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,708
If I died, then RyuZU
would lose her master.

349
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,208
Not to mention I wouldn't
be able to help AnchoR.

350
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,583
You didn't sacrifice
yourself to save me?

351
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:31,000
[NAOTO]
What? Are you kidding?

352
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,041
Where did you get
that idea from?

353
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,458
I was just tryin'
to stop AnchoR,

354
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,583
nothing more
complicated than that.

355
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:39,708
Oh, wow, you actually thought
I would die for you?

356
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:43,458
You're gonna die,
all right, you jerk.

357
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,041
[NAOTO] So, AnchoR was in
Tokyo before coming to Mie?

358
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,083
Yeah.

359
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,583
That's what Meister
Konrad told us.

360
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,291
Right. I guess we're
takin' a trip to Tokyo.

361
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,833
Huh?

362
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,708
AnchoR is protecting that giant
weapon, which we now believe

363
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,583
is going to make its way
toward Tokyo, right?

364
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,083
So that's where we go.

365
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,166
You say that like
it's so simple.

366
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,625
But the situation is more
complicated than that.

367
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,416
We need to think this through.

368
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,416
Tokyo's gathered its army, and
Mie's activated their weapon.

369
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,000
In all likelihood,
Mie will strike first.

370
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,250
But even if we were
able to catch up to it,

371
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,875
I don't have the first idea how
we'd go about defeating it.

372
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,083
Should we go to Tokyo
and wait for it, then?

373
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,208
If it reaches Tokyo, the city
will become a battlefield.

374
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,333
Civilian loss
would be significant.

375
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,708
[NAOTO]
Shut up already!

376
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,625
No matter how many what-ifs
you come up with,

377
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,250
I've got no doubts about
what I need to do.

378
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,541
I'm going to Tokyo
to save AnchoR!

379
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:36,916
So, what's it gonna be?

380
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,375
Are you comin' with me,

381
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,166
or are you gonna sit here
like an idiot thinking about

382
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,958
what could go wrong until it's
too late to do anything?! Huh?!

383
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,458
Are you kidding, here?!
You calling me an idiot?!

384
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,083
That's rich!

385
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,333
Ha!

386
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,666
What else do you call
someone who does nothing

387
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,875
but whine about how impossible
everything seems?

388
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,000
You don't even have
a concrete plan!

389
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,500
Yeah, well, who cares?!

390
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,250
It's better than being a walking
landmine, so damn uptight

391
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,750
you're ready to explode
at the slightest pressure!

392
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,291
Meister Marie!

393
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,250
[grunts]

394
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,333
[MARIE growls]

395
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:07,333
[NAOTO growls]

396
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,833
[MARIE]
Get this straight:

397
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,041
I am a woman who doesn't believe
in the word "impossible."

398
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,000
[NAOTO]
Heh. Yeah, that's right.

399
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,041
I thought you could use
a little reminder.

400
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,291
Hope it helped.
No thanks needed.

401
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:25,708
[laughs]

402
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:29,208
You're an idiot, an
absolutely, absurd idiot.

403
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,458
Hands down, a much better
idiot than I could ever be.

404
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,041
Hey.

405
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,583
I mean, when you think about it,
we're all idiots in our own way.

406
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,208
People are irrational.

407
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,375
We're stubborn and
stupid and selfish,

408
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,583
and there's not a damn
thing we can do about it.

409
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,833
Because we're human,
and humans are imperfect.

410
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,000
Maybe this sad,
half-broken world of ours

411
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,458
doesn't really
deserve to survive.

412
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,875
Even so. I'm still
going to fight for it.

413
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,500
Okay, why's she getting
poetic all of a sudden?

414
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,500
I hear that tends to happen when
a girl's going through puberty.

415
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,208
For the record, you're rude
and I hate you both!

416
00:22:04,291 --> 00:22:05,750
Now, here's the plan.

417
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,125
The two of you are going to be
in charge of saving AnchoR,

418
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,250
and I will focus on
saving the world!

419
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,000
All right, let's go!

420
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,666
Uh, Princess. What are we doing?

421
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,291
[MARIE]
Isn't that obvious?

422
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,583
Whatever we have to do.

423
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,541
Now, come on.
First thing's first,

424
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,208
we're going to go attack Tokyo.

425
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,708
[RYUZU]
Tokyo's military readies for war

426
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:03,083
as the giant weapon
heads in their direction.

427
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,750
Drastic measures must be taken

428
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,250
in order to prevent
civilian casualties.

429
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,958
Sometimes to defeat evil, good
people must become criminals,

430
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,375
and sisters must
battle each other.

431
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,958
Next time:
"Attack the Multiple Grid."

432
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:20,458
Master Naoto, I believe in you.

433
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:23,500
And you, too, AnchoR.
Little sister,

434
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,458
I believe in you, as well.
