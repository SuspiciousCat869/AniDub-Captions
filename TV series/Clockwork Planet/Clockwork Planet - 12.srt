You can kill me now,

164
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,416
but it's not going
to make a difference.

165
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,000
Everything's in place.

166
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,458
The cannon will
fire in a moment.

167
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,208
[laughs]

168
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,958
[GENNAI]
What?

169
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,916
Why isn't it firing?

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,333
[RYUZU]
That's easy to explain.

171
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,583
[RYUZU] AnchoR attacked
your giant weapon

172
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,166
and bought my master enough time

173
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,625
to put his extraordinary
abilities to work.

174
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,875
That's all it took.

175
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,666
To be completely honest,

176
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,791
he may have had a tiny amount
of help from someone else.

177
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,875
Hya!

178
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,333
Unbelievable!

179
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,791
They've done the impossible!

180
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,166
The holy tree has
been completely reborn.

181
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,791
[HOUKO] You made it in
time to stop the cannon.

182
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,375
We did.

183
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,416
But we took longer
than the 70 minutes

184
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,375
we told AnchoR we'd need.

185
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,291
It's okay!

186
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,666
RyuZU will bring her back.

187
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,625
I don't doubt that for a second.

188
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,916
Alrighty, ladies,
gentlemen, boys, girls, cyborgs,

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,750
and whoever else
we've got, look lively!

190
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,291
No time to rest.

191
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,916
Reinforcements are
coming up from below.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,291
[HALTER]
We need find a way out,

193
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,666
or we're gonna be
in serious trouble.

194
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,500
Well, the way out
is right in front of you.

195
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,791
[multiple gasps]

196
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,083
You are joking
about that, aren't you?

197
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,250
Jumping down from here would
be nothing short of suicide.

198
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
I see what you're getting at!

199
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,625
We just need to use the weather
control to create an updraft,

200
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,541
and we should be
good to go, right?

201
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:08,500
You're getting the hang
of this intuition thing! Hya!

202
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,083
I'm leaving you in
charge of the controls.

203
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,000
Wow.

204
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,666
That boy is crazy.

205
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,000
And I like 'em crazy.

206
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,208
Let's go!

207
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,708
Ahh!

208
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
[HALTER] Do you think the
updraft'll be strong enough

209
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,750
to support this new body?

210
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,958
[MARIE] Are you doubting
my abilities, Halter?

211
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,833
[HALTER] Sorry, Princess,
don't know what I was thinking.

212
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,000
[HOUKO]
You're going, too?

213
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,708
Yes. I'll leave
the rest of it to you.

214
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,416
Right, I know what to do.

215
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,125
By the time I'm done,
the world will believe

216
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,583
you're the greatest criminal
masterminds in history.

217
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,583
[HOUKO]
Goodbye. And thank you.

218
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,583
[GENNAI] I guess he won
in the end after all.

219
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,416
[RYUZU] Now you're
just being ridiculous.

220
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,541
To say that
Master Naoto won implies

221
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,833
there was some sort
of contest to begin with.

222
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,833
And between your posturing and
his skills, there could be none.

223
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,458
Surely even your
old eyes can see that.

224
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,041
[GENNAI grunts]

225
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,458
Your existence betrays humanity.

226
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,333
You and your kind
may look like people,

227
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,625
but you are nothing
more than hollow dolls.

228
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,375
Suffering defeat over
and over again in a world

229
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,458
that's cruel and ugly.

230
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,458
Fighting for just
a taste of victory.

231
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,583
That's what it means
to be human.

232
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,083
[laughs]

233
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,416
Just wanna check: We're
not plummeting hundreds

234
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,375
of meters to our
deaths here, are we?

235
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,708
Have a little faith.

236
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,791
The updraft will kick in soon.

237

Oh my god, poor AnchoR.

Daddy's here!

241
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,583
She'll be all right.

242
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,500
The damage is extensive, but
thankfully none of it is fatal.

243
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,291
Marie and I can repair her.

244
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,625
I'm sure of it.

245
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,875
Thank god for that.

00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,583

I tried to,
but I couldn't destroy.

249
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,333
I failed you.

Even though it's
all I'm good for.

I left, Father.

252
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,041
I disobeyed.

And I still failed.

Don't say that.

00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,666
I don't know what to do.

Please help. Please help me.

257
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,166
I feel so confused.

258
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,166
What should I do?

259
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,791
I need an order.

Okay, I'll give you an order.

Hold your head high and say,

"I did my best, and
I deserve praise for that."

Hmm?

I did my best?

Yeah!

Of course I believe it.

There is nobody out there
who works harder than you do.

00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,625
And if I want to be praised,
then that's okay?

asking so much of you.

But no matter what it is,
you come through for me.

Thanks so much.

Nah, you know I'm always honored

to help any way I can.

You look so much smaller now,
after that other body.

293
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,208
[HALTER] I guess it'll take
a little getting used to.

294
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,083
[KARASAWA]
You've got a head start,

295
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,250
but your pursuers
are closing in.

296
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:50,625
The weather's not ideal.

297
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,833
But unfortunately, you can't
afford to rest for long.

298
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,208
Actually, this
weather is perfect

299
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,458
for ditching people
who're after us.

300
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,333
Okay, everybody.

301
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,250
Let's get out of here.

302
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,458
[NEWSCASTER] The multiple grid
sustained significant damage,

303
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,083
but repairs are well underway

304
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,583
and should be
completed before long.

305
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,458
The Akihabara Grid was
by far the most affected.

306
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,916
However, an inexplicable
and dramatic increase

307
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,791
in temperature
demagnetized the grid,

308
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,291
saving it from complete ruin.

Hmm? AnchoR?

Ah! Your repairs
are finally finished!

[ANCHOR]
Yes.

314
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,250
Unfortunately, it was more
first aid than a full repair.

00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,458
Don't worry, AnchoR.

and you'll be in better
shape than ever!

Oh, like hell!

doing her repairs.

No way!

00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,375
Yeah!

323
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,791
I can't leave
it to you and RyuZU.

324
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,208
You'll just create
another pervert like you.

325
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,541
Excuse me?

326
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,541
Yes, that was wholly
uncalled for, Miss Marie.

327
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:13,750
That's what I'm saying!

328
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,250
You tell her, RyuZU!

329
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,750
However, I don't like the
idea of Master Naoto cheating

330
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,500
on me with my little sister.

331
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,500
So perhaps having
Miss Marie take care of her

332
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,041
would be preferable.

333
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,791
It hurts me you would even
suggest something like that!

334
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,750
Okay, AnchoR,
which of us do you prefer,

335
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,916
me or the walking landmine?

336
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,375
That should be easy to answer.

337
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,208
You like me more than mega
perv over there, don't you?

338
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:40,083
Oh, um. Well, actually...

339
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,333
What I really like best

340
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:43,250
is when the two of you
are working together.

341
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,833
That makes me happy!

342
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,208
[NAOTO, MARIE]
Huh?

343
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,708
[HALTER] Pretty sure that asking
a kid if they like mom or dad

344
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,958
more is a textbook
example of bad parenting.

345
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,791
[NAOTO, MARIE]
Well, nobody asked you!

346
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,583
Hey, could you all stop
shouting for a second?

347
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,125
Sorry to interrupt
your little party,

348
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,666
but I've got some news,
and I don't think it can wait.

349
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,625
Don't worry,
I'm way ahead of you.

350
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,708
From the sound of it, there's
a decent-sized fleet of ships

351
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,208
nearby, and they're
headed right for us.

352
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,541
[MARIE]
Seriously?

353
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,875
If you knew that,
why didn't you say something?

354
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,041
[NAOTO]
Because I have a good idea.

355
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,166
[MARIE]
Which means it's a bad idea.

356
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,583
Let's take over a battleship and
blow up the rest of the fleet.

357
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,625
You are seriously
the biggest idiot ever.

358
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,500
There's something
I've been thinking about.

359
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,916
The Gears of Fate.

360
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do you believe in them,
or are we all on our own?

361
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,250
Sadly, I do not have
the ability to assess

362
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,750
such a complex
philosophical notion.

363
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:39,583
However, in this world
made entirely of gears,

364
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,541
everything is as
it is meant to be.

365
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,500
As an automaton of
the Clockwork Planet,

366
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,291
that is what I believe.

367
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:48,833
[VERMOUTH]
Woooo!

368
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,083
Great idea, Naoto!

369
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,416
All that relaxing was
starting to get boring.

370
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,625
[MARIE] I'll go along with the
plan, but if we're doing this,

371
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:59,166
we can't afford to
make a single mistake.

372
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,791
We've already got
our work cut out for us

373
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,291
overhauling the planet,
so let's not waste any time.

374
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,916
Don't worry, as long
as we're all together,

375
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,041
there's nothing we can't do.
