Hello. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

4
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:36,166
Sorry for interrupting your work
as mindless corporate slaves.

5
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,125
I realize that you're all busy
desperately trying to find

6
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,250
meaning in your
monotonous lives.

7
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,750
However, that's exactly
what I've come here

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,416
to help you with today!

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,166
It's time for this city
to start a new chapter,

10
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,125
and I've taken the liberty
of setting things

11
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,416
in motion for you.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,291
Aw, yeah!

13
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,291
What's happening?

14
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,791
Something's up with Tokyo

[CROWD screaming]

00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,333
[NAOTO]
Allow me to explain.

17
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,458
I have seized control
of all the gears

18
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:11,625
that comprise the
Akihabara Grid.

19
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,041
You do know what
that means, don't you?

20
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:16,666
All right, let's turn
things up a notch.

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,000
Come on, everybody! Yeah!

22
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,666
Yeah!

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,833

be fun! Let's party!

[NAOTO]
Don't worry, AnchoR.

25
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,250
It won't be long now.

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,875
I promise. I will save you.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
[MARIE] The giant weapon
is moving underground,

28
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,958
using the deepest floors
to make its way to Tokyo.

29
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,375
Here's the plan:

30
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,000
we get to Tokyo before it does,
take over a district,

31
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,833
and scare the residents away.

32
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,583
Then, the military can fight
the weapon in an empty city.

33
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,875
Not really the easiest
plan to pull off.

34
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,875
Security is gonna be tight.

35
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,750
Well, it's an interesting plan.
I'll give you that much.

36
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,833
But I don't see how we're
gonna find the manpower

37
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,083
to get it done.

38
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,958
[MARIE] Oh, that's not
going to be a problem.

39
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,833
Fortunately, I have
a friend or two

40
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,250
who would be more than
happy to help out.

for all of the floors

have been taken care of as well.

This is Clock Tower Four.

48

As requested, we've
brought in all the material.

49

to send you his regards.

Great. Please thank him for me.

under control there,

in from the Deep Underground.

of the Tokyo military.

What happened?

57
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,291
[RYUZU]
I suspect their officers

58
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,750
may have suffered some
sort of brain damage.

59
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,125
That seems like the only thing

60
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,833
that could explain them
falling for a plan of yours.

[KONRAD] It looks like we've
made it just in time.

00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,958
Yes. We couldn't have done it

It was my pleasure, but you know
I am no longer a service chief.

68
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,625
Which is my fault.

69
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,375
I'm so sorry about that.

70
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:58,041
No apologies are necessary,
I assure you.

71
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,333
I couldn't be part of an
entertaining plot like this

if I were still in the Guild.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,916
The Clock Tower controls
the city's basic functions,

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,166
its bones and muscles.
By controlling it,

you hope to also gain control
of the Core Tower,

the surprising things

you young people come up with.

79

Well, we should be able
to take it from here.

80

instructions.

Thank you, everyone.
Your help means so much.

I don't know what I've
done to deserve it.

All right, enough of that.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,875
It's not very complicated,

86
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:38,291
you earned our loyalty
simply by being who you are.

87

That's more than enough for us.

What's the idiot doing?

He looks like he's hosting
some cheesy game show.

[KONRAD]
You know, Meister Marie.

94
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,458
I've noticed something about you

95
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,375
in the time we've
worked together.

96
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,500
I hope you won't be offended
by me saying this,

97
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,083
but you're a terrible actor.

98
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,541
Huh?

00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,166
Your true self is beautiful.
There's no need to keep it

100
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,583
hidden from the
world all the time.

101
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,916
What?! It isn't nice to tease
people, Meister Konrad.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,750
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to go.

103
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,291
[NAOTO]
They'll be here in nine seconds.

104
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,208
We're looking at two
silent helicopters

105
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:30,625
and one transport helicopter
loaded with 12 combat automata.

106
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:34,708
3... 2... 1... 0!

107
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,958
Take this!

108
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,333
[HALTER]
Heh.

109
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,625
[RYUZU] Sorry if I'm late.
Were you waiting long?

110
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,666
Not too bad for the debut
of a super villain

111
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,375
bent on world domination.

112
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,125
Well done, Naoto.

113
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:28,083
From what I'm hearing,
the military's begun

114
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,250
their underground battle
against the weapon.

115
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,333
I think it's safe to say
most of their focus

116
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,041
will be on that for a while.

117
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:37,041
All right. Then I guess it's
time for us to get going.

118
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,541
As planned,

119
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,166
the princess and I will help
the others get out of here,

120
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,500
and we'll all regroup
at the safe house later.

121
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,458
We'll leave AnchoR
to the two of you.

122
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,250
Try not to die or anything.

123
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,666
[NAOTO laughs]
I wasn't planning on it.

124
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,416
[RYUZU]
May I make a request?

125
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,666
I'd appreciate it if you would
accompany us, Miss Marie.

126
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,750
Why do you want me?

127
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,083
Master Naoto has devised
a plan he thinks

128
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,708
will let me defeat AnchoR
without harming her.

129
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,875
However, there is a chance
things could go wrong.

130
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,166
And if something does,

131
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,000
having you there could
make a difference.

132
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,833
You really think so?

133
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,375
All right. I honestly
don't think

134
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,625
there's anything that I
can do against AnchoR.

135
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,666
But if you want my help,
then you've got it.

136
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,250
I hoped you would say that.
Thank you, Miss Marie.

137
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,625
I'm starting to wonder
if she'll come.

138
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,708
[NAOTO] She will.
She knows that you're here.

139
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,333
She'll come because she
wants you to destroy her.

140
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,750
She's weak and
tired of fighting.

141
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,708
This isn't going to be easy.

142
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,041
I realize that.

143
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,791
But I know you can do it.

144
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,666
You can save her.

145
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,125
Can you hear me, AnchoR?

146
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,625
I hope so.

147
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,625
I know you are trapped, but your
voice reached my master.

148
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,666
I will do what he has asked.

149
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,291
Because I am his servant,
and your older sister.

150
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,791
I'm going to save you.

151
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,125
But not alone.

152
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,083
You will have to fight, too.

153
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,000
Do whatever you can
to protect yourself

154
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,291
from the thing that binds you.

With your limitless heat energy,

you tore open the

AnchoR was.

The difference between our
combat power is evident.

And only becoming more so.

183

However, that difference is not
always the deciding factor

One hit from her,
and it'll be over.

191
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,416
Now, time to implement the plan.

192
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,375
[RYUZU]
If I were to fight AnchoR,

193
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,000
my chance of winning
would be nearly zero.

194
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,416
You don't need to win, though.

195
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,250
All you have to do is
destroy that ugly mask.

196
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:36,791
[RYUZU] Even if I
activate the Mute Scream,

197
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,375
the result would be the same.

198
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,000
[NAOTO] Then as far as I can
see, we only have one option.

199
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,625
You'll just have to
use me as a shield.

200
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,333
Absolutely not.

201
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,250
Are you offering to trade
your life for AnchoR's?

202
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,708
Do you truly think that is
an acceptable sacrifice?

I have cut my offensive and

But that is not what

My master has put

Knowing that makes
anything possible.

214
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,166
I must succeed.

215
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,333
Technically, I'll be putting
my life on the line,

216
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,666
but I have no
intention of dying.

I won't sacrifice you, either,

218
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,333
nor do I mean to
give up on AnchoR.

219
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:44,625
I believe in you.
I know you can do this.

220
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:49,375
Besides, I'm pretty sure AnchoR
isn't able to kill humans.

221
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,250
When we were fighting
in the factory in Mie,

222
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:55,333
she didn't target me or Marie
once, despite having the chance.

223
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:59,166
There's too much at stake
to base a decision on that.

224
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,416
She isn't herself.

She's being controlled
by something else now.

to change things up
at the last minute

256

he has complete faith in me.

319
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,458
[ANCHOR]
Yes.

320
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,708
[RYUZU] This is Naoto Miura.
He is my master.

321
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,916
Would you like for him to
be your master as well?

322
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,916
That depends on whether or not
he would like to be my master.

323
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,458
Oh, yeah, I'm totally
down for that!

324
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,708
All right, then.

325
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,000
[NAOTO]
Hm?

326
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,958
Requirement for
registering master.

327
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,833
Question. Tell me, who am I?

328
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,000
You will only be registered
as her master

329
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,833
if you are able to answer
that question correctly.

330
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,583
Make sure you take your
time and think carefully.

331
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,666
Who are you? That's easy.

332
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,500
Your name's AnchoR, and you're
a super cute automaton girl.

333
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,500
So, how was that?
Did I pass the test?

334
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,416
What the hell kind of
answer was that?!

335
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,958
Answer accepted.

336
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,250
What? That was a lame answer.

337
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,916
She's an Initial-Y Series unit

338
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
equipped with the
Perpetual Gear!

339
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,875
[NAOTO] AnchoR is a
one-of-a-kind automaton,

340
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,125
so beautifully constructed that
she's practically a work of art.

341
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,291
She's sweet, and shy, and
almost ridiculously cute.

342
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,000
She just so happens
to come equipped

343
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,166
with a few flashy weapons.

344
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,250
[ANCHOR]
I am Initial-Y series Unit Four.

345
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:02,583
"One who annihilates"... AnchoR.

346
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:06,333
Naoto Miura,
you will be my master.

347
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,750
I await your command.

348
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,833
Master Naoto, after she has
completed master registration,

349
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,916
AnchoR is not permitted
to exercise free will.

350
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,541
As Miss Marie pointed out,

351
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,125
AnchoR is first and
foremost a weapon.

352
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:24,541
Do weapons require
consciousness?

353
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,708
That's not what I
was trying to imply.

354
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,250
You have a choice to make.

355
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,333
As her master, the decision will
fall to you, and you alone.

356
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:35,041
Think carefully.

357
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,583
[NAOTO] AnchoR, what
would you like to do?

358
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,333
Can you think about it and
tell me what you want?

359
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,083
Certainly, Master.

360
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,875
I would like to perform
the tasks I was created for

361
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,750
as "One Who Annihilates."

362
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,875
[NAOTO] Mm-mm. I'm not
talking about duties.

363
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:54,208
Not what you're supposed to do,
but what you want to do.

364
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,625
[ANCHOR]
Yes, Master.

365
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,875
However, that answer
is impossible.

366
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:01,458
At present, this unit's
free will is locked.

367
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,666
Okay. We'll have to
unlock it, then.

368
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,708
Huh?

369
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,625
Yes, Master. Requesting details.

370
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,250
Is this an order to
act however I wish?

371
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,250
According to my own judgment?

372
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,000
Unlock everything
that is preventing you

373
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,291
from having free will.

374
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,666
Consider that my official order.

375
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,500
You understand?

376
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,791
You are allowed to do
anything you want.

377
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,541
I'm not going to stop you.

378
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,250
Wait, anything... that I want?

379
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,125
[NAOTO]
Of course!

380
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,666
I want permission...

381
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,416
Huh?

382
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,000
[ANCHOR]
I want permission... to cry.

383
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,416
May I?

384
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,625
Go ahead, AnchoR. Cry.

385
00:20:55,708 --> 00:21:00,416
[ANCHOR cries]

386
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,250
I want further permission.

387
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,000
Okay.

388
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,333
May I please... touch you?

389
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,416
Yeah, sure.

390
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,541
[ANCHOR]
And may I... apologize?

391
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:22,250
You don't have to, but you
can if it's what you want.

392
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:26,000
[ANCHOR cries]
I'm sorry. So sorry.

393
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,541
Sorry... Sorry.

394
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,041
[NAOTO grunts]

395
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:33,041
[crying continues] I'm so sorry.

396
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,833
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

397
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,250
I'm so sorry!

398
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:42,750
[ANCHOR sobs]

399
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,500
You can be a real
jerk sometimes,

400
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,791
you do know that, right?

401
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,416
If that is how your feeble brain

402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,041
interprets what has
happened today,

403
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:54,041
then I'm afraid I'm
unable to help you.

404
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:58,250
So, I don't have to
destroy things anymore?

405
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,541
Nope. You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

406
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,833
[giggles]

407
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:08,958
[RYUZU] Master Naoto, I don't
know where your path will lead,

408
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:13,625
but wherever it does, I believe
I am meant to follow.

409
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,833
[MARIE] Our plan to protect
the capital and save AnchoR

410
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:02,791
appears to have been a success.

411
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:06,375
Until we realize the giant
weapon has not been deactivated.

412
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,083
It emerges from underground,

413
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:11,125
equipped with the forbidden
power of electromagnetism,

414
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:14,333
a force that may disrupt the
workings of the Clockwork Planet

415
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,916
and alter the destiny
of the human race.

416
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,750
Next time: "Yatsukahagi."

417
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:24,791
Everything. Literally everything
has been destroyed.
