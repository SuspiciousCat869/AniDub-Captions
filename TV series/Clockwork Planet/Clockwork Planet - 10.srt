1
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,125
[SOLDIER B]
Huh?

2
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,083
Enemy fire!

3
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,666
Everyone hold positions!

4
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,083
[RYUZU]
May I have your attention?

5
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,166
[gasps]

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,958
I am Initial-Y Series
Unit One, RyuZU,

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,250
also known as One Who Follows.

8
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,416
And, I'm Initial-Y Series
Unit Four, AnchoR,

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,833
One Who Annihilates.

10
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,083
[RYUZU] And, now that we've
made our introductions,

11
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,958
it's time to say farewell.

12
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,791
[ANCHOR] But we'll try not
to make it hurt too much.

13
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,500
[SOLDIERS gasp]

14
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,375
I'm so sorry!

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,250
[RYUZU sighs]

16
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:08,333
The last 48 hours have
been rather suffocating.

17
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,666
The fresh air makes
for a nice change.

18
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:45,625
[VERMOUTH]
Ohhh!

19
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,333
You're having fun out there.

20
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,250
[NAOTO]
Okay, got 'em. Your two o'clock.

21
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:50,500
[VERMOUTH]
Hmm?

22
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,000
[NAOTO]
In formation number five.

23
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,291
[VERMOUTH]
All right.

24
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,666
[MARIE] Hey, you sure
you're going to be able

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,291
to pull this off?

26
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,375
[VERMOUTH]
Just trust me.

27
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,458
[MARIE]
In what world would I trust you?

28
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,666
[VERMOUTH]
Well, if you can't manage that,

29
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,708
then at least trust
the body you tuned.

30
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,458
You did an amazing job
with the supplies at hand.

31
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,625
[VERMOUTH]
Now, shall we?

32
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,166
Oh, clumsy me!

33
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,875
[VERMOUTH]
Good-bye, now.

34
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,000
Sorry, no time to chat.

35
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,458
[VERMOUTH laughs]
Like it a bit rough, do you?

36
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,791
Two can play at that game.

37
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,583
Here, let me show you!

38
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,416
[SOLDIER D]
What kind of insult is this?

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,291
Being attacked
by a pleasure bot?

40
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,541
I'm gonna destroy that filth!

41
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,166
[gasps]

42
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,208
[SOLDIER D laughs]
Take that!

43
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,750
[VERMOUTH]
There.

44
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,125
Alrighty, then,
let's take a peek inside.

45
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:49,666
[gasps]

46
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,791
[VERMOUTH] Hey, kid, this is
a pretty sweet ride you've got.

47
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,125
Let's make a deal:

48
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,916
Hand it over, and I'll let
you have this cigarette.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,083
Sound good?

50
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,041
"Sure. No problem!"
Good decision.

51
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,791
Now, you're going
to take a little trip.

52
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,541
Feel free to send me a postcard.

53
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,291
[screams]

54
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,625
It's been a pleasure!

55
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:09,333
Honestly, complete the mission
without any human casualties?

56
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,625
That's a hell of a lot easier
said than done, Naoto.

57
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,291
[VERMOUTH]
There.

58
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,458
Show me your moves, baby.

59
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,166
Give me everything you've got!

60
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,708
[MARIE] You want me
to hook Halter's brain

61
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,500
up to a heavily armed automaton?

62
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,083
That's a crazy idea!

63
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
[NAOTO]
No, it's not.

64
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,125
I really think
he could handle it.

65
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,083
Do you have any clue how
many things can go wrong

66
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,958
when you attempt
something like that?

67
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,916
I wasn't worried about it
with you because I didn't care

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,208
about the outcome,
but the point is, it's risky.

69
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,916
Please, tell me how
you really feel.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,916
Besides, there's no
precedent for this kind of--

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,833
[VERMOUTH]
There is, though.

72
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,208
[MARIE]
Hmm?

73
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,666
Directly wiring
a weapon to a brain--

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,666
no, it's not exactly
common practice,

75
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,333
but it has been done before.

76
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,000
And by none other
than our man Halter.

77
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,666
[MARIE]
No way, I never--

78
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,583
[NAOTO]
Perfect. Then it's settled.

79
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,166
Now, we just need
to see if the enemy

80
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,208
has a suitable body for us.

81
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,666
[VERMOUTH]
What?

82
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,500
You're talking about nabbing
a heavily armed automaton

83
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,625
from the middle
of hostile forces?

84
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,125
Where are you gonna find
someone nuts enough to do that?

85
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,000
Heh. I think I know the
perfect man for the job.

86
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:16,041
[VERMOUTH chuckles]

87
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,208
[roars]

88
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,250
[VERMOUTH]
There you are, Genbu.

89
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,000
I've been waiting.

90
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,625
[MARIE]
I have a condition.

91
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,500
What was the body
that Halter used?

92
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,416
Do you know?

93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,833
It was an HS-FK2 Oberon.

94
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,375
They're not deployed
anywhere in this country.

95
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,041
The Oberon, huh?

96
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,250
[MARIE]
I want a CZ-35 Genbu.

97
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,500
They use the same design
philosophy as the Oberon

98
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,083
and should be deployed
at the Pillar of Heaven.

99
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,208
That was quick.

100
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,291
What, do you have the blueprint

101
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,416
for every automaton
model memorized?

102
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,916
Yup, know 'em all by heart.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,166
It comes in handy.

104
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,708
[VERMOUTH]
Uh! Are you shitting me?

105
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,000
[VERMOUTH cackles]

106
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,500
This is freaking awesome!

107
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,375
Come on, a little
love tap like that

108
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,875
is no way to satisfy a girl.

109
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,375
Watch and learn, friend.

110
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,041
When I give you my spear,
you won't forget it!

111
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,375
[VERMOUTH] Man, there's
nothing like a cigarette

112
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,291
after taking care of business.

113
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:42,916
[MARIE] Is it physically
impossible for you

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,166
to open your mouth
without being filthy?

115
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,166
[VERMOUTH laughs]

116
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,375
Such delicate sensibilities.

117
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,708
Anyway, I destroyed the Genbu's
artificial intelligence unit

118
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,375
but left it intact otherwise.

119
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,666
The remaining enemies
have been taken out as well.

120
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,750
Is there anything I missed?

121
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:03,708
Wow, I was half-convinced we'd
asked you to do the impossible.

122
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,375
Well, I did my job,
now it's your turn.

123
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,875
[MARIE]
Damn straight it is.

124
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,041
[MARIE]
This is it.

125
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,541
If I mess up,
I could lose him for good.

126
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,750
[VERMOUTH] Let me tell you
something that might help.

127
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,291
[MARIE]
Hm?

128
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,041
[VERMOUTH] For a career soldier,
fighting is like breathing.

129
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,250
And your right-hand man
is nothing if not a soldier.

130
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,875
Knowing old man Halter, the
scent of the battlefield alone

131
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,750
would probably be enough to
bring him back from the dead.

132
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,000
Fair warning, though,

133
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,250
he'll likely be in the
worst mood imaginable.

134
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:41,875
[NAOTO]
Marie.

135
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:42,750
[MARIE]
Hm?

136
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,916
They're gathering more troops.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,583
I think you'll have
about... 30 seconds.

138
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:50,500
Got it?

139
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,250
Yeah.

140
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,958
I'm ready to do this.

141
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,500
[MARIE] I can't afford
to make a single mistake.

142
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,875
One error and
Halter will be gone.

143
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,083
Hyah!

144
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,708
[MARIE]
Now!

145
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,958
[MARIE]
Dismantling all 2,876 parts

146
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,083
of the destroyed processing
unit: 4.2 seconds.

147
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,333
[MARIE] Connecting all
the parts: 7.6 seconds.

148
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,875
Testing the nerves: 6.1 seconds.

149
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,833
Tuning the control unit:
4.9 seconds.

150
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,458
Rebooting the chassis:
3.3 seconds.

151
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,041
4.1 seconds until
consciousness returns.

152
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,250
A total of 30.2 seconds,

153
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,666
which means I can't afford
to make a single error.

154
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,666
[MARIE]
My hands are too slow.

155
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,541
I have to move faster than this!

156
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,833
Are you really
she's human, Naoto?

157
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,333
It's kind of hard to believe
once you've seen her work.

158
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,416
Yeah.

159
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,708
That's what genius looks like.

160
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,916
Mother's the most amazing woman!

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,708
Just look at her.

162
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,416
She can do anything!

163
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,291
It may look impressive,
but don't get carried away.

164
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,333
There are limits to what
humans are able to accomplish.

165
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,666
At least there are, for now.

166
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,125
[MARIE]
I can see it all.

167
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,166
Every part of this
machine is visible to me.

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,833
And my perception
is only expanding.

169
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,125
[MARIE] There seem to be
no limits to this new sight.

170
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,583
I could use it to
grasp the entire city.

171
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,625
[MARIE]
Huh?

172
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:41,000
That's an SK-30
self-propelled artillery unit.

173
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,666
Crap, its projectiles fly
at supersonic speed.

174
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,625
[MARIE]
They haven't noticed it yet.

175
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,416
Even Naoto can't hear
something moving that fast.

176
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,416
Come on, I thought I'd
connected everything perfectly!

177
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Wake up!

178
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,666
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up!

179
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,000
You have to wake up, Halter!

180
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,333
[gasps]

181
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,125
[RYUZU]
Huh?

182
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,958
[HALTER]
Those bastards.

183
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,791
That's what happens
to anyone stupid enough

184
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,791
to point a gun at me.

185
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,500
Is it you?

186
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,583
Halter!

187
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,083
Yeah!

188
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,875
[HALTER] Huh?
What's going on here?

189
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,583
You hooked me up
to an automaton?

190
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,125
What trouble have
you gotten yourself into?

191
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,958
[MARIE] It's not me
I'm worried about right now.

192
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,416
Where the hell have you been?

193
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,708
[HALTER]
Oh, yeah, sorry about that.

194
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,875
I was sleeping.

195
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,458
Sleeping?

196
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,875
[HALTER] It's been a long time
since I've slept that deeply.

197
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,041
Once my sensory receptors
were disconnected,

198
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,708
I kind of drifted off I guess.

199
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,166
Uh...

200
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,750
[NAOTO] Well, old man,
how's the new body?

201
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,125
[HALTER]
Just fine.

202
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,000
Like you'd expect with
our princess doing the work.

203
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,333
[NAOTO] If you're up for it,
I've got a job for you.

204
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,458
[HALTER]
So you're giving the orders now.

205
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,625
All right, what's the job?

206
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,708
I need you to destroy the
remaining 378 enemy units.

207
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,041
You've got 38 seconds, and we
don't want any humans killed.

208
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,875
Sound good?

209
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,750
[HALTER]
Oh, come on.

210
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,958
That's too easy.

211
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:31,500
[VERMOUTH]
Aw, man! Look at him go!

212
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,458
Looks like 38 seconds
was a bit generous.

213
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,458
[HALTER]
Hey, Princess.

214
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,750
[MARIE]
Huh?!

215
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,250
[HALTER] This body's
heavier than I'm used to,

216
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,416
but it's working great.

217
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, of course it is!

218
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,750
It was tuned by
yours truly, after all!

219
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,583
[HALTER]
I almost pity these guys.

220
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,000
I mean, I'm always
a little grouchy

221
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,833
when I wake up from a nap,
but after such a long one,

222
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,500
I'm in the worst
mood imaginable.

223
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,083
[REPORTER A] What we're
seeing now is unbelievable.

224
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,291
The security forces that
guard the Pillar of Heaven

225
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,208
were overrun in minutes.

226
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,625
And leading the group of
attackers is the same boy

227
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,500
who orchestrated the
takeover of Akihabara!

228
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,083
Nnnnh!

229
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,833
Hey! How is everybody today?

230
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,375
You haven't forgotten
me already, have you?

231
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,208
I thought I had an awesome
party set up in Akihabara,

232
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,541
but you military boys
made it too easy!

233
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,833
Here's hoping you'll put up
a better fight next time.

234
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,625
Who is this little brat?

235
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,791
What's his connection
to the Shiga group?

236
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,500
Now for the exciting news: after
that last disappointing shindig,

237
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,750
we've decided to go all out and
drop the entire multiple grid

238
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,333
that comprises Tokyo
into the abyss!

239
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,458
Yes!

240
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,666
Is this a joke?

241
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,708
[NAOTO]
Oh, excuse me!

242
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,833
I almost forgot that I have a
very special guest to introduce.

243
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,583
I have a feeling
you'll recognize her.

244
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,625
[OFFICIALS gasp]

245
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,250
It's Her Highness, Hoshinomiya.

246
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,625
[HOUKO]
Please listen carefully.

247
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,125
The Pillar of Heaven is tasked
with the governance of Tokyo

248
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,458
and the control of our
country's Core Towers.

249
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,125
It has been seized
by an unknown group

250
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,458
and is no longer
under our command.

251
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,291
This broadcast should
leave no doubt of that.

252
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,791
I know, this is frightening,
but please try to remain calm.

253
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,916
We hope for an orderly
evacuation of the capital.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,333
Thank you all.

255
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,916
[KARASAWA]
No point staying here.

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,625
I need to get my report
to Meister Marie.

257
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,750
[GENNAI]
So...

258
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,000
They've made
the Yatsukahagi a pawn,

259
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,166
manipulating its presence
to suit their needs.

260
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,000
But why claim responsibility
for crimes we committed?

261
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,791
What is their motivation?

262
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:40,833
Are they setting
themselves up as martyrs?

263
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,875
Divert all energy to the main
cannon's charger at once.

264
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,583
You heard His Excellency,
prioritize main cannon!

265
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,291
[GENNAI]
Can you guess my next move, Y?

266
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's see.

267
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,291
[KONRAD] I'm sorry
if I've kept you waiting,

268
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,750
but I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

269
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,958
Karasawa's been keeping an eye
on the Japanese government

270
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:03,000
for us, and he sent
word of a new development.

271
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,250
They intend to use the Tall Wand
against the Yatsukahagi.

272
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,625
[gasps]

273
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:11,041
It will be dropped from
orbit today at 1400 exactly.

274
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,666
Roughly 6 hours
and 45 minutes from now.

275
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,541
That's insane!

276
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:25,041
Ahhh... How did I live
before I knew this joy?

277
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,333
Even the gods themselves
are envious of the treasure

278
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,958
that is my lap.

279
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,333
There is no earthly
luxury that can rival it.

280
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,625
Um, Father,
may I have permission?

281
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,083
Heck, yeah!

282
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,416
Sweetie, come on over here
and give your dad a snuggle.

283
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,250
Yay!

284
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,916
There. Good girl!

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,666
This is nice.

286
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,583
You're so warm.

287
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,000
Oh, yeah?!

288
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,375
Who's the happiest man
to ever walk the face of this

289
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,833
or any other planet?

290
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:55,000
That's right: me!

291
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,958
[MARIE] If we can bring
down the Yatsukahagi,

292
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,208
the government won't have
a reason to use the Tall Wand.

293
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,958
Everyone knows what to do.

294
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,166
Let's get to work.

295
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,333
[ENGINEERS]
Right!

296
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,500
[HOUKO]
I'm sorry.

297
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,333
May I have a word?

298
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,375
I'll be right back.

299
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,083
Can you take over for me?

300
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,666
[KONRAD]
Heh.

301
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,250
[HOUKO] It's been such
a long while, Marie.

302
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,708
I went to your funeral,
of course.

303
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,833
[MARIE] At which they
buried an empty coffin.

304
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,375
I'm surprised to see
you still wear the watch.

305
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,916
[HOUKO]
Why wouldn't I?

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,291
After all, a friend
made it for me.

307
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,250
That makes it
a prized possession.

308
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,916
Hold on, you two
know each other?

309
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
[MARIE]
Yes, we do.

310
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,041
We met at a university in Europe

311
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,166
where I was spending
a year abroad.

312
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,583
I was slow.

313
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,083
I took the whole year,
but Marie was done in a month.

314
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,791
If I hadn't been
goofing off with you,

315
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,791
I'd have graduated in a week!

316
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,666
Oh? I'm so sorry.

317
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,583
I didn't realize
I was holding you back.

318
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,625
It was fun.

319
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,583
Not like I'm complaining
or anything.

320
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,708
Okay, I've been patient,
but I must know.

321
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,041
Will you tell me what you
want with the Pillar of Heaven?

322
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,916
I suppose.

323
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,583
How much do you know about
the situation in Akihabara

324
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,333
and the weapon
that's appeared there?

325
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,500
[HOUKO] From what I've heard,
Shiga is behind this mess.

326
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,291
It appears they are
attempting a coup d'état.

327
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,000
It seems that,
judging from its attack,

328
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,875
the weapon is most likely
electromagnetic in nature.

329
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,291
[MARIE]
Pretty impressive.

330
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,875
[HOUKO]
So, it's true, then?

331
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,416
Yes.

332
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,875
The electromagnetic pulse it
emitted magnetized Akihabara.

333
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,375
But, if we can find a way
to destroy the weapon

334
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,416
and demagnetize the city,
repairs would be possible.

335
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,041
[MARIE] Our plan is to
light a fire under its butt.

336
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,333
We're gonna turn up the heat,
to two thousand degrees.

337
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,250
[HOUKO]
Wow.

338
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,083
[MARIE] And the only
way we can do that,

339
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,541
is by using the
Pillar of Heaven.

340
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,833
I bet you'll never guess
whose idea this was.

341
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,666
[gasps]

342
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,500
Can't take it! Too much!

343
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,375
I'm gonna die
from all the happy!

344
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,250
No, Father, you can't die!

345
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,458
Don't worry, my dear!

346
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,250
With you here, I'm invincible!

347
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,041
Your papa will stay
by your side forever!

348
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,916
Ah... I'm so glad!

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,875
There, there!
I'll never leave you!

350
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,166
[ANCHOR giggles]

351
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,375
As you can see,

352
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,500
he is the biggest idiot
in the entire world.

353
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,875
Even so, he's an idiot who
knows how to get things done.

354
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,250
[HOUKO]
Hmm...

355
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,500
[NAOTO]
All right. I figured it out.

356
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,875
Let's do it, Marie.

357
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,000
Ready?

358
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,500
[HOUKO]
Uh...

359
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,916
[HOUKO] So, he truly analyzed
the Pillar of Heaven's

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,250
components using
nothing but his hearing?

361
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,375
[MARIE]
Sounds ridiculous, right?

362
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,791
[HOUKO]
Yes.

363
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,791
But, if you of all people
believe in him, so will I.

364
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:49,125
I do hate to say this, but his
existence poses a real threat.

365
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,500
He could endanger
the public safety.

366
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,500
Oh, the guy's
a hazard all right.

367
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,458
It might be wise if we
took steps to contain him.

368
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,458
Huh?!

369
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,666
Huh? Oh, god. Ow!

370
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,208
I had not realized
you had a death wish.

371
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:06,250
In that case, please feel free
to take half a step forward.

372
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,875
I'm more than happy
to offer you an end

373
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,125
that will be quick
and relatively painless.

374
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,916
You'll hardly feel a thing.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I won't let anyone hurt Father.

376
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:16,458
[sighs]

377
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,541
[HOUKO]
I apologize.

378
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,500
You may lower that now.

379
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
I mean him no harm.

380
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,333
[NAOTO]
Hey, RyuZU!

381
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,416
What's up with you
flying away like that?

382
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,041
I hit my head!

383
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,750
[RYUZU]
I am very sorry, Master. Truly.

384
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,625
It certainly wasn't my
intention to harm you, but,

385
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,500
perhaps the fall revitalized
your sluggish brain cells.

386
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,041
Aw... That was pretty harsh...

387
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,125
[ANCHOR]
Pain, pain, go away.

388
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,291
Come again another day!

389
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,958
He's a strange person.

390
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,833
You can say that again.

391
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,083
Well, I'm gonna
get back to work.

392
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,625
Wouldn't things
get completed faster

393
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,916
if he helped you instead
of lying around here?

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,375
[MARIE]
Honestly, Naoto's done more

395
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,375
than his fair share already.

396
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,750
Now it's time
for me to do my job.

397
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,041
I don't think I could stand
losing to someone like him.

398
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay, everything
should be set here.

399
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,500
What's up AnchoR?

Oh, hi, Mother.

401
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:15,416
Would you please stop
calling me that, already?

402
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,333
Why are you here?

403
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:18,041
Where are Naoto and RyuZU?

404
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,750
[ANCHOR] Father said there
was something important

405
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,041
he needed to
discuss with sister.

406
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:22,916
Oh, yeah?

407
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,750
I wonder what that's about.

Well, back to work.

[MARIE sighs]

411
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,541
Hey, you know, if you're
not busy, you could help me.

412
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,875
Huh...?

413
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,291
[NAOTO laughs]
Amazing!

414
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,708
Look at the flowers!

415
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,500
There's an entire garden of 'em!

416
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,708
Master Naoto,
I'm very eager to know why

417
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,041
you've brought me
to a place like this.

418
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,708
Do you have a flower kink
I should know about?

419
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,833
[NAOTO] Call me crazy,
but I feel like you've avoided

420
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,875
looking at me
for the past few days.

421
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,916
I don't know what
you're talking about.

422
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,250
Perhaps the more pertinent issue

423
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:16,458
here is the serious
over-inflation of your ego.

424
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:20,666
Do you expect me to spend
all of my time looking at you--

425
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,208
RyuZU.

426
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,458
Tell me.

427
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,250
I can't look at you.

428
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,583
I don't dare.

429
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:34,041
The destiny of this
planet is in these hands,

430
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,833
and because of
my severe failings,

431
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,958
they have suffered
irreparable harm.

432
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:44,625
I don't deserve your
forgiveness, but I am sorry.

433
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,833
You're safe, and that's
all that matters to me.

434
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,291
Why not try thinking of them
as badges of my masculinity?

435
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,250
[RYUZU]
I cannot.

436
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,541
I've proven myself to
be a worthless servant.

437
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,375
Please punish me.

438
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:03,833
[NAOTO]
All right, then.

439
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,625
Close your eyes.

440
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:14,791
[NAOTO]
Now, open them.

441
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,416
[RYUZU]
Huh?

442
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,250
Master Naoto?

443
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:22,875
What's this?

444
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,708
Is this ring my punishment?

445
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,166
Yeah. That's what it is.

446
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,625
I designed and made it myself.

447
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,416
Wearing this ring
is your punishment.

448
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,166
So, um, don't ever take it off.

449
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,708
[RYUZU] I'm afraid to inform
you this sort of gesture

450
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,708
is only appreciated when made
by a certain type of man.

451
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,375
Generally, somebody
who is better looking

452
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,583
and smarter than you are.

453
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:56,125
[NAOTO]
Eh heh... So ruthless.

454
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,750
Promise me, Master.

455
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,625
Swear you will never do
something like this again.

456
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,500
Of course, I'm sorry I--

457
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,166
This once. And never again.

458
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,041
[NAOTO]
Just this one time, RyuZU.

459
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,875
[RYUZU]
For better or worse.

460
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,125
In sickness and health.

461
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,958
Master Naoto.

462
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,416
[NAOTO] It's only a matter
of time before the Tall Wand

463
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,291
is deployed and the Yatsukahagi
is recharged and ready to fight.

464
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,125
Marie and the others
work relentlessly,

465
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,416
but their efforts
are nothing in the face

466
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,458
of Gennai's deep-rooted
delusions and hostility.

467
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:14,000
In spite of everything, though,
I refuse to give up hope!

468
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,833
Next time, "Theory of Y."

469
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,958
As much as it disgusts me
to say it to your face,

470
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,708
you're a genius, Marie!

471
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,625
All this time, it's been
your talent that's made

472
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:25,791
my random power
into something useful!
