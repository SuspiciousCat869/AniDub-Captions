00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,666
[PEOPLE yelling]

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,916
[MARIE]
We've gotta hurry!

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,875
There isn't much
time left to stop it.

4
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:32,125
Besides, the faster we go,
the sooner I get to meet AnchoR!

5
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,458
That's your priority?

6
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,708
Ugh!

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,541
What, you're just
gonna stop there?

8
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:41,500
[MARIE] We don't have
time for a longer lecture.

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,791
It's too quiet.

10
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,041
[HALTER] We haven't seen
a single soul so far.

11
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,333
You think the military
forced them to leave?

12
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,333
[MARIE] Honestly, that
might be for the best.

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,166
They'll be safer that way.

14
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,916
There are people in there,
more than a few.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,416
[HALTER gasps]

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,125
What d'you know?

17
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,458
[MARIE]
You're all here!

18
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,166
Oh! I'm glad to see
you're in one piece.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,750
What are you doing?
Why haven't you evacuated?

20
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,833
Hey, what do you think of us?

21
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,000
Running away when there's
still work left to do?

22
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,083
We'd never be so irresponsible.

23
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,041
[gasps]

24
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,708
I'm sorry for doubting you.
Of course you wouldn't.

25
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,791
[rumbling]

26
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,083
Another anomaly, huh?

27
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:31,875
Do you have any
new leads for us?

28
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,125
[MARIE]
Better than that.

29
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,666
I've got the answer to
our problem right here.

30
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,833
Naoto!

31
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,833
Oh my God, it's so beautiful!

32
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,125
I've never seen anything
like this before!

33
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,375
Oh! Look at all the gears...

34
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,583
He's certainly enthusiastic.

35
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:48,083
Naoto!

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,291
Oh, wow! It's so
gorgeous I could cry!

37
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,916
Seriously, can you imagine
the genius it takes

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,208
to design and build something

39
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,833
that's not only
perfectly functional

40
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,041
but also incredibly beautiful?

41
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,291
He is such an idiot!

42
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,708
Excuse me, Master,

43
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,458
but I believe you have
better things to do

44
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,958
than gush over this mechanism.

45
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,916
Yeah, you tell him, RyuZU!

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,041
Your juvenile outburst is
unseemly and unacceptable.

47
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,750
You are giving this
mold-covered antique

48
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,041
higher praise than you give me.

49
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,708
That's not the point here!

50
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,791
You looked at my entire
body, even inside me,

51
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:53,375
and you said I was
the most beautiful,

52
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,375
perfect thing you'd ever seen,

53
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,958
but now I can see those
words were just a lie.

54
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,416
I wasn't lying! You are
beautiful and perfect.

55
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,166
But still, these gears
are pretty amazing, too.

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,208
Can't I like you both? Eh?

57
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,250
[RYUZU]
I see.

58
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,083
As long as there
are gears involved,

59
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,875
you don't care who
they're attached to.

60
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,583
Not true! You're the best!

61
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:15,750
Nobody has gears
like you, RyuZU...

62
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,041
[RYUZU]
I see what you're doing.

63
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,375
You want me to take
my clothes off.

64
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,916
No, I didn't say anything
about you stripping!

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,875
Keep your clothes on,

66
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,000
--I beg you!
--I've had enough!

67
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,625
Shut up! Right now!

68
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:26,875
Don't push me!

69
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,000
Then stop acting like a
love-struck school girl

70
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,333
and get to work!

71
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,208
[RYUZU] I would expect a
Meister to demonstrate...

72
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,708
[KONRAD]
Interesting.

73
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:38,041
How did that boy come across
an Initial-Y Series Unit?

74
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,125
Ahem.

75
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:42,541
Now, allow me to
introduce him properly.

76
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,250
This is Naoto Miura.

77
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,916
I'm sure some of you will find
this difficult to believe,

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
but with his help,
I think we'll be able

79
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,083
to repair the Core Tower.

80
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,625
[ALL]
Hmm...

81
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,791
Those aren't... the most
welcoming looks I've ever seen.

82
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,083
I'm sure you've noticed,
he is an idiot.

83
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,250
[NAOTO]
Hey. Shut up!

84
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,041
That said, he's an idiot
we need right now.

85
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,458
The truth is, this kid is
the only hope we have left.

86
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,958
[ALL gasp]

87
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,833
[KONRAD]
Time's running out.

88
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,750
Three hours and 57
minutes until the purge.

89
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,208
We may have some
reservations about this boy,

90
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,500
but following Meister
Marie's lead is our best bet.

91
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,916
Understood, sir.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,458
You won't be sorry.

93
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,250
Well?

94
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,000
Right. Give me a sec.

95
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,750
I will hold those for you.

96
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,125
Cool, thank you.

97
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,833
[NAOTO]
There. That's one.

98
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,541
[NAOTO]
Two...

99
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,708
[NAOTO]
Three.

100
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,125
Mind telling us what he's doing?

101
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,666
Be quiet.

102
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,750
[sighs]

103
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,333
Good work, Master.

104
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,958
Would you like these back now?

105
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,750
Yeah, thanks a lot.

106
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,875
What did you find?

107
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,791
[NAOTO]
Eighteen spots.

108
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,208
That isn't very many.

109
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,041
Actually, there are 4,047
irregularities that exist,

110
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,458
but those 18 are
the only ones

111
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,833
connected to the
gravity anomaly.

112
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,541
[ENGINEERS gasp]

113
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,625
That's more doable
than I expected.

114
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,416
Now tell me where they are.

115
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,166
I don't really know
how to read that.

116
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,041
Just give me a rough idea.

117
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,208
I'll figure the rest
out from there.

118
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,666
We're ready to assist you.

119
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,125
Simply tell us what
needs to be done.

120
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,250
It will go faster
if we split up.

121
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,291
You and your team can take the
12 problems up on Level 3.

122
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,291
[ENGINEERS]
Got it!

123
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,666
[MARIE]
Please move quickly.

124
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,291
Skip the inspection and move
straight to repair work.

125
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,750
Halter, get the materials
we need and follow me.

126
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,125
[HALTER]
Roger that.

127
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,333
There is an irregularity here.

128
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,166
That boy can't even
read a blueprint.

129
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,041
So how did he find this?

130
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,375
There we go.

131
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,083
All finished up over here.

132
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,166
Yeah here, too.

133
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,583
This one's done.

134
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,791
Good to go, sir.

135
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,125
This one's taken care of.

136
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,041
Excellent work.

137
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,625
One of the problems is in a spot
a human won't be able to get to.

138
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,166
So, RyuZU?

139
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,458
[RYUZU] The only person I take
orders from is Master Naoto.

140
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,208
Please, RyuZU. Fix it?

141
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,416
Very well, as you wish.

142
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:20,833
[MARIE] From your current
location, jump up 52.3 meters.

143
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,625
Rotate 47.5 degrees
horizontally,

144
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:28,916
then proceed upward
another 14.25 meters.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,250
Look for a loose gear with a
diameter of 0.07 micrometers.

146
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,750
[RYUZU]
This must be it.

147
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,916
[MARIE]
That gear has to be fixed

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,541
without a break in its rotation.

149
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:41,083
I hate to admit it, but you're
the only one who can do this.

150
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,458
The gear is repaired.

151
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,291
Am I part of the materials
she told you to bring?

152
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,416
[HALTER] Very delicate material.
I'll handle you with care.

153
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,833
Thanks, I think. Hm?

154
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,500
Marie, the spot you're
looking for is up there.

155
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,125
[MARIE] Fourth from the
right edge, correct?

156
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,041
[NAOTO] Yeah. But you'll
need a scaffold to reach it.

157
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,875
[MARIE]
We don't have time for that.

158
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,125
[NAOTO]
Hey, what are you--?

159
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,541
[HALTER]
Just watch. You'll see.

160
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,291
Amazing.

161
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,500
[chuckles]

162
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,750
Okay, on to the next one.

163
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,375
Impressive, huh?
The princess has skills.

164
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,333
Uh-huh.

165
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,125
[HALTER]
That head of hers may look tiny,

166
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,500
but inside it, she's
got every single defect

167
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,750
and repair method stored away.

168
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,083
All she has to do
is consult that data

169
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,750
and she can determine the best
course of action in an instant.

170
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:58,708
That is the gift of
Marie Bell Breguet.

171
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:02,833
She's no ordinary Meister.
You're not the only genius here.

172
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,083
[HALTER] Well done, Princess.
Another job well done.

173
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,208
That was the last one!

174
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,541
[chuckles]

175
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,833
[NAOTO chuckles]

176
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,833
Nicely done, Marie.

177
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,000
[HANNES] The Brown's
constant of Floor 24's

178
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,958
pressure control block appears
to have returned to normal.

179
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,666
The dissonance is gone.

180
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,333
Everything sounds right.

181
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,833
How's it looking, Hannes?

182
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,416
Finishing checks now.

183
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,583
We are all clear.

184
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,541
Are you saying what
I think you are?

185
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,541
[HANNES]
I can't believe this.

186
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,291
The repairs succeeded.
We really did it!

187
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,708
[ENGINEERS gasp]

188
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,875
[ENGINEERS cheering]

189
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,875
[KARASAWA] This is unreal! I
didn't think we stood a chance!

190
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,833
[ENGINEER B] It's not a dream,
right? It really happened?

191
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:59,916
[ENGINEER F] Damn, boys, we did
it! We actually pulled it off!

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,666
[HANNES]
I'm sorry for doubting you.

193
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,375
You really came through!

194
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,083
[NAOTO] Huh? But...
I didn't do anything.

195
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,416
What are you talking about?

196
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,791
We couldn't have
done it without you.

197
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,208
If we don't know what's
broken, we can't fix it.

198
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,625
We'd been working for
days to identify the spots

199
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,958
that needed repairing.

200
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,333
You did what we were unable to.

201
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,666
Oh, really?

202
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,791
You mean I was useful?

203
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,041
Useful?

204
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,291
You just saved the lives
of 20 million people.

205
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,250
[NAOTO]
Uh...

206
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:36,708
Okay.

207
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,125
That's cool!

208
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,083
--[ENGINEER H] What's that?
--[ENGINEER I] What's going on?

209
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,541
I thought we fixed it!

210
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,666
What's happening?

211
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,708
[HANNES]
It's the purge.

212
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,541
The military's
beginning the purge!

213
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,750
[growls]

214
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,208
You've got to be shitting me!

215
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,958
[OPERATOR A]
Coupling shaft disengaged.

216
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:18,291
[OPERATOR B]
Shaft number 52939 disengaged.

217
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,333
Get this done as
quickly as possible.

218
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,416
We can't afford to
waste any more time.

219
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,666
All the evidence must be
destroyed in the purge.

220
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,041
Can't you people
move any faster?

221
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,375
[grunts]

222
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,500
[MARIE]
To orchestrate the purge,

223
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,208
they'll use the gravity
control system

224
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,541
to drop the city into
the core of the planet.

225
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,375
What can we do that'll
give us the best chance

226
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,416
of stopping them?

227
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,583
Try to access the
system directly?

228
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,541
We don't have time for that.

229
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,041
Should we at least
inform the public

230
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,958
of the military's actions?

231
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,541
At this point, that would only
add to the chaos and confusion.

232
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,625
[MARIE]
There's gotta be something

233
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,125
we haven't thought of yet.

234
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,375
There must be.
Come on, Marie, think!

235
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,375
It looks like there's
something on your mind.

236
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:07,875
[NAOTO]
Uh, no. It's nothing.

237
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,291
Are you sure about that, Master?

238
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,541
If we had another hour,
no, just 30 more minutes.

239
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:23,291
That could buy me enough time to
prevent the city from falling.

240
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,291
The Imaginary Gear!

241
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,250
[NAOTO]
No!

242
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,333
[MARIE]
Uh? Naoto?

243
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,083
[MARIE] In order to prevent
the city from falling,

244
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,833
we need to find a way
to generate anti-gravity.

245
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,208
The only chance we have

246
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,916
is to use the Imaginary Gear
contained within RyuZU.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,333
It will allow us to reverse
the energy output!

248
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,541
Do you really expect
me to sacrifice her?

249
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,166
It will only be temporary.

250
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,333
But you can't guarantee
that she'll be okay!

251
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,833
I can repair her!
You just have to trust me!

252
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,708
[NAOTO] I said no!
It's not gonna happen!

253
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:12,166
[RYUZU] Master, I swear
I will honor the title

254
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,500
"One Who Follows"
and keep you safe,

255
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:17,875
no matter how perilous
the situation may be.

256
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,125
However, foolish Master Naoto,

257
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:24,166
if you aren't willing to make
the sacrifice yourself,

258
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,250
somebody else will
have to do it for you.

259
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,750
Try not to waste too
much time crying.

260
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,500
Will you at least
listen to my plan?

261
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:36,375
I don't wanna hear any more
about sacrificing RyuZU!

262
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,625
Don't be so dramatic.

263
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,916
I have faith in you, Master.

264
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,500
[ALL gasp]

265
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:05,083
[inaudible]

266
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:26,000
[wailing]

267
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,125
[NAOTO]
RyuZu.

268
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,416
[NAOTO]
Marie, you said you had a plan.

269
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,333
So tell me... what do
you need me to do?

270
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,791
[OPERATOR A]
Purge, final sequence.

271
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,166
Counting down for gravity
energy generator.

272
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,208
Commence countdown at once.

273
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:01,000
[OPERATOR A]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

274
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,416
Final stage commencing.

275
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,708
Purge confirmed. The
city is falling 50...

276
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,750
...100, 150.

277
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,916
[ringing]

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,833
Hey, what's happening?

279
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,833
[OFFICER A]
The gravity, it's been reversed.

280
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,666
Somebody is trying to
push the city back up!

281
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,000
Impossible!

282
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,583
Hurry up!
Reconfigure the system!

283
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,625
[ENGINEERS]
Right!

284
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,833
[NAOTO]
How long?

285
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,166
[MARIE]
Thirty minutes.

286
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,208
Longer than that and the
Imaginary Gear won't last.

287
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,958
RyuZU.

288
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,291
[MARIE]
Don't worry.

289
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,583
Thirty minutes is more
than enough for this.

290
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:44,875
Did you hear something?

291
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,291
There are multiple sounds
approaching quickly,

292
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,125
and they're familiar.

293
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,875
I've heard them before.

294
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,208
[LIMONS]
Find them and kill them!

295
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,416
We're too close now.

296
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,166
No one can stand in
the way of this purge.

297
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,708
Kill them all!

298
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,250
[MARIE]
We're so close!

299
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,500
[HALTER]
I'm gonna go buy you some time.

300
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:04,666
I'll be more useful out there
than in here, anyway.

301
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:15,625
[KONRAD] Mind if an old
man joins in the fun?

302
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:16,958
You sure about that?

303
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,250
[KONRAD]
I have one or two tricks

304
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,875
that make me useful in a fight.

305
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:20,833
[HALTER chuckles]

306
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,583
[HALTER]
By all means.

307
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,208
[HALTER] Nice of them to
bunch together like that.

308
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,375
There's no need to aim.

309
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,708
Very true.

310
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,291
Let's take advantage of
their formation, shall we?

311
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,500
Whoa, nice.

312
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,166
A bit of a mess, but I can
repair it later. Now, let's go.

313
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,458
We make a good team, Meister.

314
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,791
[MARIE]
Naoto. Naoto.

315
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,583
Naoto!

316
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,958
Now is not the time
to lose focus!

317
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:01,458
I know that, but I'm
worried about her.

318
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,708
Let's do this, then
we'll bring her back.

319
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,333
Are you with me?

320
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:22,666
[NAOTO]
Yeah, I am. Let's do it.

321
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,708
[MARIE]
What next?

322
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,958
[NAOTO]
The fifth cylinder,

323
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,708
you need to rotate it
34 degrees to the right.

324
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,208
[OPERATOR A] Soon we'll lose
all control of the system!

325
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,083
[OPERATOR B]
Gravity at...

326
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,666
No. No! They're ruining my plan!

327
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,541
[screams]

328
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,000
Marie! Where are we?

329
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,000
Just a bit longer.

330
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,041
[NAOTO]
Hurry. She's at her limit!

331
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,333
Marie!

332
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,708
[HANNES] Meister Marie!
We did it. We're in!

333
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,291
RyuZU!

334
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:21,875
Naoto!

335
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:27,666
[NAOTO screaming]

336
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,750
[RYUZU] Barely awoken
and now I sleep again.

337
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,041
There's no help for it.

338
00:19:54,125 --> 00:20:01,291
Even after 1,800,926 hours,
nothing has changed.

339
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,291
Humanity's intelligence
has still yet to surpass

340
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,250
that of a flea.

341
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,500
And so, I must sleep again.

342
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,250
It shouldn't matter.

343
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,500
I've slept before.

344
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,166
Nothing's changed.

345
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,000
But this feeling...

346
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,875
It's as if my heart...
is constricting.

347
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,166
[RYUZU]
I see now.

348
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,666
I was wrong.

349
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,000
Something has changed.

350
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,833
[NAOTO gasps]

351
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,083
Master Naoto, your face
is already plain, at best.

352
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,250
These tears do
nothing to improve it.

353
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,208
No more crying.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,416
[RYUZU]
Was it a matter of circumstance,

355
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,666
or was it inevitable
from the very beginning?

356
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:43,750
There are no elements
of coincidence

357
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,833
in the four trillion,
207 billion, 600 million,

358
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:52,250
8,643 gears that
comprise my body.

359
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,625
Each one has its purpose.

360
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,625
The same is true for me.

361
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,958
I, too, exist for a reason.

362
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,583
I am propelled, as is
everyone on this planet.

363
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:06,375
Driven by the Gears of Fate.

364
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,833
In this world comprised
entirely of gears,

365
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,458
I have a feeling that the
most important gears of all

366
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,583
will soon begin to turn.

367
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:27,458
[ANCHOR] Tick, tock. Tick,
tock. Tick, tock. Tick.

368
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,000
[ANCHOR]
The Core Tower was repaired

369
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,250
and the Kyoto Grid was saved.

370
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,541
It seemed as if the planet

371
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:06,625
had regained a
measure of tranquility.

372
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:09,333
But that brief peace
would not last long.

373
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,583
In the deepest layers
of the world,

374
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:15,125
another Gear of Fate was
beginning to creak and move,

375
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,416
promising change ahead.

376
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,125
Next time: "Trishula."

377
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,083
Beginning imaginary output
through the Chrono Hook.

378
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,958
Perpetual Gear,
materializing now.
