1
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,291
[RYUZU] Everything comes
to an end someday.

2
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,375
Perhaps it shouldn't
have been a surprise

3
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,375
when the world did, too.

4
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
[RYUZU]
It was sudden.

5
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,375
One day, the Earth simply
reached the end of its life.

6
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,875
At first, it seemed as if
humanity had no choice

7
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:45,666
but to die along with the world.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,208
But then a clocksmith appeared.

9
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,083
He called himself "Y."

10
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,708
He said that he could rebuild
the destroyed Earth with gears,

11
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,916
the same way he would
repair a failing clock.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,833
He did. And a thousand
years passed.

13
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,333
[NAOTO]
They'll be here in nine seconds.

14
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,041
We're looking at two
silent helicopters

15
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:22,291
and one transport helicopter
loaded with 12 combat automata.

16
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:26,125
3, 2, 1, 0!

17
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,500
[NAOTO]
Heh.

18
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,166
Take this!

19
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,333
[HALTER]
Heh.

20
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,750
[NAOTO] Enemy reinforcements
from the southeast.

21
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,375
Twelve seconds.

22
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,958
Clean these up before
they get here. Got it?

23
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,208
I don't take orders from you,

24
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:54,166
so let's drop the
bossy tone, okay?

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,833
I hate to break it
to you, Princess,

26
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,125
but this was your idea.

27
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,541
I didn't ask for
your opinion, did I?

28
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,416
Now shut up and fight
like a good bodyguard.

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, crap.

30
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,250
[MARIE] Gotta say,
this doesn't look promising.

31
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,833
I think we're a bit
outnumbered here.

32
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,541
Agreed, so what now?

33
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,375
What do we do now?

34
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,875
We end this. Right, RyuZU?

35
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,875
[RYUZU]
That's right, Master Naoto.

36
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,875
If sending these crude machines
is someone's idea of a joke,

37
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,916
it is not an amusing one.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,291
In fact, I find it
downright insulting.

39
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,500
Don't worry, Master,

40
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:38,041
I'll deal with these
worthless contraptions.

41
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,166
And there will be nothing
but scrap metal left.

42
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,500
[RYUZU]
Sorry if I'm late.

43
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,125
Were you waiting long?

44
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,041
[laughs]

45
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,750
That was high-class
butt-kicking. Oh, yeah!

46
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,250
And that was a very low-class
assessment of my performance,

47
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,333
indicative of your
inferior intelligence.

48
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,625
[RYUZU]
Y named the world he built

49
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:27,750
of a seemingly infinite
number of gears.

50
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,333
It was no longer Earth.

51
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,416
He called it the
Clockwork Planet.

52
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:30,541
[NAOTO humming]

53
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,291
[NAOTO]
I'm back!

54
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,291
I hope you weren't too
lonely without me!

55
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,333
Oh, you were, weren't you?

56
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,333
My lovely ones,
patiently waiting for me

57
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,666
even though I'm a complete
and utter failure.

58
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,250
I know I've never managed
to repair a single clock,

59
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,083
but my love for you is true!

60
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,708
I swear! Someday I will finally
be able to prove it to you!

61
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,125
I'll become the clocksmith
you deserve. Really!

62
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,250
[yelps]

63
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,291
[NAOTO] I'm sorry. You
have the right to choose.

64
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,541
I won't force you
to wait for me.

65
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,916
[sighs]

66
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,833
I confess, I have another love.

67
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,500
The pinnacle of clockwork
achievement: Automata!

68
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:23,291
I really wanna make
one of my own someday.

69
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,208
Ugh.

70
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,458
Come on, fate, help me out!

71
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,750
Give me something!

72
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,500
Materials, money, maybe
just a scrap of talent?

73
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,000
Huh?

74
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,000
What is that? Rain?

75
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,916
Go! Go, go, go, go, go.

76
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,333
[NAOTO screams]

77
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,666
[NAOTO]
My sweet lovers, all destroyed!

78
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,875
Who did this to
you, lovely ones?

79
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,875
They'll pay! I will
have revenge!

80
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,000
Huh?

81
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:28,375
[clock tolling]

82
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,208
Beautiful.

83
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,708
[MARIE]
You dropped a YD-01 container?

84
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,208
[SUBORDINATE A]
Yes. I can't apologize enough!

85
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,291
It belongs to the Breguet family

86
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,333
and contains a national
treasure-class automaton.

87
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,125
[SUBORDINATE A]
I promise the person responsible

88
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,250
will be punished accordingly.

89
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,375
[growls]

90
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,958
Halter! Send out our own
recovery team immediately.

91
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,833
We can't trust those incompetent
shitheads to do anything!

92
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,125
[HALTER]
Roger that.

93
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,166
But if I can make a
suggestion, Meister Marie,

94
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,833
you may consider
behaving more like a lady.

95
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,250
Huh?

96
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,000
[HALTER] Since this is a
request from the Kyoto Grid

97
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,958
to the Meister Guild, we should
put our best foot forward.

98
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,416
Don't you think?

99
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,375
You know what they're really
saying, though, don't you?

100
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,750
"This is too much of a hassle
for us to deal with,

101
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,458
so you take care of it."

102
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,166
Still, I suppose we can't
exactly ignore problems

103
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,916
with the Core Tower.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,750
Let's get there quickly.

105
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,375
As you wish, Princess.
It won't be long.

106
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,750
Idiots.

107
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,625
[MARIE]
Well, at least this looks like

108
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,250
it'll be an
interesting job, huh?

109
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,166
[NAOTO] This is everything
I love about clockworks

110
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,958
in human form.

111
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,041
Incredible. I have to
know what she sounds like.

112
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,625
'Kay.

113
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,958
Oh, wow. Amazing.

114
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,500
The sound of the gears
is more perfect

115
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,833
than anything I've ever heard.

116
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,000
No. Hold on.

117
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,250
[NAOTO] It's faint, but there's
an unpleasant sound mixed in.

118
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,916
The gear at the
very center is stuck.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,208
It isn't turning like it should.

120
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,458
That must be why
she isn't booting up.

121
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,666
The power spring
seems to be functional.

122
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,708
[NAOTA yelps]

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,083
No way.

124
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,250
At this rate, it won't be long

125
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,583
before this whole
place collapses.

126
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,416
[NAOTO]
Huh?

127
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,958
[yelping]

128
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,250
[NAOTO]
Look at that!

129
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,041
So pretty.

130
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,541
[NAOTO] You've never even
fixed a simple clock.

131
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:05,208
What the hell do you
think you're doing? Idiot.

132
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,541
[MARIE]
Meister Konrad!

133
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,125
[KONRAD]
Good to see you, Meister Marie.

134
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,583
It's been too long.

135
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,958
We're very glad to have you
as our service chief here.

136
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,625
Thanks for coming on board.

137
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,958
[MARIE, HALTER]
Hm?

138
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,583
[HALTER]
Friends from the military.

139
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,541
[MARIE] Didn't take 'em long to
tell us to stay off their turf.

140
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,416
Afternoon, Dr. Breguet.

141
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,625
We were sent with orders
to provide any assistance

142
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,833
that you might require.

143
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,208
And we require none.
Thanks so much, though.

144
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,125
We're more familiar with
the Kyoto Core Tower than you.

145
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,958
It would be foolish to refuse
our help because of--

146
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,416
We were called in because
you can't handle this.

147
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,083
The last thing we
need is help from you.

148
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,291
Have a good day.

149
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,500
Don't let the door hit
you on the way out.

150
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,750
[NAOTO] I must be
outta my freakin' mind.

151
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,291
If my hand slips and I put
even the slightest scratch

152
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,333
on the main cylinder, that's it.

153
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,500
The mechanism will
be irreparable.

154
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,041
But still, that sound
it's makin' is wrong.

155
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,666
I have to fix it.

156
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,000
Whoa.

157
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,666
[NAOTO] There it is. I just
have to reach that screw.

158
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,541
There. It's over.

159
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,625
Aw, yeah!

160
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,916
So tired.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,625
That really took it all
out of me. I need a nap.

162
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:11,083
Huh?

163
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,708
[screams]

164
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,750
[NAOTO gasps]

165
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,375
I am a part of the
Initial-Y Series. Unit One.

166
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,041
I am called RyuZU.

167
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,541
Uh. I'm Naoto Miura.

168
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,916
[RYUZU]
Thank you for repairing me.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,958
I am very grateful
for the assistance.

170
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,791
However, I am surprised
it took so long

171
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,916
to repair a simple malfunction.

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,791
It suggests
humanity's intelligence

173
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,916
leaves a great deal
to be desired.

174
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,458
I think a monkey could have
resolved the issue more quickly.

175
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,666
Yes, a monkey,
or even a smart dog.

176
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,458
I confess I had hoped the person
who is to become my master

177
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,000
would be superior to an animal.

178
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,291
[chuckles]

179
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,958
[chuckles nervously]

180
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,500
'Scuse me. I'm gonna
pass out now.

181
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,166
[RYUZU]
Huh?

182
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,958
[RYUZU]
Are you feeling any better?

183
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,875
You look quite pale.

184
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,750
[whimpering]

185
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,833
[NAOTO screaming]

186
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,666
[RYUZU] Master Naoto,
may I ask you a question?

187
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,208
[NAOTO]
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

188
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,625
[RYUZU] Tell me. Do you
have my design plan?

189
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,458
[NAOTO]
Uh. No, I don't.

190
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,791
I see.

191
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,333
Do you know how many gears
my body is comprised of?

192
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:06,500
Uh, four trillion, 207 billion,
600 million, 8,643, I think.

193
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,833
So you were able to determine
the issue and repair me,

194
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,500
using sound alone.

195
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,041
You could sense
what was going on

196
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,625
while I was making the repairs?

197
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,250
Yes, that's right.

198
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,666
Oh, awkward!
I'm sorry about that.

199
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,208
I didn't mean to go
opening you up,

200
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,958
but that stuck gear was
ruining the sound, ya know?

201
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:27,666
Master Naoto...
you are a pervert.

202
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,541
Sorry, guess I kind of am.

203
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,791
Okay.

204
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,958
With your permission,

205
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,416
I would like to register
you as my master.

206
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,208
I will serve at your side and
help in any way you require.

207
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,708
Really?

208
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,208
After observing your work,
I have come to the conclusion

209
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,666
that you are the most talented
clocksmith on the planet.

210
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,083
Uh, no, sorry. I think
you've got the wrong idea.

211
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,583
What's wrong?

212
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,708
You aren't pleased at the
thought of becoming my master.

213
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,541
Is it because I am powerful,
skilled, and highly capable?

214
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,958
Does my perfection threaten
whatever scraps of pride

215
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,291
you've clung to in
your sad little life?

216
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,791
Well, no, I wouldn't say that.

217
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,000
I understand. You don't want me.

218
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:11,125
You don't have any
use for an automaton.

219
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,416
[NAOTO] Okay, calm down
and get a grip, Naoto.

220
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,208
Who is this girl, anyway?

221
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,375
She's both high-spec
and crazy beautiful.

222
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:24,875
Is she a prototype for a big
corporation? Or the military?

223
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,375
Part of some international plot?
Will they kill me to shut me up?

224
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,125
Will anyone ever
find the pieces?

225
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:33,083
Careful! You have
to weigh the risks.

226
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,500
[NAOTO]
Please, who am I kidding here?

227
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,958
I can't say no! I'd have
to be an idiot to do that!

228
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,833
And maybe I'm an idiot
anyway, but if you want me,

229
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:46,291
I'll be the best
damn master I can be!

230
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,833
All right.

231
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:50,166
Then give me your right hand.

232
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,666
[NAOTO]
Uh...

233
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,208
[gasps]

234
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,416
Initial-Y Series Unit One.

235
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,458
I am "The One Who
Follows." RyuZU.

236
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:26,208
I swear to remain by
Naoto Miura's side

237
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,666
and help him in
any way he wishes.

238
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,041
I pledge loyalty and
servitude to him alone.

239
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,208
[MARIE]
It's weirdly quiet.

240
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,958
[KONRAD]
Is that a problem?

241
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:46,041
[MARIE] It seems strange
to me that those officers

242
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,750
haven't come back.

243
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,958
[HALTER] You think
they're up to something?

244
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
[KONRAD]
I have somebody who can help us

245
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,375
find the answer
to that question.

246
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,666
Karasawa.

247
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,333
What can I do for you?

248
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,583
We believe the military
may be hiding something.

249
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,166
Think you can look into it?

250
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,833
[KARASAWA] I do have some
experience with shady business.

251
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,583
My last job saw to that.

252
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,958
You don't mind helping, do you?

253
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,208
No one can refuse
you, Meister Marie.

254
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,333
I'll see what I can find out.

255
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,750
[NAOTO]
Whew. You saved me again!

256
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,333
If you hadn't gone
in to get my things,

257
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,625
I'd be broke as
well as homeless.

258
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:19,791
I'm sorry, though.

259
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:22,208
It was a dangerous
thing to ask you to do.

260
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,958
You may be frail and weak,
but I am strong and capable.

261
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,375
I fail to see how entering
a building put me in danger,

262
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,208
no matter ho derelict.

263
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,541
Were you intentionally designed
to be so sharp-tongued,

264
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,375
or was that some kind of glitch?

265
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,833
Sharp-tongued?
What do you mean?

266
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,833
[NAOTO]
Uh, forget I said anything.

267
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,083
Now then, we need
a place to stay.

268
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,541
I believe that building
will provide

269
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,666
suitable accommodations for us.

270
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,458
[NAOTO screams]

271
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,708
[NAOTO]
But-- But--!

272
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,666
That's a love hotel!

273
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,458
[RYUZU]
It is also reasonably priced,

274
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,833
close to our current location,

275
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,458
and provides the best
amenities in the area.

276
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,708
We should keep looking.

277
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,208
Master, remember that
no matter how unusual

278
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,083
or indecent your primitive
desires might be,

279
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,750
it is my job as your servant

280
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,083
to see that all of
your needs are met.

281
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,250
What kind of sicko
do you take me for?

282
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,541
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

283
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,958
Let's just go someplace else.

284
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,750
A manga café'll
work for tonight.

285
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,500
[PUNK A] Hey, babe.
You're really freakin' hot.

286
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,208
Yes, I am aware of that.

287
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,541
[PUNKS laugh]

288
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,416
[PUNK A] I like you!
You wanna go have some fun?

289
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,416
Come on. There's a
hotel right there.

290
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,916
[NAOTO]
Huh?

291
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,125
[PUNK A] Brat. What are
you doing? Piss off.

292
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,000
No! You jerks don't deserve
somebody like her!

293
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,583
Just leave her alone.

294
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:38,875
[gasps]

295
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,333
What did you say to me, punk?

296
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:41,416
Got a death wish?

297
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,625
Hit 'im already.

298
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,375
RyuZU, go!

299
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,916
Master Naoto, that's the first
time you've called me RyuZU.

300
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,375
You seem to think
I need defending.

301
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,666
Allow me to correct that
misguided assumption.

302
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,375
That hurt.

303
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,583
[RYUZU] It's possible I
took things a bit too far,

304
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,625
but you shouldn't die of your
injuries and now you know

305
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't tolerate fools
who insult my master.

306
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,416
[NAOTO]
Phew! Ha.

307
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,666
Oh, I see, rather than the
big bed at a love hotel.

308
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,250
you prefer the close proximity
necessitated by a narrow bench.

309
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,375
No, that's not it!

310
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,875
This was the only
place that was open.

311
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:25,750
[NAOTO sighs]

312
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,083
Jeez, I could sleep for a week.

313
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:30,500
You should totally
get some rest, too.

314
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,333
Thanks for everything.

315
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,166
[RYUZU]
Are you going to ignore it?

316
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,541
Say wha--?

317
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,541
[RYUZU] The perfect opportunity
to sleep on my lap.

318
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,708
[gasps] Wait, I can
do that? Really?

319
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,125
Yes, you did it earlier
today, didn't you?

320
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:47,958
Was it unsatisfying?

321
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,958
Nope, not even a little! Ha!

322
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,041
Night!

323
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,625
Master Naoto.

324
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,125
Yeah?

325
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:02,666
You know I'm an automaton,
a manufactured clockwork doll.

326
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,000
Sure. I know that.

327
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,041
Okay, then tell me something:

328
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:11,375
Why are you treating me
like I'm a human girl?

329
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,875
A strange master.
So young and naïve.

330
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,541
I wonder what he
thinks about me.

331
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:32,000
[clicking]

332
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:37,958
[gasps]

333
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,375
Too loud. Need to sleep.

334
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,791
[HALTER] Problem, Princess?
You have a scary dream?

335
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,541
Don't treat me like a child!

336
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,791
Get the team chiefs
together, now!

337
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,041
[HALTER]
Okay.

338
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,916
Uh, quick suggestion?

339
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,333
[MARIE]
Yeah, what?

340
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,916
[HALTER] You might wanna
cover your girly parts first.

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,541
[screams]

342
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,458
I hate you!

343
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,125
[MARIE] We just experienced
a gravity irregularity.

344
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,000
[KONRAD] Yes, though I'm
amazed you could tell.

345
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,666
It didn't shake so
much that your body

346
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,500
should've been able to sense it.

347
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,416
The consequences will be
serious if it continues.

348
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,291
It could cause the entire
Kyoto Grid to fall.

349
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,625
[ENGINEERS gasp]

350
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,791
[MARIE] That's right.
There's no time to waste.

351
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,416
We need to find the point
that's causing the problem now.

352
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,750
[door opens]

353
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,041
[KARASAWA] Unfortunately,
it seems the military

354
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,666
has a different idea.

355
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,333
[KONRAD]
What have you found out?

356
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,958
That they have their own plan.

357
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,916
One they'll put into effect
in the next few days.

358
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,750
[MARIE]
Wait, you don't mean...

359
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,583
[KONRAD] A forced purge
of the Kyoto Grid?

360
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,125
[MARIE, ENGINEERS gasp]

361
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,000
Impossible! There's not enough
time to evacuate everybody!

362
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,208
They're aware.

363
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,166
Doesn't seem to make
any difference, though.

364
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,750
Insane.

365
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,583
They truly mean to let Kyoto and
its 20 million residents fall?

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,500
[RYUZU]
Even the greatest genius,

367
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,166
possessing the greatest skills,
can only do so much.

368
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,125
No clock, however well-built,
can tick on infinitely.

369
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:17,833
Everything comes to an end
someday. People. Worlds.

370
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:22,125
Eventually, they must receive
new life. Restored.

371
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:26,166
Rebuilt. Just as Y once did.

372
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,666
[MARIE] I'm working with
Konrad and the other Meisters

373
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,708
to repair the Core Tower.

374
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:06,541
Unfortunately, the military
wants to purge the Kyoto Grid,

375
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,625
so they're not
making it easy on us.

376
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,958
We're running into one
problem after another,

377
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,250
and the purge inches closer
with every minute that passes.

378
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,166
It doesn't help that I can feel
the weight of 20 million lives

379
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,125
resting on my shoulders.

380
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,458
Next time: "Purge."

381
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,625
I am Marie Breguet,
a woman who doesn't believe

382
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,375
in the word "impossible."
