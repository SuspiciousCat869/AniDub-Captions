1
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,916
[VERMOUTH]
The hero of the Meister Guild,

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,291
the person responsible
for preventing the purge

3
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:24,750
of the Kyoto Grid,

4
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,916
Marie Bell Breguet.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,458
She is believed to have been
killed during a collapse

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:32,250
while she worked to
repair the Core Tower.

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,083
But something doesn't add up.

8
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,125
It seems premature
to hold a funeral

9
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,000
when her body hasn't been found.

10
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:40,041
At any rate,
this is shaping up to be

11
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:42,916
more interesting
than I'd expected.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,708
[NAOTO]
I will meet AnchoR someday.

13
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,291
I won't.

14
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,208
I will meet her. I won't...

15
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,375
[RYUZU]
You have done that 137 times.

16
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,375
As it doesn't seem to be
accomplishing anything,

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:58,125
perhaps you should pursue
a different activity.

18
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,333
[NAOTO yells]

19
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,416
AnchoR wasn't even down there!

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,875
We almost died, and what's
worse, we put RyuZU in danger!

21
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:08,666
Hear me, God! What have I
done to earn such cruelty?

22
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,416
You've said that 137 times.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,541
[MARIE] Planning to jump?
It's a long way down.

24
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:14,666
[NAOTO]
This is your fault!

25
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,791
Doer of evil,
bringer of bad luck!

26
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,625
Go on, kid, get
it off your chest.

27
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,083
It's nice to see you, too.

28
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:21,750
What is your business here?

29
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,791
I hope you aren't trying
to involve Master Naoto

30
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,750
in another hopeless mess
because he's not interested.

31
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,125
Please call off your guard dog.

32
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,625
I came to ask you
for a little help.

33
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,666
With what, exactly?

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,791
You know... just saving
the world real quick.

35
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,375
Huh?

36
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:41,958
[MARIE] Countless cities
all over the planet

37
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,541
are being torn apart by the
same kind of conspiracy

38
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,500
that we faced here in Kyoto.

39
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,458
I plan to get in,
tear everything apart,

40
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,208
and repair it all before
the world collapses

41
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,833
under the weight of corruption.

42
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:52,958
Uh...

43
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,791
[MARIE]
We're gonna save the world

44
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,833
and it's gonna be awesome!

45
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,208
What d'you say, in or out?

46
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,833
Please! Why in the world
would I wanna help you?

47
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,625
Maybe because I can use my
extensive information network

48
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,125
to help you track down AnchoR.

49
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,166
[NAOTO]
Huh?!

50
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,416
Cheater! Now you're
playing dirty.

51
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,041
[MARIE]
Say yes. You know you want to.

52
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:18,500
[NAOTO] No! I won't allow
you to tempt me like this!

53
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,291
AnchoR!

54
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,916
[VERMOUTH] I don't like
the smell of this place.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,041
Be careful.

56
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,375
[STREGA]
Heh! Are we ever not careful?

57
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,625
[AMARETTO]
Seriously.

58
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,333
Lettin' our guard down
isn't somethin' we do.

59
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,250
Hold on.

60
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,291
[VERMOUTH] I can sense
something. And I don't like it.

61
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,833
[STREGA]
What the hell is that?

62
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,541
[AMARETTO]
A kid?

63
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,041
[VERMOUTH]
No, that's no child.

64
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,750
[ALL gasp]

65
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,375
Quick, take it out!

66
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,708
What the hell?

67
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,916
What is this thing?

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,625
Strega! Amaretto! No!

69
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,833
What in the hell is that thing?

70
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,625
It swallowed Strega
and Amaretto whole!

71
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,166
[screams]

72
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,666
[VERMOUTH]
What is this?

73
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,333
Is it what it looks like?

74
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,041
'Cause if so, someone is
trying to destroy the world.

75
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,125
[footsteps]

76
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,875
[VERMOUTH]
Ahh...

77
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,833
You know, I can't remember the
last time I fought somebody

78
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,208
without even getting
a single hit in.

79
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:45,291
[chuckles]

80
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,625
Not so dead after all.

81
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,125
[VERMOUTH] I figure the only way
to fight the screwed-up assholes

82
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,666
behind this is to send in
somebody equally screwed up.

83
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,375
Here's hoping it works.

84
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,041
I'm counting on you,
l'il ghost girl.

85
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,375
Just one week following

86
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,666
the narrowly avoided
purge of the Kyoto Grid,

87
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,833
various press outlets received
an anonymous statement

88
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,291
providing evidence that the
incident was a joint operation

89
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,791
between the government,
the military,

90
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,166
and the Meister Guild.

91
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,958
The individuals responsible
for this egregious move

92
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,291
are either resigning or
being forcibly removed

93
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,416
from their positions.

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,625
[MARIE laughing]

95
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,666
[MARIE]
Look at his face!

96
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,625
After what you did,
it serves you right,

97
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,041
you Vacheron shithead!

98
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,708
Looks like someone's
mood has improved.

99
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:45,750
I'd say about one
caramel candy's worth.

100
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,166
I was ready to get
the party started,

101
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,708
but thanks to that idiot Naoto,
the two of us are stuck here.

102
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,750
I can't believe that moron
has to retake a test.

103
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,916
[HALTER] Rushing isn't
always the best option.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,916
Sometimes you have
to be patient.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,125
Yes, thank you for your
wisdom, big brother.

106
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,166
Couldn't we have gone
with something different?

107
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,083
Marie Bell Breguet's dead.

108
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,750
I am now Maeribell Halter.

109
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,250
The tall, terrifying giant's
sweet, innocent little sister.

110
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,833
--Isn't that right, bro?
--Please stop.

111
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,083
If you keep that up,
I'm gonna puke.

112
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,041
You know, if you want
a different cover,

113
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,583
you could be my dad.

114
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,083
Old man.

115
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,958
[HALTER]
Ohh...

116
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,208
That's enough
sightseeing for one day.

117
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,291
Let's go home.

118
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,583
[static]

119
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,458
[HALTER]
Princess, hold on a sec.

120
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,791
I just intercepted a
strange transmission.

121
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,416
What's strange about it?

122
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,833
[NAOTO] "The rebuilding of
the planet 1,000 years ago

123
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,958
necessitated a ban on the
use of electromagnetism,

124
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,583
which can adversely
affect gears,

125
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,041
compromising their ability
to function correctly.

126
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,375
The world now relies
upon resonating gears

127
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,041
rather than radio waves
for communication."

128
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,791
Hey, uh, what's
electromagnetism again?

129
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,541
The interaction of electric
and magnetic fields.

130
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,500
For obvious reasons, it has
little value these days.

131
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,083
Uh?

132
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,583
[static]

133
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:18,500
[NAOTO] This sound, it's
like high-pitched static.

134
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,041
You disappoint me, Master.

135
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,208
The stain on the ceiling is
more interesting than I am?

136
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,833
No, I was distracted
for a sec, that's all.

137
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,750
You said that not even
studying was a chore

138
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,916
as long as you could
have me by your side.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,958
Was that just a lie?

140
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:35,916
[MARIE]
Knock, knock!

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
[NAOTO yelps]

142
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,583
Hey, I told you I
needed to study!

143
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,333
I've got something
I need you to study,

144
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,083
and I think it'll appeal to that
perverted little brain of yours.

145
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,500
Now put the books away and make
yourself useful for a change,

146
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,333
you obnoxious gear-loving idiot!

147
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,833
Wha--?

148
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,958
You shouldn't abuse Master
Naoto like that in front of me.

149
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,416
You won't enjoy
the consequences.

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,833
[MARIE]
What do you think you're doing?!

151
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,666
Let go of me right now.

152
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,833
Do you ever know
when to stop?

153
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,750
[NAOTO]
What's this about, anyway?

154
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,833
I came because we
intercepted a transmission

155
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,083
I need you to trace.

156
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,916
t was sent via short-wave radio.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,166
Really? But how?

158
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,708
Isn't that kind of
communication illegal now?

159
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,416
[HALTER] There are jobs
out there that require

160
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
bending the rules
from time to time.

161
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,041
[MARIE]
You must've heard something.

162
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
It was just a minute ago.

163
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,416
I imagine it would've been
extremely high-pitched.

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
[HALTER] Surely even he
couldn't have heard that.

165
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:30,083
Yeah, the sound I heard came
from up in that direction.

166
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,958
About 88 degrees, I think?

167
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,333
[HALTER]
Seriously? Damn.

168
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,083
[MARIE] Eighty-eight degrees?
Gimme a second here.

169
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,541
--Gimme a second here.
--Watch it.

170
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,916
[MARIE] We know the direction
and reflection angle.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,333
That's enough information
to triangulate the origin.

172
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,333
Here we go.

173
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,583
It's in Mie! The
industrial complex!

174
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,083
Come on, let's get going!

175
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,083
What? Why do you need us?

176
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,750
You haven't even told me
what the transmission said.

177
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:54,625
[MARIE]
Eh...

178
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,791
Oh, y'know, it's not important.

179
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:00,875
Whatever the content of this
emergency transmission was,

180
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,208
it led you to believe that
this is an appropriate way

181
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:04,500
to treat Master Naoto.

182
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,833
[MARIE yelps]

183
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,833
As such, I am very curious
to hear what it said.

184
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,833
Hey, let me down! You're crazy!

185
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,708
[MARIE whines]

186
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:14,875
[HALTER]
Uhh...

187
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,125
I'll relay the contents for you.

188
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:19,458
[clears throat]

189
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,291
[HALTER]
"Hey, bitch. How's it goin'?

190
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,125
The l'il ghost girl seems to be

191
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,166
more than a little
full of herself.

192
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,333
I have to wonder,
is your hole sad

193
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,875
because you aren't
getting any?

194
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,750
You should try begging for it.

195
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,500
There's a bunch of
guys with big cocks

196
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,666
just waiting to knock
down your door for cheap."

197
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,333
We don't know who,
but someone sent that out

198
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,958
to this general area
via short wave radio.

199
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,583
Why is Marie so mad about it?

200
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:46,416
It seems to have
struck a nerve.

201
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,833
If your hole is sad,

202
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,541
there are a number of facilities
around here that ca--

203
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,500
That is so not the issue here!

204
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,333
That phrase, "l'il ghost girl."

205
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,041
They were obviously
directing that at me.

206
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,458
What are you going to do
once you find whoever sent it?

207
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,958
Capture them, tie them up,

208
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,291
and make sure they
suffer a slow death!

209
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,750
Now, come on. Let's go.

210
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,541
As you said, the message
was clearly intended for you.

211
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,083
Perhaps you ought to seek
them out on your own.

212
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,333
[HALTER]
Hey, buddy.

213
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,416
If I remember correctly,
there's a beach nearby.

214
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,666
I don't know 'bout you, but
I'm a big beach man myself.

215
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,166
The white sand,
the gleaming sun.

216
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,375
Of course, we'll probably
need to bring bathing suits.

217
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,083
Aw, yeah! What are we
waiting around here for?!

218
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,916
Let's get out there and
restore your honor, Marie!

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,291
Damn, you're good.

220
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,500
Haven't you ever
heard that saying

221
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,125
about catching more
flies with honey?

222
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,875
[HALTER] What was the
purpose of that message?

223
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,375
Just to provoke?
Or something more?

224
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:51,958
[ANCHOR] Tick, tock. Tick,
tock. Tick, tock. Tick.

225
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:56,416
I'm sleepy. So sleepy.

226
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,541
There's a room full of
toys. Puzzles. A bunny.

227
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:04,625
That house, where was it again?

228
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,250
[ANCHOR]
Big sister.

229
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,125
I'm surprised you allowed
this little beach break.

230
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,750
[MARIE] Don't worry,
I'm going to make him work

231
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,125
for every second he
enjoys himself here.

232
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,166
[HALTER]
Such a stern task mistress.

233
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,583
It's nice. I haven't done
something like this in ages.

234
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,166
Not since my studies
ended, I think.

235
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,958
What's Houko up to?
It's been a while.

236
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,458
[NAOTO laughs]

237
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,166
[NAOTO] So beautiful!
Amazing! Ah, incredible!

238
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,375
No, that doesn't even
begin to do it justice.

239
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,666
It's perfect! Beautifully
perfect! Amazingly perfect!

240
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,708
So incredibly perfect!
Perfectly perfect!

241
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:10,583
Right there! Hold that pose!

242
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,625
[RYUZU] The limitations
of your vocabulary

243
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,791
astounds me, Master Naoto.

244
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,500
But for now, I suppose,
your praise is acceptable.

245
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,916
[NAOTO] Okay, for this one,
turn around and face me.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,166
Good! Now give me a twirl
and make your hair fly.

247
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:29,916
[RYUZU]
Huh?

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,416
You're going to fall!

249
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,458
I'm sorry about that. You okay?

250
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,750
You don't have many skills,

251
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,750
but one of them is arranging
these "accidents."

252
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,500
[RYUZU] Master, you
should know by now...

253
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,291
If you wish to indulge
your fantasies

254
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,875
and unleash your
bestial, perverted,

255
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,583
carnal desires upon me,

256
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,500
I would have no objection
to you doing so.

257
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,791
[NAOTO]
Is it really okay to do this?

258
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,791
Can I allow myself to sully
RyuZU's pure, impeccable body?

259
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,541
It's a sublime work of art!

260
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,375
I mean, part of its beauty
is rooted in the fact

261
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,208
that it's an
untouchable treasure.

262
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,083
Can I deny myself to
preserve its perfection?

263
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:24,083
Am I even strong enough
to make the right choice?

264
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,416
[yelps]

265
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,250
[NAOTO screaming]

266
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,166
[RYUZU]
Master Naoto!

267
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,083
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

268
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,458
We didn't come here to act out
your dumb rom-com fantasies!

269
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:15,500
How dare you
manhandle my master!

270
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,541
Come off it! I saved
his life, didn't I?!

271
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,958
So stop complaining!

272
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,083
[RYUZU] Your pitiful worm-sized
brain cannot hope to...

273
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833
That's enough, kids.
It's time to get going.

274
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,000
[MARIE] It's hot here.
And the air is so still.

275
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,291
If there was even a tiny breeze,
it would feel so much better.

276
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,875
There are no seasons
here anymore,

277
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,875
not since the purge of the
neighboring Shiga Grid.

278
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,666
That was 30 years ago now.

279
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,250
Feels like everything's
starting to fall apart.

280
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,875
Like the world is
reaching its limits.

281
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,333
[HALTER, MARIE]
Hm?

282
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,333
Stay silent, please.

283
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,750
I can't hear anything at all.

284
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,458
[MARIE]
Wait! What are you suggesting?

285
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,291
There must be some noise.

286
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,916
[HALTER] No, I don't
think he's exaggerating.

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,458
It's much too quiet out here.
Where are all the people?

288
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,416
[NEWSCASTER A]
The alleged conspiracy--

289
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,750
The alleged conspiracy--

290
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,333
[MARIE]
What's going on?

291
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,541
This place is like a ghost town.

292
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,583
[NAOTO]
It's not just the streets.

293
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,583
That clock tower
there has stopped.

294
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,666
Actually, it's empty.

295
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,458
[MARIE] Do you understand
what you're saying?

296
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,791
A city can only function

297
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,916
if the Core Tower and
Clock Tower are working.

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,541
There are no exceptions.
That's how it is everywhere.

299
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,833
That's what I mean.

300
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:36,666
This city is already dead and
has been for a long time now.

301
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,208
He's correct.

302
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,791
That's why there are no people
and why the air is so still.

303
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,000
Because everything's
been severed.

304
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,583
[NAOTO]
And I know why!

305
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:48,625
There's an Initial-Y Series
Unit somewhere in this city!

306
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,458
[MARIE]
Uh.

307
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,500
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,583
Yes, I see.
That would explain it.

309
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,041
[MARIE, HALTER]
Huh?

310
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,458
There must be something here
that would warrant the use

311
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,458
of illegal radio waves
to transmit a message.

312
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,833
Such as an Initial-Y
Series Unit.

313
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,625
[NAOTO] Yeah, exactly!
That's what I was trying to say.

314
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,000
[MARIE sighs]

315
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,791
[HALTER] Then perhaps we
should focus on determining

316
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,041
the true meaning
of that message.

317
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,416
[RYUZU]
That would be a waste of time.

318
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,125
The message seemed perfectly
straightforward to me.

319
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,916
[MARIE] Do you want me
to disassemble you?

320
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
When its hole is sad,
a dog wags its tail

321
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,125
in order to beckon
the opposite sex.

322
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,416
It's part of animal nature.

323
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,666
The same is true for you.

324
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,375
You have traveled all
this way to beg for it,

325
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,875
just like a dog
wagging its tail.

326
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:28,666
[MARIE grunts]

327
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,666
I'm a virgin!

328
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,958
[NAOTO]
Uh...

329
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,958
Enough of this.

330
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,083
Let's hurry and go to
the transmission source.

331
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,083
You sure that's a good idea?

332
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,958
[MARIE]
What's there to worry about?

333
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,375
We're the ones who
stopped the purge

334
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
of the Kyoto Grid, remember?

335
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,375
With our skills, getting into a
factory will be a piece of cake.

336
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,875
[NAOTO]
All right!

337
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,916
Hold on, AnchoR!
I'm comin' for you!

338
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,500
[HALTER]
This place makes the hair

339
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,125
on the back of my neck stand up.

340
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,916
Awesome job, RyuZU!

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,333
I don't think I'll ever get
tired of seeing you do that.

342
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,250
You're here to be a human
sensor, now shut up and listen!

343
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,833
Yeah, yeah.

344
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,625
It won't be long now, AnchoR!

345
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,208
I'm on my way! Just you wait!

346
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,500
What does he think this
is, a school dance?

347
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,625
Come on, let's do a quick
sweep of the place.

348
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,791
We'll leave if we
don't find anything.

349
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:45,458
It should be somewhere
around here.

350
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,666
A hole in the floor?

351
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,250
[HALTER] Looks as if
something tore through it.

352
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,541
[NAOTO]
It's underneath here.

353
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,208
[MARIE]
That's impossible.

354
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,375
Really? Why?

355
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,666
Because over a
thousand years ago,

356
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
the planet's crust and mantle

357
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,333
were stripped and
mined for resources.

358
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,708
There's nothing under here but
a 5,000 kilometer-deep abyss.

359
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,541
[NAOTO] But I can sense
something down there.

360
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,333
There's a really spacious room.

361
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,500
And inside is
something very large.

362
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,000
All right, then,
let's check it out.

363
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,250
[RYUZU] Master Naoto,
if you'll allow me.

364
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,625
[NAOTO]
Hm?

365
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,333
[HALTER]
Don't let your guard down.

366
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,250
I've had a bad feeling
since we got here.

367
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,833
[MARIE] I won't. Whatever's
going on here, it's not normal.

368
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,083
[MARIE gasps]

369
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,208
[HALTER]
That wasn't a good way to go.

370
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,541
It's the same damage
as the hole above.

371
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,666
[MARIE]
Could this have been the person

372
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,291
who sent out that message?

373
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,166
[HALTER]
Maybe.

374
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,166
Hey, Marie. Come look at this.

375
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,500
Yeah, gimme a second.

376
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,833
Not everyone here is a freak

377
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,000
who can see with
their ears, you know.

378
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,958
What the hell? What is that?

379
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,208
[BOTH gasp]

380
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:08,333
[HALTER] Whatever it is,
it's an abomination.

381
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,541
A violation of the
military arsenal treaty.

382
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,166
A weapon of mass destruction.

383
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,916
Naoto, what are that
thing's dimensions?

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,208
[NAOTO] Height: 320 meters.
Length: 932 meters.

385
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,791
Whoever it was who
built this monstrosity,

386
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:30,000
they used all the clock
tower's parts to do it.

387
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:30,875
[HALTER]
What?

388
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,833
[RYUZU]
There is our answer.

389
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,500
Now we know what
killed this city.

390
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,125
Unbelievable.

391
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,083
We put our lives on the line
to keep the cities ticking,

392
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,291
only to have them gutted
for parts by people

393
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,291
who would build a weapon

394
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,833
that can destroy
the entire planet.

395
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,625
[NAOTO] And from the look of it,
it's ready to be used.

396
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,625
Never! Not on my watch!

397
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,416
We're tearing this thing apart!

398
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,708
[NAOTO] Are you kidding?
How are we supposed to do that?

399
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,708
[MARIE]
I'll figure something out.

400
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,125
I swore.

401
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,958
I will root out the corruption
that plagues our cities

402
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,000
and do what I must
to repair this planet!

403
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,625
[HALTER]
Marie, stop!

404
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,708
[MARIE]
A child?

405
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,375
[HALTER]
No, an automaton.

406
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,208
So this is where
you've been, AnchoR.

407
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,583
AnchoR? Really? This is her?

408
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,500
But that mask, it's hideous.

409
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't recall your taste
being so sadly lacking.

410
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,458
Well, AnchoR?

411
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,000
[NAOTO]
Something's wrong.

412
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,250
Threat level assessed,
category two.

413
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,750
[ALL gasp]

414
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:51,916
[ANCHOR] Requesting Power
Reserve change. Acknowledged.

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,041
Differential ring
to number three.

416
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,625
Beginning shift.

417
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,916
Beginning imaginary output
through the Chrono Hook:

418
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,625
Perpetual Gear.

419
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,958
Materializing now.

420
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:14,416
[ANCHOR] Absolute
maneuver. Bloody Murder.

421
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,750
[ALL gasp]

422
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,083
Go!

423
00:23:58,625 --> 00:24:00,958
[HALTER] The darkness concealed
a monstrous weapon.

424
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,625
With it awaited AnchoR,

425
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,041
another Initial-Y Series
Unit and RyuZU's sister.

426
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,833
Her relentless attacks rain
down on the small party,

427
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,000
their destructive power
warping the gears

428
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,541
that had just begun to mesh,

429
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:15,875
and shoving them into an
abyss of eternal darkness.

430
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,041
Next time: "Deep Underground."

431
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,333
You're still a child, Princess.

432
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:24,541
The thing about being a child
is, you're allowed to cry.

433
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,625
Nobody will judge you for it.
