1
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,666
May I ask where you're
going, Dr. Breguet?

2
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,291
[MARIE] To inspect the
situation in the lower floors.

3
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,541
Do you really expect me to
report my every move to you?

4
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,750
This is the Core Tower,

5
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,041
under the jurisdiction
of the military,

6
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,125
so I will be accompanying you.

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,041
We'd love company.

8
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,500
[MILITARY OFFICER A]
Try to remember your place.

9
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,291
The military has the
final say on anything

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,875
that happens in the Tower.

11
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,666
You may have the
title of "Meister,"

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,416
but we all know that you people
are just glorified repairmen.

13
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,291
[MARIE]
You've got one thing right.

14
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:02,458
We of the Meister
Guild are repairmen.

15
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,958
We fix things.

16
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,291
Which is exactly what we're
going to do with this Tower.

17
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:09,791
And nothing will
stand in our way.

18
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:11,916
Nothing and no one.

19
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,833
[MARIE]
Now I've got a question for you.

20
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:53,208
Answer quickly.
When will the purge happen?

21
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
Twenty hours from now.

22
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,958
Tomorrow at 02:42.

23
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,833
[BOTH gasp]

24
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,833
Why do it so soon?

25
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,958
Because we can't
afford to lose face.

26
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:05,291
There's an anomaly we can't fix,
so the purge is our only option.

27
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,125
If the public learns that we
couldn't handle the repairs,

28
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,833
our authority will
be questioned.

29
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,333
You people are monsters!

30
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,666
Twenty million
lives are at stake

31
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,791
and all you care
about is saving face?

32
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,541
Tell us where the anomaly is.

33
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:22,375
Fine, Floor 24, in the
pressure control block.

34
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,000
Sounds like we know
where our next stop is.

35
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,791
[MILITARY OFFICER A] You really
think you're going to fix it?

36
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,583
The purge is in 20 hours.

37
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,333
That'll never be long enough.

38
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,625
A lot can happen in 20 hours.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,291
Let's do this.

40
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,500
We'll fix it if
we can, and if not,

41
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,833
then I guess I'll
die with this city.

42
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,041
What now?!

43
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,875
Why's it so loud?

44
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:58,541
Good morning, Master Naoto.
How are you feeling?

45
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,833
You don't appear to
have slept very well.

46
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:03,666
Was there something displeasing
or inadequate about my lap?

47
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,083
No, not at all!

48
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,666
Y-Y-Your lap was amazing,
pure perfection, I swear!

49
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,166
It's just that lately,

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,791
the ground beneath the Core
Tower has been really noisy.

51
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,500
I assume that is due to errors
in the city's mechanisms.

52
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,375
Well, it's 70,620
meters below ground.

53
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:23,041
[RYUZU] Interesting. That
would put it at Floor 24.

54
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,041
What? You know that?

55
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:28,375
Of course. Y designed
me and the planet.

56
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,083
I guess you could say
we have a lot in common.

57
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,958
[VOICE A] There's no limit
to what you can achieve

58
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,416
as part of the Meister Guild...

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,916
[NAOTO]
Ugh! The Meister Guild! I wish!

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,541
[RYUZU] You want to
join the Guild someday?

61
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,041
[NAOTO]
Yeah, of course!

62
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,500
Those guys get paid to spend
their days ogling clockworks

63
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,875
and playing with
the Core Towers.

64
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,166
I can't think of anything
I would rather do.

65
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,916
They're amazing!

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,916
I'm afraid I must disagree.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,333
They had 206 years, and they
still couldn't repair me.

68
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,291
These are mankind's most
skilled clocksmiths?

69
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,666
I find that a rather
pathetic joke.

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,291
Well... Ha-ha...

71
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,291
Wait, 206 years?

72
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,125
I had no idea you'd
been around that long.

73
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,208
When were you built?

74
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,041
[RYUZU]
About a thousand years ago.

75
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,666
Seriously?

76
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,291
[HALTER] Think you'll be
able to get it going again?

77
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,000
[MARIE]
I need to secure a line first.

78
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,666
We have to inform
everybody about the purge.

79
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,000
Usin' the emergency frequency
for the Meister Guild.

80
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,333
[MARIE] The military is no
longer just a hindrance.

81
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,541
They are the enemy.

82
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,333
Yeah, that's for sure.

83
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,625
[MARIE]
All right.

84
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,125
Got it.

85
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,416
This'll reach the communication
officer outside the tower.

86
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,875
[LIMONS] Kyoto Grid
Communication Officer Limons.

87
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,208
[MARIE]
This is Marie Breguet.

88
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,458
Hi, Dr. Breguet.
It's been a while.

89
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,750
You're calling on the special
frequency, you all right?

90
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,916
Is everything okay?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,458
[MARIE]
No, it isn't.

92
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,708
The military intends to purge
the Kyoto Grid in 20 hours.

93
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,250
[LIMONS]
That is serious.

94
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,291
Are you sure about this?

95
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,666
Yes, I need to speak with
Service Chief Konrad

96
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,916
on Floor 3 immediately.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,500
[LIMONS] Certainly. I'll have
you patched through right away.

98
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,708
Good-bye.

99
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,416
[KONRAD] Konrad here.
Are you all right, Meister?

100
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,666
[MARIE] Yes, but the
situation is critical.

101
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,000
We questioned an officer
and learned that the military

102
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,750
means to purge the
Kyoto Grid in 20 hours.

103
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:22,000
You sure? That's earlier than
we expected them to act.

104
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,250
We know where to go.

105
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,125
Please head to the
24th Floor immediately.

106
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,291
That's where the anomaly is.

107
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,541
I'll meet you as
soon as I'm able to.

108
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,041
[KONRAD]
I understand your urgency,

109
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,000
but we've got another problem.

110
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,166
I can't say for
sure what happened,

111
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,250
but Floor 3 has had its
power system severed

112
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,208
from the power spring
barrel on Floor 15.

113
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:44,166
I'm sorry, but there's simply
no way we can get to Floor 24

114
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,500
until we repair it.

115
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,916
The military doesn't
want us interfering.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They're actively
sabotaging us now.

117
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,333
Explains why the elevator
shut down on us. Damn.

118
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:56,625
[KONRAD] I promise we're
doing everything we can,

119
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,916
but the repairs will still
take about four hours.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,416
[MARIE]
Given the situation,

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,333
wouldn't it be faster to
go directly to the barrel?

122
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,750
Good thinking. You're right.

123
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,583
[HALTER] I have to ask,
though I'm sure I'll regret it,

124
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,875
we're going down to the power
spring barrel, aren't we?

125
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,250
That's a 30,000-meter
descent, you know.

126
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,500
Well, there's no other option.

127
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,125
C'mon, where's your
sense of adventure?

128
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,250
[COMM. VOICE A] Commencing
purge from the outer edge

129
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,166
of the Kyoto Grid.

130
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,666
[HALTER] Special express
to the depths of hell.

131
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,291
Better hold on tight,
Princess. It's a long fall.

132
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,416
You've got a pretty girl
all wrapped around you,

133
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,250
I would think you'd be happier.

134
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,458
[HALTER]
Heh.

135
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,208
[KONRAD] Meister Marie is
on her way to the barrel.

136
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,541
We're going to assist her
as best we can here.

137
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,291
We've got a lot
to do. Stay sharp.

138
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,625
[ENGINEERS]
Yes, sir!

139
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,458
[NAOTO groans]

140
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,791
[NAOTO]
Everyone's staring,

141
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,750
wondering what a pretty
girl like you is doing

142
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,875
with a loser like me.

143
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,541
So this is the high school
you attend, Master?

144
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,041
Yep, this is it.

145
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,541
I hadn't thought
about it till now,

146
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,708
but what will you do
while I'm at school?

147
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:18,916
That's simple.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,541
I'll do what's required
to perform my duties

149
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,125
as your servant.

150
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,625
[TEACHER A] Listen up, class, we
have a new student joining us.

151
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,750
Like the teacher said, I am
now a student at this school.

152
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,833
You may call me RyuZU Yourslave.

153
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,125
Is this really happening?

154
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,916
It is not a habit of
mine to spend time

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,833
with people of vastly
inferior intellect.

156
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,958
So there's no need to be
friendly to me, at all.

157
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,250
One more thing,

158
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,208
and this is very important,
so listen closely.

159
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,625
I'm a servant. I am
Master Naoto's property.

160
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:51,541
[chuckles]

161
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:52,625
[NAOTO screams]

162
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,666
What the heck are you saying?!

163
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,291
[MARIE] It's going to get
more narrow up ahead.

164
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,041
Think you can squeeze through?

165
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,333
I dunno. It'll be
a tight fit for me.

166
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,625
I'm not exactly a small guy.
We can't all be as flat as you.

167
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:10,666
[MARIE]
What?!

168
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,375
I'm still a growing
girl, damn it.

169
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,250
[HALTER] That sounds
like wishful thinking.

170
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,875
You know that wanting something
doesn't make it true, right?

171
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,500
[MARIE]
Die!

172
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,791
Ow!

173
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,041
We're almost there.

174
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:26,750
The barrel is through here.
Be sure to stay with me.

175
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,916
I'll be right behind
you. You ready?

176
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,625
As much as I'd like to,

177
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,291
we don't have time to
deal with these guys.

178
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,875
Then we'll take a shortcut.

179
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:42,833
You up for it, Halter?

180
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,458
Sure, let's go.

181
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
[MARIE
All right, we're here.

182
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,708
That's the barrel's connection
to the main shaft.

183
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,833
Ugh. I knew it.
They were waiting for us.

184
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,666
Come on. Let's go.

185
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,708
Right.

186
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,166
How much time do
you need, Princess?

187
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,333
Forty-one seconds please.

188
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,791
[HALTER]
Okay. You got it.

189
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,208
[HALTER]
Tch.

190
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,250
[HALTER]
A VS-071-A minotaur.

191
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,625
The latest offering
from Vacheron.

192
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,208
You wanna test your
strength against me?

193
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,083
Well, come on then, let's dance.

194
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,166
Okay.

195
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,250
Another 1-20 to go.

196
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,250
[HALTER]
I'm done with you!

197
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,666
[MARIE] Damn, I only
had three more to go!

198
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,916
Come on, think, Marie!

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,916
You've gotta do something!

200
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,416
[KONRAD]
Nice work, you two.

201
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,666
I hope you don't mind if we
give you a hand with these.

202
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,583
We don't mind at all!
Thanks, Meister Konrad.

203
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,416
Just one more left.

204
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:12,833
We're done here.

205
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,041
[MARIE]
We've got 18 hours left.

206
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,375
Let's hurry and get
back to the others.

207
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:41,208
[RYUZU] Is everything
all right? You look tired.

208
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, yeah? I look tired, huh?

209
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,583
Well, considering I
just spent all day

210
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:48,250
with my classmates looking at me
like I'm the scum of the earth,

211
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,250
I guess that's not surprising.

212
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,416
They envy you because you
have something beautiful

213
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,750
they have no hope of possessing.

214
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,541
You have me now, and that
makes you their superior.

215
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:01,041
You shouldn't allow the stares
of lesser mortals trouble you.

216
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,541
Okay, if you say so.

217
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:08,500
[RYUZU] I'm surprised at
how little it's changed.

218
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,750
[NAOTO]
Hm?

219
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,458
Wait, you mean you've
been to Kyoto before?

220
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,916
[RYUZU] I was talking
about the planet itself.

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,375
In 206 years--no, more.

222
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,583
In the thousand years since I
was built, it's barely changed.

223
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,541
It's stagnated.

224
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,958
Thousand years, huh?

225
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,958
Long life, even for
a clock. Real long.

226
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,500
It must be needing
an overhaul by now.

227
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,791
[KONRAD]
Pressure control unit JD-90021

228
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:45,000
appears to be working fine,
so that wasn't the problem.

229
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,958
This is impossible.

230
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,958
The control block has
trillions of parts.

231
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,583
That's just way
too many to check.

232
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,291
We can narrow it down some,

233
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,208
but that still leaves something
like 520 million parts

234
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,333
to look over.

235
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,208
No way we'll find
it soon enough.

236
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,500
It'd take a miracle.

237
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,958
[MARIE] Then we'll just
have to make one happen.

238
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,500
There are 20 million
lives at stake right now.

239
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:12,125
We'll fix this. Whatever it
takes, we'll make that repair.

240
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,166
We still have 9 hours
and 44 minutes.

241
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,166
Let's keep narrowing it down.

242
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,750
Meister Marie, we're
going to keep working,

243
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,666
but shouldn't we give an
evacuation notice to the public?

244
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,458
We can't. That might
spook the military.

245
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,916
They could move up the purge.

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,416
They'll do anything
to cover their tracks.

247
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,791
Yeah, he's right. It would
be too much of a risk.

248
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,375
So our hands are tied?

249
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,541
It feels wrong not
to warn people.

250
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,291
[HALTER] We got a message
from Guild headquarters.

251
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,375
We're to withdraw.

252
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,291
You've got to be kidding!

253
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,583
[MARIE] Man, can't we
catch a freaking break?

254
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:56,916
If only RyuZU were here.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,541
[HALTER] You think having that
thing with us would be helpful?

256
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,625
Assuming we could
get it working.

257
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:04,208
Which would be a
miracle on its own.

258
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,208
I'm grasping at straws.

259
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,291
Right now, I'd take help
from anywhere I can get it.

260
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,416
[MARIE]
So many people depending on us,

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,583
and they don't even know it.

262
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,791
Finding one defect in more
than 500 million parts?

263
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,000
We're looking for a needle
in a stack of needles.

264
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,125
It's going to be impossible.

265
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,791
There's no way.

266
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,958
But you're gonna
do it, aren't you?

267
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,708
You bet I am!

268
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,916
I'm Meister Marie Bell Breguet,

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,416
and I'm a woman
who doesn't believe

270
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,916
in the word "impossible."

271
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,333
Good, now here.

272
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,708
You and I both know you'll
be practically useless

273
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:50,000
without that.

274
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,916
You're such a jerk.

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,666
But thank you.

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,208
[NAOTO]
Huh? Ha-ha!

277
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,458
Is there something wrong?

278
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,583
Hey, would you mind
trying that outfit on?

279
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,458
[RYUZU]
Um, Master Naoto?

280
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm not so sure about this.

281
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,291
I don't think it's an
appropriate outfit

282
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,291
for a servant.

283
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,291
Nope, I think it's
totally appropriate.

284
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,791
You look really good!

285
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,791
Better than good! Amazing!

286
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,125
Thank you, but it doesn't
seem very practical to me.

287
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:30,291
[NAOTO] It's more fun
this way. Date-like!

288
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,541
I'm confused, though.

289
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,208
I don't understand why
you would want things

290
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,291
to be "date-like" with a clock.

291
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,916
What do you mean?
You're not a clock, RyuZU.

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,833
All right, but if I'm not
a clock to you, Master,

293
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,208
then what am I?

294
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,875
Only the best thing ever!
A cute automaton girl.

295
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:49,708
Wait a second.
You-You think I'm cute?

296
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,166
[NAOTO]
Super cute!

297
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,000
Hey, what if we do something
fun with your hair?

298
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,333
We could make it look a bit
more playful, you know?

299
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,666
--Just hold still.
--Wait. Please stop.

300
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,000
--I think I've got an idea.
--Wait. Please stop.

301
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,833
[NAOTO yelping]

302
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,708
[RYUZU]
I see now.

303
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,333
This makeover was actually
a calculated plot.

304
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:12,416
A way to disguise the sexual
harassment you intended.

305
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,750
No! No!

306
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,416
I'm not smart enough
for that, I swear!

307
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,791
[LIMONS]
I'll say it again.

308
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,333
You and your team are to cease
your repair efforts immediately.

309
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,875
[MARIE]
Will you tell us why?

310
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,875
[LIMONS] The military maintains
all the world's Core Towers,

311
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,208
which gives them a great
deal of authority.

312
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,708
We can't disregard their wishes

313
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,250
because we don't
agree with them.

314
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,250
It's a matter of give and take.

315
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,750
Give and take, huh?

316
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:39,250
We're talking about 20 million
people losing their lives,

317
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,791
and that's how you're
going to justify it?

318
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,916
[LIMONS]
A regretful sacrifice.

319
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,083
You're in bed with the
military, aren't you?

320
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:53,125
[LIMONS] The world needs both
the military and the guild.

321
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,458
It makes sense for us to work
together, don't you think?

322
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,375
You were the one
I spoke to earlier.

323
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,958
Bet you leaked
that message, too.

324
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:04,250
[LIMONS]
Going so soon? Where to?

325
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,166
[MARIE] Where do you think?
To resume my work.

326
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,708
Do that, and I will be forced
to revoke your license.

327
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:14,083
You'll be nothing more
than a regular civilian.

328
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:18,500
Of course, you won't be allowed
to enter the Core Tower, either.

329
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,250
What's going on here?

330
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,583
Your name. You're
Limons Vacheron.

331
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,708
So, what?

332
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,458
Is this the Vacheron
Company's attempt

333
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,458
to discredit the Breguets?

334
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,000
Quite an imagination you've got.

335
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,666
I have no clue what
you're talking about.

336
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,250
You disgust me!

337
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,791
[gasps]

338
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,833
[HALTER]
Marie!

339
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,500
Let's go.

340
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,208
This guy isn't worth the
effort of pulling the trigger.

341
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:52,791
Yeah.

342
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,875
No.

343
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:12,541
[screaming]

344
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,375
his isn't helping. Calm down!

345
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,666
[MARIE]
Let go! Let go! Let go!

346
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,541
[MARIE]
Don't you get it?

347
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,625
Don't you see what's going on?

348
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,750
This is happening because of me.

349
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,375
These guys want
to screw me over,

350
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,125
and the 20 million
people in this city

351
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,083
are nothing more than
collateral damage!

352
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:47,583
No.

353
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:51,250
The purge was gonna happen
anyway. The military wants it.

354
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,125
The shitheads from Vacheron
are just along for the ride.

355
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,791
How can you know for
sure that's true?

356
00:19:56,875 --> 00:20:00,958
If I hadn't been here, maybe the
purge could've been avoided.

357
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,708
[HALTER] Even so, that doesn't
make this your fault.

358
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,416
Shut up!

359
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,750
Shut up! Just shut up!

360
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:19,500
[MARIE laughing]

361
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,500
All those people...
just... gone.

362
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,875
Are you calm now?

363
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,625
[MARIE]
What are talking about?

364
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:35,666
Nobody's calmer than me.
I'm the damn queen of calm.

365
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,875
Whatever you say, Your Majesty.

366
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:42,291
It's okay. It's
going to be okay.

367
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,166
If these jerks think I'll
give up that easily,

368
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,541
then they're even
stupider than I thought.

369
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,875
I'll teach them not to
mess with Marie Breguet.

370
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,500
We've got a city to save,
Halter, let's get back to work!

371
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,250
[NAOTO]
RyuZU, how should I say this?

372
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,750
Well, to be perfectly
honest with you,

373
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,958
that outfit is just
a little unsettling.

374
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,791
I cannot comprehend the fetish
you have for skimpy outfits

375
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:10,208
or your wish to style my hair
"playfully," as you refer to it.

376
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,208
However, I do know that there is
a time and place for everything.

377
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,541
You don't have to come
with me, you know.

378
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,875
I realize I'm just being
willful at this point.

379
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,500
Of course I'm coming.

380
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,291
Unless you've got yourself
another bodyguard.

381
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,625
Besides, when have you
ever not been willful?

382
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,833
You shut up.

383
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,666
[HALTER chuckles]

384
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,791
So, uh, is this really
where we're gonna stay?

385
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,125
Master Naoto, you have
the courage of a flea,

386
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,291
so this may be difficult.

387
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,500
But could you please attempt
to display the dignity

388
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,208
and composure that a servant
of my caliber deserves?

389
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,083
--Is that...?
--You all right? What's up?

390
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,125
[RYUZU]
Why are we stopping?

391
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,333
Is something wrong?

392
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,541
No, it can't be.

393
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:18,000
That's the first unit of the
Initial-Y Series. RyuZU!

394
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,833
[NAOTO] The countdown for
the purge of the Kyoto Grid

395
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,041
draws steadily closer to zero.

396
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,500
As trouble continues to brew,
two geniuses meet.

397
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,791
With their powerful
automata at their sides,

398
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:11,958
an unlikely and unexpected
quartet is born.

399
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,583
The gears that will
determine the fate

400
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:16,083
of the Clockwork Planet
are beginning to turn.

401
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,916
Where will they lead us?

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,166
Next time: "Conflict."

403
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,083
Come on, ya gotta be kidding me!

404
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:25,041
How could I not fall in love
after something like that?
