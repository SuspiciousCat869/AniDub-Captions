00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,875
[GENERAL 8A] From the beginning
of our existence,

2
00:00:20,958 --> 00:00:25,041
mankind sought to master the
five elements of the world.

3
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,625
Over time, we acquired
power so great

4
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,500
it almost approached the divine.

5
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:33,291
Then one day it came
crashing down on us.

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,333
The Earth was destroyed,
reality was rewritten,

7
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,833
and we were faced
with the knowledge

8
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,916
of just how small we are.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,750
It became clear this universe
was the sandbox of a crazed god,

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,666
and we humans were nothing
more than playthings

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,541
to be used and discarded.

12
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,333
This world of ours--

13
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,833
this place full of ambiguities,

14
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:59,041
uncertainties, absurdities,
and inconsistencies--

15
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:03,291
was merely a joke
to a careless god.

16
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:06,458
How could we continue
knowing that?

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:12,416
How could we accept
such an ugly truth?

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
How could we help but wonder

19
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:20,000
if this world of ours
is actually real?

20
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,666
[NAOTO] I can't believe
how cute you are!

21
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,125
You may be the cutest girl
in the whole world!

22
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,208
[RYUZU]
Master Naoto.

23
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,541
[BOTH]
Huh?

24
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,750
Are you already abandoning
me for a younger model?

25
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,250
[NAOTO]
No, not at all!

26
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,250
I'm totally devoted
to you, RyuZU!

27
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,541
I think of AnchoR as
a daughter, I swear!

28
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,041

You're both crazy.

29

Hey, sorry it took so long,

32
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:30,125
but we managed to get everybody
safely out of Akihabara.

33
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,708

Oh, hey. Good work, thanks.

Anyway, check this out.

I think it's the cyborg
from the Mie factory.

37
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,958
Okay, so what're
you gonna do?

38
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,416
Try to fix it! It's not like it
can be in worse shape, right?

39
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,416

[MARIE]
Hi there! Are you with us now?

41
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,958
[VERMOUTH]
Where am I...?

42
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,500
Hey, you're Vainney Halter!

43
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,958
I sure am, but why's
that matter to you?

44
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,250
Because I know who you work for.

45
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,625
If you're here, it means
that's Marie Bell Bregay.

46
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,041
She's the one who
got you working,

47
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,416
but given the shape you're in,

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,583
I'm not sure that's somethin'
to be thankful for.

49
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,958
The way I see it,
alive is better than dead.

50
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,333
Even if I'm missing
a body part or two.

51
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,666
Ha! A lot more than two.

52
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,666
So, it looks like
your plan worked.

53
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,041
I mean, she's not tryin' to kill
everyone anymore, at least.

54
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,333
She wouldn't kill us.

55
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,625
She's an angel.

56
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,583
--Huh?
--What are you talking about?

57
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,291
Halter, whatever the sacrifice,

58
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,291
you'll do anything you have
to to protect Marie, right?

59
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,250
You were ready to kill
your soul and be a machine.

60
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,208
Ready to throw away your life.

61
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,916
Hold on. Is that how
you figured it out?

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,916
How you knew that AnchoR
can't attack humans?

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,500
So basically, what
you're tellin' me

64
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:52,958
is that I was schooled by an
automaton on my humanity.

65
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,500
Honestly, she really
is quite the angel.

went to the trouble of

been rendered nonoperational.

[OPERATORS cheering, laughing]

164
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,750
A good result, Your
Excellency. Quite good.

165
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,291
The outcome I'd expected.

166
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,250
[OFFICER 8A] Now we've proven
that even the country's

strongest weapons,
and most elite troops,

168
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,958
are ineffective against
our Yatsukahagi.

Nothing can stand before it.

170
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,791
Other countries will know
what happened today,

171
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,750
and they will have no
choice but to acknowledge

172
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,208
the usefulness of our research.

173
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,750
The enemy is retreating.

All right. Everyone stay alert.

[SUPERIOR OFFICER 8A]
Listen up, men!

179
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,875
Once charging is complete,

180
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,291
we will move forward and
finish what we started.

[OPERATORS]
Ha!

183
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:02,291
[GENERAL 8A] That may be
your reason for being here,

184
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:05,041
but it isn't mine.

185
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,250
[GENERAL]
You know the story.

186
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,833
A thousand years ago,
the planet died.

187
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:15,291
And Y, our "great savior",
reconstructed it using gears.

188
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,625
Many scientists sacrificed their
lives to the hopeless quest

189
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,416
of understanding the workings
of his Clockwork Planet.

190
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,041
It was no use. They failed,
or, really, we failed.

191
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,375
Constructing an absurd
world like this

192
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:33,625
and leaving humanity
to its mercies...

193
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,583
What kind of reckless, arrogant
genius must Y have been

194
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,875
to do that?

195
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,833
Let me ask you something, boy.

196
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,958
Have you never felt like
giving up on this world?

197
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,666
Haven't you ever
thought that maybe

198
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,666
it's not worth fighting for?

199
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,666
When all it does is crush
us, stealing hope?

200
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,583
You may have given up, but
whatever happens, we never will!

201
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,833
[gasps]

202
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,625
[grunts] Hot! Damn it!

203

[growls] That noise is terrible!

204

Whatever's going on here,
it's not good.

205
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:33,791
[NAOTO] Hey, Marie! Do you
know what's happening?

206
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,000
Everything...

207
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,208
Literally...

208
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,625
...everything has
been destroyed.

209
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,250
[PRIME MINISTER] Terrorists
striking at us in the night?

210
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,958
Mysterious weapons? Someone
tell me what's going on!

211
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,333
Prime Minister.
The situation is dire.

212
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,125
Yes, I've gathered
that much, thank you.

213
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:01,333
I want details.

214
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,250
Our approval rating
has already taken a hit

215
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,916
after that business
with the Kyoto Grid.

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,250
[OFFICIAL 8E] Please, sir,
there's someone here

217
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:07,791
who may help to explain.

218
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,375
My name is Karasawa.
I am a civilian meister.

219
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,125
But I have come here
as a consultant

220
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,583
to the Ministry of Technology.

221
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,458
When you said everything's
been destroyed,

222
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:26,333
what did you mean by that?

223
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:31,458
That huge electromagnetic pulse,
it magnetized everything.

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,583
[MARIE]
Do you get it now?

225
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:39,833
A magnetized gear can't
function properly, or at all.

226
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,541
RyuZU!

227
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,041

00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
[NAOTO groans]

229
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,458
[MARIE]
Like I said,

230
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,500
everything we know
has been destroyed.

231
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,916
Unfortunately, none of the
resources currently available

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,250
will be sufficient to bring
down the Yatsukahagi.

233
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,750
You can't be serious.

234
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,916
That's unacceptable,
there must be a way.

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,583
Well, as you can see,
even the strongest

236
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:15,291
conventional weapons have
absolutely no effect.

237
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,875
Then do something
to make them stronger!

238
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,791
Our only option is a purge.

239
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,375
What?!

240
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,000
Fortunately, the whole Akihabara
Grid has already been evacuated.

241
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,500
If we purge the grid quickly,

242
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,250
we will be able to take the
Yatsukahagi down with it.

243
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,000
[FIN]
Now hold on just one second!

244
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,333
Don't forget that Tokyo
is a multiple grid.

245
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,833
All the grids are connected,

246
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,750
so purging one will
affect the others.

247
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,000
[OFFICIAL 8AA]
Purging could cause

248
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:40,166
serious damage to all of
Japan, not to mention

249
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,375
possible repercussions
throughout eastern Asia.

250
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,625
[MINISTER OF DEFENSE]
If we act quickly

251
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,916
to contain the situation,
we can spin it

252
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,083
however we need to
when this is all over.

253
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,458
[OFFICIAL 8AA]
We'll be jeopardizing the peace

254
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,875
of an entire continent!

255
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,125
[MINISTER OF DEFENSE]
That sort of cowardly thinking

256
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,708
is why other countries
take advantage of us.

257
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,291
[OFFICIAL 8AA]
No, actually, Minister...

258
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,541
[KARASAWA] I came here to gather
information for Meister Marie,

259
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,458
but I didn't think
it'd be this bad.

260
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,750
[FIN]
Hey, you!

261
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,833
Yes?

262
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,291
[FIN]
Tell us more about that weapon.

263
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,833
What exactly is it, anyway?

264
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,083
[KARASAWA] If a theory would
suffice, I'd be happy to answer.

265
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:10,458
[FIN] A theory? What kind of
technology consultant are you?

266
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,250
A good one, I assure you.
However, I am a clocksmith.

267
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,500
So, I'm not too well versed in
electromagnetic technology.

268
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,791
It can't be true.

269
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,875
This weapon...
that's what it's using?

270
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:24,916
Yes. Considering that it
disabled the entire grid

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,333
with one large pulse,

272
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,208
and that it appears completely
immune to our weapons,

273
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,458
that's the only feasible
explanation.

274
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,000
Electromagnetic technology
is a violation of

275
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:37,333
the Treaty of the International
Territory Administration.

276
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,958
Why would something like that
even be in this country?

277
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,500
A weapon like that one would
be nearly impossible to build

278
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,208
without the resources of
an entire nation behind it.

279
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,916
Just what are you implying?!

280
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,458
Do you have any proof for such
outrageous speculation?!

281
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,125
Apologies, I meant
nothing by it.

282
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,750
[KARASAWA]
Perhaps we should assume

283
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,458
every country is doing research
on electromagnetic technology.

284

[gasps]

285
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,833
[KARASAWA]
So that's what's going on.

286
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:05,833
Meister Marie,
please be careful.

287
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,416
[NAOTO]
Everything's destroyed, huh?

288
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
Well, I don't buy it.

289
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,750
We should get
started on repairs!

290
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,625
You can do something, right?

291
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,166
Yeah. Probably.

292
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,875
If I could find a way to
demagnetize the gears.

293
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,958
Okay, then snap out of it
and get to work already!

294
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,333
How can I? Have you been
listening at all, Naoto?

295
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,250
That pulse magnetized
every gear in Akihabara.

296
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,541
It disabled the
entire freaking city!

00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,791
Everything is broken now!

298
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,666
We can't even get
out of this room.

All right. We're pretty high up.

But there should be plenty
of cables around here

[NAOTO] First, we have
to get out of here.

After that, we do the

and repair everyone.

317

And then, I'm going to
hunt down the people

00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,333
And I'm going to make them pay!

320
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,000
[gasps]

321
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,500
Are you coming?

322
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,416
If not, then keep your mouth
shut and let me get to work.

323
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,708
[MARIE]
How do you do it, Naoto?

324
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,666
The world is falling
apart while we watch.

325
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,375
And yet you never give into
despair, not even for a second.

326
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,625
Halter...

327
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,625
[NAOTO] I'm so sorry this
happened to you, RyuZU.

328
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,666
But don't worry, I'll
fix you up in no time.

329
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,750
[MARIE]
Wait. I'm coming with you.

330
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,083
[MARIE laughs]

331
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,833
[gasps]

332
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:44,375
Nice.

333
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:48,833
Yes, well, thank you for sharing
that wisdom, big brother.

334
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,125
Couldn't we have gone with
something different?

335
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,125
You know, if you want
a different cover,

336
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,708
you could be my dad.

337
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:57,416
Old man.

338
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,666
[HALTER]
Oh!

339
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,333
Sorry. I promise I'll fix you.

340
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,458
I'm ready to go.

341
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,250
Good.

342
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,875
Whoa! What?

343
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,583
[MARIE]
Halter's body is special.

344
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,000
It's the pinnacle
of the Breguets'

345
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,000
cutting edge technology.

346
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:22,291
I should know. I took part
in the initial design phase.

347
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,500
I won't let anyone touch it.

348
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,583
What?

349
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,916
Nothing, nothing at all.

350
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,291
Well, let's go.

351
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,250
[ANCHOR] Confirmed disappearance
of magnetic field.

352
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,333
Ending emergency sequence.

353
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,750
[gasps]

354
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:41,000
[ANCHOR] Initiating return
to regular sequence.

355
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,458
[ANCHOR grunts]

356
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,791
[sighs] That was so scary.

357
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:51,375
[cries] AnchoR!

358
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,583
What's wrong?
Why are you crying?

359
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,291
I'm so relieved.

360
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,666
My heart almost stopped when I
thought you might not wake up.

361
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,750
I'd die if something
happened to you!

362
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,083
[gasps] Father, you can't die!

363
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,083
[NAOTO] No need to worry
about that. I'll be fine now.

364
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,041
Once I realized you were
still moving inside,

365
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,083
I knew everything
would work out.

366
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,041
[ANCHOR]
Okay, good.

367
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,875
[gasps] Hold on a second,

368
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,333
did you just say that
AnchoR was still moving?

369
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,208
Yeah, the entire time.

370
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,458
But unlike her,
RyuZU overheated.

371
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,791
There must be a reason for that.

372
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,083
The anti-zappy provision?

373
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,458
Sorry, what now?

374
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,291
[ANCHOR] Um, well. It's
something I'm equipped with.

375
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,416
It sent me into an emergency
heating sequence.

376
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,166
Heating sequence?

377
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,791
You got rid of the
magnetic field

378
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,416
with the Curie Temperature?

379
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,666
Help me here, what's
the Curie Temperature?

380
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,541
Magnetic materials lose all
of their magnetic properties

381
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,083
when they are heated up
to a specific temperature.

382
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,333
Essentially, you can demagnetize
things by heating them.

383
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,833
Oh, I see now!

384
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,208
My sister can't cool herself
down the way I can, though.

385
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,125
Don't worry,
I've got it covered.

386
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,958
I knew she was hotter
than she should be,

387
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,666
so I moved her over here
to a spot where it's cooler.

388
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,916
Wow, Father, you're amazing!

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,166
But... your hand...

390
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,208
This burn must be very painful.

391
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,333
[NAOTO laughs]
I barely even feel it!

392
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,750
I don't care how
many burns I get,

393
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,291
if it's for my wife
and daughter.

394
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,416
[MARIE]
He knew all along.

395
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,958
That idiot already realized
RyuZU and AnchoR

396
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,708
were going to be fine.

397
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,916
But that didn't stop him
from moving RyuZU

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,458
so she could cool down,

399
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,250
even though it meant burning
himself in the process.

400
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,458
He acted out of instinct,

401
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,458
without even stopping
to think about it,

402
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,041
and did exactly the right thing.

403
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,500
He just barrels through life,

404
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,166
always ready to
sacrifice himself

405
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,000
for what he believes in.

406
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:45,000
Naoto, you are totally
crazy. And yet, somehow...

407
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:45,791
[NAOTO]
Marie.

408
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,000
[gasps]

409
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,625
Now that AnchoR's awake
and feeling better,

410
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,125
we should really get going.

411
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,708
Are you ready, Mother?

412
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,041
[MARIE]
Where are we going?

413
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,000
Someplace where we
can repair RyuZU.

414
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,833
Yeah, someplace where we
can make my sister better!

415
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, great. That's very specific.

416
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,000
All right. Well, for now,
let's head to Weno.

417
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,291
Meister Konrad will
be waiting for us.

418
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,500
--That's it!
--Okay!

419
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,916
[MARIE] I gues I'll follow
your example, Naoto.

420
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,375
[ANCHOR] The companions
escape Akihabara

421
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,583
and meet up with Meister
Konrad in Weno, as planned.

422
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,666
The threat of the
Yatsukahagi looms,

423
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,833
and Mother frets impatiently,
growing increasingly

424
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:11,458
more frustrated with
her inability to act.

425
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:14,083
Meanwhile, Father takes
me on a shopping trip,

426
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,583
determined to give me the
experiences he says that I've

427
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:19,291
missed out on over the
last thousand years.

428
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,041
Next time: "Criminal Act."

429
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:24,083
You don't have to
cry anymore, Mother.

430
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,666
I'll go and destroy it for you.
