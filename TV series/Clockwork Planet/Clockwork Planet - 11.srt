00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,125
[MINISTER OF DEFENSE]
Our primary objective

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,958
is the rescue of Her Highness
Houko Hoshinomiya.

3
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,916
All units, advance!

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,416
[MARIE] Connected the
bypass to block C-21!

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,166
Readjusting the rotational
speed of the AOS 5-0-2-2 gear

6
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,625
to increase it by
one fifteenth of a second.

7
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,541
Acknowledged.

8
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,708
Gear readjustment successful.

9
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,875
[MARIE] Please connect the HT
shaft to the deceleration gear.

10
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:57,916
[ENGINEER A]
On it!

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,208
[VERMOUTH]
Look at all you busy bees!

12
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,458
You deserve a reward
for working so hard.

13
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,166
Here's your prize!

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,083
[HALTER]
Are you done fooling around?

15
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,833
We've got work to do, kid.

16
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:08,708
Come on.

17
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,500
[KONRAD]
What's this?

18
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,916
You're heading back out?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,333
[HALTER] The military's
starting to get a little antsy.

20
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,166
Thought we'd go out and
keep them busy for a bit.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,375
Good idea, thanks.

22
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,083
Buy as much time as you can.

23
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,500
[HALTER]
Roger.

24
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,625
[HOUKO]
A moment, Naoto Miura?

25
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,833
Um, what do you need?

26
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:28,458
I'd like to borrow
you for a little chat.

27
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,250
[HOUKO]
I admit I am curious about

28
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,791
your single-minded determination
to destroy the giant weapon.

29
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,750
Is it retaliation for having
hurt the automata dear to you?

30
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,125
Well, yeah.

31
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,333
They enslaved AnchoR and forced
her to do something awful.

32
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,708
If that wasn't enough,
they also hurt RyuZU.

33
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,000
It's only natural
I'd want them to pay for that.

34
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,541
I mean, who wouldn't?

35
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,958
[HOUKO]
Your motivation makes sense,

36
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,875
but I don't understand why
you would assume the risk

37
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,333
of taking over
the Pillar of Heaven.

38
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:29,166
Would it not have been quicker
to purge the Akihabra Grid?

39
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,750
[gasps]

40
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,541
I believe that would have given
you the revenge you are seeking,

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,166
and it would have been
more efficient and less risky.

42
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,041
I could never do that.

43
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,750
I want to strike back
against whoever's controlling

44
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,833
that weapon,
not innocent people.

45
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,083
I understand.

46
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,208
Thank you for clearing that up.

47
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,375
I see now I was correct

48
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,291
in assuming you were
a dangerous person.

49
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,375
[NAOTO]
What?

50
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,125
How'd you get that
from what I said?

51
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:56,416
Well, fair-minded people
can be difficult to predict.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,416
[gasps]

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,583
Something wrong?

54
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,291
Frankly, I find your
response astonishing.

55
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,291
I never expected to find
another human being

56
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,250
who wasn't completely blind.

57
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,375
Aside from
Master Naoto, that is.

58
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,916
I'm relieved to know
I meet with your approval.

59
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,958
[GENNAI]
Let me ask you something, boy.

60
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,583
Have you never felt like
giving up on this world?

61
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,791
Haven't you ever thought

62
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:23,125
that maybe it's
not worth fighting for?

63
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,916
When all it does is
crush us, stealing hope?

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,625
How can you be
so arrogant, old man?

65
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,916
You don't have the right
to speak for all of humanity.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,375
You may have given up, but
whatever happens, we never will!

67
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,500
[GENNAI]
Someone came along

68
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:46,208
and stole everything
we humans thought we knew.

69
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,500
In place of Earth,

70
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,500
he created this grotesque
"Clockwork Planet."

71
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,166
If he had been a god or a demon,
I could have accepted it.

72
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,833
There would be no
reason for our species to fight

73
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,833
a superior being we would
have no hope of defeating.

74
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,791
I could resign
myself to that fact

75
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,166
and live with what he had done.

76
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,500
But then I met that boy.

77
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,708
Gentlemen!

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,333
[OPERATORS]
Huh?

79
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,541
I thank you for your dedication.

80
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,458
What is this?

81
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,041
Your Excellency,
what's going on?

82
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,208
Please, we've been loya--

00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:30,500
[screaming]

84
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,375
[GENNAI] I shall challenge
you one more time.

85
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:44,041
We shall see who wins, you
monster who pretends to be Y.

86
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,666
[VERMOUTH]
You shitheads!

87
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,291
Take that!

88
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,125
[VERMOUTH]
The damn things keep on coming.

89
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,000
I've got more stamina
than most people,

90
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,666
but I can't go on forever.

91
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,375
[HALTER] This might go better
if there was less talking

92
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,791
and more fighting.

93
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,083
Sorry old man, but I can't
squeeze out another drop.

94
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,166
I'm on empty. Ah!

95
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,750
[HALTER] Princess, you'd better
make something happen. Quickly!

96
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,541
They'll launch
the Tall Wand soon.

97
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,916
Thirty minutes left!

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,875
This is the home
stretch, people!

[NAOTO]
Look at her.

102
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,000
If I could work instead of just
standing here, being useless.

103
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,583
[NAOTO gasps]

104
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,458
What is it, Master?

105
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,208
[NAOTO]
No.

106
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,708
This can't be happening.

107
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,583
We were supposed
to have more time!

108
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,041
[MARIE]
What's wrong?

109
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,375
We've almost completed the
bypass to take full control.

110
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,875
[NAOTO]
Marie! Quick!

111
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,041
No time to waste!

112
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,708
Gather all clouds
to the south of here!

113
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,708
[MARIE] Initiate weather
control on the exterior

114
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,541
of Floor Twenty, six o'clock!

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,625
It's no use.

116
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:04,833
We're not gonna make it!

00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,875
What the hell?

121
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,250
Now the sky's falling, too?

122

[screaming]

123
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,000
They actually shot it.

124
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,583
Shot what?

125
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,083
[NAOTO]
Can't you tell?

126
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,375
The Yatsukahagi's main cannon.

127
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,958
That was the same type of
pulse that took out Akihabara.

128
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,291
[MARIE]
No way!

129
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,791
We were supposed to
have another fifteen hours.

130
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,125
I thought they were trying
to stage a coup d'etat!

131
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,500
If they destroy
the Pillar of Heaven,

132
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,083
they'll go down with Tokyo
and the rest of us.

133
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,666
[NAOTO]
I don't understand.

134
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,916
We were so sure they were trying

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,625
to take over the
country, but now--

136
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,458
[GENNAI] Shifting the clouds
was indeed the appropriate

137
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:08,833
countermeasure against
a microwave maser cannon.

138
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,375
And you gave that order

139
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,833
without even knowing the
underlying principles behind it.

140
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,208
Right, Naoto Miura?

141
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,541
I know that voice.

142
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,000
It's gotta be him.

143
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,458
[GENNAI]
I haven't introduced myself yet.

144
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,291
My name is Gennai Hirayama.

145
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,000
[MARIE]
You know this guy?

146
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,541
Who is he?

147
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,083
He's the man we met when we
fell into the Deep Underground.

148
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,708
An ill-mannered recluse who
has given up on the world.

149
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,000
[GENNAI] Despite the conclusions
you seem to have drawn,

150
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,708
I was never interested
in a coup d'état.

151
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,750
[MARIE gasps]
What the hell is he after?

152
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,958
[MARIE]
The bypass was disconnected?

153
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,333
With that one shot?

154
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,125
We have to get back to work!

155
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,250
[KONRAD]
Marie.

156
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,000
We've received an
urgent transmission.

157
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,708
Huh?

158
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,958
[KONRAD] They moved the
launch of the Tall Wand forward.

159
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,750
We're out of time.

160
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,875
No way.

[MARIE gasps]

162
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,458
[GENNAI] If you thought
I would let this end easily,

163
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,125
you were mistaken, Y.

164
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,875
Did he say Y?

165
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,041
[GENNAI]
Do what you can to stop me.

166
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:43,958
You'll see how strong
we common men can be...

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,750
...you monster.

168
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,333
[MARIE]
Okay.

169
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,041
We should get back to work.

170
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,416
Let's rearrange those gears.

171
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,333
Yeah, that's what we'll do.

172
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,291
Are you coming?

173
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,375
[NAOTO]
Marie.

174
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,791
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can help with that.

175
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,541
[NAOTO] What sound am
I supposed to be listening for?

176
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,750
I can't hear gears
that have disappeared.

177
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:16,958
[MARIE gasps]

178
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,625
[NAOTO]
They diverted all energy

179
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,458
to charging the
weapon's main canon.

180
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,791
That's why it was able
to fire again so quickly.

181
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,083
[MARIE] How long until it's
ready to take its next shot?

182
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:38,875
[NAOTO]
It fired more than once, so...

183
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,416
...72 minutes.

184
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
That doesn't give us much time.

185
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,416
Damn.

186
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,291
[HALTER]
Hey, Princess! Are you safe?

187
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,833
What's going on over there?

188
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,083
[VERMOUTH]
And how long are we supposed

189
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,708
to keep holding down the fort?

190
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,875
These guys are rough.

191
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,958
They're giving us
a real pounding.

192
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,750
[whimpers]

193
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:02,041
[KONRAD] Meister Marie, do you
remember what happened in Kyoto?

194
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,583
Everybody else had given up,
but you refused to.

195
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,708
Do you know why that was?

196
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,625
Because I found a miracle.

197
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,000
The same one that I've
been relying on ever since.

198
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,333
A miracle called Naoto Miura.

199
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,500
[KONRAD]
Hmm...

200
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,208
Naoto.

201
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,625
Can't you destroy that weapon
using AnchoR and RyuZU?

202
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,750
[NAOTO] You're asking
me to make them fight,

203
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:29,083
to endanger them again after
everything they've been through?

204
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,666
I can't!

205
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,583
It's okay.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,083
Order me.

207
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:37,833
Please.

208
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,958
I can't do that.

209
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,041
I won't, ever!

210
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,708
We can't stand by
and do nothing.

211
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,083
Yes, I know.

212
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,625
Just give me time.

213
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,833
There's got to be another way.

214
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,833
I'll figure something out.

215
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm sorry, Father.

216
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,125
Really, but... I have to go!

217
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,625
AnchoR!

218
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,083
[NAOTO]
AnchoR! AnchoR!

219
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,000
You have to bring
her back, RyuZU!

220
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,583
Hurry!

221
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,208
I'm sorry, but once she is fully
powered, even I cannot stop her.

222
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,666
Then find her.

223
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,583
Ask her if she will please
just give me 70 minutes.

224
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:19,666
I'll figure something out.

225
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,958
I just need time!

226
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,291
I will deliver your message.

227
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,250
Miss Marie.

228
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,791
There is something
I would like to tell you.

229
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,750
You should know
that you're right.

230
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,041
[MARIE]
Huh?

231
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,875
[RYUZU]
Like Master Naoto.

232
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,083
And at the same time,
you're wrong.

233
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,250
Right and wrong?

234
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,375
I don't understand.

235
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,625
Think about it.

236
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,625
It may take every cell
of your stunted brain,

237
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:45,708
but I believe you can manage.

238
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,833
Now, if you'll excuse me.

239
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,833
All right, let's do this!

240
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:53,791
[MARIE]
Do what?

241
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,041
There isn't anything we can do.

242
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:56,916
Don't say that!

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,625
We can come up with something!

244
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,416
You said it yourself: you can't
even hear the gears anymore.

245
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,375
But you think we'll
"figure something out"?

246
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,916
That's not how things work.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,666
There are no miracles!

248
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,791
Yeah. You're right.

249
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,916
I have no freaking
clue what to do.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,625
But I'm not alone here.

251
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,291
I have you,
and you're different!

252
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,500
Remember?

253
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,916
What happened to the
woman who always says

254
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,250
that she doesn't believe
in the word "impossible"?

255
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,291
As much as it disgusts
me to say it to your face,

256
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,041
you're a genius, Marie!

257
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,416
All this time,
it's been your talent

258
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,000
that's made my random power
into something useful!

259
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,166
You have knowledge
and skill; I don't.

260
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,916
So why are you the one
who's so ready to give up?

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,875
Use your damn talent, Marie!

262
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,208
Or if you won't,
then give it to me!

263
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,916
Please!

264
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,250
[MARIE]
Talent?

265
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,208
Did you say talent?

266
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,000
[MARIE] Why are you
looking at me like that?

267
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,708
You're envious.

268
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,833
You envy my talent.

269
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,000
[NAOTO screams]

270
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,500
Stop it you idiot!

271
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,125
You're going to break something!

272
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,625
Did you hear that pop?

273
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,208
[MARIE] Everything that comes
out of your mouth is crap!

274
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,500
You are such a jerk!

275
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,708
[NAOTO groans]

276
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,541
[MARIE]
There. Much better.

277
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,750
I'm done agonizing.

278
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,958
It's over. Finished.
Thanks for playing.

279
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,875
It's ridiculous when
you think about it,

280
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,208
that someone like
me would have to rely

281
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,500
on an idiotic pervert like him.

282
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,333
Damn! I'm so angry, I don't
even know where to start!

283
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,208
I'm pissed at myself
and everybody else.

284
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,375
That little shit should
be kneeling before me.

285
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,708
On your knees!

286
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:30,750
You've said enough.

287
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,375
Shut up!

288
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,958
[MARIE]
The fact of the matter is:

289
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,833
If I had Naoto's senses
or if he had my skill,

290
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,916
we could easily
construct a new bypass.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,875
We just need
to combine our talents.

292
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,875
It won't work.

293
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,125
How can we rebuild the bypass

294
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,791
when all the parts and
gears have disappeared?

295
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,041
We'll find a way.

296
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,125
Naoto and I can do it.

297
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,333
[RYUZU]
Wait a second.

298
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,333
[gasps]

299
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,333
Don't stop me.

300
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,208
Please don't.

301
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,041
I can do nothing but destroy.

302
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,166
It's who I am.

303
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,958
[RYUZU] There's much more
to you than you realize.

304
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,541
You don't understand why you
were given the name AnchoR.

305
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,958
[ANCHOR]
Why?

306
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,583
Master Naoto believes in you,

307
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,791
but you should believe
in him and Miss Marie.

308
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,458
Father and Mother.

309
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,250
I do believe.

310
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,666
[MARIE]
It took me awhile to understand,

311
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,291
but your senses
were right all along,

312
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,750
which means that what's wrong

313
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,541
is the original clocksmith
technology itself.

314
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,041
You do get what you're
saying here, don't you?

315
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,625
[MARIE]
Yes.

316
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:47,500
A thousand years of research by
who knows how many clocksmiths.

317
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,250
And all of it for nothing.

318
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,375
We got it wrong.

319
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,208
What?

320
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,041
Unbelievable.

321
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,666
But not you.

322
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,083
You know the answer, Naoto.

323
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,541
What do you mean?

324
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,541
[MARIE]
This isn't about academics.

325
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,166
I don't have to
give you a lesson.

326
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,083
Textbooks and
blueprints won't help.

327
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,375
All you can rely
on is your mind.

328
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,750
Everything you need
to know is already there.

329
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,958
In your head.

330
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,708
Say what now?

331
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,291
Naoto.

332
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,166
You hear the orchestra before
the performance has even begun.

333
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,583
But, then it begins

334
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,875
and you're disappointed
with the way the song sounds.

335
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,166
[MARIE] So, you listen to
each instrument one by one

336
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,125
until you locate the problem.

337
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,250
You tune them and let them play
again until they're in harmony

338
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,625
and the song sounds like
you know it's supposed to.

339
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,583
[MARIE]
What you're seeing is music,

340
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,083
the transition from
one piece to the next.

341
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,833
The flow of the symphony.

342
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,833
You don't have to think about
repairs and construction.

343
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,375
You're a conductor.

344
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,791
Your job is to
guide the orchestra.

345
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,666
[NAOTO]
Huh...?

346
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,000
Uh! Okay, enough of that.

347
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,083
Now it's your turn to teach me.

348
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,458
Well, um, actually, I think
you already understand.

349
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:05,875
Huh?

350
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,666
[NAOTO] I think you're capable
of more than you know.

351
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,000
I realized it when you
connected Halter's brain.

352
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,416
What are you talking about?

353
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,625
I had the blueprint memorized,

354
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,916
so I was just
working off of that.

355
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,291
Oh, really?

356
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,375
You could do a modification
you'd never done before

357
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,208
in that short a time
without thinking?

358
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,833
[MARIE]
Uh...

359
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,041
[NAOTO] You can see
it as you work, Marie.

360
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,291
The result.

361
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,750
The outcome you're striving for.

362
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,458
[MARIE]
No! That's not...

363
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,958
I see. That's it.

364
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,708
You and I, we're opposites.

365
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,375
Opposites, how?

366
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,375
[MARIE] Naoto constructs
the situation from the answer,

367
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:47,958
and I arrive at the answer
by looking at the situation.

368
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,541
I want you to tell me
everything you heard

369
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,750
when you listened
to the Pillar of Heaven.

370
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm going to decode it
all and memorize it.

371
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,708
And then I'll make it my own.

372
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,291
All right, but I might have
a hard time putting it

373
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,125
into words properly.

374
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,791
Listen carefully to
what I am about to tell you,

375
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:05,958
and then let it go.

376
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:07,500
[MARIE]
Huh?

377
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,083
[NAOTO]
You don't have to memorize it,

378
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,916
but don't forget it.

379
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,375
Listen to everything
and nothing.

380
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,208
Think without thinking.

381
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,625
Everything is right and wrong.

382
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,583
Contradictions make sense.

383
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,875
Right is left.

384
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,666
Nothing exists,
and everything exists.

385
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,875
[MARIE]
Huh?

386
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,375
[NAOTO]
You don't know, but you know.

387
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,583
You know, but you don't know.

388
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:35,375
You don't remember,
but you remember.

389
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:35,958
Let's go.

390
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,333
[MARIE]
Wait!

391
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,833
[NAOTO]
You don't have to memorize it,

392
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,916
but don't forget it.

393
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,500
[MARIE screams]

394
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,708
[NAOTO]
You don't have to memorize it,

395
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,000
but don't forget it.

396
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,000
Listen to everything
and nothing.

397
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,791
You don't know, but you know.

398
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,125
One last thing.

399
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,666
If something built using
clockworks can't function

400
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,666
when even a single
gear is missing...

401
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,166
[MARIE, NAOTO]
...the question is:

402
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,958
How is the planet still working?

403
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,500
[NAOTO]
Marie. Marie?

404
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,083
All right, you're awake.

405
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,625
You get it?

406
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,583
[MARIE]
Huh? Get what?

407
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,375
[NAOTO]
Okay. Good.

408
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,000
You memorized it.

409
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,375
[gasps]

410
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,583
[MARIE]
Hold on!

411
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,083
I have no clue what you told me.

412
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,416
I think you do.

413
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,458
Remember?

414
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,541
What you said?

415
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,583
That was quick.

416
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,666
What, do you have the blueprint

417
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,833
for every automaton
model memorized?

418
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,291
Yup, know 'em all by heart.

419
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,833
It comes in handy.

420
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:40,333
Memorizing god-only-knows
how many blueprints?

421
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,875
Something like
that's impossible.

422
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,041
Unless you are you.

423
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,750
[MARIE]
Uh...

424
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:49,500
[NAOTO]
It's fine.

425
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,625
Let yourself believe.

426
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,833
Are you ready to eat my dust?

427
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,958
Do you know who you're
talking to, newbie?

428
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,625
Let's do this!

429
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,583
[NAOTO]
Here, everything is right.

430
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,083
And everything is wrong.

431
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:16,208
Contradictions make sense.

432
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,833
Right is left.

433
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,166
Everything exists.

434
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,083
Nothing exists.

435
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,375
[MARIE]
Uh... Mm!

436
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,291
[MARIE laughs]

437
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,833
All right!

438
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,083
In case there wasn't already
enough proof of my brilliance.

439
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,833
Am I seeing what
I think I'm seeing?

440
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,250
New gears are being born!

441
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,458
There, y'see?

442
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,041
Did you really think there
was something I could do

443
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,500
that you couldn't figure out?

444
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:55,958
[MARIE]
Ha! Of course not!

445
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,208
I am a genius who makes
the impossible possible.

446
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,166
I'm also the woman
who's going to crush you,

447
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,000
so let's keep going.

448
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,958
[NAOTO] Marie! Listen to the
carving sound of the coaxial.

449
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,916
The locking corner is worn down,
and it's not going deep enough.

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,291
[MARIE]
Not a problem.

451
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,541
I'll just push in the
H-I-M-0-3-3-1, and... there!

452
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,375
That did it.

453
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,291
Try to focus!

454
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,208
Back at ya.

455
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,583
No more giving up, Marie!

456
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,458
Those two are amazing.

457
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,291
Yes, I've never
seen anything like it.

458
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:25,500
I wonder how far
they intend to go.

459

[ANCHOR]
It's time now.

460
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,458
Here. I don't want
this to get lost or dirty.

461
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,875
You take it.

462
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,833
Keep it safe.

463
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,875
I'll look after it
until you return.

All right.

00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,666

Materializing now.

[ANCHOR] Instead of
following Father's orders,

I attack the giant

Desperate to save
both Akihabara and me,

to repair the Pillar of Heaven.

of fate turn again,

486
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,875
will they bring hope or despair?

487
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,708
Next time, "Steel Weight."

488
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,958
It's no use.

489
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,500
I can't destroy it.

490
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,166
It's what I was made for...

491
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,000
...but I... I failed.
