00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:21,125
[MARIE]
My name is Marie Bell Breguet.

2
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,625
As you can see, I'm a member
of the Meister Guild.

3
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,208
If we have inconvenienced
you somehow,

4
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,958
I offer my sincerest apologies.

5
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,125
Holy sprockets, is that
really a Chrono Compass,

6
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:30,875
the mark of a
world-class clocksmith?!

7
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:32,666
The thing that allows
you to inspect and tinker

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,750
with all the gears in the world?

9
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:36,333
Can I please, oh please, see?

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:37,958
[MARIE]
Hmph.

11
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,666
If you would calm down, there
are things we need to discuss.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,375
This automaton, YD-01 RyuZU,

13
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:45,250
is the property of
the Breguet family.

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,083
We have a project that
requires its abilities.

15
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,166
So I ask that you
return it to us at once.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,458
Not a chance.

17
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,916
[MARIE gasps]

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,666
Of course, I'll make
sure that you're given

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,666
an appropriate reward.

20
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,708
I said no.

21
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,916
Sorry, but RyuZU's mine now.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,291
[grumbles]

23
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,666
Well, Halter, looks like
we'll have to bury this guy

24
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,375
and forget we ever met him.

25
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,666
Something tells me
he won't be missed.

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,000
We don't have time for this.

27
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,916
We can't afford to be
picky about our methods.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,583
I think you should
stop talking now.

29
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,791
[MARIE]
Shut up!

30
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,666
I'm not gonna let this
idiot get in my way.

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,125
I'm serious, Marie,
shut your mouth.

32
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,625
And look.

33
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:35,125
Now, then...

34
00:01:35,208 --> 00:01:38,333
What was that you were saying
about burying someone?

35
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,625
[RYUZU]
You are a piece of junk,

36
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,583
and that gun is nothing
but a pathetic little toy.

37
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,833
But, toy or not,
I will not allow you

38
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,500
to point it in my
master's direction.

39
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,250
I will prove this by turning
you both into mincemeat.

40
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,791
[gasps]

41
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,708
[HALTER]
I have no intention to hurt him,

42
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,583
and the princess here
wasn't serious, either.

43
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,250
Maybe this will
finally teach you

44
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,083
to keep that big mouth
of yours closed.

45
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,625
I almost just died,
so be nice to me!

46
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:44,958
You're wrong about that.

47
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,541
If she wanted us
dead, we'd be dead.

48
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,958
Now calm down.

49
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,333
Like it or not, she's the
one who's in control here.

50
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,458
I retract my statement that
you are a piece of junk.

51
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,625
Obviously, you
grasp the situation.

52
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,875
[HALTER]
I apologize for our behavior.

53
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,583
But I would like to ask
that you hear us out.

54
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,833
[NAOTO] They're going to purge
Kyoto and kill everyone

55
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,750
who lives here without
a second thought?

56
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,375
And this is happening
in seven hours?

57
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,791
You've gotta be kidding!

58
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:19,041
That's why we need you. Now.

59
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,666
The Initial-Y Series
are masterworks,

60
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,250
the best automata
left behind by Y,

61
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,000
the creator of the
Clockwork Planet.

62
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,166
They are maintenance
machines that were entrusted

63
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,583
to the future
generations of our world.

64
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,666
You awoke now for a reason.

65
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,291
Because you are the guardian of
this planet and it needs you.

66
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,208
So am I wrong?

67
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,750
Well?

68
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,916
I'm very sorry.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,125
You aren't as stupid
as I thought you were.

70
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,875
You're stupider.

71
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,500
In fact, you're so
far off the mark,

72
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,541
I can't tell if you're
even trying to arrive

73
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,916
at the correct answer.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,375
[MARIE] Hey, stop that!
I don't need pity from you!

75
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,583
Fine, if I'm wrong,

76
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,000
why don't you tell
me what you are?

77
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,000
[RYUZU]
"One Who Follows."

78
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,291
I exist to stay by
Master Naoto's side

79
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,333
and do everything he wishes.

80
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:11,166
I'm his servant. I am
to fulfill his desires.

81
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,541
Yeah, baby!

82
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,916
[RYUZU]
However, fortunately for you,

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,666
there is somebody who can help
with your current problem.

84
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,666
Really? Who is it?

85
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,583
[gasps]

86
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,666
Well, you see--

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,125
Quick, over here!

88
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,041
[MARIE]
Hey, what's going on?

89
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,791
[NAOTO]
There's a big one coming!

90
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,541
[MARIE]
A gravity anomaly!

91
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,791
Is the military
beginning the purge now?

92
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,958
No, it's way too early.

93
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:46,666
[PEOPLE screaming]

94
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,291
[HALTER]
The damage looks extensive.

95
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,833
[MARIE]
This is just the beginning.

96
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,583
Once the real purge starts,
it won't be so contained.

97
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,708
[NAOTO]
RyuZU, are you all right?

98
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,958
Of course. I am perfectly fine.

99
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,458
Okay, tell me how you knew
what was about to happen!

100
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,125
[NAOTO] There was a loud
noise from underground.

101
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,750
I figured it had to
be an anomaly.

102
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:17,291
[MARIE] Wait, those are noise
cancelling headphones.

103
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,166
Nowadays, even the cheapest
pair has a 100% block rate.

104
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,958
How can he even
have a conversation?

105
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,750
There's some dissonance.

106
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,791
It's coming from the Kyoto Core
Tower somewhere on Floor 24.

107
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:31,791
Hold on!

108
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,208
When I told you
about the problem,

109
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,958
I said nothing about
it being on Floor 24.

110
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,375
How did you know?

111
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,500
You're saying that you
pinpointed some anomaly

112
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,958
seven kilometers beneath us

113
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,166
while wearing
noise-cancelling headphones?

114
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,416
Well, yes, why?

115
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,791
That isn't possible!

116
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:49,458
There's no way a human could
do something like that!

117
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:52,916
[RYUZU] That's child's
play for Master Naoto.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,916
He did what no one else could.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,333
He was able to locate
and repair the defect

120
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,666
that kept me in
slumber for 206 years.

121
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,666
Given that, I believe
he can save this city.

122
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,041
Where generations of Breguet's

123
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,375
most talented clocksmiths
failed, you succeeded.

124
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,583
I just have slightly better
hearing than the average person.

125
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,458
Not true.

126
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,833
As I've said before,

127
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,375
you're mankind's most
talented clocksmith.

128
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,208
That's nice of you to say,
but I'm not, seriously.

129
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,875
[MARIE]
Naoto, that was your name?

130
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,083
Yeah, that's me.

131
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,250
[MARIE] We have a full
team working on it,

132
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,416
but we still haven't been able

133
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,125
to locate the
problem on Floor 24.

134
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,000
And you're saying
you can do it alone?

135
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,208
[NAOTO]
No.

136
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,708
I can't pick out all
the details from here.

137
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,791
Then I'll take you where
you can pick them out.

138
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:40,541
Anything to keep the
purge from going forward.

139
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,125
I don't understand why
you're even doing this.

140
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,041
It sounds like you're
surrounded by enemies

141
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,333
and you have no hope of
solving the problem in time.

142
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,000
So why try?

143
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,208
Why not get out while you can?

144
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,416
I've never been the type
of person to calmly accept

145
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,625
that something is impossible.

146
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,500
I know things don't
always work out,

147
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,583
but we're alive right now
because of the people

148
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,083
who weren't afraid
to keep trying

149
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,541
no matter how hopeless
it all seemed.

150
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:09,750
If I run away, then I'll never
have faith in myself again.

151
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,208
[MARIE]
So please, Naoto.

152
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,125
Help us. The city needs you!

153
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,291
I don't know.

154
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,875
[RYUZU] Since I am nothing
but a servant to Master Naoto,

155
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,291
I was torn about
whether to mention this,

156
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,208
but my younger sister is in
the basement of the Core Tower.

157
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,416
[gasps]

158
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,250
You... Uh... Huh?

159
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,541
[RYUZU]
That's right.

160
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,833
My younger sister,
Initial-Y Series Unit Four,

161
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,208
"One Who Annihilates,"
also known as AnchoR.

162
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,833
[NAOTO] Um. Could you
tell me a little bit about her?

163
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,250
[RYUZU]
She has pretty black hair,

164
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,250
which she wears in a short
bob, and bright red eyes.

165
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,708
She has a little trouble
expressing her emotions,

166
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,041
and she likes to be spoiled.

167
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,375
[NAOTO]
Well, what are we doing?

168
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,583
It's time to get movin',
everybody! Come on...!

169
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,208
Great, we've set an
automaton-obsessed teenage boy

170
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,458
loose on the streets of Kyoto.

171
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,333
[MARIE] If the military finds
out what we're up to,

172
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,291
they'll stop us
however they can.

173
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,875
We need to make it to the
Core Tower before that.

174
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,708
[NAOTO]
Uh, too late. They already know.

175
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,666
What?

176
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,833
[VOICE A] They're approaching
the underground parking lot.

177
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,000
She's with a civilian
and a bodyguard.

178
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,500
A civilian, huh?
That's interesting.

179
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,500
I expect you to capture
Dr. Breguet alive,

180
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,791
whatever the cost.

181
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,541
The civilian and the
bodyguard are disposable.

182
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,791
I can make out a dozen
military automata.

183
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,916
They're ready and
waiting for us.

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,375
[MARIE]
No, wait a second.

185
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,500
We can't just go barging
in there like that.

186
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,333
It would cause a rift
between the Meister Guild

187
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,750
and the military for sure.

188
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,541
If that happens...

189
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,125
Okay.

190
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,708
So what should we do
instead of barging in there?

191
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:58,916
Play politics?

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
[MARIE]
What do you even know about it?

193
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,041
Nothing, that's why
I'm asking you.

194
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,583
You guys are here because you
wanna fix the Core Tower.

195
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,166
And I'm here because
I wanna meet AnchoR.

196
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,208
So let's do what
needs to be done.

197
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,708
Just focus on the
things that matter, 'kay?

198
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,833
[gasps]

199
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,333
[MARIE]
Halter.

200
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,375
What's up?

201
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,375
[MARIE] I've just been
out-argued by a complete doofus.

202
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,333
I find that very unsettling.

203
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,041
I can tell your ego's
been dealt a serious blow.

204
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,166
Would you like a little
time to recover?

205
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,750
We can always go on without you.

206
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,166
He has a point.

207
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,041
Right. We'll focus
on what matters.

208
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,458
Saving Kyoto.

209
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's get to work.

210
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,166
[HALTER]
Sounds good.

211
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,833
Since you're so eager
to get in there,

212
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,666
you better be ready
to help us out.

213
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,208
Um. I'm not really much
of a fighter, so...

214
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,833
It's not your fighting
prowess I'm interested in.

215
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,333
Don't worry,

216
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,208
it's that super hearing of yours
that I mean to put to use.

217
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,041
Is that the best you can do?

218
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,958
Impressive! You're no
ordinary cyborg, are you?

219
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,041
Nope, I'm an eighth
generation Breguet Unit,

220
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,000
a prototype two generations
ahead of what's current.

221
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,541
So cool!

222
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,708
Hey, do you think I could take
a look inside of you later?

223
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,833
[RYUZU] Master, since you
have yet to release

224
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,750
a torrent of pent-up
lust upon me,

225
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,791
I started to think
you were impotent.

226
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,333
Now, I suspect the problem

227
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,208
is that I am not
actually your type.

228
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,333
No! It's not like that, RyuZU.

229
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,750
Any gear nerd would want
the same thing, I swear!

230
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,416
[screams]

231
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,541
[MARIE] Wake up!
Do you have a death wish?

232
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,833
[NAOTO] I'm sorry about before.
Thanks for not letting me die.

233
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,208
It's in my best interest
to keep you alive.

234
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:56,583
Now try not to
fall behind, okay?

235
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:58,291
[MARIE] He's dead
accurate on the location

236
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,916
and type of all the enemies.

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,083
No one should be
able to do that.

238
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,125
Whatever this is, it's more
than just good hearing.

239
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,541
[NAOTO]
Hey, Marie, hold on a second.

240
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:09,708
What now?

241
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,666
There's a big one right there.

242
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,041
Optical camouflage?

243
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,958
Is that the VS-08 Goliath?

244
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,000
These guys definitely
aren't screwin' around.

245
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't understand
how this happened.

246
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,625
She's dead?

247
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,916
[VOICE A]
It was us or them.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We had no choice
but to shoot her.

249
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,541
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

250
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,750
After the dust settles,
we'll release a statement

251
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,500
saying she was lost
during the purge.

252
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,958
[VOICE A]
Are you certain?

253
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:43,250
The military has as
much to lose as we do

254
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,833
if anybody ever finds out
that someone from Vacheron

255
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,375
was involved in the murder
of Breguet's daughter.

256
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,458
Damn it! This wasn't the plan.

257
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,416
People keep getting in my way.

258
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,333
[HALTER chuckles]

259
00:12:58,416 --> 00:12:59,541
[HALTER]
Was that all right?

260
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,791
[MARIE] Yeah, I got
the recording I needed.

261
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,083
It should be plenty of evidence
to prove the connection

262
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,458
between the military, the
Guild, and the Vacheron pigs.

263
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,500
Was it necessary? Did you
have to fake your own death?

264
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,958
[NAOTO] Wow, RyuZU, that
was seriously awesome!

265
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,583
[RYUZU] You are too easily
impressed, Master Naoto.

266
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,125
You should have
higher expectations

267
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,125
of the people who serve you.

268
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,458
Yes.

269
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,416
Marie Bell Breguet is dead.

270
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,458
There is nothing left
to bind me now.

271
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:39,666
From here on out... I choose
my own path to follow.

272
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,416
Halter!

273
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,833
I'm on it.

274
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,458
[NAOTO yelps]

275
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,250
[NAOTO] How could you destroy a
perfectly good Chrono Compass?

276
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,541
What's the big deal?

277
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,708
It's just a hunk of metal.

278
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,375
"Let's focus on the things
that matter," right?

279
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,500
Now come on. Let's
go and save Kyoto!

280
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:09,875
[NAOTO] My God. And it's
going to get so much worse.

281
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,291
[MARIE]
Drive faster.

282
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,541
[HALTER]
Right.

283
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,083
[RYUZU]
Excuse me, Master Naoto.

284
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,291
What's going on back there?

285
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,291
[HALTER yelps]

286
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,333
That was close.
Are you all right?

287
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,666
Uh, yeah.

288
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,458
I'm okay, thanks to you,
but what about the others?

289
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,000
[MARIE screams]

290
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,708
Were you trying
to freaking kill me?

291
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,041
No.

292
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,041
In fact, I managed to save
your insignificant life

293
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,083
while ensuring my
master's safety.

294
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,083
Couldn't you have found
a better way? Jeez!

295
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,458
[HALTER]
Sorry, folks.

296
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,625
I think we need to save
this little chat for later.

297
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,833
They sent out the Core
Tower's defense squad.

298
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:08,083
It looks like we've reached
the end of the road.

299
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:09,125
[MARIE growls]

300
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,958
Hold on, RyuZU,
what are you doing?

301
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,875
Eliminating them.

302
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,416
These unsightly piles
of junk made the mistake

303
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,041
of pointing their
weapons at my master.

304
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:25,250
So now, they are mine to
dispose of, as I see fit.

305
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,000
What do you think you can do?

306
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,041
Those are the latest
military automata,

307
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,250
designed specifically to
protect the Core Tower.

308
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,625
[RYUZU]
It doesn't matter how many

309
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,958
of these scrap heaps there are.

310
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,291
They're no match for me,

311
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,500
even though I am the
weakest among my sisters.

312
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:44,250
Classification: Initial-Y
Series, Unit One,

313
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:47,041
"One Who Follows," RyuZU.

314
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,000
Unique ability: Dual Time.

315
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,791
Initiating activation sequence.

316
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,666
[RYUZU]
Commencing shift

317
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,083
from Clock One, real time,
to Clock Two, imaginary time.

318
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,458
Chrono Hook.

319
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,500
Making the jump from normal
mode to imaginary mode.

320
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,625
RyuZU!

321
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,916
[RYUZU]
Don't worry, Master.

322
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,041
It will be all right.

323
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,541
I am simply going to activate

324
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,416
the Imaginary Gear
that you fixed.

325
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
To you, only a moment
will seem to pass,

326
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,458
but it will be approximately
three hours for me.

327
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,958
I ask that you please allow me

328
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,208
to leave your side
during this time.

329
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,416
[NAOTO]
No!

330
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,750
Relative activation,
Mute Scream, begin.

331
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,666
[NAOTO]
RyuZU!

332
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,333
I'm coming!

333
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,041
Hey, RyuZU.

334
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,541
Ah, thank God. Her gears
are just out of energy.

335
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,250
[NAOTO] She really did
all this by herself?

336
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,625
No time for gawking.

337
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,125
Let's get outta here.

338
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,458
We've gotta get inside
the Core Tower.

339
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,750
Just give me a second
and I'll wind you back up.

340
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,583
[MARIE]
Imaginary time. Incredible.

341
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:34,250
Mind explaining the
concept? For us laymen.

342
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,750
Imaginary time,

343
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:38,833
an idea that exists only
in physics calculations.

344
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,000
At least, that's what I thought.

345
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,916
Imaginary time runs orthogonal
to what we experience

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,375
as "regular time."

347
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:49,291
The time is rotated by
a Lorentz transformation.

348
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,500
It becomes symmetrical
in Minkowski space-time.

349
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,375
[NAOTO] Ah, I see.
No, actually I don't.

350
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,666
[MARIE] Essentially, RyuZU
defeated those automata

351
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,250
by fighting in a timeline
that we can't perceive.

352
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,875
Incredible.

353
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,083
No wonder she was completely
drained after that.

354
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,333
You haven't understood half
of what I've said, have you?

355
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,916
How did you fix her when
you don't know anything?

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,291
[NAOTO]
Hm...

357
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,041
Maybe not knowing
actually helped me.

358
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,833
I mean, the fact
that Y even thought

359
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,416
of building a
planet out of gears

360
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,208
suggests he had a
screw loose somewhere.

361
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,666
So doesn't it kinda make sense

362
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,541
that the automata he built
are a little absurd, too?

363
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,500
[MARIE]
Unacceptable!

364
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,708
I can't believe the
esteemed Breguet family

365
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,791
was shown up by this
monumental moron!

366
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,041
[RYUZU] Good morning, Master.
Have I been out long?

367
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,333
[NAOTO]
RyuZU?

368
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,791
[NAOTO]
Um, I have something to ask.

369
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,458
RyuZU, will you
please marry me?!

370
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,750
[BOTH]
Huh?

371
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,458
That was a very ridiculous
question, even for you.

372
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,916
[NAOTO whines]

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,666
[MARIE]
So, have you been planning

374
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,291
that insane proposal long,
or is this a nervous breakdown?

375
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,166
[NAOTO]
I couldn't help it.

376
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,375
I opened my mouth,
and it just came out.

377
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,833
I mean, you saw what she did.

378
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,500
How could I not fall in love
after something like that?

379
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,625
I'm human, you know!

380
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,083
After this latest
embarrassing outburst,

381
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,458
I think it's painfully clear

382
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,708
that you are a few
gears short of a clock.

383
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,833
[NAOTO sobs]

384
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,458
Of course, I should've known.

385
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:55,291
We can only ever be master and
servant; never anything more.

386
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,166
I was under the
impression that automata

387
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,791
had to obey their masters
in every regard.

388
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,166
[RYUZU]
How insulting.

389
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,541
Please don't presume to
compare me to the love dolls

390
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,041
who happily spread their legs

391
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,250
the moment the master
registration is complete.

392
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,083
I am not a mindless object
designed to be lusted over.

393
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,583
I like Master Naoto
of my own free will.

394
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:18,750
[gasps]

395
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,875
Your free will? But
you're an automaton.

396
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,750
I wanna ask you something.

397
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,083
[RYUZU]
Go ahead.

398
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,375
When I proposed just now,
you said it was ridiculous.

399
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,583
Is there a reason
I can't marry you?

400
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,458
I'm your servant,
but if we married,

401
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,708
we'd be a couple and
that would put us

402
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,958
on equal footing
with one another.

403
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,875
The idea that a master and his
servant could ever be equal?

404
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,416
Impossible.

405
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,083
[NAOTO]
Then let's do this.

406
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,166
Just nod if the answer's yes

407
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,541
and shake your head
if the answer is no.

408
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,625
Is it true what you said before?

409
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,291
That you like me of
your own free will

410
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,541
and not because you were

411
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,375
previously configured
by somebody to do so?

412
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,666
[NAOTO]
Okay, here's my next question.

413
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,625
Is it more than "like"?

414
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,166
D-D-D-D-Do you love me?

415
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,083
[NAOTO]
You do? A little, or a lot?

416
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,916
Can you nod a few times
to show me how much?

417
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,250
I'm so happy.

418
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,583
Best day ever!
Woo-hoo! She meant...

419
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,083
This is quite an
accomplishment, master.

420
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,458
I've never been subjected
to such shameful treatment.

421
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,333
You are singlehandedly
giving new meaning

422
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:13,791
to the word "perversion."

423
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,916
Are you happy?

424
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,958
[HALTER chuckles]

425
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,750
[MARIE] Am I the only
one who understands

426
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,083
that we're busy, here?!

427
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,958
[RYUZU] The Kyoto Grid is
sinking deeper and deeper

428
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,416
into the ground.

429
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,041
The two geniuses work hard,

430
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,083
doing everything they can
to repair the Core Tower.

431
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,666
But what will happen
when the military

432
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,500
and the Guild crush their
last hope for saving the city?

433
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,416
Next time: "Imaginary Gear."

434
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,458
Foolish Master Naoto.

435
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,375
If you aren't willing to
make the sacrifice yourself,

436
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,000
somebody else will
have to do it for you.

437
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,750
Try not to waste
too much time crying.
