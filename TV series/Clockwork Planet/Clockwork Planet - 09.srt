1
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:23,875
[NAOTO]
Huh?

2
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,500
[ANCHOR]
This shop's weird.

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,750
What kinds of things
do they sell here?

4
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,541
[NAOTO]
Um, well...

5
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,541
It's a place for grownups.

6
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,166
You'll understand
when you're older.

7
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,541
[MARIE]
It doesn't make sense.

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,541
Why would Meister Konrad
want us to meet him

9
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,291
in a place like this?

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,125
[KONRAD]
Oh! Meister Marie!

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,833
Meister Konrad, you're... Uh...

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,458
[KONRAD]
I'm so glad you're safe.

13
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:45,708
We've been worried.

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:46,916
We didn't know what to think

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,416
when we lost contact
with you in Akihabara.

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,333
What in the world happened
since our last communication?

17
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,791
[MARIE] I'm sorry, he wants to
know what happened to me?

18
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,625
[NAOTO]
Whoa!

19
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,541
[ANCHOR]
What is it, Father?

20
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,958
Is something wrong?

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,333
This isn't something you
should be looking at, AnchoR.

22
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,750
[ANCHOR]
Okay.

23
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,083
Hey. You shouldn't be
looking at any of it, either.

24
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,500
For that matter,
neither should I.

25
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,458
Now, let's keep moving.

26
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,208
[KONRAD]
Isn't this a great place?

27
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:58,958
The automata I've adjusted
around here are quite popular.

28
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:02,291
And the customers are very
appreciative of the work I do.

29
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,625
[MARIE]
A "great" place?

30
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,375
Try corrupt, depraved, immoral.

31
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,208
Well, this is where I work.

32
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:08,791
Uh!

33
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,333
Huh?

34
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,958
[KONRAD] It's not something you
want to be too noisy about,

35
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,541
but there's a thriving
black market for automata here.

36
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,000
It's an open secret.

37
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,125
We even sell to the
authorities now and then.

38
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,458
Good, this is perfect.

39
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,208
It's exactly what we need.

40
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,416
Put RyuZU onto
that hanger over there.

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,208
We're going to
cool her down slowly.

42
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,666
'Kay. On it.

43
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,500
[NAOTO]
Hmm...

44
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,000
[MARIE]
And Halter...

45
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,500
I don't know what I'll do if
we can't wake him up again.

46
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,875
He's been magnetized.

47
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,958
But if his brain
is still intact...

48
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,250
[KONRAD] It looks
like we're going to need

49
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,666
a spare body, then.

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,541
[MARIE] Within the next
twelve hours, if possible.

51
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,000
As you can imagine,
that won't be easy.

52
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,500
I'll look around, though,
and see what I can find.

53
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,833
That's all I can ask for.

54
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,458
I know you'll do your best.

55
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,291
[ANCHOR]
I hate seeing big sis like this.

56
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,541
Will she be okay?

57
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,208
[NAOTO] RyuZU took
all the proper precautions

58
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,958
to protect herself.

59
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,708
I don't think we have
anything to worry about.

60
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,000
[ANCHOR]
That looks painful.

61
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,333
Does it hurt?

62
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,500
[NAOTO]
Not too bad.

63
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:14,791
I barely feel it.

64
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,375
Soon I'll be good as new.

65
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,666
They could still get infected.

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,791
Stop acting tough
and let me treat you.

67
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,583
Yeah, okay. Good idea.

68
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,250
You all right, Mother?

69
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,458
I want you to stop
calling me that.

70
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,166
Now, let me see your burns.

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,083
[NAOTO]
Oh, right. Sure.

72
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,208
[NAOTO] What's the point
in waking him up?

73
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,541
He's not really...
himself anymore.

74
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,500
It might be nicer to let him go.

75
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,916
[VERMOUTH]
What did you say? Well?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,833
How dare you talk about Vermouth
Handsome Face like that?

77
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,291
[VERMOUTH]
Oh...!

78
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,791
What the hell did you do to me?

79
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,708
No need to get shrill.

80
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,916
The only way to revive you

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,666
was to connect your
brain to an automaton.

82
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,750
[VERMOUTH] And you had
to pick a pleasure doll?

83
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,916
There must have
been other options.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,333
Does my dignity mean
nothing to you at all?

85
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:07,541
Honestly, I can't
say that it does.

86
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,250
[VERMOUTH] She connected
a cyborg brain to an automaton

87
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,416
that was of a
completely different make.

88
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
That goes way
beyond genius level.

89
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,208
Who is this chick?

90
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,333
The devil?

91
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,375
[NAOTO] I'd play nice
with her if I were you.

92
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,625
Halter's not waking up,
so she's on edge.

93
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,125
Well, more on edge than usual.

94
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,583
[MARIE]
Too much information, Naoto.

95
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,041
I want to hear everything you
know down to the last detail.

96
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,416
The weapon's in play,

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,416
but I still haven't figured
out what the endgame is.

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
You aren't seriously
this clueless, are you?

99
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,750
Huh?

100
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,125
[VERMOUTH] All the pieces
have been laid out for you,

101
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,666
and you still can't put
the puzzle together?

102
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,041
[NAOTO]
Those shitheads are just gonna

103
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,875
sit back and
do nothing. Right?

104
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:50,541
What?

105
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,666
[VERMOUTH whistles]

106
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,458
You look like such
a sweet little kid,

107
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,666
but you've got a devious mind

108
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,208
behind that baby
face, don't you?

109
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,000
[MARIE]
I still don't understand.

110
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,333
The appearance of the weapon

111
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,166
has pitted the government
against the military,

112
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,041
and that's not a fight either
one is likely to survive.

113
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,583
Things getting
clearer now, little girl?

114
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,916
[PRIME MINISTER]
We made a request

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,583
to the International
Territory Administration

116
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,166
for the use of the Tall Wand.

117
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,458
We'll target the Akihabara
Grid and the Yatsukahagi.

118
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,333
[OFFICIAL A]
The Tall Wand?

119
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,416
[KARASAWA]
This guy can't be serious.

120
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,791
We're talking about a weapon
of mass destruction dropped

121
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,125
from equatorial orbit
that's easily capable

122
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,916
of wiping out a city or two,

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,166
and he means to deploy
it on his own country?

124
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:39,666
[PRIME MINISTER]
Now that the public knows

125
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,375
about the electromagnetic
weapon, there will be

126
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,625
no escaping reproach from
the international community.

127
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,000
We must try our
hardest to make amends.

128
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,666
Like that matters to you!

129
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,875
All you care about is
avoiding responsibility

130
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,125
for illegal research and
the creation of the Yatsukahagi.

131
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,041
I won't allow you
to speak to me that way!

132
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,541
Oh, shut up!

133
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,416
This is obviously a situation
that will be best resolved

134
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,541
by the military.

135
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,916
Please! You and your
precious military

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,333
couldn't so much as
dent the Yatsukahagi.

137
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,500
[OFFICIAL B] Between the
mess in Kyoto and now this,

138
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,958
you've proved yourselves
completely worthless!

139
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,708
[MINISTER OF DEFENSE]
Take that back, you bastard!

140
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,250
Take it back right now!

141
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,458
[MARIE] You're saying that
the military and the government

142
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,375
are going to destroy
themselves just by being there?

143
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,041
That's why the weapon's
not making a move?

144
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,833
You're starting to get it.

145
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,541
This is no ordinary
terrorist attack.

146
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,833
These fools are
orchestrating a takeover.

147
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,750
A full-blown coup d'état.

148
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,375
[NAOTO]
Actually, for the record.

149
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,291
The weapon's not moving
because it can't right now.

150
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,291
What do you mean?

151
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,541
[VERMOUTH]
Yes, do tell.

152
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,916
Where'd you get that idea?

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,458
It's charging, using its
1,333 clockwork generators

154
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,875
to replenish its energy.

155
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,708
That's gonna take some time.

156
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:52,041
I'd say we've got...
66.5 hours 'til it's done.

157
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,208
Clockwork generators?

158
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,041
But it's electromagnetic.

159
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,625

00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,625
Hey, are you okay?

322
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,041
[NAOTO]
Sorry, could you please,

323
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,416
keep it down a bit?

324
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,916
Thank you.

325
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:55,833
[gasps]

326
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:56,750
You're in pain.

327
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,541
What happened to
your headphones?

328
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,750
[NAOTO]
They broke back in Akihabara.

329
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,500
So I ditched 'em.

330
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
You should've
got more first thing!

331
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,541
[NAOTO]
No time for that yet.

332
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,625
Once I find what I'm
looking for, I'll get some.

333
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,500
Hold on!

334
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,125
Tell me what you're looking for?

335
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,541
[NAOTO]
Isn't it obvious?

336
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,625
A chance.

337
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,250
A chance to beat up the people
who hurt RyuZU so badly.

338
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,166
I want to see them punished.

339
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,625
[MARIE]
Huh?

340
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,375
[MARIE] So he wasn't
just screwing around.

341
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,458
He's been thinking
about this all along.

342
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,791
[NAOTO] Multiple grids
are connected, right?

343
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,833
So that means they
all affect each other.

344
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,583
Um... Well, yeah...

345
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,666
They're all connected,
with the State Central Territory

346
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,000
Control Tower and the
Pillar of Heaven at the center.

347
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:47,541
[NAOTO] I found a way to
get us into Akihabara, but...

348
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,208
I've got some ideas, but
before we start making plans,

349
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,208
I need to know
what you want to do.

350
00:15:57,625 --> 00:16:01,916
[ANCHOR] Well, what I want
is to destroy that thing

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,958
to help Mother.

352
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,750
[NAOTO] All right,
what did you say to her?

353
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,291
Well, if she can take it out...

354
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,958
[NAOTO]
No way! Not happening.

355
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,375
How could you ask that?

356
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,375
You think you can just use her,
like she's some tool?

357
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:14,583
What do mean?

358
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,875
She's the Initial-Y
Series annihilator!

359
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,458
She's a weapon!

360
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,041
Don't you dare call her that!
She's my daughter!

361
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
And besides that,
she's charging right now.

362
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,500
You'd be sending
her out to fight

363
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,250
before she was
even at full strength.

364
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,541
Huh?

365
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:29,833
[NAOTO] You're okay
with making a small child

366
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,500
shoulder your burden
just because it's gotten

367
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,041
a little too heavy for you?

368
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,291
Don't you have any pride, Marie?

369
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,750
[MARIE gasps]

370
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,708
[ANCHOR whines]
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,916
It's my fault.

372
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,791
[NAOTO sighs]

373
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,291
[MARIE]
I didn't mean to say it.

374
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,541
I was so frustrated about not
being able to do anything.

375
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,416
So I just...

376
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,416
[gasps]

377
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,250
I'm sorry,
but I need to head back.

378
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,583
AnchoR, please
take care of Naoto.

379
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,333
A request? Right.

380
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:14,208
That's more important
than an order.

381
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,958
She can be difficult, but
she's actually pretty amazing.

382
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,583
Like, a total genius.

383
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,166
She's that smart?

384
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,666
For all her intelligence,

385
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,125
she has a tendency to get
hung up worrying about stuff.

386
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,083
Still, she does get things done,

387
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,500
which is more than
I can say for myself.

388
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,958
Huh?

389
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,208
Well, hello there, kids.

390
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,416
I wondered when
you'd get back here.

391
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Almost scary to watch, isn't it?

392
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,125
She's done all this
in only four hours.

393
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:03,958
Kinda makes you wonder
if she's actually human.

394
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,375
"A genius." I see.

395
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,666
You're right.

396
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,916
Yeah.

397
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,208
It's not fair.

398
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,666
That should be me.

399
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,708
[NAOTO]
I should be fixing her.

400
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,041
[NAOTO]
Damn it.

401
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,416
Huh?

402
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,541
[MARIE screams]

403
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,750
I'm all out of sugar.

404
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,416
Chocolate.

405
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,083
Choco...

406
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,208
[MARIE]
Thank you.

407
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,500
[ANCHOR giggles]

408
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,958
Ah, that's better!

409
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:44,791
Oh. Hey!

410
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,958
I didn't know you were back.

411
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,416
Just now.

412
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,083
[MARIE] I take it you found
what you were looking for?

413
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,416
[NAOTO]
Mm-hmm

414
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
How about you come over
and give me a hand, then?

415
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,166
I need three resonance
movement connectors.

416
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,916
It shouldn't be too hard.

417
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,041
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,208
I can't make those.

419
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:58,916
[MARIE]
That's fine.

420
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,416
Just the circuits, then.

421
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,250
[NAOTO]
Nope.

422
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,333
Can't do that either.

423
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,875
Huh?

424
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,000
But that's the kind of stuff you
learn back in middle school.

425
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,541
How'd you ever manage
to repair RyuZU?

426
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,875
I did it by feel.

427
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,250
Say wha?

428
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,000
[NAOTO] I didn't have
any particular plan in mind,

429
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,250
I just knew that
something sounded wrong.

430
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,250
I figured all I had to do
was fix that sound, so I did.

431
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,375
And that's when she woke up.

432
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,958
No way.

433
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,375
She's a crazy complex automaton.

434
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,875
That's ridiculous.

435
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,125
No one could repair her without
any theoretical knowledge!

436
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,041
Yeah, whatever.

437
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,708
Clearly, I did fix her.

438
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,916
[MARIE] He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,625
Unless, what if he <i>is</i> right?

440
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,000
What if we experts

441
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,500
have been missing something
fundamental all along?

442
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:42,958
[NAOTO]
Hey, Marie.

443
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,291
[MARIE]
Huh?!

444
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,083
You did say the Pillar
of Heaven is at the center

445
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,000
of all the grids
in Japan, right?

446
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,791
[MARIE] Naoto, what's going
through that head of yours?

447
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,291
We're going to take over
the Pillar of Heaven.

448
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,250
[gasping]

449
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,583
[laughs]

450
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,708
There's a plan!

451
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:03,208
Sure, why not?

452
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,208
I could kiss you, kid.

453
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,166
I think it's amazing, Father!

454
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,000
[MARIE]
Really?

455
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,208
'Cause I think it's insane.

456
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,208
Who was it who took
over the Akihabara Grid

457
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,625
in the first place?

458
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:13,750
That was us.

459
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,375
Who publicly
claimed responsibility

460
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:16,916
for the entire thing?

461
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,041
Again, us.

462
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,666
So, why don't we continue
to play our parts

463
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,833
and act accordingly?

464
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,333
Coup d'état?
Government conspiracy?

465
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,958
Nothing like that happened.

466
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,500
All of this was the
work of the villains

467
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:32,250
who seized control of Akihabara
and bragged about it on TV.

468
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,666
Makes sense, right?

469
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,458
[NAOTO] We're gonna throw
these people into the fire.

470
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,291
Akihabara is the fire pit.

471
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,958
And if we do this right,

472
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,708
the Pillar of Heaven
will be the fuel.

473
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:43,583
Hold on.

474
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,625
It's the center of the nation.

475
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,083
For something on this scale,
we need more people.

476
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,541
If it helps,

477
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,791
I've got an idea where to
get a spare body for Halter.

478
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,041
[VERMOUTH] And for what
it's worth, you can count me in.

479
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't mind doing my part.

480
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,916
You get that this
isn't a joke, right?

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,916
We're going to be criminals,
and not just petty ones.

482
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,708
What could possibly
be in it for you?

483
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,958
A whole lot of fun.

484
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,208
What better motivation could
a man ask for than that?

485
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,250
[MARIE]
Hmm...

486
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,833
[ANCHOR]
Mother?

487
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,500
Are you frightened?

488
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,000
Don't worry.

489
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,208
I'll protect you.

490
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,333
[MARIE]
Uh...

491
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,958
Come on, Marie.

492
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,541
These guys have spent years
putting their plans into action,

493
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,083
and now, we have the
chance to ruin it all for them.

494
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,375
Are you really gonna tell me you
don't like the thought of that?

495
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,958
Huh?

496
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,416
[MARIE]
Huh?

497
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,250
We're gonna save the world,
and it's gonna be awesome!

498
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,916
[MARIE]
I was so busy being frustrated.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,958
I forgot what's
really important.

500
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,666
Sometimes you just
have to do what's right

501
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,666
even if it means
becoming a criminal.

502
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,458
You're right, Naoto.

503
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,083
This'll be amazing, Let's do it!

504
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,708
[HOUKO]
It is out of our control.

505
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,958
As hard as we've tried,

506
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,666
we cannot come up with
a single countermeasure

507
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,708
to the threat that lies
deep beneath Tokyo.

508
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,708
I can do nothing.

509
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:18,875
In the face of this danger,
I'm powerless.

510
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,916
[HOUKO]
Marie.

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,958
If only you were here.

512
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,708
[VERMOUTH]
Without Halter,

513
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,541
the attempt to occupy the Pillar
of Heaven would likely fail.

514
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:05,500
After finally locating
a suitable automaton,

515
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,041
Marie begins the daunting
task of connecting it

516
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,791
to her bodyguard's mind.

517
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:13,250
But will even someone of her
genius be able to pull it off?

518
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,666
Next time, "Progressor."

519
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,625
Knowing old man Halter, the
scent of the battlefield alone

520
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:21,583
would probably be enough to
bring him back from the dead.

521
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,125
Fair warning, though,

522
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:25,875
he'll likely be in the
worst mood imaginable.
