1
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,083
[HIDETADA] What compelled you
to start hunting monkeys?

2
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,625
And to do it at Sengen Shrine,
in Suruga, where they

3
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,208
consider the animals to be
the messengers of the gods?

4
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,333
You must have been
aware of that!

5
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,625
[TADANAGA]
Yes, my lord.

6
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,291
And yet, you still
slaughtered scores of them

7
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,333
in a place where they are looked
upon as sacred beasts.

8
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,166
I feel awful.

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,958
I humbly apologize,
for whatever it's worth.

10
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,500
[HIDETADA]
Tell me why.

11
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:06,333
[TADANAGA]
The forest...

12
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,625
Nonsense.

13
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,250
What does the forest have
to do with anything?

14
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,916
My Lord. Father.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,916
I beg for your forgiveness!

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
[HIDETADA] It brings me no joy,
but I must strip you

17
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,500
of your lands and
peerage for this affront.

18
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,958
[NARRATOR] In the winter
of that year, Hidetada,

19
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:58,291
the second shogun, was taken
from this world by illness.

20
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,166
In accordance
with his last order,

21
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,208
his funeral was held in secrecy.

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,541
[NARRATOR] The year after
Lord Hidetada's death,

23
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,875
Lord Tadanaga was to be found
in the distant land of Joushuu.

24
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,291
[NARRATOR] It is said that
only then was his punishment

25
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,666
for the scandalous monkey hunt
at Sengen Shrine delivered.

26
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,375
[SHIKIBU]
Where is she?

27
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,250
Waiting for me to
make the first move?

[SHIKIBU]
You all right?

37
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,833
[SHIKIBU]
Looks like I win this time.

38
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,666
You know, one of these days,

39
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,583
you're gonna have to learn
to stop being so nice.

40
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,041
Even when we were
just little kids,

41
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,666
you never held back like this.

42
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,458
In those days,
I could barely keep up.

43
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:13,916
So what, now you're
afraid to give it your all?

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,916
No, I...

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
You're guilty
of it, too, you know.

46
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:22,000
I'd have been in real
trouble if you kept on firing.

47
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,083
Don't get the wrong idea.

48
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,000
I didn't stop because I was
taking it easy on you.

49
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,416
It's this.
I need to talk to Gorone.

50
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,625
The design needs work.
Plus, I was out of bullets.

51
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,375
He made you
a gun that fires five times

52
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,250
without having to reload,
and that's still not enough.

53
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,416
The man is an
underappreciated genius!

This is nothing...

58
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,333
If I couldn't take this,
I'd be a joke...

won't work on me...

[RUI pants]

61
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,083
[SHICHIGEN panting] But I bet...
this is starting to take

62
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:05,916
its toll on you, now...
The scent of a man...

63

Pheromones drifting
in the air...

64
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,208
[RUI panting] I'm not even
bothered. I feel fine.

65
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,458
[RUI]
I've told you all this before...

66
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:21,208
I've no interest
whatsoever... in filthy men...

[SHICHIGEN]
Heh. You're fooling yourself.

68
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:25,791
I don't believe a thing you say.

69
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:28,041
The heat of your skin
tells a different story.

70
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,416
[RUI panting] That's just...
because it's so hot...

71
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:40,708
[RUI] I'm confused.
Isn't this a waste of time?

72
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,541
What's the point
of this training?

73
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,375
[SHICHIGEN] It's because the
more we work on restraining

74
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,791
our natural urges, the stronger
our abilities will become.

75
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,166
That's what Gorone told us
anyway, and I believe him.

76
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,791
[RUI]
But is it true?

77
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,500
Even if it is
what Gorone said,

78
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,708
he's pretty useless lately.

Everyone is different,

You lack a little something
called "elegance."

the illusion I truly

00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,750
She's wary. Good.

159
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,958
[NARRATOR]
How should one rid oneself

160
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,625
of all their earthly desires?

161
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,125
Perhaps it is best
done now, right here,

162
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,958
while there's still time.

163
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,875
Did you have the two orders
of dumplings, sir?

164
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,458
[PATRON A]
Over here!

165
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,083
You've already finished off
your other plates?

166
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,916
[PATRON B]
Miss? More rice!

167
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,083
[HACHISU]
Yes, sir!

168
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,625
[UTSUTSU]
Uh! Welcome, please have a seat.

169
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,291
[HACHISU] Hibiki,
could you help us out front?

170
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,375
[HIBIKI]
Uh. Sure, got it.

171
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,625
[UTSUTSU]
Who had the gyoza?

172
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,500
[HIBIKI]
Coming! Welcome!

173
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,833
[PATRON C]
You are rather comely, miss.

174
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,583
Do you have a suitor?

175
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,666
[HIBIKI]
Uh. No, I don't.

176
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,916
[UTSUTSU]
Well, you kind of do.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,125
[HIBIKI]
Utsutsu.

178
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,916
[RUI sighs]
Men are always so disgusting.

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,958
[HACHISU] Sorry, but can
you take over for Utsutsu?

180
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,333
[RUI]
I suppose.

181
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,166
[SERVANT A]
The shogun is here!

182
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,666
[NAMENBA]
I've made it this far.

183
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,958
Everything is going
according to plan.

184
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,791
[UTSUTSU]
How are the sales looking?

185
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,041
[sighs] I'm doing the
calculations right now,

186
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,708
so please don't interrupt me.

187
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,666
I sold off a lot of old
clothes today, which was good.

188
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,500
I actually made
a decent amount of money!

189
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,916
I'm not surprised!

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,291
I think the whole
merchant aesthetic

191
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,250
really suits you well, Rui.
You and Hachisu both!

192
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,708
You and I see things
a bit differently, I guess.

193
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,083
[RUI]
I don't know.

194
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:44,000
Sometimes, I think...
maybe they won't come back.

195
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,208
What'll happen then?

196
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,625
I mean, that would
be perfectly fine by me.

197
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,375
Then our lives could be
about running our little store.

198
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,000
Doesn't that sound nice?

199
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,166
[UTSUTSU]
Maybe.

200
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,083
[HACHISU]
Impossible. Nothing's that easy.

201
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,333
Am I the only one who
remembers the last few years?

202
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,500
I haven't forgotten
about those who mean

203
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,083
to kill us, but still, I--

204
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,416
And what about all
of the work Namenba did?

205
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,250
She spent years setting
this place up the way it is.

206
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,375
She didn't do it because
she wanted money.

207
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,416
It was all to prepare for when
the Joujinshuu came back

208
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,041
to finish us off!

209
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,250
After Hachirou disappeared...

210
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,833
[HACHISU] ...the Kouga boys
cried their eyes out

211
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,458
for days on end.

212
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,250
[HACHISU] It was like we'd been
betrayed by him, and it hurt.

213
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,333
 Protecting him
had been our purpose.

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,208
Even so...
The boys never gave up hope.

215
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:48,083
They still believe that
he'll return one day.

216
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,791
Without a sliver of a doubt.

217
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,250
[HACHISU] Because they believe
in him, they remained here,

218
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,708
continuing to hone
their special abilities.

219
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,708
[HACHISU] Though I'm not
certain they're all putting in

220
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,833
the same amount of effort.

221
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:25,708
[SHICHIGEN chuckles]

222
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,875
[HACHISU] If the
Joujinshuu were to come...

223
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,333
If the Joujinshuu
were to come for us,

224
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,500
Hachirou would return.

225
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,916
[RUI gasps]

226
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,375
That's it, right?

227
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:45,208
That's what the boys
believe will happen.

228
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,708
Yeah.

229
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,458
So things would be better
if the Joujinshuu came back?

230
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,958
It's not about better or worse.

231
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,000
But still, you have
to think that they'll--

232
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,666
[HIBIKI]
Even so.

233
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,708
Even if the Joujinshuu return,
there's no telling

234
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,291
whether Hachirou will
still come back to us.

235
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,125
[HIBIKI] It almost seems
like a lifetime ago.

236
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,375
I can't explain it.

237
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:55,208
But somehow, ever
since then, I can feel Hachirou.

238
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,500
[HIBIKI]
And so...

239
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:00,291
...I'm never lonely.

240
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:43,625
[JOUJIN] Your vaunted ninja
technique, won't work on me.

241
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,208
[HACHIROU growls]

242
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,333
[JOUJIN] Your vaunted ninja
technique, won't work on me.

243
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,000
I assume you are the
ninja Kouga Hachirou- <i>sama</i> .

244
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,708
Will you not look me in the eye?

245
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm afraid I'll have to pass,
thank you very much.

246
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,666
I can tell you've
only just learned how

247
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,458
to fight with a blindfold.

248
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:25,416
So if I remain still, you won't
have any sound to rely on.

249
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,375
Which is precisely why
I chose to face you here.

250
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:54,750
[gasps]

251
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,375
[HACHIROU]
It isn't a very bright idea

252
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,875
to make so much noise.

253
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,875
Have you forgotten
how this fight began?

254
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,750
You proved it was
possible to pass overhead

255
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,208
when you leapt over me.

256
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,333
Why have you come?

257
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:11,041
The battle is far from
over yet, Kouga- <i>sama</i> .

258
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,250
[HACHIROU gasps]

259
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,000
Greetings, my name is Hadaebou.

260
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,541
Your technique is stupid.

261
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,291
You honor me.

262
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,083
It was uncouth, I know.

263
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,500
Please forgive my rude behavior,
but it was necessary to put

264
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,166
your skills to the test.

265
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,833
I come to you with
an urgent request

266
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,375
from the Suruga Dainagon.

267
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,125
Lord Tadanaga has recently
been exiled to Kouzuke.

268
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,041
So he sent me here to let
you know that he wanted

269
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,000
to have a word with you.

270
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,750
He what?

271
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,875
[HADAEBOU] He says that
something strange is coming,

272
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,833
and we must prepare ourselves.

273
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,916
Something strange, you say?

274
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,583
Or perhaps,
it has already come

275
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,583
and time is precious.

276
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,000
[HADAEBOU]
According to reports,

277
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,791
a bizarre new castle
has appeared.

278
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:57,250
A dark, mysterious place
known as Murakumo.

279
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,541
[NARRATOR] Hadaebou. A shady
priest who infests Edo Castle.

280
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,875
He travels across the land,
acting as an agent of Tenkai.

281
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:54,583
Is he an ally to the
Kouga and Iga, or an enemy?

282
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,000
Only time will tell.
