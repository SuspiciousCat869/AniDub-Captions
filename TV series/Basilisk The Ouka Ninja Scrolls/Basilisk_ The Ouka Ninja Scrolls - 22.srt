00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:48,291
First, my white-spotted hawk.

167
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:54,125
Second, my pale songbird.
And third, my dear Ranmaru.

168
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:57,666
You honor your humble
servant too much, my lord.

169
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,000
[NOBUNAGA] My friend,
I have not a sliver of doubt

170
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,708
that if you were a bird,
you would be a peacock.

171
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,166
My very own "kujaku."

172
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,375
I know not when I shall return.

173
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,750
But while you yet live,
I'll ask this--

174
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,916
Will you keep your
brilliant wings spread?

175
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,791
Fanning the embers
of my conquest,

176
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:23,000
that the fire of my dream
will never die out.

177
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,708
Lord!

178
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,416
[yells]

179
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,250
[screams]

180
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,083
Well done, young warrior.

181
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,083
You fought valiantly.

182
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,166
Your voice is that of the demon.

183
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,041
[JOUJIN]
Hmm?

184
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,708
[KUJAKU]
If your words rang true,

185
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,041
then there's more
to my lord's fate.

186
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,708
But if you lied.

187
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,166
I'll become a devil
worse than you,

188
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,250
and plunge your rotten soul
to the depths of Hell.

189
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:27,000
I pledge myself,
to continue in the service

190
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,666
of the Demon King.

191
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,583
You'll become a devil.

192
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,833
--Why wait?
--[KUJAKU gasps]

193
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,791
[JOUJIN]
Your name, what is it?

194
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,083
Kujaku. That's my name.

195
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:52,750
Yes. I am Kujaku.

196
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,041
[KUJAKU]
I no longer need that name!

197
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,375
My true name is Ranmaru,

198
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,708
and the master I have
always served faithfully,

199
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,041
mighty Lord Nobunaga.

200
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,875
The one who called me by
that name will at last return!

201
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,708
So that's why.

202
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:15,916
[NOBUNAGA] Fifty years
of a mortal man's life.

203
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,250
Pass by in the breadth
of a vivid dream.

204
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:26,375
When held against the
scope of Heaven's history.

205
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,708
For once a man is born.

206
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,541
As with all things
in this world.

207
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:39,416
Mustn't he one day die?

208
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,833
[KUJAKU] I would expect nothing
less from you, Joujin- <i>sama</i> .

209
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,000
[KUJAKU] To think that
the blood of Kouga Hachirou

210
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,958
and Iga Hibiki was never needed.

211
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,708
That your blood alone
was more than enough!

212
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,791
[KUJAKU] Devouring a demon
shall open the path to conquest.

213
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,291
[KUJAKU] My master will
devour the blood of a demon,

214
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:15,041
and with it, return to life!

215
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,750
But why?

216
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,916
[KUJAKU laughs]

[gasps]

219
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,375
So you've come...

220
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,791
At last, we meet in
person, Lord Nobunaga.

221
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,666
Welcome, Demon King.

222
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,375
With you made flesh,

223
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,250
you can finally bring
about a Hell on Earth.

224
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,625
Only then can true salvation
be brought unto the masses.

225
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,791
Let us bring my--

226
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,750
No, I mean our
desire to fruition

227
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,416
after such interminable waiting!

--[skull shatters]

232

[JOUJIN] With true salvation
at hand after so long,

233
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:51,250
there is no further need for me.

234
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,875
[KUJAKU]
My master, welcome back.

235
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,041
It's me, my lord.

236
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,666
Your ever-faithful
servant, Ranmaru.

[gasps]

238

A repulsive sight.

[KUJAKU gasps]

00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,333
I'm ending this, right now!

243
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,291
What have you done?

244
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,083
[NAMENBA]
Hmph. Is that Nobunaga?

245
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,250
Well, isn't he a looker!

246
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,833
[BOTH grunt]

247
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,375
[NAMENBA] Maybe I'll see if he
wants to have some fun in Hell!

Disgusting monster.

258
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,583
You would try to trick
the Demon King?

259
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:45,083
And to pick such
a hideous form to do so.

260
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,750
Claiming to be
the beauteous Ranmaru?

261

You fool.

262

A poor effort.

You are nothing at all
like my Ranmaru,

who was truly exquisite.

265
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,500
Like the peacock,
for which I named him.

[NARRATOR]
Let us stop this,

267
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,958
there's nothing else
to be done, Kujaku.

268

And as for your backward-flowing

269

corridor of time.

270
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,208
I must seal it within my
Adamantite Tower,

271
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,916
while I still can.
