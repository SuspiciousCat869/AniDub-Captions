[BOTH gasp]

2
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,500
[HADAEBOU]
You don't believe me, my lord?

3
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,041
It's true.

4
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,375
Your brother shared with me,
a man of low station,

5
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,666
his happy memories
from childhood,

6
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,833
of spending time with you,
his beloved younger brother.

7
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,625
[JOUJIN]
Enough, deceiver.

8
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
You should know
better than to lie

9
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,666
in the presence of nobility.

10
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,291
It's just preposterous.

11
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,208
The shogun would
never be so sentimental.

12
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,750
What's this?

13
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:55,375
[JOUJIN] It's entirely likely
that this snake in the grass

14
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,833
is simply repeating
the stories his Master

15
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,500
told him to memorize.

16
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:04,708
[TADANAGA] But the things
he said, they were all true.

17
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,500
And Tenkai wasn't
there to witness.

18
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:09,791
It was only my brother and I.

19
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,833
When were you and
your brother truly left alone

20
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,750
during your childhood?

21
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,458
Were there no
courtesans, or servants?

22
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:23,541
Men of your station are rarely,
if ever, by themselves.

23
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,333
So you've come, then.

24
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,583
Hachirou.

25
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,083
Shichigen!

26
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,250
Joujin.

27
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,500
I request you give me
some more time.

28
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,250
I'd like an opportunity to think
about the matter in full.

29
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,791
[JOUJIN] Hmph. Even now,
you would reconsider,

30
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,125
after all that's transpired?

31
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,375
Yes.

32
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,333
Let's go, Hadaebou.

33
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,833
Lord.

34
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,291
[MAGOROKU]
It won't be that simple.

35
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,458
I shall take your life
before you leave here.

36
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,541
What?

37
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,958
What did you just say?

38
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,125
Is this some joke in poor taste?

39
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,416
Didn't you give me your
word you'd take me to Edo

40
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,541
as the master of this castle?

41
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,208
[JOUJIN]
I did promise to take you.

42
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,833
But you, your lordship,
were never the master

43
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,125
we had planned for Murakumo.

44
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:11,041
But if you never wanted me,
then who was this for?  

45
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,583
[HADAEBOU sighs]
I knew it.

46
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,875
His name is known to us all.

47
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,333
Oda Kazusanosuke
Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> ,

48
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,250
the Demon King.

49
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,708
[TADANAGA]
It can't be!

[NEIRICHIOU]
Kouga Hachirou.

51
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,458
I heard that Yasha Itaru
made you an offer

52
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,625
and you refused her.

53
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,291
Now. There's no need
to be so stubborn, boy.

54
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:40,166
It's clear who the victor
would be in this battle.

55
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,916
Come to Murakumo and
hear Joujin out instead,

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,333
I'd be glad to take you there.

57
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,708
I don't need you to take me!

58
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,125
I'll come save Hibiki myself!

59
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,583
[JOUJIN]
Hmph.

60
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,583
Wait, what're you planning?

61
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,666
This country needs
leadership, and you, my lord,

62
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,166
will act as our vessel
for this purpose.

63

--[gasps]
--You must be joking.

64
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,291
The matter is far too
serious for me to jest about.

65
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,333
As I said, we need
you to serve as our vessel.

66
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,666
To revive Nobunaga,
we must provide him

67
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,500
with an adequate body.

68

[TADANAGA yells]

71
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,083
We cannot use
the body of a normal man,

72
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,166
it would not suffice for the
task of his reincarnation.

73
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,333
We require
the bloodline of a ruler,

74
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,416
the only ones able to
hold the magnitude of

75
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,583
the Demon King's spirit.

76
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,208
You carry the blood
of a great ruler in your veins.

77
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,625
You are of slightly
poorer quality, but alas,

78
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,375
that can't be helped.

79
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,666
We tried to find other
suitable host bodies,

80
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,208
but none of the other candidates
were so easily deceived.

You bastard.

Then, I don't need
to ask for your permission.

84
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,375
I shall leave of
my own free will!

85
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,958
I'll have my revenge.

86
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,958
I shall return home
to my brother,

and together we'll come
back and finish you!

A wise choice, Tadanaga- <i>sama</i> .

[NEIRICHIOU] Now,
your Spearing Eye technique

[growls]

101
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:51,166
[laughs] I'll keep my
eyes closed, and you assume

102
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,041
that means I won't be
able to see anything?

But that is not the case.

[NEIRICHIOU] This Lightning

I have developed

I need not use my

[TADANAGA gasps]
What is that?

118
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,625
[JOUJIN]
It is a fan, your lordship.

119
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,791
For you to use
to commit seppuku.

120
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:41,291
[JOUJIN] Simply beheading
you is unacceptable,

especially for a man
of your position.

122
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,000
Nor would it be fitting
to cause bodily harm to

Thus, the least we can
do is offer you one last chance

125
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:57,208
to reclaim your lost honor
by using this fan,

126

the forest itself is moved,

Who can make the trees
unfix their buried roots?

Indeed, it's impossible.

[gasps]

161
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,375
[HADAEBOU grunts]

162
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,833
What would you have me do?

163
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,291
Ignore him.

164
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,291
[HADAEBOU]
Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

165
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:37,500
Lord...

166
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,416
[NEIRICHIOU screams]

167
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,416
Vile pests!

168
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,166
[NEIRICHIOU groans]

169
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,375
Shichigen. You did it!

170
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,666
[SHICHIGEN grunts]
Not quite.

171
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,791
[NEIRICHIOU giggles] It seems
I underestimated you,

172
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,708
but that was very impressive.

173
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,000
You had best
prepare yourselves though.

174
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,833
That little stunt of yours has
awoken the wrath of the Raijin.

175
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,375
[SHICHIGEN gasps]

176
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,708
[SHICHIGEN gasps]

177
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:52,000
[NEIRICHIOU]
Hmm. Now, what do we have here?

178
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,000
It's Gorone!

179
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,500
Idiot!

180
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,916
[grunts]

181
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,708
[growls, yells]

182
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,416
[GORONE]
Well?

183
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,041
I've fought with the tenacity
of ten men, haven't I?

184
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,375
[NAMENBA]
Why?

185
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,333
Why do something so reckless?

186
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,375
I thought you hated bravado.

187
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:07,916
[GORONE] Hachirou, always
be true to your feelings.

188
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,708
[GORONE]
All men die, one day.

189
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,083
That's the order of nature.

190
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,208
The budding flowers
can bloom only after

191
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,500
the old ones have fallen.

192
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,125
[GORONE]
As it was meant to be.

193
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,833
[NEIRICHIOU screams]

194
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,958
[RAIJIN roars]

195
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:47,333
[NEIRICHIOU screams]

196
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,500
[NEIRICHIOU]
I've failed.

197
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,208
Everyone, please listen.

198
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:42,208
What I want is to save Hibiki.

199
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,833
[HACHIROU]
It might be a trap.

200
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,750
No, I'm sure it will be.

201
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,791
But I shall enter that castle
one way or another!

202
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,291
[SAIZOU] So you've finally
admitted the truth.

203
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,791
Though, if we're to continue,

204
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,875
there's one more thing
you have to say.

205
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,958
Right, we've all
been waiting to hear it

206
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,625
directly from our leader.

207
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,208
What do you command?

208
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,000
[HACHIROU]
Their destiny is to fall,

209
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,333
but the sakura blossoms
will always return.

210
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,083
So, my friends. Join me.

211
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,583
The time has come
for us to fall!

212
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,916
[HACHIROU] Joujin!
Open the doors to Murakumo!

213
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,583
[HACHIROU] Kouga Hachirou,
has at last arrived!

214
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:46,541
[NARRATOR] As long as Saizou's
eyeball hovers near the ceiling,

215
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:51,375
you can't hope to best me,
no matter how hard you try.

216
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,708
Well, everyone?

217
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,375
Let's have some fun.

218
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,041
What do you say?
