1
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:31,541
[HACHIROU] Joujin!
Open the doors to Murakumo!

2
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,166
[HACHIROU] Kouga Hachirou,
has at last arrived!

3
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,833
Kujaku Tsuibamu.

4
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,583
Gorone has fallen.

5
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,333
I want Namenba to
conduct funerary rites.

6
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,791
[SAIZOU]
We'll find a way in, too.

7
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,750
I'll set up, see if
I can get a clear line of fire.

8
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,166
Saizou.

9
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,000
We need you to keep
an eye out from above.

10
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,500
[RUI]
We'll go right, you go left.

11
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,791
[SHIKIBU]
Got it.

12
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,750
Hachirou and Hibiki,
we're coming to save you.

13
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,375
Then, I suppose it's
time for me to head to the back.

14
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:15,708
[SAIZOU groans]

15
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,333
[SAIZOU]
I need all of you.

16
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,291
[SAIZOU]
Too narrow.

17
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,708
That slippery
monk could probably

18
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,541
slither in, but I can't.

19
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,166
[ITARU giggles]

20
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,833
[ITARU]
Your guts will burst out,

21
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:56,166
and fall to the ground, and
your soul sent straight to Hell.

22
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:22,916
[groans]

23
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:26,875
[HADAEBOU groans]

24
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
[gasps]

25
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,875
Yasha Itaru.

26
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,541
[HADAEBOU] Wait, has he fallen
victim to Destiny's Passage?

27
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,208
[GORONE] It's time you tell
us everything you know.

28
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,000
What are the
Joujinshuu's techniques?

29
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,875
[HADAEBOU] Yasha Itaru
has the power of what

30
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,458
one might call
"extreme suggestion."

31
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,125
Her technique
presents the victim a vision,

32
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,666
making their entire life
seem a burden to others.

33
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,416
An existence plagued
by evil and misfortune,

34
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,416
and ending violently.

35
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,416
[ITARU] One's whole world is not
but the tumbling of the dice.

36
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,166
They roll and scatter.

37
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,333
One stirs in slumber.

38
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:29,083
We dub this fitful dream
life, but death wakes us all.

39
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,958
Now listen, to learn
to play Oicho-Kabu.

40
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,916
You have to add up the two
cards, and whoever has

41
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,208
the highest first digit
is the winner.

42
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:39,750
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Okay, how many points is that?

43
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,416
[SAIZOU]
Ah... [laughs]

44
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,333
I guess it's still
too early to try out.

45
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,500
[SAIZOU]
Six.

46
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,333
Five.

47
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,541
Eight.

48
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,291
[SAIZOU]
Two sevens.

49
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,375
[SAIZOU]
Well, Dad?

50
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,541
How long are
we going to do this?

51
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,208
Tell me.

52
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,083
[MAN A]
Never seen you before.

53
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,833
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Yeah. I'm not from here.

54
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,041
[MAN B]
Got any money?

55
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,333
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Sure.

56
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,625
Just a little, to pay for
traveling expenses.

57
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,208
[MAN B]
Well, ante up then.

58
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,791
[MAN B] All right,
let's go another round!

59
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,375
[MAN B]
I'm staying in.

60
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,458
[MAN A]
Damn it!

61
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,833
[MAN C]
I'm in.

62
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,166
[MAN D]
It's your turn, stranger.

63
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,750
Ah-- Sorry about
that. I need a moment.

64
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,916
Just make a decision.

65
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,833
We don't have all
damn night, you know.

66
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,458
[SAIZOU]
Six.

67
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,750
Five.

68
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,125
Two sevens.

69
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,708
Here we go,
man's got to take a risk!

70
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,416
[MAN C]
Six!

71
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,166
[MAN B]
Five.

72
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,416
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Two sevens.

73
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,708
[MAN C groans]
I thought I had that!

74
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,250
[SAIZOU] You're letting
him play you for fools.

75
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,833
Poor saps.

76
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,875
[SAIZOU] Of course,
the same could be said of me.

77
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,666
[SAIZOU]
But...

78
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,291
I suspect he was
being played, too.

79
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,833
[HACHIROU]
Tadanaga- <i>sama</i> ?

80
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,250
You've come to us
at last, Kouga Hachirou.

81
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,125
Joujin. Where is she?

82
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,416
I'm taking Hibiki back home.

83
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,208
We won't work with you.

84
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,500
We'll never give you control
of our Ouka technique.

85
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,041
Enough.

86
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,416
As impressive as your skill
may be, it was never our goal.

87
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,416
Tell me--and be honest--

88
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,750
do you really see the world
that we live in today as

89
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,541
one filled with peace?

90
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,625
[JOUJIN]
Hmph. Nothing to say?

91
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,375
Of course not.

92
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:49,416
Why did your mother and
father have to die so horribly

93
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,875
if our nation was truly
a land at peace?

94
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,625
[HACHIROU]
The Tokugawas are to blame!

95
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,500
[JOUJIN]
The Tokugawas!

96
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,000
Precisely as
I'd hoped you'd say.

97
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,000
[JOUJIN] The temporary
peace their dynasty boasts

98
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,958
is an illusion.

99
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,166
You of all people should know,
the age of civil wars

100
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,208
never truly came to an end!

101
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,541
They aren't over, there
hasn't been enough killing!

102
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,416
[HACHIROU]
What are you saying?

103
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,375
[JOUJIN] Should that
glorious Hell on Earth

104
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:20,958
really be allowed to
conclude so neatly?

105
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,458
Don't you understand?

106
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,500
Joujin shows this
world compassion.

107
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,625
An altruistic nature equaled
only by the Buddha.

108
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,208
That's nonsense!

109
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,958
The Buddha wishes only
to save the world from itself!

110
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,208
You are evil passions
in the flesh!

111
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,625
The total opposite!

112
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,500
[JOUJIN]
But that's where you're wrong.

113
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:42,250
I intend to bring true
salvation unto the masses.

114
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,041
And in order to do that,
the people of this world

115
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:49,125
must experience the hell that
comes with it along the way.

116
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:52,083
The sinners, the innocent,

117
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,833
the flames will
consume them all.

118
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:57,500
And when there
are none who long for war--

119
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:00,166
even the slightest--
left standing,

120
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,291
only then, will we know
real salvation.

121
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,541
True peace.

122
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:07,291
That is my one desire.

123
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,041
[HACHIROU]
You're mad.

124
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,958
[JOUJIN] The Tokugawas created
a temporary peace and engaged in

125
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,541
a capricious game to
determine their next heir

126
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,625
at the cost of your clan.

127
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:20,500
Do you think that
should be allowed?

128
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,583
Thus, my desire
to end such behavior.

129
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,625
[HACHIROU grunts]

130
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,708
By installing
a great demon king,

131
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,125
who can wield the sword that
will summon forth devils!

132
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,750
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Five. Tough luck.

133
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,041
[MAN C]
You rat bastard!

134
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,083
You're cheating, I know it!

135
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,500
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Hey, now.

136
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,625
just because you keep losing,
there's no need for you

137
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,500
to take it out on me.

138
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,916
[MAN A]
can't really blame him for that.

139
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,083
After all the money we've lost
to an outsider tonight,

140
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,625
I'm sure you can
understand how he feels.

141
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,833
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Fair.

142
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,666
Now can we all get back
to having some fun?

143
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,750
Whaddaya say?

144
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,791
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Well. I'll have fun at least.

145
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,041
Cause as long as Saizou's eye is
up there, watching out for me.

146
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,833
You idiots don't
stand a chance in hell.

147
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,125
[SAIZOU huffs]

148
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,500
[SAIZOU]
Dad, it's so cold.

149
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,625
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Oh, my! I win again?

150
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,166
Can't believe my luck!

151
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,083
[SAIZOU'S DAD] Saizou,
this will be the final round

152
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,875
for the night.
Don't screw it up.

153
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,375
I'll get you something warm
to eat when we're done.

154
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,791
[MAN C]
Heh.

155
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,458
[
Give me another card.

156
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,625
[MAN C]
I won't lose this time!

157
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,291
[MAN B]
I'm in.

158
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,125
All right, I guess I'll
get in on this hand, too.

159
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,250
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
A three and a six, huh?

160
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,166
Good hand.

161
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,541
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Hmm?

162
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,833
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Where the hell is he?

163
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,583
[MAN D]
So? Are you in, or are you out?

164
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,041
Add up your cards, and the
first digit closest to nine

165
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,250
is the winner.

166
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:30,000
But ya know, matching
cards can beat that.

167
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,333
[MAN C]
Hmph.

168
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:37,541
[MAN C] I'm not letting some
outsider take me for everything!

169
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,083
[gasps]

170
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,666
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
Look at this beauty of a hand.

171
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,875
The gods of fortune are
smiling on me tonight.

172
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,750
I can win this on my own!

173
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,833
[MAN C] It's the last round,

174
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:51,208
so I'll bet everything
I've got left!

175
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,750
There's my stake.

176
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,166
[MAN B]
Too rich for my blood.

177
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,833
[MAN A]
I'm out.

178
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,500
[MAN D]
Okay, then, winner takes all.

179
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,916
[SAIZOU'S DAD] Show 'em.
I've got a three and a six!

180
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,041
[MAN C]
Doubles!

181
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,750
[MAN B] And he got matching
tens, the strongest hand!

182
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,041
You win double!

183
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,458
[MAN A]
Damn.

184
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,291
[MAN D] So, he took
everything you had, huh?

185
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,625
[MAN C laughs]

186
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,750
[blow lands]

187
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,708
[SAIZOU'S DAD]
What were you doing?!

188
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:25,958
I saw the moon...

189
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,000
What's that?

190
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,791
The moon made you fail me?

191
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,375
You worthless little bastard.

192
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,666
I didn't mean to...

193
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,125
I'm sorry, Papa...

194
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,000
[SAIZOU]
I did it deliberately.

195
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,833
[SAIZOU] To finish off your
sorry little enterprise.

196
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:49,583
It was all supposed to come to
an end there, under that moon.

197
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:04,250
[SAIZOU]
It was supposed to end there.

198
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,916
But instead the
Kouga took me in.

199
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,708
[ITARU chuckles]

200
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,625
[HADAEBOU] After gazing into
the abyss of your own despair.

201
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,208
Yasha's words take
root inside your soul,

202
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,333
and bring you to your doom.

203
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,250
[SAIZOU]
My so-called leader.

204
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,875
You didn't need us
until the very end, huh?

205
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,791
Well, I never needed
to be lead, anyway.

206
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,708
[HACHIROU]
Their destiny is to fall,

207
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,333
but the sakura blossoms
will always return.

208
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,208
So, my friends.

209
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,791
Join me.

210
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,166
The time has come
for us to fall!

211
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,458
[ITARU]
It's time to go to Hell!

212
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:55,375
[SAIZOU laughs]
That's been the plan all along.

213
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,916
[SAIZOU]
What have we here?

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,333
A perfect way to scatter
my guts on the ground.

215
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:27,583
[SAIZOU]
Heh.

216
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:45,916
[SAIZOU]
It's funny.

217
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,541
I've always been a contrarian,
and the last thing that I want

218
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:53,916
is to do something just because
somebody ordered me to!

219
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,083
[UTSUTSU]
Saizou!

220
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,250
[UTSUTSU]
What are you doing? Stop!

221
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,916
[SAIZOU]
I already see too much.

222
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,208
That's the downside to my power.

223
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,500
As a rule, I don't look at
things unnecessarily.

224
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,541
[UTSUTSU] It seems I can never
see what I want to see.

225
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,333
So I have dreams.
But they're always horrifying.

226
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,500
[SAIZOU] This is the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen

227
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,416
in this unforgiving world.

228
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,666
[gasps]

229
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,791
[UTSUTSU]
Saizou!

230
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,541
We've stopped.

231
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,000
It matters not if you
stop Murakumo in its path.

232
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,416
Tell me, did you think this
was nothing more than

233
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,791
a palankeen to carry us to Edo?

234
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,875
There's more to the
Murakumo than meets the eye.

235
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:43,750
If you thinks it's simply a
moving castle, you're mistaken.

236
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,750
It serves as a barrier,
which will at last enable

237
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,625
the secret ritual
to be conducted

238
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,125
to revive Lord Nobunaga.

239
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,541
That is not all.

240
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,625
For when he revives,
reborn as a child, no--

241
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,416
reborn into this world
as a savage beast,

242
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,041
the Murakumo is the womb which
shall awaken the memories

243
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:06,666
lying dormant within him,
as well as his thirst for glory!

244
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,125
[HACHIROU] That's quite
an impressive speech

245
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,833
you've made to
justify your actions.

246
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,833
You should share this
with a playwright.

247
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:16,750
Your dream would make
fascinating Noh theatre.

248
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,125
But I have
no intention of performing

249
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,958
as a character in your playlet.

250
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,250
But you must,
for no one else can play

251
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,083
your part quite so capably.

252
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,416
We must have you.

253
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,791
And Hibiki!

254
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,208
[HACHIROU]
And Hibiki?

255
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,500
Indeed.

256
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:37,250
She's a necessary
aspect of the revival ritual

257
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,750
we've been planning.

258
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:42,333
Why is Hibiki needed,
or I, for that matter?

259
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,791
You're pieces
to the great puzzle.

260
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,125
We must have a young man
and young woman in love

261
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,916
with each other to continue.

262
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,708
Of course, not just
any man or woman will suffice.

263
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,125
For they must be
of a worthy bloodline.

264
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:59,708
Masters of an art, with perfect
bodies and powerful souls!

265
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:02,125
[HACHIROU]
To what end?

266
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,125
For this plan
to work the two of you

267
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,083
must lie together.

268
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:07,625
[HACHIROU gasps]

269
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,875
[JOUJIN] The fluids generated
by your coupling will flow,

270
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:14,416
and pour down into the skull,
becoming the blood

271
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,666
that will connect it to a body.

272
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:22,041
For only then, will the great
demon king be reborn unto us.

273
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,375
[HACHIROU] And you think we'll
agree to be a part of this?

274
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,541
[JOUJIN]
Will you not?

275
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,208
[HACHIROU]
You know the answer!

276
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,375
[JOUJIN] Should you refuse, then
I'm afraid that you and Hibiki

277
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,000
will be forced to
slay one another instead.

278
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,916
If you and
she kill each other,

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,833
the rite can still be completed.

280
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,375
[HACHIROU]
What?

281
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,250
[JOUJIN] You may not
know this, but the fluids

282
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,958
born of love-making can contain
the same potent magical energy

283
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,916
as the blood that is spilled
during deadly combat!

284
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,291
If you'll not willingly
generate those fluids,

285
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,541
then I shall require
your blood instead!

286
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,666
You sound like a madman.

287
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,041
We will never lie
together for you.

288
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,958
Let alone kill each other!

289
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,750
[JOUJIN] I fear you will find
that you have no choice

290
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,791
in the matter, boy.

291
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,208
[gasps]

292
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,416
Hibiki!

293
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,166
[HACHIROU gasps]

294
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,625
What's wrong? Hibiki?

295
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm not her.

296
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:30,375
I am Oboro of Iga,
or have you forgotten?

297
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,791
Kouga Gennosuke- <i>sama</i> .

298
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,125
[HACHIROU gasps]

299
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,666
You are an inhuman monster.

300
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,958
I wish I'd never made
the mistake of falling in love

301
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,833
with you all those years ago.

302
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,500
Because if I hadn't,

303
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,500
then those in my clan
wouldn't have been slaughtered

304
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,041
like animals.

305
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,625
[HIBIKI] I regret everything,
but it's too late.

306
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,166
To atone, I must offer my
head before their graves!

307
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:58,041
No, that's no good,
it isn't enough!

308
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,083
First, Gennosuke,
I must offer them your head!

309
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,375
[NARRATOR]
No. You're the monster.

310
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,500
[NARRATOR]
I shall permanently alter

311
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,750
that disgusting fate of yours.

312
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,833
Just wait and see.
