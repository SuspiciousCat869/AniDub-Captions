1
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,458
[JOUJIN]
Quite the predicament

2
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,416
[BUNNOSHIN gasps]
Who's there?!

3
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,583
[JOUJIN] Perhaps, your treason
will be brought out

4
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,958
into the light of day.

5
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,916
Damn you! Where--

6
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,166
[TADANAGA gasps]

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,958
[JOUJIN] So there are
no further interruptions.

8
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,750
Greetings, my lord.

9
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,833
[TADANAGA]
Who are you?

10
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:51,291
[JOUJIN] Could it truly be the
case, you've forgotten me?

11
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,666
[TADANAGA whimpers]

12
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:57,208
Your eyes tell me
you remember who I am.

13
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,166
That desperate look of fear.

14
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,708
You're-- You're Joujin.

15
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,416
Intruder! Men!

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,208
Come to my aid!

17
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,333
[grunts]

18
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:16,833
I won't be fooled twice
by a madman like you.

19
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,625
I know better now.

20
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:21,583
First, my lord, you should
sheathe your sword

21
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,583
so we may have
a civilized conversation.

22
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,041
Now, please be seated.

23
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,708
You and I have much
to discuss before I leave.

24
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,708
[TADANAGA whimpers]

25
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:40,541
I let myself get carried away.

26
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,208
If only for a moment.

27
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,500
I was deceived by
your honeyed words.

28
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,625
I imagined being the ruler.

29
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:50,666
How different life could be
if I took my brother's place.

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,125
[JOUJIN]
I fear you misunderstood

31
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,333
what we talked about, my lord.

32
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,750
I never meant to insinuate
anything so simple

33
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,916
as becoming the ruler of Japan.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,375
What?

35
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,166
You think too small.

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,458
I told you to embrace the
destiny I had foreseen in you.

37
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,375
As an actual god
who rules over all.

38
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,083
[TADANAGA whimpers]
The forest...

39
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,208
The forest moved,
while I was there!

40
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,958
Misled, by your prophecy.

41
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,541
You told me my wish
would come true,

42
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,333
unless the forest began to move.

43
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,958
Well, that's precisely
what I saw!

44
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,375
Those were mere monkeys
and nothing more, my lord.

45
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,208
Not messengers from
gods or ill omens.

46
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,541
Just groups of monkeys
seeking out a new habitat

47
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,125
in which to live.

48
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,375
You know this
by now, I'm certain.

49
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:36,041
You slew so many of them,

50
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,708
you had to have eventually
realized as much.

51
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,625
[JOUJIN] The moving forest was,
quite simply put,

52
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,916
a fantasy of your own making.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,041
Perhaps the result
of a fevered brain.

54
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,416
[TADANAGA gasps]

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,916
[JOUJIN] A sickness,
that's the best way to explain

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,791
your irrational behavior.

57
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,958
However, any future displays of
such weakness will only serve

58
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,916
to put you in further danger.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,333
A man who is destined
to be a god cannot be a slave

60
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,041
to his own emotions.

61
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:07,208
A god commands,
and all the laws of this world

62
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,541
would change to suit his whims.

63
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,750
That is what you
must learn, my lord,

64
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:15,500
if you are to ascend
into godhood!

65
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:19,708
I can't. How can any man
hope to become a god?

66
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,000
[JOUJIN] But in fact, it has
happened once before.

67
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,875
[gasps]

68
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:28,791
[JOUJIN] A man who became as
close to a god as one could be.

69
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,208
I speak, of course,
of Oda Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> .

70
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,125
[RUI snarls]

71
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,708
[yells]

72
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,958
[UTSUTSU]
When I see you in my dreams...

73
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,375
[UTSUTSU]
...it seems it is because...

74
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,958
[UTSUTSU] ...you are
telling me to die for love.

75
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,541
The hellscape
of skeletons and fire,

76
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,583
is no mere illusion.

77
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:39,125
Though seemingly impossible,
I assure you it's real.

78
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,458
This is the
true hell that awaits us.

79
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,583
[UTSUTSU grunts]

80
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,875
[UTSUTSU]
There are too many.

81
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,333
[gasps]

82
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,041
Rui ran in
this direction, didn't she?

83
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,375
I think so.

84
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,416
[NAMENBA growls]

85
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,166
--[NAMENBA] We should go.
--Yes.

86
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,375
[GORONE]
These are fascinating.

87
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,083
Do you think you can
learn anything from them?

88
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,208
Well, it'll take me a bit
of time to understand them.

89
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,916
This structure is like
nothing that I've ever seen.

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,708
[NAMENBA] Those crazy girls are
going to give me grey hairs.

91
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,291
They almost got
themselves into real trouble

92
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,583
on their little mission.

93
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:20,125
[GORONE] Then it seems you
came back at the perfect time.

94
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:31,958
You know...

95
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,250
...I was afraid we'd
never get the chance

96
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,875
to bathe together again.

97
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,000
Me, too. That was close.

98
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,458
Those men...

99
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,833
They referred to themselves
as the Rain, didn't they?

100
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,250
But who are they really?

101
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,458
The Rain?

102
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,208
The group of brigands
that attacked us

103
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,000
as we were scouting
out Murakumo.

104
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,750
Well, one thing's for certain.

105
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,291
If you and Namenba
hadn't saved us,

106
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,000
things would have ended poorly.

107
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:55,833
Then I guess you owe us one.

108
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,666
Yes, and I promise
that I'll repay you.

109
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,541
[UTSUTSU sighs] It's starting
to get cold, let's go.

110
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,875
[RUI]
Hey.

111
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,083
[UTSUTSU]
Hmm?

112
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,250
[HACHISU]
All right. I'm headed back.

113
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,750
About your illusions.

114
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,875
[UTSUTSU gasps]

115
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,083
[RUI] I wanted you
to show me one of them.

116
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,125
[RUI]
Something so rare and beautiful,

117
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,583
that no one has ever seen it.

118
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,000
[UTSUTSU]
I'm sorry...

119
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:42,166
The only illusions I can
show anyone are of Hell.

120
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,208
The endless realm of fire

121
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,500
that will come after
the end of the world.

122
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,333
It's an awful technique.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
And then?

124
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,833
[NAMENBA]
Hmm.

125
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,833
[HADAEBOU]
Head straight back.

126
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,208
[GORONE]
You met with High Priest Tenkai?

127
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,625
[HADAEBOU] This is Namenba,
she is a ninja of the Iga clan.

128
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,041
During the Osaka
Summer Campaign,

129
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,625
after Osaka Castle
had been set alight,

130
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,833
she rushed inside and
rescued Senhime- <i>sama</i> .

131
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:41,125
Granddaughter of
His Divine Lordship, Ieyasu.

132
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,375
[TENKAI]
I welcome you, Namenba.

133
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,083
I assume that you're
aware of who I am?

134
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,375
[NAMENBA]
Yes.

135
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,083
To speak in the same
manner as your servant

136
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:55,958
hiding up in the rafters,
His Holiness, Nankoubou Tenkai.

137
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,666
Lord Ieyasu's
most trusted councilor.

138
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,416
You were heavily involved in
the Houkouji bell's inscription,

139
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,916
and the subsequent
interpretation of its meaning,

140
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,166
that led directly to
the Siege of Osaka.

141
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,291
So Tenkai asked for our help?

142
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:10,666
If crushing the Joujinshuu
is now beyond the scope

143
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,666
of his reach, will our
assistance be enough?

144
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,208
[NAMENBA]
He thinks so.

145
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,958
You're asking for
help defeating the Joujinshuu?

146
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,833
From the Iga?

147
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:22,708
Joujin wants to bring
an end to Tokugawa rule.

148
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,500
And if he does, that means an
end to the peaceful era

149
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,208
we've come to know and a
return to the chaotic civil wars

150
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,916
that once raged across Japan.

151
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,458
[TENKAI] After all that was
sacrificed during unification,

152
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,791
this cannot be.

153
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,750
However, as I'm sure
you are aware,

154
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,541
Joujin and his men will
not be easy to deal with.

155
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,583
Otherwise, I would
not request your help.

156
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,625
We're aware.

157
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,666
[TENKAI] Will you
put aside our differences?

158
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,125
To fight, side by side, for the
sake of the entire country?

159
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,333
The Divine Lord Ieyasu
did not struggle in

160
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,666
the unification of Japan
merely for the sake

161
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,916
of his own ambition,
nor the establishment of

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,416
the Tokugawa shogunate.

163
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,625
It was for the sake of
all people, across our nation.

164
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,583
[NAMENBA] Hmph. Really,
like I'd believe the crap

165
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,916
that bastard was spewing.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,500
[GORONE]
High Priest Tenkai sounds like

167
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,916
quite an interesting old man.

168
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,208
I would even venture
to say, "crafty."

169
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,833
[RUI]
Thanks, come again!

170
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,791
[SHICHIGEN] I'll take a tea
and an order of dumplings.

171
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,958
Sure, coming up-- Ah!

172
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,708
Shichigen!

173
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,708
And you know I like 'em hot.

174
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:07,291
We tracked him
all the way to Kouzuke,

175
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,583
to the estate of
Tadanaga- <i>sama</i> .

176
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:12,125
What was Hachirou
doing there, of all places?

177
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,500
Tadanaga
had requested an audience.

178
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,958
He told Hachirou
to crush the Joujinshuu.

179
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:19,625
[GORONE]
And what was Hachirou's reply?

180
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,083
"Hell no," was the sentiment.

181
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:24,958
[SHIKIBU] And so, they tried
to ambush him with rifles.

182
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,291
[HIBIKI gasps]

183
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,958
[SHICHIGEN] Mere samurai
couldn't hope to best

184
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,041
our ninja techniques,
much less the power

185
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,833
of Hachirou's eye magic.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,708
We had to kill so many...

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,958
And Hachirou?

188
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,833
He said he wasn't coming back.

189
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,875
[SAIZOU]
He plans to finish this himself.

190
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,416
If that's the way
Hachirou feels,

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,416
then there's no point in us
worrying about him any longer.

192
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,291
Let's just be glad
we found out where he is,

193
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,958
and that he's in good health.

194
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,375
So. Just forget him, Hibiki.

195
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,541
[HACHISU grunts]

196
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,791
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you are?

197
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,166
I'm one of the
Five Treasures of Kouga.

198
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,791
That's who I think I am.

199
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,541
Have you got
a problem with that?

200
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,625
[UTSUTSU]
What?!

201
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,458
--[HIBIKI] Enough.
--[UTSUTSU gasps]

202
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,708
The castle's been spotted here.

203
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,833
He's bound to come.

204
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,291
Right.

205
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Our current focus should be
on gathering intelligence.

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,083
It's time to recon
the castle in force,

207
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,291
and learn what we can about
it before Hachirou's return.

208
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,583
Don't you think?

209
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,375
Indeed.

210
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,750
But what about
the Rain patrolling?

211
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,625
Do we take them out?

212
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,750
[HIBIKI]
This time, I will go.

213
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,958
[SAIZOU]
Hatching up a crazy plan, huh?

214
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,625
That's what you have me for.

215
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,791
[HIBIKI sighs]

216
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,708
Good work, Hibiki.

217
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,083
That was amazing!

218
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,750
[HACHISU]
Don't worry.

219
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,125
[HACHISU] I'll watch over
you the entire time.

220
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,250
I promise to keep you safe.

221
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,750
[SAIZOU]
Who is that man?

222
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,208
I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

223
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:02,583
But for the life of me
can't remember where.

224
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,041
[NEIRICHIOU]
Greetings, Sire.

225
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,291
Lord Nobunaga,
are you feeling stronger today?

226
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,958
[gasps]
That's Oda Nobunaga?

227
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,833
But he... He was burned
to death at Honnouji.

228
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,833
[gasps]

229
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,500
[SAIZOU]
That was too close.

230
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,583
We need to get outta here.

231
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,083
[UTSUTSU]
Hmph.

232
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,375
They sure are persistent.

233
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,208
Time to paddle harder, big guy.

234
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,708
Otherwise, you boys
will be affected by it, too.

235
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,291
Now.

236
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,041
Leaving her to do it by
herself, it seems pretty risky.

237
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,958
That's why she isn't alone.

238
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,333
Oh, yeah. I love this thing!

239
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,333
Seems the young
caterpillars have begun

240
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,875
to emerge from
their cocoons at last.

241
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,583
They must have
become quite agitated

242
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,041
by the sudden appearance of
Murakumo on the horizon.

243
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,625
And there are still so many
surprises yet in store.

244
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,666
[KUJAKU, NEICHIROU laugh]

245
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,750
[HACHIROU]
Who's that?

246
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:46,833
Those men?

247
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,208
They look to be
soldiers out of Kishuu.

248
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,416
Then it'd be best
to hurry along.

249
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,500
[NARRATOR]
The 20th year of Keichou.

250
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,833
The Iga ninja,
Namenba of Otoshi,

251
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:50,500
saved Oichi no Kata from Osaka
Castle, just before it fell.

252
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,541
The war led to the
Siege of Osaka,

253
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,291
and ended in what
would come to be known

254
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,458
as the Osaka Summer Campaign.
