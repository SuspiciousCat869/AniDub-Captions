I want you to show me
one of your illusions.

Then I can reflect the visions

Hmph.

[UTSUTSU'S FATHER]
Is that all the progress

165
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,750
you've made with this skill?

166
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,666
Yes...?

167
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,958
[UTSUTSU'S FATHER]
You would dare call

168
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,958
such a worthless technique
"Dreaming Reality"?

169

Father, no!

177
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,083
[UTSUTSU'S FATHER]
I soaked my kimono in oil,

178
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,083
in preparation for your failure.

179
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,000
These flames will rage on until
everything has burned to ashes.

[UTSUTSU]
Ah! Father!

181
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,958
[UTSUTSU'S FATHER] I cannot kill
my own daughter, but then...

182
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,958
...perhaps that would
have been more merciful.

183
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:49,791
You must live on,
custodian of the knowledge

184
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:53,708
that you killed your father,
rather than yourself!

185
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,083
This hell will remain
forever branded on

of your mind.

--[SAIZOU] Hey, let's go.
--[UTSUTSU gasps]

192
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,750
[NAMENBA] I still find it hard
to believe that this thing

193
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,583
uses whale whiskers.

194
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,416
[GORONE]
So that Hadaebou fellow,

195
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,541
how far do you think
we can trust him?

196
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,208
[NAMENBA] He's a highly
skilled ninja in the service

197
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,750
of High Priest Tenkai.

198
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:26,333
With a pedigree of that sort,
what is there to trust?

199
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,583
Indeed.

200
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,583
What's that?

201
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,833
Nothing.

202
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,666
I was just noticing the
similarities between us.

203

Ah, yes.

204
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,458
Both parties are trying to see
how much the other side

205
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,375
can do for them, and
what kind of advantage

206
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,375
such work affords us.

207
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,666
Well, we'll be the ones
to ultimately win.

208
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,041
I hope you're right
about that, but nevertheless,

209
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,708
when he's around,
keep your guard up.

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,083
[HACHIROU gasps]

211
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,375
[HACHIROU] So your plan
was to gain entrance,

212
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,208
by taking advantage
of the ensuing chaos

213
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,125
of the ninja raid.

214
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,666
That's the real
reason you recruited

215
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,333
my friends, correct?

216
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,750

Here goes.

218
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,833
You missed it.

219
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,416
You really thought we'd
hit our target the first time?

220
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,708
[UTSUTSU]
We still have three bombs left.

221
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,625
But that first shot had to
have notified the enemy

222
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,375
of our exact location.

223
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,958
As we speak, the Rain could
be heading right this way.

224
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,250
And when they get here,
you can take care of them.

[HACHISU]
What do you think you're doing?

That's right.

If we hope to win,
we'll need her power.

So we're headed
for an all-out brawl?

231
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,000
While you work the
cannon, we'll cover you.

--[UTSUTSU] Hmm?
--What's that?

[HACHISU]
I fire this into that embrasure.

234
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,583
And then, your bomb will
follow along behind it.

235
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,291
[SAIZOU]
Is that even possible?

Looks like I was mistaken.

243

I'd assumed the Rain would
be sufficient to handle

244

245
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,208
[KUJAKU] I compliment you
for actually making me

246

have to work, if nothing else.

247
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,041
[HACHISU]
What just happened?

248
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,708
[SAIZOU] It's what that damned
monk was telling us about.

249
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,916
The technique to
reverse time's flow.

250
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,750
The Inverted Halberd of Time.

251
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,916
[HACHISU] Is a technique
such as that even possible?

252
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,208
It must be.

253
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,708
Though I'm having serious
doubts whether I can

254
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:28,583
trust my eyes on this one.
It's unbelievable.

255
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:32,708
But time really did
flow backwards, somehow.

256
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,791
Yeah. Then, that's...
Kujaku Tsuibamu.

257
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,166
That is him.

258
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,541
So he's one of the ones
we'll have to fight.

259
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,000
And he's dangerous.

260
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,083
Remember, these people
defeated the Five Treasures

261
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,041
and the Five Flowers.

262

[HIBIKI growls]

263
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,291
Hachisu, where's the cannon?

264
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,791
I've got it right here.

265

[SAIZOU]
Your Gorouza.

266

You can still use it, can't you?

00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,416
Of course,
but what good will it be?

I can't be certain. Who knows?

But for the time being,
that's all we've got.

270

We have to do something with it!

[HACHIROU]
I'll say this, Hadaebou.

Your unending deviousness
is almost impressive.

Thank you for the compliment.

And?

made it inside Murakumo?

277
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,416
Be honest with me.

278
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
There are very few
excuses I could make

279
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,333
that would allow me to pass.

280
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,416
That's true.

281
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,708
But if it's adequately
entertaining,

282
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,333
I might grant you passage.

283
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,250
[HADAEBOU] We have reason to
believe that Tadanaga- <i>sama</i>

284
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,041
was kidnapped by Joujin.

285
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,791
[HACHIROU] Lord Tadanaga
was taken by Joujin?

286
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,041
But why?

287
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,750
[HADAEBOU] Well. That's
what I've come to learn.

288
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:58,375
Yet, what power
does Tadanaga hold now?

289
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:02,166
He has no title,
no courtiers, no soldiers.

290
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,625
[HACHIROU] What could Tenkai
possibly fear from such a man?

291
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,416
And if Joujin did indeed
take Tadanaga- <i>sama</i> ,

292
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,041
what concern is it of
High Priest Tenkai's?

293
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,541
It may not be
the most flattering thing

294
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,291
to say about the man.

295
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,125
But for better, or for worse.

296
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,041
Suruga- <i>sama</i> is
still Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

297
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,875
Nothing will change that.

298
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,416
[HACHIROU]
I understand.

299
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,250
Tadanaga is the grandson of the
late Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu.

300
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,541
[HACHIROU] He would
make the perfect puppet.

301
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,875
[HACHIROU] And because that
cannot be allowed to happen,

302
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:40,416
you have to rescue him
from Joujin's clutches.

303
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,833
I assume that's why you're here.

304
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,666
Well...

305
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,833
Best hurry, before the people
in power are agitated.

306
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:49,208
Right.

307
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:53,625
We can't hope to keep
using a double indefinitely.

308
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:58,041
[JOUJIN] But if he cannot be
saved, he is to be slaughtered.

309
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,541
That is precisely what
your master instructed you

310
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,791
to do, if I'm not mistaken.

311
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,458
[NARRATOR]
He opened his eyes,

312
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,750
and his glance fell
upon a sword.

313
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,208
Above it, he saw
swirling clouds,

314
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:52,791
thus he named the sword
Ama no Murakumo.

315
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,000
Murakumo, meaning
"a gathering of clouds".
