00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,375
whether they like it or not.

160
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,583
[KASOU] Even when that requires
a brother to bed his sister?

161
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,416
You should know
better than to ask.

162
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,625
[GEI'IN]
To keep the line alive,

163
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:45,458
we would force
a parent to bed their child.

164
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,583
Without a new generation
of superior ninja,

165
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:52,000
both the Kouga and Iga clans
would be finished.

166
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,000
This is Hachirou
and Hibiki's birthright.

167
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,958
They should both be
well aware of this by now.

168
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,250
[KASOU]
A message?

169
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,208
[TENSHIN]
The wife of the last shogun--

170
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,583
her health is failing.

171
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,541
[KAZUMA]
Suruga- <i>sama</i> 's mother?

172
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,791
[TENSHIN] It says he left
by horseback last night.

173
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,125
[TADANAGA pants]

174
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,333
[SOLDIER C] My lord!
It's getting too dangerous!

175
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,375
We need to seek out shelter!

176
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,791
[TADANAGA pants]
I told you, I don't care!

177
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,750
Even if I risk being
struck by lightning.

178
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,041
I must go!

179
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,208
I will be by my mother's side!

180
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,166
[HIBIKI giggles]

181
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,166
[gasps]
Hachirou!

182
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,666
[HACHIROU]
Your sandals.

183
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,875
Aren't you cold?

184
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,458
[HIBIKI]
I'm fine!

185
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:31,458
A cherry blossom?

186
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,083
[HACHIROU] Hmm? Well,
I did just cut a branch off

187
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,000
of the Tenzen cherry tree.

188
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,541
[HIBIKI]
Mm! That's awful!

189
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,125
It was a branch,
trees lose them all the time.

190
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,250
Plus, the Tenzen tree is
immortal, so it's gonna be fine.

191
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,833
That's just a silly old legend!

192
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,625
They say that one
of those dirt mounds next

193
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:51,416
to the tree belongs to the great
Yakushiji Tenzen- <i>sama</i> .

194
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,583
but an "immortal" ninja wouldn't
have a grave, would he?

195
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,166
Maybe not.

196
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,250
[NAMENBA]
Are you in there, Gorone?

197
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,875
I'm coming in.

198
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,875
Is that Shikibu's?

199
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,041
[GORONE]
It is.

200
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:21,541
I'm tinkering with his Saibougu.

201
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:23,125
[NAMENBA] Hachisu wanted
to know if it was possible

202
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,625
to fire off multiple
rounds at once.

203
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,083
Multiple rounds?

204
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,041
It takes too long
between firing a round,

205
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,833
and following it up
with another shot.

206
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,083
Now that's an interesting idea.

207
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,250
Have you seen
what's going on

208
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,875
between Hachirou and Hibiki?
Sparks are flying.

209
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:40,833
I can hear excitement
in your voice.

210
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,666
Uh. [chuckles] Well, of course,
because it's wonderful news!

211
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,625
And besides,
I'm not the only one.

212
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,458
The whole village wants those
two to love each other.

213
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,166
[GORONE]
I suppose you're right.

214
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,875
What? That doesn't
make you happy, Gorone?

215
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,250
[GORONE] Could you fetch
the helmet back there for me?

216
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,583
[GORONE] Trying to improve
the head's field of motion

217
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,625
makes the neck more vulnerable.

218
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,208
This one right over here?

219
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,041
[GORONE]
Hmm. That's it.

220
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,916
--Tell me.
--[GORONE] Hmm?

221
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,625
Aren't you happy?

222
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,375
I haven't forgotten our duty,
and I know that you haven't.

223
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,000
After all, you and I--

224
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,083
[GORONE]
We're the ones responsible

225
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,083
for watching over
them as they grow.

226
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,083
Right.

227
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,875
It all sounds fine in theory,

228
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,666
but you're also trying
to justify bringing

229
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,500
those two together,
no matter what the cost.

230
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:28,916
[sighs] Why do you insist on
being so dramatic all the time?

231
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,666
What's wrong, you don't approve?

232
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,125
[GORONE gasps]

233
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,041
Let me.

234
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,041
Thank you.

235
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,416
[NAMENBA sighs]

236
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,375
[TADANAGA]
Where are the carriers?!

237
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,375
We need them to take
us across the river!

238
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,750
[SOLDIER E] My lord. I think
they've already gone home.

239
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,083
Then call them back!

240
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't care how much
we have to pay!

241
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,416
[SOLDIER E]
Even with their assistance,

242
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,208
we would be ill-advised to
attempt crossing the river

243
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,208
in such a heavy
downpour, my lord.

244
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:14,458
[TADANAGA] You are not in any
position to refuse my command!

245
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,375
Have you forgotten that
I'm the Dainagon of Suruga?

246
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,875
[TADANAGA]
Do something other than snivel!

247
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,250
I know! A ship.
Is there a ship?

248
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,416
[SOLDIER F]
My lord!

249
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,208
[SOLDIER E]
Lord Tadanaga, wait!

250
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,625
[TADANAGA]
Halt!

251
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,083
I found one.

Praise be unto mighty Hachiman!

253
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,541
At last I have the chance to
make it to my ailing mother

254
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,500
without any further delay!

255

[SOLDIER F]
My lord.

You don't actually plan to
cross in this boat, do you?

257
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,541
[TADANAGA]
Of course!

258
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,125
We haven't another moment
to lose, so make haste.

259
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,166
Which of you can pilot a boat?

260
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,041
Since all of you have
become such pathetic cowards.

261
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,625
I shall take it across myself!

262
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:04,125
[TADANAGA] Now, men,
push the boat into the river!

I'd like to ask a question.

Forgive my boldness,

but you are the Dainagon
of Suruga, are you not?

275
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:39,666
Bastard! You slaughter my men
and beg for my title?

Who are you?
I demand to know your name!

277

[MAN D] Apologies,
but we men of low birth

278
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:49,125
haven't a name worthy of
sharing with our betters.

Especially the sons of
powerful men, like shoguns.

What's that?

281
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,666
Please allow me
to share a little advice.

282
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,708
Simply put, Suruga- <i>sama</i> ,
a man like you trying to take

283
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:03,041
that boat across the river
goes against the natural order.

284
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,666
What I mean is,
you're out of place,

285
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,541
like a dog trying to replace a
cat as a catcher of rats.

You would dare to call me a dog?

[MAN D]
No, sire.

288
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,166
It was just an example
to help illustrate my point.

[MAN D]
I sense your disappointment,

302
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,125
but this is not due
to any lack of mastery

303
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,958
you have with the blade.

304

It wouldn't matter
if your lordship were

305

the greatest swordsman
currently living.

You could not hope to

[MAN D]
It's true.

309
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,875
Due to my unique
physical abilities,

310
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,625
the blade naturally avoids
making any sort of contact

311
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,125
with me, therefore, it is truly
not your shortcoming, sire.

This is the ninja
technique "Ukigumo,"

So then...

315
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,750
...you are a ninja.

316
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,250
[KAZUMA]
Indeed.

317
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:32,000
However, not an
impressive one, I assure you.

318
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,666
[KAZUMA]
If I were being charitable,

319
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,625
I'd say he was... below average.

320
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,708
It's you, Kazuma!

321
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,875
Worry not, my lord.

322
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,500
The Five Treasures of
Kouga are here to serve.

323
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,416
[NARRATOR] The leader of
the Five Treasures of Kouga--

324
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,875
Kouga Hachirou.

325
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,041
The leader of
the Five Flowers of Iga--

326
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,750
Iga Hibiki.

327
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,791
An innocent
brother and sister,

328
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,291
lighting the way forward for
those who lurk in the shadows.
