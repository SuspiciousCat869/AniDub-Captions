[GORONE] I don't want to have
to repeat myself, Hachirou.

8
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:25,500
I can't allow you to go. We have
no idea what we're up against.

9
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,125
That's precisely why
I need to go, and soon.

There's no need to run off.

The Five Flowers of Iga are
already on their way--

12
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,166
We should wait for them.

13
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,708
How can you be sure
they're still alive?

14
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,625
Wasn't their defeat the reason
the enemy's at our doorstep?

[gasps]

If the Five Treasures
were killed by this foe,

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,916
it is my duty as their leader
to see them avenged.

It's not that simple!

Listen to me.

We aren't just trying
to keep you protected

22
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,541
because of the
position you hold.

23
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,166
We must also
safeguard your techniques.

24
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,458
Ensure the powers you and
Hibiki inherited aren't lost.

25
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,333
That is our mission.

Over there.

00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,750

What the hell is that thing?

00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,208
I got no clue.

32
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,250
How are we supposed
to fight something like that?

33

Don't be such a coward.

34
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,916
That monster's an illusion.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,083
So they're playing with
the same tricks that you do.

36
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,916
Don't compare me to that beast!

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,291
Just close your eyes,
and it shouldn't be a problem.

38
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,875
[NEIRICHIOU] Oh. I don't
know if I'd go that far.

39
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,958
It's in the mind
of the beholder.

40
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,416
That is what truly determines
if something is real

41
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,333
or merely an illusion.

42

[BOTH gasp]

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,333
[NEIRICHIOU] There are many who
cannot survive the real world

44
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,458
without clinging onto the
hope offered by falsehoods.

45
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,291
Be it reality or a mirage,
it matters not.

46
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,166
They need it to make
sense of a chaotic world.

47
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,166
Your silence tells me
you're still unhappy, Hachirou.

48
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,541
The only thing that
truly matters is my blood.

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,458
Does that newfound
responsibility upset you?

50
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,041
That's not it, no.

51
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,041
It's just... I've been thinking
about what you told me.

52
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,500
And If the world can
remain at peace for long enough,

53
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,833
then one day, there may be
no further need for ninjas.

54
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,333
Which means that blood
wouldn't matter.

55
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,083
That is why, from time to time,

56
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,958
a person needs something
to cling on to. A certainty.

57
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,333
Even if the truth they yearn for
is nothing more than a fantasy.

58
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,291
[GORONE]
Understand that.

59
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,458
If you accept that fact,

60
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,916
and still wish to
do things your way,

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,291
I won't argue with you.
I'll remain quiet.

62
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,625
[GORONE] Through here, there's
a shaft leading downwards.

63
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,958
It's a shortcut to the mountain.

64
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,458
[HACHIROU]
Got it.

65
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,125
[GORONE] And I don't want you
to come back until things

66
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,291
have begun to calm down.

right where we are.

controlling that monster?

[NEIRICHIOU]
How ignorant you sound.

74
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,791
"That monster"?

75
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:31,125
Its majestic form, reminiscent
of the gods of India,

76
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,916
only brings the word "monster"
to your miniscule brain?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,458
Shut your mouth.

78

[NEIRICHIOU] Are any of you
little ones Hachirou of Kouga?

79
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,708
Or Hibiki of Iga, by chance?

No matter.

If either one of them
is hiding amongst you,

83
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,833
they'll surely use their
eye magic to fight back.

And if none of you
are able do that,

it'll go with him.

That's my...

[NEIRICHIOU] You show your

technique, is it not?

But unfortunately,
it simply doesn't work

on those who do not see it.

102
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,000
Be quiet! You saw it!
I know that you did!

103
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,041
I did not.

104
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,666
It simply displayed itself
across the layer of film

105
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,125
on my eyeballs.

106

What?

107
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,833
If you don't allow
the vision to travel

108
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,958
from your eyes to your mind,
then perhaps you don't

109
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,541
really "see" it at all!

110
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,500
Wait-- What the hell
is he saying?

111
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,000
I get it.

112
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,291
His eyes are nothing more than
the tools he uses to see.

113

What's that mean?!

couldn't kill anybody.

Listen up, toothless.
Give that back!

116
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,875
I have a much finer idea.

happen is real or not.

[gasps]

119

So does that mean the

right between the eyes.

It knew to stop following us.

Something tells me that's about
the extent of its brain power.

I think so.

Hah! That was
a perfectly set-up trap.

Even the Buddha himself
wouldn't have seen it coming!

That plan was
completely reckless.

You were moments away from
being caught in it yourself.

134

And yet you were there
to rescue me, weren't you?

00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:58,500
How was seeing an illusion
enough to hurt us...?

the ability to pull off such

You're still just a larva.

while you still can.

then tell Namenba and Gorone.

of Kouga Gennosuke within you.

It's most impressive.

Tell me. Why kill
the Five Treasures?

235

And the Five Flowers?

A fair question.

We killed them all as a
demonstration of our power.

That's it?!

is to take your heads.

It's a shame
to end lives so young,

242
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,583
but the moment
you were born a leader,

243
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,291
that became your destiny.

244
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,958
And there's nothing you
can do to change that fate.

"Why is my technique
not working on him?"

No normal human man,

nor even a mighty
god of thunder,

249
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:15,125
could kill while lacking
the desire to harm his enemy.

00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,833
It seems like a contradiction.

Though, perhaps due to
my spiritual training,

252
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,208
I can hurt people while my heart
remains as calm as a still pond.

Without poison of
malice or fire of rage.

won't work on me.

Now, die.

the fact your "sacred skill"

it mattered most.

we can do for them.

But that isn't all there is.

It's impossible to have
