1
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,291
[NARRATOR] On the outside,
we look the same.

2
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,166
And yet, men call us monsters.

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,125
We are naught but
shadows lurking in between eras,

4
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,166
but if we are
destined to perish,

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,416
then I shall fall with
the cherry blossoms.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,541
Yes.

7
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,833
I shall fall with
the cherry blossoms.

8
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,583
[HACHIROU]
I can't be certain,

9
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,875
but I think we might have
arrived at a different "now,"

10
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:19,250
altered from the "now" where
we faced the Joujinshuu,

11
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,333
and lost our companions.

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:25,000
No matter what world
we find ourselves in,

13
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:28,125
we can't stand by
as Joujin destroys it!

14
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,291
Not while we're
still able to fight!

15
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,375
You would interfere
in our affairs?

16
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,833
[laughs]

17
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,916
It'd be rude of us to
turn down free entertainment.

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,791
[KUJAKU] I don't know who you
people are, other than fools.

19
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,125
Ready?

20
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll start with the one
that's the biggest threat.

21
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,416
[yells]

22
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,750
[KUJAKU]
Impossible.

23
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:55,791
[ITARU gasps]

24
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,041
My Destiny's Passage
will make short work of you!

25
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,333
You knew?

26
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,458
Damn you.

27
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,583
Your attack was a feint--
you used me to distract them!

28
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,833
[NEIRICHIOU growls]

29
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:48,916
Neirichiou!

30
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,208
You...

31
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,708
[NEIRICHIOU growl]

32
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,333
[NEIRICHIOU grunts]

33
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:09,958
[NEIRICHIOU screams]

34
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,583
Who are you? Tell me your names!

35
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,208
Kouga Hachirou.

36
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,916
Iga Hibiki.

37
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,833
[JOUJIN] Well, they
proved to be worthless.

38
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,125
Killed so easily.

39
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,916
[JOUJIN]
What's wrong?

40
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I stand before you now.

41
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,750
Won't you use your
"eye magic" on me?

42
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,833
Hachirou.

43
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:47,208
I can't.

44
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,583
My Spearing Eye
won't work against him.

45
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,000
Well then, I'll try.

46
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,083
No, that last time.

47
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,958
Your technique only worked
because he was caught off guard.

48
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,458
[HIBIKI growls]

49
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,708
Joujin.

50
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,333
No matter what world you're in,
we won't allow

51
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,000
your wicked desires to
ever come to fruition!

52
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,250
Oh?

53
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,750
No matter what world I'm in?

54
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,791
So, what happened
to me in this "other world"

55
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,833
to which you refer?

56
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,750
You met with a gruesome death.

57
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,125
[JOUJIN]
I died, and then what happened?

58
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,958
Nothing.

59
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,791
You died, and all your
scheming lead to failure.

60
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,625
Then that possibility
is the only one you have seen?

61
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:26,750
It was.

62
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,083
I see.

63
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,625
[chuckles]

64
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,916
[HACHIROU]
Why do you laugh?

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
[laughs]
That's enough!

66
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,000
Begone!

67
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,083
[gasps] 

68
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,791
You know nothing.

69
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,041
No matter the fate that
bound us in another world,

70
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,875
we are but strangers
in this one.

71
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,833
I will achieve my
ambitions with Murakumo!

72
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,750
I cannot be stopped!

73
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,958
Perhaps, or perhaps not.

74
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,416
Because in this world, you know
nothing of our final technique!

75
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,875
Your what?

76
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,041
[gasps]

77
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,541
I've never seen
a power like this before!

78
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll handle the rest of it.

79
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,416
Thank you.

80
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,458
So, try to tell me
what it's like, best you can.

81
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,416
[HIBIKI sighs]

82
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,083
There's love, caring.

83
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:39,250
Plus pain and sorrow.

84
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,375
All those feelings combined.

85
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:45,083
Perhaps it's connected
to the contradictory powers

86
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,083
you originally possessed.

87
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,583
Something that channeled
those diverse feelings,

88
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,333
and distilled them into
a strength unmatched.

89
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,541
But...

90
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,291
If that's how it works,
why aren't we able

91
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,333
to control the power ourselves?

92
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,083
Because of those emotions.

93
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,041
They're rooted in
violence and passion,

94
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,958
and can't be controlled.

95
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,958
It's a power
that's fueled by joy,

96
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,416
melancholy, and madness.

97
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,750
[GORONE]
I find it hard to comprehend.

98
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,666
Why would the technique you
both created be so powerful,

99
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,041
yet unable to bring
you happiness?

100
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,583
The entire equation is unfair.

101
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,958
[gasps]

102
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,083
Ouka can evolve,
this is the first stage.

103
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,500
[GORONE]
Yes.

104
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,541
What we've seen of the technique
could easily be eclipsed

105
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,125
by the intense brilliance
of its true form.

106
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,583
[HIBIKI]
The brilliance of its true form.

107
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:41,500
[JOUJIN]
This is your ultimate technique?

108
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,708
[HIBIKI gasps]

109
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,291
[JOUJIN]
Behold.

110
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,208
Look upon the destruction
your ability has wrought.

111
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,583
[HACHIROU gasps]

112
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,000
[HIBIKI growls]

113
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,291
In the end, my weakness
brings me shame.

114
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,791
I'll never get over the pain of
being unable to defeat you

115
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,375
without using the Ouka.

116
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,958
So now... you will kill me?

117
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,291
I will put you down
without mercy.

118
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,333
Die, Joujin.

119
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,625
[HACHIROU] It doesn't
matter what the Ouka is,

120
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:09,208
we must abstain from
ever using it again.

121
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,791
Yes.

122
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,250
[HACHIROU]
But as long as we're together,

123
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,375
we cannot escape its grasp!

124
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,750
I've chosen.

125
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,916
I know what I'm
willing to forfeit.

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
[HIBIKI gasps]
No, don't leave again!

127
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,958
[HIBIKI gasps]

128
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,583
[gasps]

129
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,333
[HIBIKI]
No! Give me another chance!

130
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,041
You have to!

131
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,750
[HACHIROU grunts]

132
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,625
Wait. Your Shielding Eye.

133
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,541
Yes, Hachirou.

134
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,625
It's finally time to do what I
should have done long ago.

135
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,958
[HACHIROU]
Hibiki!

136
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,875
[HACHIROU]
No...

137
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,291
[HIBIKI] Now, you'll never
forget about Ouka.

138
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,958
Or leave me behind.

139
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,666
[HACHIROU whimpers]

140
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,458
Hibiki..

141
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,500
I'll never stray
from your side again.

142
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,916
I'll be with you, eternally.

143
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,166
[JOUJIN]
Pathetic fools.

144
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,250
[HACHIROU]
Joujin!

145
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:04,750
Tell me, was that display
the best you could muster?

146
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,833
Impossible.

147
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,875
I killed you, I'm sure of it.

148
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,791
That can't be. Tenzen?

149
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,666
I'm impressed
that you know of him.

150
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,833
[HACHIROU]
The Tenzen cherry tree blooms

151
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,708
above Jison'in Village.

152
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,625
They say an immortal ninja
gave the tree its name.

153
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,041
Tenzen.

154
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,083
[HACHIROU]
You mean to tell me he was real?

155
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,583
[JOUJIN]
So it would appear.

156
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,291
Now, he lives on within me.

157
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,916
[gasps]

158
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,541
[JOUJIN] I never thought she
would destroy her own eyes.

159
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,291
How very dull.

160
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,208
All right.

161
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,791
She's no threat,
just forget about us.

162
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,541
[JOUJIN]
I will, I assure you.

163
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,250
Of course, if I let you live,
you'll only get in my way.

164
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,500
What?

165
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,666
[JOUJIN] Even a single pebble
in the road could cause

166
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,250
a man to stumble.

167
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,500
That is why you must be removed.

168
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:32,458
[yells]

169
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,958
[JOUJIN] The eye magic you
used to defeat Magoroku.

170
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:47,291
it seems to reflect an enemy's
desire to kill you back on them.

171
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:50,458
An interesting technique,
to say the very least.

172
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,708
[HACHIROU grunts]

173
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,791
[JOUJIN] And still,
you will not use it on me,

174
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,458
now that all other options
have failed you?

175
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,583
I assume you used it
against me in that other world

176
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:05,875
you spoke of, and it
failed to affect me.

177
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:06,875
[HACHIROU growls]

178
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,208
[JOUJIN]
I have seen your weakness,

179
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,750
and know precisely
how to exploit it.

180
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,083
[HACHIROU growls]

181
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,291
[HIBIKI]
Hachirou!

182
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,000
Hibiki.

183
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,333
[HIBIKI]
Hachirou.

184
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:22,833
Where are you?

185
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,291
[HIBIKI whines]

186
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:39,000
[JOUJIN yells]

187
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,416
[JOUJIN]
Too easy.

188
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,958
Stupid boy.

189
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:03,041
[HACHIROU] Joujin, aren't
you ashamed of yourself?

190
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,583
[JOUJIN]
Hmm?

191
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,750
Keeping yourself alive.

192
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,833
Having to rely on
the power of Tenzen.

193
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,375
The power of a mere ninja?

194
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,833
That's your plan?

195
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,916
To draw out my desire to
kill you with your insults?

196
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,125
A feeble attempt at best.

197
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,666
Didn't you know?

198
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,833
Tenzen lusted after Oboro,
leader of the Iga clan.

199
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:28,750
He tried to rape the woman
he was honor-bound to serve,

200
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,041
a despicable monster.

201
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,708
If you realize your ambitions,

202
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:39,208
but only through the help of a
worthless excuse for a ninja.

203
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,708
Can you honestly take pride in
what you've accomplished?

204
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,250
You're a tenacious one,
I'll give you that much.

205
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,083
Hachirou, was it?

206
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,333
It won't work on me.

207
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:56,916
[gasps]

208
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,750
What?

209
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,000
Stop it!

210
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,000
[coughs]

211
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,166
You used... Tenzen's
desire... to kill you?

212
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,500
[JOUJIN groans]

213
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,708
Tenzen. Stop it!

214
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,708
What are you doing?

215
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,208
Hachirou!

216
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,500
Where are you?

217
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:36,375
[JOUJIN groans]

00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,000

Slow down, Chou!

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,458
Wait up!

222
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,125
[IEMITSU]
In truth.

223
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,583
I don't like my brother,
Tadanaga.

224
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,416
Neither do I believe his story.

225
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,166
He tried to plot rebellion.

226
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,000
He not only betrayed me,
but our legacy.

227
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,541
I will not abide this treason.

228
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,000
However.

229
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,458
I wonder who
stoked this fire within him.

230
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,583
Our stations were
determined by the outcome

231
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,000
of a ninja battle.

232
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,875
Such an embarrassing
fact about us both,

233
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,250
and one only a handful
of people could have known.

234
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:14,750
He still could not
forgive me, after so long.

235
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,291
[TENKAI]
Your Majesty.

236
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,750
In the end, it was all for the
glory of the Tokugawa Clan.

237
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,333
[NARRATOR] Some say Tenkai lived
on for another decade,

238
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,875
eventually surpassing
the century mark,

239
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:30,166
until he had fulfilled all
of his earthly desires.

240
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,750
Wait! I'm not ready yet.

241
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,125
I...

242
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,333
[NARRATOR] The tenth
year of the Kan'ei Era.

243
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,000
In December of that year.

244
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,541
Tokugawa Tadanaga commits
seppuku by the order

245
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,333
of the Shogun.

246
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,541
A fact that few people
were aware of,

247
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,083
due to the machinations
of the Joujinshuu

248
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,416
was that the true Tadanaga
had died long ago.

249
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,333
[NARRATOR]
And the cherry blossoms,

250
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,916
bloomed and fell several times,
as the seasons rolled on.

I won't lose today!

[SHICHIGEN]
Go ahead and make your move!

Looks like we've got
a real match on our hands.

what do you think you're doing?

[SAIZOU]
I'm helping.

264
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,791
[SHICHIGEN]
I don't need any help from you.

265

I'm a samurai, remember?

266
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,583
[SAIZOU] Fine. Then I'm
on Hachisu's side.

We'll come get you once the kids
have all been taken care of.

Sure. The weather's
so nice today,

I don't mind staying out
a little while longer.

[HIBIKI gasps]

[JOUJIN] You cannot see,

to watch over you.

Joujin?

279
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,750
No. Joujin died long ago.

280
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,333
How can you be so certain?

281
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,791
In truth, I did perish
when last we met.

282
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,250
But then...

283
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,041
Tenzen.

284
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,208
[JOUJIN] I'd expect no less
from the leader of the Iga.

Since you rendered
your eyes completely useless.

00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,458
I can no longer
harness the Ouka.

However, there
is one course of action

[JOUJIN]
That's right.

I shall fill your womb
with the seed of life.

And you will be with child,
and bear forth my heir.

No one will come to save you.

If my essence were to
combine with your bloodline.

We would create a technique
that would surpass Ouka.

With our two bloodlines mixed,
