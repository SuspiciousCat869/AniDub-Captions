[GEI'IN]
But... Why didn't it work?

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,083
It wouldn't matter
if it was a Firefly Squid

164
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:19,250
or just a regular one,
because no poison can work

165
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,750
without the victim coming
into contact with it.

166
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,041
There's no need
to act so surprised.

167
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,250
Even the Kurokuwa you
encountered earlier

168
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,416
have harnessed the
ability of levitation.

169
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,833
Another power in
their bag of tricks.

170
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,416
[GEI'IN] I see, and which
of the ninja lines did

171
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,291
the Joujinshuu come from?

172
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,583
[KUJAKU]
Ninja?

173
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,958
We aren't peons who
can only serve their lord

174
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,250
and live out their
lives in secret.

175
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,791
Not like you
unfortunate creatures.

176
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,083
[GEI'IN]
What?

177
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,375
[KUJAKU] The longer
the Tokugawas flourish

178
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,291
and the peace they
established continues unabated,

179
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,041
the less need they
will have for ninja.

180
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,041
Perhaps this is
a mercy of sorts for you.

181
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,791
To be killed before you see the
end of the ninja way of life!

182
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,083
I've had enough
of your proud posturing!

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,541
Oh, my!

184
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,541
[KUJAKU giggles]

185
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,791
[GEI'IN]
A strange sight, is it not?

186
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,250
The light that emanates from my
sweat derives from the fact

187
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,333
that since childhood,
I have ingested a litany

188
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,833
of virulent, toxic elements.

189
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,666
This is the power
of a ninja's technique!

190
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,375
A light gained after
total dedication.

191
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,291
All paid for with unyielding
focus and intense suffering!

192
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,833
[GEI'IN groans]

193
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,625
[GEI'IN yells]

194
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,625
[GEI'IN gasps]

195
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,458
So I...

196
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,791
I wasn't simply
imagining things...?

197
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,125
I take it you've
already figured out

198
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,916
what just happened.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,208
Indeed.

200
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,291
Something altered
the very flow of time

201
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,333
and sent it backwards.

202
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,333
[GEI'IN] You made the passing
of time reverse itself?

203
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:31,125
No, that sort of technique
should be completely impossible!

204
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,458
[KUJAKU]
How interesting!

205
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:35,791
You noticed for yourself,
yet refuse to admit it?

206
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,750
That stubbornness
will be the end of you.

207
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,291
I can promise you that.

208
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,708
[GEI'IN]
The end...

209
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,958
This must certainly be

210
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,041
an exhilarating
experience for you.

211
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,958
Death by the coursing
of your own poison.

212
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:54,791
[giggles] Well, die slowly,
then, you pickled old squid.

213
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,041
[GEI'IN groans]

214
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,625
[GEI'IN]
I shall meet my demise

215
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,500
with my task
unfulfilled, my lord.

216
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:25,291
I beg your forgiveness.

217
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,916
[HIBIKI]
Hachirou, what's wrong?

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
[HACHIROU]
I heard Gei'in's voice just now.

219
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:33,458
And he... No, the
Five Treasures are dead!

220
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,291
[HIBIKI gasps]

221
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,625
I could hear his voice as if

222
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,125
he were standing here.
They've all been defeated!

223
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,541
I'll go on ahead!

224
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,083
[NAMENBA]
The Five Treasures are dead?

225
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,458
[HACHIROU] I hope with all my
heart that I'm wrong.

226
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,625
No, if that was
how it seemed to you,

227
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,833
then that must be what happened.

228
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,000
The rest of the
Five Treasures are lost.

229
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,291
Yes, but who's responsible?

230
00:14:57,375 --> 00:15:00,416
If all four of them
were defeated in combat,

231
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,291
the enemy was
either very skilled,

232
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,375
or used overwhelming numbers.

233
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,250
Whatever the case,
they were strong ninjas.

234
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,166
It would have taken a great deal
of preparation to defeat them.

235
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,708
So Gei'in and
the others were targeted

236
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,541
from the start?
Then that means--

237
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,208
[HIBIKI whimpers]

238
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,666
Definitely.

239
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,000
Hachirou.

240
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,625
I can no longer allow you
to leave the village,

241
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,208
as we'd discussed.

242
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,416
With the
Five Treasures now gone,

243
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,625
I don't dare go
against their will.

244
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,333
[GORONE]
Wait.

245
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,208
Wait!

246
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,583
First thing's first--

247
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,041
We must tell the
Five Flowers of Iga.

248
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,750
I don't want to let
the damned Iga avenge

249
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,166
our fallen comrades!

250
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,708
Then who shall we
send to avenge you?

251
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,416
[NAMENBA]
Let's leave this to Rui.

252
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,375
She is the fastest.

253
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,458
Hold on.

254
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,875
If we're informing
the Five Flowers,

255
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,625
as their leader, I should go!

256
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,125
[HACHISU]
You have to stay behind, safe.

257
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,916
Can't risk you getting killed.

258
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,916
[HIBIKI sighs]

259
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,375
[UTSUTSU]
Besides,

260
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,333
whether the Five treasures
were actually killed or not,

261
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,916
do we Iga need to
meddle in Kouga affiars?

262
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're really
still talking like that?

263
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,625
Remember, our two clans
now share the same fate.

264
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,125
What I remember
is Kazuma tried to kill me

265
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:15,041
during yesterday's
training mission!

266
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,208
--He got what he deserved.
--Be quiet!

267
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,916
He only did that
because you threw a <i>kunai</i>

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,291
at him during his training!

269
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,500
[UTSUTSU] But did he
have to take things so far?

270
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,250
[RUI]
Give them a break.

271
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,166
The Kouga aren't
really all that bad.

272
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,875
[UTSUTSU] You mean
you never noticed it, Rui?

273
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,166
[RUI gasps]

274
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,333
That Shichigen guy
looks nice, and, who knows?

275
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,541
Maybe he is mostly harmless.

276
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,375
But whenever he thinks
that no one is looking,

277
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:37,875
he stares at your breasts.

278
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,041
[RUI whimpers]

279
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,583
He wants to get
his hands on them so bad.

280
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,041
No way...

281
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,125
[UTSUTSU growls] Why do
we have to keep company

282
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,416
--with these fools?
--That's enough, Utsutsu!

283
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,041
Even though we may be
called on to avenge the Kouga,

284
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,333
we have to do as we're asked.

285
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,041
Situations like this
are the reason we were

286
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,833
brought here in the first place.

287
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,333
[UTSUTSU]
Hmph.

288
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,791
[RUI sighs]

289
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,375
It's up to you.

290
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,833
Shichigen, you
volunteered for this assignment,

291
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,333
so don't let us down.

292
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,833
[UTSUTSU]
Hmph.

293
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,916
You might want to
stay close to me.

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,375
We don't know when the enemy
will choose to appear.

295
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,375
[RUI sighs]

296
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,041
Hey, you can hear me, can't you?

297
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,375
Of course I can.

298
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,041
Well then, don't
let your guard down.

299
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,083
[RUI] My guard's been
up this whole time.

300
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,166
The enemy may be even
closer than I expected.

301
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,250
[SAIZOU]
I'll send my eyes up to spy.

302
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,083
You can, I don't know,
watch the north?

303
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,708
I don't take orders from you.

304
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:10,041
I'll decide which direction
I'm going to check.

305
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,708
[SAIZOU groans]

306
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,041
[UTSUTSU]
Hmm?

307
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:20,291
[SAIZOU groaning]

308
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,000
That disgusts me
every time I see it.

309
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,750
And it can't be convenient.

310
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,416
Sure, it lets you see farther
away, but it also leaves

311
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,000
your eyes and your body wide
open to an enemy's attack.

312
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,541
I mean, what would
you do if you lost your eyes?

313
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,000
[SAIZOU]
I wouldn't care.

314
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,041
If it means protecting Hachirou,

315
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,875
I'd gladly give up
an eyeball or two.

316
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,083
[UTSUTSU]
What is wrong with everyone?

317
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:49,291
In any case...

318
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,041
...you wanted me to watch north?

319
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,250
Consider the north
under observation.

320
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:07,458
[HACHISU] So, the Treasures of
Kouga--are they really dead?

321
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,875
[SHIKIBU] Well, it's
definitely not something

322
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,083
that I want to believe.
But Hachirou would never lie.

323
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,250
It's true.

324
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,500
Huh.

325
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,583
It makes you itch?

326
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,916
[HACHISU] Hey. If it
itches, just take it off.

327
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,166
I can help, you know?

328
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,541
[gasps]
Cut it out!

329
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,583
[HACHISU gasps]

330
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,250
Don't touch me.

331
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,416
[HACHISU whimpers]

332
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,333
[gasps]
Sorry. No offense.

333
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,666
None taken.

334
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:49,791
[HACHIROU]
This is your plan?

335
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,875
You're going to keep us
cooped in here all night?

336
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,541
[GORONE]
That's precisely the plan.

337
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,125
There's also a place to
hide underneath the floor.

338
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,000
[HACHIROU]
Is that so?

339
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,416
[GORONE] And you'll only
come out when we're sure

340
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,416
that it's over.
Your safety is our priority.

341
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,500
They're late.

342
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:17,375
[TADANAGA]
Is that you, Gei'in?

343
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,083
Answer me, now!

344
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:23,416
[JOUJIN]
Forgive my impudence,

345
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
but may I ask you for
your name, my lord?

346
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,625
I'm searching for the one
known as Suruga Dainagon.

347
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,541
Is that you?

348
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,291
[TADANAGA gasps]

349
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,166
[JOUJIN] Are you Suruga
Dainagon, my lord?

350
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,166
I must know.

351
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,416
Indeed, I am.

352
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,083
[JOUJIN]
The ruler of the rich fiefdoms

353
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,125
of Suruga and To-otoumi.

354
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:48,375
As well as Dainagon of
the Imperial Court.

355
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:50,625
In other words,
after the former shogun,

356
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:54,458
Lord Hidetada and the current
shogun, Iemitsu- <i>sama</i> ,

357
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:58,375
you are the third most
important man in the country.

358
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,916
However, you are
also the most unfortunate soul

359
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,166
in the entire Land
of the Rising Sun.

360
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,375
[TADANAGA]
What? How dare you say that!

361
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,833
I refuse to forgive
such disrespect!

362
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,125
[TADANAGA gasps]

363
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,375
[JOUJIN]
I am afraid that someday soon,

364
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,458
your own neck, Suruga- <i>sama</i> ,
will be exposed to the blade

365
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:21,333
in order to maintain
the peace, as it were.

366
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,333
[TADANAGA]
What? Hold your tongue!

367
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,333
Kneel before me, that I might
bring about your execution

368
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,583
here and now!

369
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:30,083
[JOUJIN]
Execute me?

370
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,000
It is you who will be executed,
Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

371
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,541
This much I promise you.

372
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,875
Quiet, you bastard!

373
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,541
No more talk!
Impudent scum!

374
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,666
[JOUJIN] And, the one
who will bring death down

375
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,083
upon your noble head?

376
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,666
[gasps]

377
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,458
[JOUJIN] Your execution will be
brought about by your brother.

378
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:50,375
Shogun Iemitsu
will be your demise!

379
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,083
What utter nonsense.

380
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,333
[JOUJIN] You call it nonsense,
and perhaps you're right

381
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,833
in that regard, but you've also
noticed the sinister feelings

382
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,750
your brother thinks
he's hidden away

383
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,208
in the depths of his heart.

384
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,041
[TADANAGA]
Who the hell are you?

385
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:06,375
Tell me!

386
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,875
[JOUJIN] My lord Dainagon,
you may call me Joujin.

387
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,833
[NARRATOR]
Tokugawa Tadanaga.

388
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,708
Grandson of the shogun Ieyasu,

389
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:49,708
who began the
Tokugawa's 300 year reign.

390
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,166
He never ascended
to the role of shogun,

391
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,375
and was forced to
commit seppuku.

392
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,500
Or, so the history books say.
