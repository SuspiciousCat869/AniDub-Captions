1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
[MALE ROYAL A] This marks
a truly joyous turn of events!

2
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,250
[MALE ROYAL B] They say
Tenkai- <i>dono</i> is responsible

3
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,166
for the castle's
miraculous disappearance.

4
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,875
[MALE ROYAL C] Yes,
it's quite miraculous indeed.

5
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:13,375
Forgive me.
I failed in my mission.

6
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,583
So Murakumo castle has vanished.

7
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:19,125
Strange. I could understand if
it had simply been destroyed.

8
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,666
But disappearing
without a trace?

9
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,375
Could supernatural
forces be at work?

10
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,500
[MAN A]
The meal was excellent!

11
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,041
[HIBIKI]
Thank you, sir.

12
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,208
Miss. It was
just there, wasn't it?

13
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,083
--[HIBIKI] Huh?
--That bizarre castle.

14
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,708
--It was.
--I wish I could've seen it.

15
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,000
Maybe it'll come back someday.

16
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,000
[HIBIKI]
I don't believe that it will.

17
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,458
No. It's gone.

18
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,416
[RUI]
Oh. You're back to work already?

19
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,875
Of course, I'm perfectly fine.

20
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,166
I'm glad. But you were
unconscious for so long.

21
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,666
We were worried.

22
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,125
[HIBIKI]
Hachisu...?

23
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:47,208
You're awake.
Thank goodness.

24
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,916
[HIBIKI]
Where's Hachirou...?

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,083
[gasps]

26
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,958
Has he come back home?

27
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,708
[HIBIKI]
I see...

28
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,500
I should have known.

29
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,708
[gasps]

30
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,916
[HIBIKI]
Hachirou. He's so short-sighted.

31
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,291
[HACHISU]
Rui. All done for the day?

32
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,541
--[RUI] Mm-hmm.
--Listen. I'm sorry.

33
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:17,083
But do you mind keeping watch
with Utsutsu again this evening?

34
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,583
I would do it myself.

35
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,500
But Namenba and Gorone need my
help with something.

36
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,833
[RUI]
I'll cover it, but...

37
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,875
I wonder...
We're constantly on patrol now.

38
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:28,625
How much longer will
we need to keep this up?

39
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:31,375
Till we know they're gone.
For good.

40
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,791
That last time...

41
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,208
...they waited years.

42
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,250
Try and hurry
it up a little, please.

43
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,083
Come on.

44
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,916
[whimpers] Damn it, I can't
take too much more of this.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,333
Now I have to go.

46
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,541
But I can't take
off the Saibogu.

47
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,291
[blowing nose]

48
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,833
You should use leaves, you know.

49
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,791
Paper is far too expensive to
waste it on your nasties.

50
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,750
I appreciate the sympathy.

51
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,958
Ugh, springtime.

52
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,208
[NAMENBA] Hmm. Well, I can
assume you're going back

53
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,458
to your days of loafing around.

54
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,458
While the Joujinshu was
afoot, you became quite

55
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,458
the man of action.

56
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,500
[GORONE] Are you saying
you want them to return?

57
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:40,916
Is that it?

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,875
You should know better
than to tempt fate like that.

59
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,958
[GORONE sighs]
In all seriousness.

60
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,125
I can't help thinking about how
it ended with them this time.

61
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,000
It's like they just disappeared.

62
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,500
So many questions
left unanswered.

63
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,875
Perhaps. But we saw Murakumo
catch fire and begin to crumble

64
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,875
right before our very eyes.

65
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,250
You witnessed it burn
till there was no trace?

66
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,750
I didn't. And yet...

67
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,583
That must've been what happened.

68
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,000
It's gone for now.

69
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,208
But the mystery will keep me
up for nights to come.

70
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:34,375
[echoing footsteps]

71
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,166
[SHICHIGEN] Who goes there?!
Reveal yourself!

72
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
[gasps]
What?

73
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,000
[SHICHIGEN]
Impossible.

74
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:12,583
[SHICHIGEN whimpers]

75
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,625
That's enough!
Show your face!

76
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,875
Even if a <i>yokai</i> 's tricking me,
I am not afraid of you!

77
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,083
Your magic's
not going to work on me!

[gasps]

79
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,750
[SHICHIGEN'S MOTHER]
Shichigen.

80
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,583
Shichigen.

81
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,708
[SHICHIGEN'S MOTHER]
Shichigen.

82
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:36,041
[gasps]
Mother?

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,083
[SHICHIGEN'S MOTHER]
Shichigen...

84
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,541
Hold on, Mother!
I'll be right there!

85
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,583
[SHICHIGEN]
Mother!

[SHICHIGEN grunts]

91
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,666
It's not true. No way.

92
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,625
I didn't see anything.

93
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,916
[SHICHIGEN'S MOTHER]
Wait just a moment!

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,833
You can't leave me like this.

95
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,750
I beg of you.
Give me what you'd promised!

96
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,583
Come back to the inn.

97
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,125
I'm sure you could get all the
money that you wanted there.

98
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:59,375
You gave your word.

99
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,291
No. Stop!

100
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,333
Please! Let me go! [grunts]

--[grunting continues]

[pants]

104
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,416
[SHICHIGEN]
It's not true...

105
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,708
No...

106
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,250
There's no way...

107
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,125
[MAGOROKU] When we combine
our techniques like this.

108
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,583
They work rather
splendidly together.

109
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:57,041
Yes, they certainly do indeed.

110
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,875
[MAGOROKU] First, I captured him
within my Adamantite Tower.

111
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,708
[NEIRICHIOU] I used my
Demon Beast Summoning

112
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,208
with the statue of Kanzeon.

113
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,083
[ITARU] And Destiny's
Passage led him through

114
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,750
terrible sights from the past.

115
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,750
The man is our slave now.

116
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,333
From this point forward,
our hold on his psyche

117
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:16,125
will never be released.

118
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,250
[ITARU giggles]

119
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,166
[NEIRICHIOU laughs]

120
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,958
[HACHIROU] Is this where
I'll find Honnouji temple?

121
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,291
[MAN B]
Sorry.

122
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,333
But I'm afraid that's closer
to Kamagawa Village.

123
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:47,125
[HACHIROU]
No. The old one.

124
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,583
Where Nobunaga- <i>dono</i>
met his end.

125
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,916
I see.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,750
The old temple was just
up the road a little ways.

127
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,916
But, sir, there's nothing left.

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,833
There are a few rumors.

129
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,041
Right? About the ghosts?

130
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,291
What ghosts?

131
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,958
[MAN C]
Well. Some people have said

132
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,958
they've seen ghosts
up there lately.

133
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,166
Strange, pale shadows
that wander around

134
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,916
in the dead of night.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,583
Maybe Nobunaga's trapped
in the very place he was slain

136
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,291
all those years ago.

137
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,583
Where did this shard
of glass come from?

138
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,750
[SAIZOU] Are you actually
running away again?

139
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,083
[HACHIROU]
Saizou.

140
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:54,875
I'll have you know,
I'm not running anywhere.

141
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,333
[SAIZOU] But you don't plan on
coming back, do you?

142
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,708
You're just as indecisive
as you've always been.

143
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,791
Not a great quality
for a leader.

144
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,791
You put kith and kin above you.

145
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,250
Even still.

146
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,541
Can't be burdened to fulfill
your obligations to them.

147
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,916
Then you claim your
bloodline holds you back.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,250
Shichigen, Shikibu,
and even the Iga among us.

149
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,333
They've waited their entire
lives for some kind of

150
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,833
guidance from you.

151
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,708
You do realize that, right?

152
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,708
[SAIZOU]
Well?

153
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,125
I must see if there's
more to Joujin's offer.

154
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,458
[SAIZOU]
What do you mean?

155
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,875
[HACHIROU] There are rumors that
he has the power to bring

156
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,875
Nobunaga back from the dead.

157
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,416
[HACHIROU]
Perhaps this supossed ghost

158
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,750
could provide some answers.

159
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,625
But will it appear?

Hachirou...?

162
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,250
What's happening?

163
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,500
[HACHIROU]
Joujin is near.

164
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,541
[HIBIKI gasps]

165
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,208
He's very close.

166
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,000
--We have to run.
--[HACHIROU] It's too late.

167
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,375
You sure?

168
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,541
[grunts]

169
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,750
[HIBIKI whimpers]

170
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,833
[HACHIROU]
It's too late to run, Hibiki.

171
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,208
So please. Listen.

172
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:09,791
I need to tell you
what my true feelings are.

173
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,666
[HIBIKI gasps]

174
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,250
I love you.

175
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,000
[gasps]

176
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,000
[HACHIROU]
Will you promise yourself to me?

177
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,208
Yes. I will.

178
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,625
[HACHIROU]
I want you all to myself.

179
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,208
[HIBIKI]
I feel the same.

180
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,416
[JOUJIN]
So. You will be mine.

181
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,375
Body and soul.

182
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,583
[HIBIKI gasps]

183
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,541
[HACHIROU]
Hmm?

184
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,958
It's you. In the flesh.

185
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,083
Indeed. And you're no ghost.

186
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,208
Don't be so foolish.

187
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,541
Did you honestly believe that
we'd be destroyed so easily?

188
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,208
Of course not.

189
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:25,000
Now Kujaku Tsuibamu.
Tell me why you're here.

190
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:29,125
I suppose I should make
the same demand of you.

191
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll make a guess.

192
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,833
You're attempting to
resurrect Lord Nobunaga.

193
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:35,791
[KUJAKU]
Hmph. I see now.

194
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,875
You want to know if there is
some truth to the rumor, eh?

195
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,375
[KUJAKU] It's a rather
twisted fate that's caused

196
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,666
our paths to cross here.

197
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Perhaps a duel would determine
who asks and who answers.

198
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,291
Oh?

199
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,958
And might that branch be
your weapon of choice?

200
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,416
It's quite fitting.

201
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,458
This sakura just began to bloom.

202
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,666
Only to be so
violently snapped off.

203
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,666
I hear what
you're trying to say.

204
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,791
But I know the
real reason for it.

205
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,333
You're scared.

206
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,583
[KUJAKU]
Hmph.

207
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,375
[HACHIROU] You chose it.
Because you fear my technique.

208
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:21,875
If you held a blade,

209
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,666
the inherent threat would
most certainly trigger

210
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,333
my Spearing Eye.

211
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,125
But the small branch you
wield is not as menacing.

212
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,708
[laughs] I believe that
you may be overestimating

213
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,625
your vaunted technique a bit.

214
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,833
Joujin- <i>sama</i> 's
order not to kill you remains

215
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,125
in effect, and defeat by
this lovely sakura

216
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,125
will be humiliating,
but far from lethal.

217
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,916
Look. I won't
use the Ouka again.

218
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,291
I warned you about
overestimating yourself.

219
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,208
That trick doesn't scare me.

220
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,875
And as you
recently demonstrated,

221
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,666
it's incomplete at best.

222
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,833
I imagine Joujin- <i>sama</i>
has decided to give up

223
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,458
pursuing it altogether.

224
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,208
If not for that,
why is he after us?

225
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,833
I couldn't say.

226
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,250
That is a question only the
man himself can answer

227
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,041
with any degree of certainty.

228
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,375
I can bring you
to him if you desire.

229
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,458
[UTSUTSU]
Hibiki!

230
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,083
Where are you going?

231
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,416
[KUJAKU]
Now, consider your next move.

232
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,416
You have faith in your ability,

233
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,333
but will it truly be
effective against my

234
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,916
Inverted Halberd of Time?

235
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,875
I know just where
your weakness lies.

236
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,541
Once you've used the power
in the item you carry,

237
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,291
you have to wait until
you can use it again.

238
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,750
[KUJAKU] I say we
should test your theory.

239
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,708
How about it?
Your special skill against mine.

240

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,958
But why?

244
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:37,583
You mean why did your
technique have no effect on me?

245
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,458
Your spearing eye has
seldom failed before.

246
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,500
[KUJAKU]
It's quite simple--

247
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,958
Your deadly gaze
couldn't reach me.

248
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,500
[HACHIROU gasps]

249
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,791
[KUJAKU] That powerful
force your eyes emit

250
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:56,458
is just not powerful enough to
overcome the flow of time.

251
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,916
I sense you're
having trouble accepting that.

252
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,166
How's this?

253
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,125
We can try again if you like.

254
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,916
Nonsense.

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,666
[KUJAKU] If you're so sure that
I can't use my technique again

256
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,875
this quickly, you should
have no qualms about

257
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,750
going another round.

258
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,291
I employed it briefly,

259
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,458
so it shouldn't take
very long to recover.

260
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:20,000
And this time,
I'll show no mercy.

00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,916
[RUI]
Utsutsu, what's wrong?

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,291

It's Hibiki.

[gasps]

264
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,333
You have to follow her.

Hurry!

266
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,041
There she is.

268

00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,833
[NEIRICHIOU]
So you've come?

[RUI]
Neirichiou?

271
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,875
You old bastard.

272
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,875
I had wondered
if her technique did indeed

273
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,500
go further than merely stripping
her enemy's will to cause her

274
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,666
physical harm, and that
appears to be the case.

275
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,916
[ITARU] Yes. When the
constraints are lifted away,

276
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,250
it can inflict harm as well.

277
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,375
Once again, Joujin- <i>sama</i> 's
theory is correct.

278
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,875
[NEIRICHIOU]
Now come with us, Iga Hibiki.

[NARRATOR]
You wish to recover Iga Hibiki,

who's trapped inside
the Murakumo.

My wish is to retrieve
Tadanaga- <i>sama</i> .

289
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,958
If our desires
converge at this point,

290
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,375
there's no reason
not to work together.

Shall we?
