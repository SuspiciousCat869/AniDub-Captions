Several years ago.

I was forced into making
the most difficult decision

That was when I fell in love.

I met a man, and yearned
for him, and thus lost my path.

And in so doing,
lost many friends along the way.

It still pains me, even now.

That man was Kouga Gennosuke.

I don't care how many

it while there's time.

This war's different from

Heard what was said.

If you'd allowed

I think so.

A rescue? That's unlikely.

since I've shown that

I cannot be controlled.

If such insanity
can be allowed in this world,

Why would I hesitate when
given such an opportunity?

228

claim what I was unfairly denied

[HADAEBOU] I've heard that

being given his position

How can one truly earn what the
whims of fate have handed them?

He understands how
you feel, and if you return now,

the whole thing.

his happy memories
from childhood,

of spending time with you,
his beloved younger brother.

249
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,125
He spoke of a time
at a court banquet,

250
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,250
when you were five years old,
and he was seven.

251
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,166
You both argued over
who would take the red

252

or the white sweets.

253
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,333
[HADAEBOU]
He eventually gave in,

254
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,083
and handed over
all the red candies,

255
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,333
because he knew how
much you loved them.

256
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,208
It made the whole room smile.

257
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,375
[HADAEBOU] He also told me
of a time several years later.

258
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,916
It was summer.

259
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,416
And together you went on your
very first hunt with hawks.

260
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,416
The two of you
drank boiled water,

261
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,458
and he still remembers
the metallic taste of it

262
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,166
to this day.

263
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,333
He recounted all this
with tears in his eyes.
