[SHICHIGEN] The operation
begins after sunset,

00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,625
but we'll head there
now and wait.

That's fine, right?

5
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,000
Seems good.
And we will be ready.

6
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,375
Then I'll head over
to the tea shop now

7
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,500
to start getting
things prepared.

8
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,791
I'll be sure to finish and
return before nightfall.

9
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,875
Right. Sounds like a plan.

[SHIKIBU gasps]

11
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,250
There it goes.

12
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,083
What's wrong? Is it broken?

13
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,791
[SHIKIBU]
The fastener flew off.

14
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,958
[GORONE]
It's gotten too small again.

15
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,333
Saizou, can you do this
without Shikibu?

16
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,250
I guess. Sure.

17
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,083
But it's just the part
holding the knee piece in place.

18
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:20,958
Can't he go
without it for a while?

19
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,708
[GORONE]
Impossible. Come to the shed.

20
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,250
You need my help?

21
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,500
No.

22
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,666
I need you to go along
with the original plan.

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,625
Hibiki can help.
Hachisu, too.

24
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,958
[GORONE] So you've gotten
more muscular again.

25
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,166
[SHIKIBU]
Sorry...

26
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,958
[GORONE]
There's no need to apologize.

27
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,583
That's just your body--
you can't help it.

28
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,291
[SHIKIBU]
Mmm.

29
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,000
[GORONE]
Okay, take everything off.

30
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,666
[SHIKIBU gasps]

31
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,375
[GORONE] Hmph. Right,
could you ladies excuse us

32
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,000
for a couple of minutes?

33
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,291
Unless you want to stay
and see Shikibu naked.

34
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,666
[GORONE]
The whole thing is in need

35
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,875
of some major readjustments.

36
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,833
Look in the barn out back,
your old Saibougu is in there

37
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,750
on one of the shelves.

38
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,166
It's tighter than
what you're used to,

39
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,291
but if you don't move too much,
you should be fine.

40
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,250
Just wear it and stay put.

41
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,375
[SHIKIBU]
Mm.

42
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,375
[GORONE]
Uh... But first...

43
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,458
...you should go take a bath.
You're smelling a little ripe.

44
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,958
You're sure?

45
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,416
Thirty minutes out of
your armor won't hurt you.

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,958
It'll take longer than that
for your body to explode.

47
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,166
[HACHISU]
What was that all about?

48
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,541
[GORONE]
Hmm?

49
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,041
You said his body would
explode without this stuff.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,750
[GORONE]
Ah.

51
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,458
The true purpose of wearing
this suit of armor isn't merely

52
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,416
to keep him protected
from enemy attacks.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,250
It's more important.
Like a sort of lifeline.

54
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,250
A lifeline?

55
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,416
[GORONE] If he doesn't use
this to compress his body,

56
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,583
then he'll keep growing
until he explodes.

57
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,916
[BOTH gasps]

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Perhaps his muscles
are far too powerful

59
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,833
for a few layers
of skin to contain.

60
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,666
It's a rare condition
the poor boy was born with.

61
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,458
[GORONE]
There's an old saying.

62
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,041
About wandering alone,
like a rhinoceros.

63
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,375
A rhinoceros?

64
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,250
[GORONE] It's a massive,
one-horned behemoth

65
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,875
that lives in India.

66
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,041
[GORONE]
They don't form into packs,

67
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,666
and never look any
direction but forward.

68
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,666
And because they only
move straight ahead,

69
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,125
the Buddha compared
them to monks

70
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,125
trying to achieve enlightenment.

71
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,708
[HACHISU]
Just like him.

72
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,750
[GORONE]
That's right.

73
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,958
"Wander alone,
like a rhinoceros."

74
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,708
That's how the "Saibougu"
or "Rhino Armor" got its name.

75
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:57,041
It's the armor to protect him as
he goes through this life alone.

76
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,250
Wait. Someone's here.

77
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,375
We're surrounded.

78
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,000
So it would seem.

79
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,833
[HACHISU] I see one in the
shadow of the far-right tree.

80
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,916
Another in the forest behind.

81
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,583
[HACHISU]
And one more! He's big!

82
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,791
If there are
only three of them,

83
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,708
best leave it to Hachisu.

84
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:35,208
We need to repair the Saibougu
as quickly as possible,

85
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,791
for Shikibu's sake.

86
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,041
You're right.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,250
Just one left.

[HIBIKI]
The sounds are retreating.

91

Then that must
mean she was able

92
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:32,250

So we need to hurry.

would treat me like a pariah.

always warned would happen.

You would not wish
to issue forth offspring.

163
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,958
How then, can you wish
for a companion?

[BOYS laughing]

165

[SHIKIBU] Wander the world
alone--like a rhinoceros.

166
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,750
[SHIKIBU] You shouldn't
kill living things.

167
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,291
I understand that.

168
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,916
I'm careful not
to even step on ants.

[PRIEST A]
That's excellent to hear!

170
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,125
[SHIKIBU]
But I'm confused.

171
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,083
Why is it that I'm not allowed
to have any friends?

172
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,541
[SHIKIBU] Why do
I have to go through

173
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,458
this life by myself?

174
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,416
[PRIEST A] Wander the world
alone, like a rhinoceros.

175
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,750
These were
the words of the Buddha

176
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,000
to those who would
follow his path.

177
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,250
Those who would
live as his priests,

178
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,958
must want for neither
children nor friends,

179
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,083
and live their lives alone.

180
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:26,416
[SHIKIBU] I can't play games
with the other children?

181
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,666
[PRIEST A] You must transcend
the desire to do so.

182
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,958
[SHIKIBU] If I live as a priest,
I can't have friends?

183
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:35,708
[PRIEST A] You must live
without wishing for them.

184
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,666
[PRIEST A]
There is peace in solitude.

185
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,083
Wander the world alone,
like a rhinoceros.

186
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,875
Endlessly repeat
those words in your heart,

187
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,875
and you may one day
attain enlightenment.

188

[SHIKIBU whimpers, sobs]

189
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,666

[HACHISU
"Wander the world alone"?

192
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,666
What point is there in letting
those words rule your life?

193
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,125
[HACHISU] You want
to live in this world,

194
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,666
and with everyone
in it, don't you?

195
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,708
You swore to
protect our leaders.

196
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,375
If someone
tries to kill one of us,

197
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,000
you have to end them.
That's all there is to it.

198
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:44,500
Which means, whether
you're being punished or not,

199
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,125
there's no sense
being worried about it.

200
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,791
We have a job to do,
plain and simple.

201
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,958
It shames me to say,
but I must leave things to you.

202
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,875
Don't forget, I have my
own magic to keep me safe.

Coming in waves...

00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:14,333
Tearing me apart!

209
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,041
I can't take it!

210
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,250
Breathe! Tell me!

Right here?

What is it?

00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,333
You're in pain.

216
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,166
I don't want to
disgust you, with my body.

217
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,458
[SHIKIBU]
Because I'm... a monster...

...just like he said.

219

[HACHISU]
Would you just tell me?

220
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,083

So you must be Hibiki.

We've been apart for so long.

00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:58,625
But I could always
feel your spirit.

239
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,916
And so...

240
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,750
...I thought I didn't need
to see you anymore.

241
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:03,791
But...

[HIBIKI] You came to fight
the Joujinshuu, didn't you?

So, let's face them together!

[HIBIKI] Hachisu thinks,
that if you and I can combine

245
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:19,125
our powers, we could
do incredible things!

246
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,500
[HACHISU]
I understand.

247
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,958
I was told to become
a great kunoichi.

248
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,125
To sharpen my skills for
the glory of our clan,

249
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,666
and for the sake of our leader.

250
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,625
I tried so hard, but I failed.

251
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,041
None of it seemed
to work at all.

252
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,041
I wasn't good at any of the
techniques I was taught.

253
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,916
So this became
all I could rely on.

254
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,833
But, if I can still
see the job done,

255
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,125
it isn't anybody's
business how I do it, is it?

256
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,166
Because it's all
I can hope to do.

257
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,916
And so, the way I see it.

258
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,208
It's all do or die.

259
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,250
And the things that other
people say, shouldn't dictate

00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,250
how you choose
to lead your life.

his blade was true...

You'll find killing me isn't
such an easy thing, monster.

[SHIKIBU]
You're right. I've always known.

It's never easy being
forced to kill anyone!

will punish me, again?
