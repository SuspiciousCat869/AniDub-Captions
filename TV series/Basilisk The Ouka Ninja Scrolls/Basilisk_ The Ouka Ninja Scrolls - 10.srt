No, I'm quite all right.

How did you learn to do that?

I am Namenba of Otoshi.

A ninja in service
of the Iga Clan.

It's useless!

The most likely scenario
is that Suruga- <i>sama</i>

Take your leave at once,
and tell Hadaebou everything.

[SAIZOU] Those soldiers

[SHICHIGEN] I doubt even
Joujin could withstand a barrage

from that kind of firepower.

Right. Perhaps there will
be nothing left for us to do.

Perhaps, but I
wouldn't get my hopes up.

Such rotten luck.

Someone you know?

00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,791
We've just recently
formed a close friendship.

Isn't that right,
Namenba- <i>dono</i> ?

Sure, fine, that's
a creative way of looking at it.

40
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,250
So? What do you want?

41
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,416
I have come to ask you

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,208
if you'll help us capture
the fortress Murakumo.

Murakumo?

That castle on
the other side of the river.

I believe you know
of which I speak.

46
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,833
Well. You seem to be aware

47
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:15,791
of everything that's been
happening, but who are you,

48
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,583
and why should we care?

49
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,041
If you've come here
to ask us for a favor,

50
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,708
you can start off by
telling us who you really are,

51
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,583
and then ask politely.

52
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:27,125
I apologize for
being so bullheaded,

One of Tenkai's dogs.

00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,708
You've come
because you're trying

00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:41,166
to use us again, aren't you?

I fear you
misunderstand, my lady.

[HIBIKI sighs]

00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,041
It's true.

64
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,791
And if someone doesn't
step up to stop Joujin,

65
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,291
a terrifying demon king
will be revived,

and the nation will be
plunged into civil war.

This demon is Nobunaga?

That is quite a plan.

00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,375
[HADAEBOU] And if this fiendish
scheme is successful.

They'll use him to turn
our world into a living hell.

To put it simply,

00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,958
this plan must never
come to fruition.

If you really want
something done about it,

74

then why don't you try getting
your own hands dirty?

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,958
[HADAEBOU]
We work from behind the scenes,

76
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,208
and have no real
power of our own.

77
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,500
Frankly, we're far better
suited to espionage.

78
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,791
We'd, of course,
be willing to share

79
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,583
all the information
we've collected with

While you hide in the shadows
protecting your own skin.

That's what you're
really saying, is it not?

00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,583
[SHICHIGEN]
She's right.

86

Listen, Hadaebou, it doesn't
matter what you say,

we will never be
your pawns again.

Very well, then. It seems
giving you time to think

it over would be in
everyone's best interest.

I shall return to you later,

00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,958
and I hope to receive a
favorable answer when I do.

94
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,333
Now.

95
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,375

I don't much care for that guy.

could you come help me

100
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,375
with repairs to the Ashura?

101
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,125
So I have to ask where
did you find the inspiration

102
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,791
for a name like "Ashura"?

103
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,416
[GORONE] That's the name of the
god who fought Taishakuten.

104
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,166
[NAMENBA]
I see.

105
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,333
So about what Hadaebou
was alluding to.

106
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,708
[GORONE]
That the civil wars would return

107
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,291
if we didn't help him?

108
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,958
I wouldn't mind so much.

109
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:10,000
At least then, the ninja would
be given a purpose again.

110
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you serious?

111
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,625
[GORONE] It's what you
wanted, too, remember?

112
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:19,875
And besides, those of our number
who perished must be avenged.

113
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,875
[sighs]
You're right, but still...

114
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,375
They're planning
to bring back Nobunaga.

115
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,708
Do you really
think it's possible?

116
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,625
The man died ages ago.

117
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,083
So how could he come back?

118
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,833
Honestly, I don't have a clue.

119
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:42,666
Anyway. There's no use in
us staring at each other here.

120
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,958
[SHICHIGEN] Hold on. Where
do you think you're going?

121
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,208
The battle between
the Kishuu army and Murakumo

122

is starting soon.

00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,583
I want to watch, and see
who comes out the victor.

124
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,083
I'll be going with you.

[RUI]
Me, too.

126
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,625
Rui, you should
stay here with Hibiki.

127
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,041
Just in case Hadaebou
makes another visit.

128
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,958
That monk is not to be trusted.

129
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,833
Fine. I'll stay.

130
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,375
I'll have you know,
my thoughts haven't changed.

131
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,958
If their intention is to drag
you into an insane battle,

132
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,916
I'll drive them off
with my power.

133
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,000
[SHIKIBU]
Hey, is it okay if I eat this?

Hmm? Sure, why not.

If you hang around the

scared to come by!

Look! We're done for!

of cannons imported from

no need to be worried, my lord.

The cannons fielded
by the forces of Kishuu,

154
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,333
are little more than toys,
and no cause for concern.

How so?

Simple.

compared to the cannons

[GORONE] I made this based
on Utsutsu's drawings.

220
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,666
Now. The fortress of Murakumo

221
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,625
is surrounded on every side by
ninja soldiers called the Rain.

00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,291
[GORONE]
And here's the plan:

223
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,083
Shichigen and Rui will go around
to the opposite side,

224
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,250
and draw them away.

Why is my paper figure naked?

00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,833

is really quite remarkable.

228
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,250
The guards distracted,

229
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,166
Saizou, Utsutsu,
and Shikibu will move in,

230
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,291
and take out Murakumo's cannons.

231
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,000
They'll throw explosives
into the cannon ports.

232
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,708
The fortress' structure
suggests that they keep

233
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,833
their gunpowder stores
directly behind the cannons.

234
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,250

That way, if any
problems crop up,

you can give everyone
the signal to retreat.

[UNKNOWN MAN snarls]

317
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:45,500
[NARRATOR] Renouncing violence
against all living things.

00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:49,125
Harming not a single one.
With no wish for offspring.

00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:51,833
How then, can you wish
for a companion?

It is your destiny to wander
alone, like a rhinoceros.
