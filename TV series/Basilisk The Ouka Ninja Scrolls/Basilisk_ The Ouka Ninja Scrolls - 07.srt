1
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,375
It was uncouth, I know.

2
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:32,500
Please forgive my rude behavior,
but it was necessary

3
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:34,500
to put your skills to the test.

4
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,083
I come with a request.

5
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,166
The Suruga Dainagon himself
wishes to have a word with you.

6
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,583
[NAMENBA] Suruga- <i>sama</i>
was sent to Kouzuke?

7
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:03,833
Are you certain?

8
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,916
[GORONE]
That's the story going around.

9
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,708
Forced exile at Kofu
apparently wasn't harsh enough

10
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,833
for the shogun.

11
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,750
Iemitsu said that?

12
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,333
The rumors of their
animosity are widespread.

13
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,500
So it all sounds
perfectly believable.

14
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:20,875
Stop that.

15
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,375
Yawns are contagious,
and I'm trying to think

16
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:24,458
things through here.

17
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,750
Two brothers
who hate each other.

18
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,833
It's such a tragic story.

19
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,958
[GORONE] The destiny tying
them together is powerful.

20
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,666
It's possible what happened
to us was linked to them.

21
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,833
[gasps]

22
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,625
Or rather, likely.

23
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:40,833
I've been dwelling
on the implications

24
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,500
for some time myself.

25
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,875
When Gei'in sent
that final message.

26
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,333
He warned us that four of the
Five Treasures had been attacked

27
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,833
by the Kurokuwa
and the Joujinshuu.

28
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:55,666
The Kurokuwa are
servants of the shogun himself.

29
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,625
They attacked Suruga- <i>sama</i>
without provocation.

30
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,166
Which means...

31
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,791
No. That can't be!

32
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,333
The Kurokuwa
must've acted under

33
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,333
the shogun's direct orders.

34
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,416
Which is a rational
conclusion that Suruga- <i>sama</i>

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,166
might have come to.

36
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,666
No, he almost certainly
has arrived at that conclusion.

37
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,166
[NAMENBA sighs]

38
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,583
Yes.

39
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,166
The fact that it's so obvious
has me worried as well.

40
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,125
Perhaps that was the intention,
to make him believe he was

41
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,791
targeted, thus forcing his
hand to move for evil, right?

42
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,750
[NAMENBA]
"Evil"? What do you mean?

43
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,541
Treason, for example.

44
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,166
If he entertained even the
slightest idea of fomenting

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,166
a rebellion, that would provide
the shogun an excuse

46
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,541
to crush his rival
without mercy.

47
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,125
And so...

48
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,541
He'd have him killed?

49
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,750
[GORONE chuckles] I'd like to
think the man in charge

50
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,375
would never go that far.

51
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,375
However, if it was actually
Joujin behind everything...

52
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,125
[gasps]

53
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,125
[GORONE] It wouldn't be
a difficult task for a man

54
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,416
of his abilities to gain
control of the Kurokuwa.

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,833
 
And so I wonder...

56
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,458
Did he and the shogun
have a connection

57
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,458
that we haven't yet discovered?

58
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,375
If we figured out that link,
we could narrow down

59
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,791
the possible moves the
Joujinshuu might make next.

60
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,541
[NAMENBA]
Then we should ask the shogun.

61
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,291
[GORONE]
It isn't quite that easy.

62
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,208
If you want
to get into Edo castle,

63
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,250
I have a plan that
just might work.

64
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,583
[GORONE gasps]

65
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,416
[KUROKUWA A] Intruder. We, the
Kurokuwa of Iga will defeat you.

66
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
[KUROKUWA A] Were you trying
to sever some invisible threads?

67
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,208
[NAMENBA pants]

68
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,666
Your lordship, a message.

69
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,750
The Kurokuwa have returned
to serve you once again.

70
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,291
You mean the ninjas?

71
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,666
What do they have
to do with anything?

72
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,791
Have you forgotten, my lord?

73
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,041
You ordered them to delay
your brother's travels.

74
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,458
A mission your loyal
servants deftly performed.

75
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,791
My brother? Tadanaga?

76
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,000
Why delay him? How strange.

77
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,583
It's a mistake.

78
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,666
[NAMENBA] And do you have
any messages to relay

79
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,750
to Joujin- <i>dono</i> , my lord?

80
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,791
Who is that? I don't know him.

81
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,666
Farewell, your lordship.

82
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,750
Now close your eyes, and forget
about this conversation,

83
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,083
and descend into
a peaceful slumber.

84
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,000
Intruder! My lord!

85
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,291
Are you all right?!

86
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,916
[snarls]

87
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,625
[BOTH growl]

88
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,958
[FEMALE GUARD A]
Intruder! Everyone, after them!

89
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,750
[FEMALE GUARD B]
My lord, please wake up!

90
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,750
[gasps]

91
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,375
[HADAEBOU] It seems
you've wasted your time.

92
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,000
I think it's in both
our best interests to keep

93
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,041
the noise to a minimum.

94
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,583
Was that your handiwork
back there, as well?

95
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,083
It's a true pleasure
to meet you.

96
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:35,208
Greetings,
Namenba- <i>dono</i> , of the Iga.

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,291
[HIBIKI]
Houren?

98
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,916
[RUI] Gorone said there
was something about it

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
that reminded him of one.

100
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,791
What is it, this "houren"?

101
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,833
It's a special carriage that
the emperor rides in.

102
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:25,375
But... that thing looks
more like a castle.

103
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,166
I wonder if
it's Portuguese? Huh.

104
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,541
You think so?
It doesn't look it.

105
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,791
But it's been great for
bringing the customers in.

106
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,291
Since it appeared three
days ago, our sales numbers

107
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,791
have been higher than normal!

108
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,000
[HACHISU]
But who's in there?

109
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,666
That's my question.

110
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,500
It's the Joujinshuu.

111
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,000
[GIRLS gasp]

112
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,625
Impossible. You think
they made that thing?

113
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,083
I can't be certain. But still...

114
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,625
I feel something
dark emanating from it.

115
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,250
Something "dark"?

116
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,541
[HIBIKI] It's the same feeling I
had when they last appeared.

117
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,541
If that's the case,
we should probably do

118
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,708
something other
than just stare at it.

119
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,166
If things are really this bad,
shouldn't we go and inform

120
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,750
the boys of what's happening?

121
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,250
No. There's no point.

122
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,541
They're gone. All of them.

123
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,583
Really?

124
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,416
They're gone? Where to?

125
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,333
How am I s'posed to know?

126
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,833
Fine, we'll do it alone--

127
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:23,625
[HIBIKI] Not yet. It may
all be in my imagination.

128
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,500
Perhaps so.

129
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,333
If it is an enemy castle,
we should wait

130
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,625
for Namenba before we rush in.

131
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,708
But she isn't here now. So...

132
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,041
So we wait.

133
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,541
She'll be back before the
cherry blossoms bloom.

134
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,375
Yes, but--

135
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,250
That wasn't a wish,

136
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,958
it was an order
from me, your leader.

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,416
[HIBIKI sighs]

138
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,166
[TADANAGA] Excellent. I see
you received my message.

139
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,083
[HACHIROU]
Yes.

140
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,083
[TADANAGA] Please,
make yourself comfortable.

141
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,500
I no longer hold any territory,

142
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,166
nor do I have any
title to my name.

143
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,875
Do you know why
I've summoned you here?

144
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,833
Did Hadaebou tell you anything?

145
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,208
No.

146
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,083
I come as the former leader
of the Five Treasures.

147
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,708
I'm here to uphold my duty.

148
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,375
"Former leader."

149
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,958
I'm sorry about what
happened to them.

150
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,458
[HACHIROU] Is that not
the function of the ninja?

151
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,125
[TADANAGA]
Indeed.

152
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:54,000
You've heard of the one called
"Joujin," have you not?

153
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,583
I know of him.

154
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,000
He orchestrated the strike
against our clans.

155
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,916
When it happened--

156
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,375
when Joujin defeated
the Five Treasures--

157
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,125
I was there to bear witness.

158
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes. I am aware of that.

159
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,083
As I'd expect,

160
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:14,208
they came and the Five Treasures
were slaughtered before me.

161
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:16,125
They brought the
Five Flowers' heads.

162
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:19,333
They wanted to show me the true
extent of their capabilities.

163
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,333
Do you understand?

164
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:26,500
I cannot imagine a better way
to demonstrate our power.

165
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,166
Joujin had me at his mercy,
and through coercion,

166
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,208
he pushed me to do something
I never wanted to do.

167
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,208
Have you heard
the troubling stories?

168
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,750
What?

169
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,208
[TADANAGA] The rumors that
this monstrosity was recently

170
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,041
sighted near Kinokawa?

171
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,458
Joujin has dubbed
this abomination "Murakumo."

172
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,750
You going?

173
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,583
Hush. Maybe try not
to say it so loud.

174
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,083
I hate not knowing about it.

175
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,375
Don't you?

176
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,833
What's in there?

177
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,208
You, too.

178
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,875
We should definitely go and do
a little on-site investigating,

179
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,916
and if we learn it has nothing
to do with the Joujinshuu,

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,750
then that's the end of it.

181
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,000
Hibiki specifically said not to!

182
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,250
So we make sure
we aren't gone too long.

183
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,875
Besides, it'll be better
for Hibiki if we do it.

184
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,458
We can get rid of
the uncertainty,

185
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:25,083
and she won't have to
take the risk herself.

186
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,250
[TADANAGA] Why not offer an
imperial carriage to Mount Kouya

187
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,625
in loving memory of my mother?

188
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,750
That was Joujin's suggestion,

189
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,708
and I gave him a great sum
of money to see it done.

190
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,083
I wanted to do
something to honor her.

191
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,041
This was several years ago.

192
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,208
I'd lost track of
the project, in all honesty.

193
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,458
But...

194
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,375
But now this shows up.

195
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,458
Does that thing look

196
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,333
like a damned imperial
carriage to you?

197
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,375
It's not an homage,
it's a castle!

198
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,500
And what's worse,
they constructed this eye-sore

199
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,416
during my father's
mourning period!

200
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,333
That's like rubbing salt
in an open wound!

201
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:05,291
[HACHIROU] What could possess
Joujin to build such a thing?

202
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,083
[TADANAGA] I wondered
the same. I've no idea.

203
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,000
But a full-fledged
castle was constructed

204
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,833
without the knowledge
of the shogunate.

205
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,791
And I, I footed the bill to pay
for it without ever realizing.

206
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,916
If word of this gets out,
what am I to do?

207
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
Joujin slaughtered
the warriors of the Five Flowers

208
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,416
and the Five Treasures,

209
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,208
all to raise money for
an imperial carriage?

210
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,666
They died... for that?

211
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,083
Wait. What're you trying to say?

212
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,625
[gasps]

213
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,250
I almost forgot.

214
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:44,958
Looking upon you as an enemy,
is to commit suicide.

215
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,625
[HACHIROU] I wouldn't dare use
my technique against my lord.

216
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,208
I should've known.

217
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,083
I guess there's
no hiding it from you.

218
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,416
I'll just say it.

219
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,375
You and I are alone here.

220
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,208
So please be discreet.

221
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,541
Because everything
I'm going to pass along to you

222
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,250
cannot leave this room.
Understood?

223
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,916
[HACHIROU]
As you wish, my lord.

224
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,833
[SAIZOU]
You two are all alone, huh?

225
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,000
This lord's a liar.

226
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,750
[TADANAGA] It's true.
Joujin wanted something more.

227
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,166
He encouraged me
to rebel against

228
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,125
my brother Iemitsu, the shogun.

229
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,500
[SAIZOU gasps]

230
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,083
He promised me that
he would keep my mother alive

231
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,000
if I complied with his wishes.

232
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,083
[JOUJIN]
Listen.

233
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,125
Unless the forest
itself is moved,

234
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,750
then failure is
impossible, Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

235
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,625
But he'd been
deceiving me all along!

236
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,833
My ailing mother's health
improved for a time thereafter.

237
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:06,833
[TADANAGA] But less than
six months later, she...

238
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,375
And then... the forest!

239
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:10,958
The forest?

240
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,666
The accursed
forest began to move!

241
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,750
[TADANAGA]
Two years ago,

242
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,583
I went to inspect my territory,
and was resting from

243
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,791
my travels at Sengen Shrine.

244
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:37,041
[TADANAGA] I was exhausted
from my time on the road,

245
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,291
and lost in a dream-like haze.

246
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,375
[TADANAGA gasps]

247
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,500
[TADANAGA] The forest
surrounding the shrine.

248
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,708
[gasps]

249
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,291
[HACHIROU]
It moved?

250
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,541
[TADANAGA]
Indeed!

251
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,875
It not only moved,
it lunged right at me!

252
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,750
[TADANAGA] Impossible.
The forest can't be moving!

253
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:09,916
[SOLDIER A]
My lord!

254
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,541
[MONKEYS screeching]

255
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,500
[SOLDIER A]
Monkeys! They're monkeys!

256
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,458
Monkeys? But why?

257
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,916
[SOLDIERS screaming]

258
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,208
We have to get you to safety!

259
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:21,875
Damn you, monkeys!

260
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,375
Lord...

261
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,375
[TADANAGA] You think some
lice-eating, screeching beasts

262
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,166
like you can mock the
Dainagon of Suruga?

263
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,958
My lord?

264
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,125
Kill them all! Open volley!

265
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,041
Suruga- <i>sama</i> , don't be hasty!

266
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,291
The legends say these
monkeys are holy creatures!

267
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,208
They're messengers
straight from the gods!

268
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,708
[TADANAGA]
I don't care! It must not move.

269
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,250
I can't afford to let it move!

270
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,000
[SOLDIER A]
My lord!

271
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,250
[TADANAGA snarls]

272
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,208
[TADANAGA] I wouldn't fault you,
if you were to laugh at me.

273
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,500
Joujin told me that
victory was certain,

274
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,333
unless the forest
itself were to move.

275
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,875
But that night, it started
moving all on its own!

276
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,208
Surely this must be
Heaven's punishment!

277
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:07,500
And he...

278
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,041
The monk, Joujin...

279
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,250
The man is a demon, more likely.

280
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:14,666
I was a fool to listen to him,
and on my honor,

281
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,250
I can never be
such a fool again!

282
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,916
Hachirou... will you help?

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,125
Go, destroy the castle Murakumo!

284
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,375
Bring death down
upon the Joujinshuu!

285
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,958
And after, burn their
fortress to the ground!

286
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,750
You wouldn't just
be doing it for me,

287
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,833
but for the Tokugawa!
And for the safety of Japan!

288
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,333
I refuse your task.

289
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,000
You... do?

290
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,541
[HACHIROU] My lord,
you will not be able to take

291
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,416
advantage of us any further.

292
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,416
I won't.

293
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,916
The cheek!
What did you just say?

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,791
[HACHIROU]
Do you remember?

295
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,000
When you were still a child,
many of the finest ninjas

296
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,083
from both clans--

297
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,041
They died for no better reason
than to determine

298
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,291
the next heir of
the Tokugawa line

299
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,625
And yet, that is not all.

300
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,166
The Five Treasures
and the Five Flowers--

301
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,833
Every one of them slain,
because of you.

302
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,791
A fool who thought
only of treason.

303
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,583
And then there were
the young ninjas in training,

304
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,458
who were nearly killed as well.

305
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,125
We refuse to sacrifice
ourselves anymore,

306
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,708

for the likes of the Tokugawa!

307
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,500
"For The likes of
the Tokugawa"? Bastard!

308
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,083
How dare you say that!

309
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,791
And after I've deigned to share
my deepest thoughts with you?

310
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,708
Inexcusable! You dog!

00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,416

[HACHIROU]
Saizou?

323
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,208
Were you surprised, Hachirou?

324
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,833
I've been refining my
techniques over the years.

325
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,500
I like to call this
one "Hundred Eyes."

[MEN wail]

327
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,416
You useless fool!
He's right over there!

328
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,291
[HACHIROU]
Will you still fight?

329

[TADANAGA gasps]

330
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,625
Stop, or you will suffer.

331
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,250
My lord, if we
allow him to leave,

332
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,916
then the shogunate
may discover everything

333
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,208
you discussed with him!

334
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:04,625
That's true,
and we cannot allow that!

335
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,875
Bring him down. Kill him.

336
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,791
Kill him!

[NARRATOR] The evil castle
spoken of in rumors

00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,791
called "Murakumo."

339
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:48,000
It stands in the forest,
tall and dark.

340
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,458
As the women seek
to reveal its mysteries,

341
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:53,500
the men go into action
for the sake of their master.

342
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,375
And now, everything
is beginning to move.
