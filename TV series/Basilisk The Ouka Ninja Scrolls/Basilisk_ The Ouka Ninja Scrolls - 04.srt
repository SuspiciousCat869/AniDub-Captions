1
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,666
Come on out!

2
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,333
I know you're here,
so there's no use hiding.

3
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,250
[ITARU]
One's whole world is naught

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,291
but the tumbling of the dice.

5
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,458
[ITARU]
They roll and scatter.

6
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,041
A woman?

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,583
[ITARU]
One stirs in slumber.

8
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:57,250
We dub this fitful dream "life."

9
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,958
But death wakes us all.

10
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,375
Well, miss, that was
quite an interesting poem.

11
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,833
Oh, my!
Why give so... generously?

12
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,666
It's only enough
to cover your fare across

13
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,000
the Sanzu River.

14
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,375
Well now,
what an odd thing to say.

15
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,125
Why would I need
to cross the Sanzu River?

16
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,125
[HOUETSU] Your pretty
face doesn't fool me.

17
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:24,291
I know right away when someone
breaks my root barrier.

18
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,791
It's the impregnable
defense system

19
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,875
of the Five Flowers of Iga.

20
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,625
There's no escape once crossed,
no matter who you are.

21
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,708
So you have
power over the roots?

22
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,375
Then you are the one called
Tsuta Houestsu- <i>sama</i> .

23
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:39,000
And you're just
a sneaky little fox

24
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:41,625
looking for the lay of the land.
Your name?

25
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,916
I shall share
my name with you

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,250
as a gift before your death.
I am Yasha Itaru.

27
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,958
Stop, you're making me laugh!

28
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,500
I'm not the one who'll be
needing the funerary gift,

29
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,791
thanks, because you're
already as good as dead

30
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,166
and don't even realize it!

31
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,333
Enough talking!

32
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,750
Feel my ninja technique,
Root Lasso!

33
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,458
You're unable to move now.

34
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,083
How unfortunate for you!

35
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,583
I wonder, what are
we going to do with

36
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,916
an interloper like yourself?

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,041
Hmm...?

38
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:55,125
[HOUETSU] After all, killing
someone so pretty too quickly.

39
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,541
[HOUETSU]
That would be a real shame.

40
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,791
[HOUETSU chuckles]

41
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,250
[HOUETSU]
Heh.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,791
[ITARU]
How disgusting.

43
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,458
As a member of
the Five Flowers of Iga,

44
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,000
are you not ashamed
to behave in such a way?

45
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,666
Can you bear to see your
true reflection in the mirror?

46
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,875
The mirror?

47
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,583
[HOUETSU gasps]

48
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:31,958
[HOUETSU gasps]

49
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,875
[HOUETSU gasps]

50
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,416
[HOUETSU gasps]

51
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,666
[ITARU]
What's wrong?

52
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,083
Did you see your own
pathetic excuse for a life

53
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,500
reflected back into your face?

54
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,041
A meaningless, shallow
existence, devoid of any joy.

55
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,666
And self-loathing
masquerading as pride.

56
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,083
--[HOUETSU whimpers]
--I understand that.

57
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,416
The despair that
makes you long for death.

58
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,625
[HOUETSU whimpers]

59
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,000
[ITARU]
If that's the case...

60
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:08,916
[HOUETSU whimpers]

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,416
[ITARU chuckles]

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,458
[HOUETSU wails]

63
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,083
[ITARU] ...fall from this cliff,
and meet your end!

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,916
[ITARU] Once you've
stared into my mirror,

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,333
you will have borne witness to
the absolute futility of life.

66
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:32,166
No one can escape the gasp of
my Destiny's Passage technique.

67
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,250
[JOUJIN]
Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

68
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,458
Do you really not
remember me, my lord?

69
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,125
[TADANAGA whimpers]

70
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,958
[JOUJIN] Of course, it has been
many years since we first met.

71
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,000
When you were still but a child,
as was your elder brother,

72
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,166
Lord Iemitsu, who was
stricken down with

73
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,125
a debilitating case of the pox.

74
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,833
When your father
summoned the great priest

75
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,583
Tenkai to say prayers
for your brother,

76
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,750
I accompanied him,
as part of his retinue.

77
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,041
[TADANAGA]
That's right.

78
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,791
I remember being there.
Watching him.

79
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,541
I was just a boy back then.

80
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:23,041
Why would you seek me out now
with these wild allegations?

81
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,583
[JOUJIN]
You misunderstand, my lord.

82
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,666
Those word are my regurgitation
of what I heard you say yourself

83
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,041
on that occaision.

84
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,500
Is that so?

85
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,708
What did you hear me say?

86
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,208
[JOUJIN] "Someday, my brother
will see me as a threat

87
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,000
to his reign, and will use
his power to slay me,"

88
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,833
my lord.

89
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,375
[TADANAGA]
Stop! That's enough!

90
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,208
You're speaking utter nonsense!

91
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,000
You lie...
I would never say such things!

92
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,166
[JOUJIN]
Magoroku.

93
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,083
[MAGOROKU]
Sir.

94
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,208
[TADANAGA gasps]

95
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,791
I am Kujaku Tsuibamu,
Your Highness.

96
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,458
And I am Rinne
Magoroku, Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

97
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,750
[JOUJIN]
We've no choice.

98
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,833
Begin your technique, Magoroku.

99
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,041
[MAGOROKU] Are you certain
of that, Joujin- <i>sama</i> ?

100
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,458
[JOUJIN]
You heard me.

101
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:14,333
The past is cloudy,
and Suruga- <i>sama</i> needs

102
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,166
our help remembering it.

103
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,458
[MAGOROKU]
As you wish.

104
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,708
[TADANAGA whimpers]

105
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,833
Nobo akyasha kyarabaya.

106
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,458
Nobo akyasha kyarabaya

107
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:53,291
Nobo akyasha kyarabaya.
Nobo akyasha kyarabaya.

108
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,708
On arikya mari bori sowaka.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,375
What is this place?

110
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,250
[JOUJIN] What Rinne Magoroku
has manifested here for us

111
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,708
is known as Akyashagaruba.

112
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,166
We're in the ethereal realm
of Kokuzo Bosatsu.

113
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,666
[KUJAKU] The original meaning
of the word "akyasha"

114
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,291
was translated as "void",
and "garuba" meant "womb."

115
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,875
To describe it other words,

116
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,541
the source from which
everything is born.

117
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,583
One could even say that
Kokuzo Bosatsu himself, is as

118
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,666
infinite as the ever yawning
expanse of the great void.

119
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,291
This is his own universe.
This is his own spacetime.

120
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,958
His universe?

121
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:47,375
Behold the raw scope of
Rinne Magoroku's finest talent.

122
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,416
His manifestation
of Kokuzo Bosatsu.

123
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,041
He calls it the
Adamantite Tower.

124
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,208
[RUI]
A question for me?

125
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:15,625
[SHICHIGEN]
Yes.

126
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,791
[SHICHIGEN]
I was wondering...

127
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,291
How much do you know about men?

128
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:22,791
[RUI]
What do I know?

129
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,208
Men are brutish,
selfish, and they stink.

130
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,083
No, that isn't what I meant.

131
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,916
I want you to tell me how much
you know about men's bodies.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,166
[growls]
What're you asking me?

133
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,875
[SHICHIGEN]
It's about our skills.

134
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,375
Your talents and mine
are very similar.

135
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,208
I heard your technique
involves summoning insects.

136
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,791
[SHICHIGEN]
That's one element.

137
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,000
You've heard that this power
goes well beyond that.

138
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,708
Haven't you?

139
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,625
This same power, when honed,

140
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,458
lets me seduce women
to do my will.

141
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:52,583
And your skill means
that you could...

142
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,541
[RUI] Well, you don't know
anything about women.

143
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,708
So keep practicing.

144
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,041
[SHICHIGEN]
No.

145
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,166
I'm not really that interested
in girls, frankly.

146
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,791
[KAREHA]
Houetsu!

147
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:07,958
Houetsu!

148
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,958
[KAREHA]
Shuugetsu. Izuma.

149
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,291
Have you found him?

150
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,166
I haven't, but I know
I heard him scream.

151
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,000
[KAREHA]
No, that's impossible!

152
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,166
He couldn't have been
defeated so quickly.

153
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,958
Find him!

154
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,166
[gasps]

155
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,166
[NEIRICHIOU] Perhaps
I could be of assistance.

156
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,875
Is this the man you
gentlemen are looking for?

157
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,333
[NEIRICHIOU]
Am I mistaken?

158

You wish to know my name?

It's a difficult one for

Neirichiou? I won't forget that.

But, I only need to hold
onto it for a short while.

Actually, just long
enough for me

What a compassionate
thing to do!

Offering to dig a grave

You are walking backwards,

retracing the

The past?
What are you talking about?

00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,375
For many years now,
you have envisioned

your demise by your

first occurred to you.

The first time you
sensed his malice,

199

and realized the threat
to your own future.

200
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:27,375
[KUJAKU] My personal skill,
the Inverted Halberd of Time,

201
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,083
allows me to turn the gears
of time backwards at a whim.

202
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,208
If the sands of time
in my hourglass were scattered,

203
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,000
there's no telling
how far we'd be able to go.

Don't worry.

As long as the sands of time

he can only travel back
a short distance.

208
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,958
Moreover, the focused
power of this place is acting

209
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,000
as a magnifier, taking us
further back in the timeline

210
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,166
than we could outside of it.

No. It was no dream, my lord.

You witnessed it all
with your own two eyes.

The child Takechiyo,
now Iemitsu- <i>sama</i> ,

has never forgotten that moment.

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,166
When he, the child
destined to be the next leader

246
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,333
was lying helpless
at death's door,

00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:02,541
you were at his bedside.
The very picture of vitality.

[TADANAGA whimpers]

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,458
[JOUJIN] The harsh feelings
your older brother began

250
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,000
harboring toward you,
they were rooted in

251
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,583
the same bitter jealousy
the sick and infirm have

252
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,750
for the wealth and insouciance
of the able-bodied.

253
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,000
[JOUJIN]
That is impossible to change.

254
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,375
I was... just a boy.

255
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,625
The only thing I cared about
back then was praying for

256
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,458
the swiftness of
my brother's recovery.

257
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:26,916
[JOUJIN] I'm afraid
your personal thoughts

258
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
on the matter are irrelevant.

259
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,875
What's of most consequence,

260
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,166
was the look on your
face at the time.

261
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,125
In your healthy visage,
your brother saw in you

262
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,208
the joy and ambition of the
one who would replace him as

263
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,750
the next shogun of the
Tokugawa line.

You just witnessed it yourself,

266
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,000
did you not, Suruga- <i>sama</i> ?

267

[rasps]

269
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,000
[TADANAGA]
No. Even if that were true,

270
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,416
if my brother
really thought that,

271
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,166
even for the briefest moment...

272
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,875
...that should all
be far behind us now!

273
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,208
It's crazy!

274
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,791
There's no need for him to
be jealous of me now--

275
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,375
He's the shogun!

276
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,208
[JOUJIN] Then can you think
of a more plausible reason

277
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,041
for the Kurokuwa to have
hunted you down like that?

278
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,541
[TADANAGA gasps]

279
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:16,375
[JOUJIN] The Kurokuwa of Iga
aren't some roving bandits.

280
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:20,458
Rather, they work directly for
the will of the Shogunate.

281
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,625
So the question
then becomes "why did they

282
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,458
act against the will of
the Suruga Dainagon?"

[JOUJIN]
Yes!

285

You yourself had serious doubts
about what this would mean

286
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,250
for you in the end, and
you choked back the words

287
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:36,875
that began to surface from
the depths of your heart.

288
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,208
That dark thought:

289
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,125
"Has my own brother
sent them here to kill me?"

290

00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,833
Your tone of voice
tells me I'm right.

[TADANAGA whimpers]

295
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,500
[JOUJIN] But then, you've come
to realize this yourself,

296
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,041
haven't you, my lord?

297
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,916
You brother's jealousy
still resides within him!

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And he will do what
he must to be rid of it!

299
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,083
He can't.
No, he wouldn't dare!

instead to rebellion!

00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,000
[BOTH gasp]

314
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,833
[gasps]
Rui!

315
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,791
I see. It's over here, too.

316
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,416
[RUI whimpers]

317
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,416
Are these remains
the Five Flowers of Iga?

318
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,958
Let us pray dearly
that it not be the case.

319
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,500
[JOUJIN]
Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

320
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,791
Unless the forest
itself is moved,

321
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,291
then failure is impossible.

322
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,625
[TADANAGA]
What's that?

323
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:44,208
[JOUJIN] I once heard
a similar story from

324
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,250
the barbarians
several years ago.

325
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,666
And so, in accordance
with the story,

326
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,750
I shall make your lordship
the same promise.

327
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,375
[TADANAGA]
Oh? Really?

328
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,625
What nonsense
are you spewing now?

329
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,875
Who can make the trees
unfix their buried roots?

330
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,125
[JOUJIN]
Indeed. It is impossible.

331
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,250
And that is why I say that
this rebellion cannot fail.

332
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,166
As long as the forest doesn't
suddenly decide to migrate,

333
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,666
then you have nothing to fear...

334
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,083
...Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

335
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,583
[TADANAGA gasps]

336
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,625
[JOUJIN] Become the god
you were destined to be!

337
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,875
[JOUJIN] Ah, yes. It would
seem they have returned.

338
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,083
[TADANAGA gasps]

339
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,333
Who are these men?

340
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,541
[JOUJIN]
Shogyou Kareha.

341
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:39,208
Tsuta Houetsu.

342
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,166
Irootoroe Izuma.

343
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,000
And lastly, Suiren Shuugetsu.

344
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,500
With these four trophies,

345
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:50,333
we have eliminated the bulk
of the Five Flowers of Iga!

346
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,833
Is that so? Who's responsible?

347
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,208
[ITARU]
My name is Yasha Itaru, my lord.

348
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,625
[gasps]

349
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,333
[JOUJIN]
Now, only two remain.

350
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,750
Which two? What do you mean?

351
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,166
The leader of the
Five Treasures of Kouga

352
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,916
who is Kouga Hachirou,

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,125
and the leader of the
Five Flowers of Iga

354
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,958
called Iga Hibiki.

355
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,041
But why would you
want to assassinate them?

356
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,125
I cannot imagine a
better way to demonstrate

357
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,000
the magnitude of our
power, Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

358
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,250
One more thing.

359
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,583
[JOUJIN] We acted out of the
desire to help your mother

360
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:32,250
survive however we could.
She deserves as much.

361
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,166
You would even save my mother?

362
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,666
What are you suggesting?

363
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,041
[SHIKIBU]
I don't like pain.

364
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,583
I wonder if it hurts
when you die...

365
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,208
I hate it. All the aching.

366
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,041
[SHIKIBU]
Death scares me.

367
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,458
Just don't think about it.

368
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,333
[SHIKIBU]
But...

369
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,375
If it was for Hachirou...

370
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,916
Then you would die?

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,958
Yeah...

372
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,833
What if you had
to do it for her?

373
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:06,291
You willing to die for Hibiki?

374
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,000
Would I die for her sake?

375
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,041
No way in hell,
but I would do it for us.

376
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,583
Because we need
Hachirou and Hibiki,

377
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,541
and we will need their
magic to survive.

378
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,458
Without their blood,
our clans are through.

379
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,291
[gasps]
Utsutsu.

380
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,916
Utsutsu!

381
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,125
[grunts]

382
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,708
[UTSUTSU]
What are you hollering about?

383
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,833
[SAIZOU]
Look up. Look at the sky.

384
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:45,166
What? The sky?
What exactly am I looking for?

385
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,583
[SAIZOU]
You mean you can't see it?

386
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,500
Are your eye sockets empty?

387
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,208
No need to be rude!
Besides, you're one to talk!

388
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,791
[SAIZOU]
They're here.

389
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:58,333
No...! It can't be...

390
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,791
What is that...?

391
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,208
[NARRATOR]
Here comes Neirichiou,

392
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,583
one of the Joujinshuu.

393
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:48,375
His skill overwhelms the
young ninjas-in-training.

394
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,625
Adding insult to injury.

395
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,416
And in the face of Joujin,

396
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
will the well of power
within Hachirou begin

397
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,833
to lose its meaning?
