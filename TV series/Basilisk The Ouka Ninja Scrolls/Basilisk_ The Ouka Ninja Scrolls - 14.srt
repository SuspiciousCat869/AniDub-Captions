[HACHIROU]
I've heard enough.

164
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,375
This will be the last
time I make this offer.

165
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,541
Will you join me, or die?

166
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,291
I refuse!

167
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,958
You prideful fool!

[HIBIKI]

[JOUJIN]
Kujaku. Can you hear me?

00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,541
Joujin- <i>sama</i> ?

176
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:44,666
[JOUJIN] Fire the Shiroku cannon
towards the eastern hill.

177
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,791
We'll flush those pests out.

178
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,500
The Shiroku cannon?
Are you certain?

179
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,166
Won't the force of
the blasts kill them?

180
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,083
If it does,
they were never of any value

181
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,166
to us in the first place.

182
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,541
Very well.

183
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,000
[bell rings]

184
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,125
They're shifting
the cannon's direction!

185
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,791
It's turning east.

186
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,125
[SHIKIBU]
It's pointing right at us!

187
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,666
Run along with
the banks of the river,

188
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,791
or else you might get
caught up in a landslide!

Shikibu!

192
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,166
That pillar of light.

193
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,750
Is it the Ouka?

194
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,750
[SAIZOU gasps]

195
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,000
Well.

00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,958

[gasps]

Could it be?

[RUI]
Shichigen, is that...?

201
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,708
It's the Ouka.

[JOUJIN]
Splendid!

204
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,875
I will ask you, once more.

205
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,625
Will you entrust your
great power unto me?

206
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,375
Join us, and we
can take over the world.

207
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,250
[JOUJIN]
Stop it, children.

208
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,000
You have yet to
master this technique.

209
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,125
Without control
there's only danger.

210
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,125
Using it again
could kill you both.

[HACHIROU snarls]

[SHIKIBU groans]

213
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,208
Ugh. So you would choose
to sacrifice your own lives

214
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,125
rather than join me?

I'm beginning to understand

00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,333
with those ninja brats!

[SAIZOU]
I'm counting on you, Utsutsu.

00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:11,666
[UTSUTSU]
Right!

226
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,416
So disappointing.

227
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,083
Of course, they have
no choice but to give up now.

228
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,958
Joujin- <i>sama</i> !

229
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,875
I am unscathed,
no need for you to worry.

230
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,833
Those children,
this is the second time

231
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,250
they've used the Ouka.

232
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,583
But it would appear they
haven't fully mastered it yet.

233
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,416
I trust that
they will, given time.

234
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,458
We'll take them later, when
they've let down their guard.

235
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,583
As you commanded us,
we sent Tenkai's servant,

236
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,333
the monk Hadaebou,
back to his master alive.

237
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,416
Excellent work.

238
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,625
Tenkai will be quite
flustered when he learns

239
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,708
of what has transpired.

240

[TADANAGA]
Joujin!

241
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,750
If Hadaebou was allowed
to leave here alive,

242
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,541
that may as well have
been a declaration of war!

243
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,958
I say we cross the river and
attack while we still have

244
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,875
the element of surprise!

245
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,208
[JOUJIN] There's no need for
such hastiness, my lord!

246
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,250
Strategy is an important
part of warfare.

247
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,375
Our first course of action
should be to cause our foe

248
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,250
to panic, and thus
make mistakes.

249

Yes...

I suppose you're
right about that.

What's become of Kujaku?

he was out playing

on top of the cannon.

Ha! Even after all these years,

255
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,166
he still somehow maintains
the heart of a child.

If this fails, it's all over.

trying the same maneuver?

Just like I thought!

265
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,708
Whenever he uses his
technique, there's a gap

266
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,833
before he can pull it off again!

[NARRATOR] Once more,
the demon begins to grow.

Deep within the tunnel,

278
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:51,375
a memory of his mother.

He sees the truth.
