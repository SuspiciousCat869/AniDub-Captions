1
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,541
[GORONE] The fortress of
Murakumo is surrounded

2
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:36,458
on every side by ninja
soldiers called the Rain.

3
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,458
[GORONE]
And here's the plan.

4
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,208
Shichigen and Rui will go
around to the opposite side,

5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,916
and draw them away.

6
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,083
The guards distracted,

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,083
Saizou, Utsutsu,
and Shikibu will move in

8
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:55,208
and take out the
Murakumo's cannons.

9
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,000
They'll throw explosives
into the cannon ports.

10
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,416
So if it works...

11
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,708
[NAMENBA]
Hachirou is here?

12
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,625
Yes. He rescued
me in the forest.

13
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:04,208
Well, I didn't run
into him, but if you say so.

14
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,750
I believe she did.

15
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,875
Hibiki, do you want
to go along with them?

16
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:11,875
[HIBIKI exhales]

17
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,166
They've already come here once.

18
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,833
So if you want my opinion,
the mission would be safer.

19
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,958
Hachisu, be sure
to bring Gorouza.

20
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,916
Are you certain of that?

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,125
[GORONE]
She raises a valid point.

22
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,250
We can't afford to make the
assumption that it's safe here.

23
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:34,041
We'll use everything
we have at our disposal.

24

[GORONE] Once the new
Saibougu is tuned up, we leave.

Time for us to
move on, Shichigen.

28
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,500
We have to make
our way there soon.

29
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,750
[SHICHIGEN'S MOTHER]
Before autumn comes to an end.

30
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,958
How many?

31
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,333
Seven... Eight... Nine...

There's ten of them,
at the very least.

Just as planned.

35
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,375
We'll draw the Rain
around to the back.

36
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,125
If it works,
I'll give the signal.

37
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,250
Until then...

38
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,708
[SAIZOU]
I understand.

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,291
Shikibu, that sutra
about the rhinoceros

40
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,791
continues beyond what
I've heard you quoting.

41
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,500
[GORONE] "For a sociable person,
there comes affection.

42
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,625
Following on the heels of
this affection, comes pain.

43
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:19,875
Seeing the perils such
affections hold over oneself,

44
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:24,250
instead, wander
alone, like a rhinoceros.

45
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,333
Does that mean...?

46
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,625
[GORONE]
Hmph. The note rings true.

47
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,708
Do you hear it?

48
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,791
It's almost as if
it's referring to the Ouka.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,750
[GORONE]
That technique.

50
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,416
If the two of you were
able to create it,

51
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,250
considering how far
you've both advanced,

52
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,416
you and Hachirou could
change its very nature.

53
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,708
[GORONE] If loving each other,
and caring for one another

54
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,291
were the basis for a powerful
new ninja technique,

55
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,458
then perhaps the Ouka
will bring more

56
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,291
than misery into the world.

57
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,625
[SHICHIGEN]
Can we reach them at this range?

of their position.

The ones who attacked us,
they must have been decoys.

The plan was for
us to lure them out.

Instead, they lured us in.

were waiting for us downwind.

00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,166
Merely a mother traveling

162
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,875
the countryside with
her little boy.

163
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,791
Very well.

164
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:49,458
[yells]

165
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,958
[gasps]

166
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,125
[gasps]

167
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,375
[SHICHIGEN]
I know the truth now.

168
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,083
My father was a ninja.

169
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:40,208
What? Did you just
have a dream or something?

170
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,125
You were unconscious.

171
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,875
I guess so.

172
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,125
Besides.

173
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,000
I heard you were from
a samurai family.

174
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,625
That was what my mother told me.

175
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,125
Let's go.

176
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,333
Right.

177
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,250
[SHICHIGEN] The way she fought,
those were ninja techniques.

178
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,750
She used them fighting
for me that day.

179
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,250
[SHICHIGEN] But in the end, all
I could do was get in her way.

180
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,833
[SHICHIGEN]
Get down!

181
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,708
[RUI]
An ambush?

182
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,875
[SHICHIGEN] So it would seem,
but that's perfect.

183
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,291
Because that means
they're focusing

184
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,125
all of their attention on us,
and so Saizou's group

185
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,208
has gone unnoticed.

186
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,250
We've done
what we set out to do.

187
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,625
How can you act
so calm right now?

188
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,958
They remain upwind,

189
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,166
even though they know we
can smell their gunpowder,

190
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,916
but they won't charge us.

191
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,291
They're too worried
about your technique to try it.

192
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,708
So they'll keep their distance.

193
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,583
We can't rely on
your butterflies.

194
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,958
But I can buy
you some time, at least.

195
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,791
While I do, run!

196
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,208
[RUI gasps]
Shichigen!

197
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,875
[SHICHIGEN] I refuse to let
anyone else pay for my failure!

198
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,250
It won't happen again!

199
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,416
[RUI]
Who's there?

200
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:15,208
You shouldn't
be so hasty, my friend.

201
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,291
Hachirou?

202
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,875
You came just
in time to rescue us!

203
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,166
Does this mean you've decided
to give us a hand?

204
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,458
I have come to
avenge the Five Treasures.

205
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,583
Nothing more than that.

206
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,833
You haven't changed a bit.

207
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,666
Well, whatever the case,

208
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,166
we have to get
through this first.

209
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,333
[HACHIROU] Shichigen,
use your technique to help me.

210
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:40,791
[SHICHIGEN gasps]

211
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,125
[HACHIROU]
At this range, in the darkness.

212
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:49,125
I can't use my eye magic.
I would need to move in closer.

213
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:27,958
[HACHIROU]
And so...

214
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,750
...I'll use the distraction of
the insects you summon

215
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,041
to get near them.

216
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,083
Your eye magic is as
powerful as I remember.

217
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,333
Perhaps even stronger.

218
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,875
As is Shichigen's technique.

219
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,333
His level of mastery
summoning the insects,

220
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,041
few ninja in history
have been so skilled.

221
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,125
I named that technique

222
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,500
"Wind through the Pines."

223
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,916
[SHICHIGEN] The wind that
blows through the pines.

224
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,375
[SHICHIGEN] I know that autumn
can be a painful season.

225
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:42,833
I shall not tire of the sound
of the bell crickets.

226
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,958
[SHICHIGEN]
Though I know.

227
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:53,458
I know that autumn can
be a painful season.

228
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:58,666
I shall not tire of the
sound of the bell crickets.

229
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,458
[SHICHIGEN]
Can you hear it, Mother?

230
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:04,833
Their song? The bell
crickets are still crying.

231
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,916
Now come. We can go together,

232
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,750
[SHICHIGEN]
Because autumn, isn't yet over.

233
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,791
[NARRATOR]
A father risked his very life,

234
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,541
praying his daughter would
master her technique.

235
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:48,875
But the young girl has no way

236
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:52,166
to ever understand
just how he felt.

237
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,916
You would name
this useless technique,

238
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,625
"Dreaming Reality"?
