1
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:40,083
[NOBUNAGA] Fifty years
of a mortal man's life.

2
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:45,500
Pass by in the breadth
of a vivid dream.

3
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:50,750
When held against the
scope of Heaven's history.

4
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,833
[NOBUNAGA]
For once a man is born.

5
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,666
As with all things
in this world.

6
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,125
Mustn't he one day die?

7
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,166
[NAMENBA]
Hachirou. Hibiki.

8
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,375
It's up to the three of us to
make sure the Demon King

9
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,250
doesn't get out of here alive!

10
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,083
Who do you think you are?

11
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,916
You're in the presence
of Oda Nobunaga!

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,583
You should be on your knees,
trembling before me!

13
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,916
Please understand.

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,625
Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> ,
you've just returned from

15
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,000
the land of the dead.

16
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,125
The land of the dead?

17
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,791
Are you trying to
insinuate that I died?

18
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,958
[laughs]

19
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,500
What total nonsense.

20
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,333
I shall never die.

21
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,000
Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> .

22
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,250
Hibiki, stand back!

23
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,458
Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> !

24
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,083
You must stop this at once!

25
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,375
[NOBUNAGA]
Begone!

26
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,291
[HACHIROU]
I will not stand down.

27
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,833
[NOBUNAGA]
Who are you?

28
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,041
Why are you here?

29
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,083
[NOBUNAGA]
Was it Mitsuhide?

30
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:48,375
Did that kumquat head send you
here to try and slow me down?

31
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,458
What an arrogant fool!

32
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:55,125
I'll show him! I'll burn
the monks of Mount Hiei.

33
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,916
I shall conquer China.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,250
And Goa, and Malacca.

35
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,125
They shall all belong to

36
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,541
the Demon King of
the Sixth Heaven!

37
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,208
Don't be fooled, Hachirou!

38
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:11,291
That isn't the real Nobunaga,
that thing is a monster!

39
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,500
[MAGOROKU]
Indeed, for the moment.

40
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,416
But before much longer,
he will fully revive,

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,750
and become the Demon King of
the Sixth Heaven, as planned.

42
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,166
[yells]

43
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,333
Hachirou!

44
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll send you back to Hell!

45
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,458
[HACHIROU]
Die!

46
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,166
[NOBUNAGA]

47
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,458
[HACHIROU]
Forgive me, Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> .

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,708
But the dead must remain dead.

49
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,791
[gasps]

50
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,083
[NOBUNAGA]
Hm?

51
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,541
[gasps]

52
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,583
What just happened to me?

53
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,125
Some kind of <i>yokai</i> 's trick?

54
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,958
Disgusting.

55
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,000
[HIBIKI] There's no blood
flowing in Nobunaga's body.

56
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,541
He's just a puppet.

57
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,208
But it doesn't seem like
anyone's controlling him.

58
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,375
[HIBIKI gasps]

59
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,583
[NAMENBA]
What are you waiting for?

60
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,708
Get back, both of you!

61
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,541
[HIBIKI]
Namenba!

62

[HIBIKI gasps]

64
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,666
That's Hachisu's.

65
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,333
Her Lotus Root Gun.

66
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,750
Namenba.

67
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,125
[HACHIROU]
We need to get out of here.

68
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,500
[HIBIKI]
Mm.

69
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,208
[HIBIKI gasps]

70
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,333
Get behind me, now!

71
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:34,541
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)] That is as
far as you go, Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> .

72
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:40,000
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)] The time
has come, to take my body back.

73
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:43,250
I refuse to remain
the puppet of anybody!

74
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,916
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)]
Without my head.

75
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have no mouth to use
when trying to speak.

76
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,000
So for the time, Lord Nobunaga,
I will borrow yours

77
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,458
to communicate with
the outside world.

78
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,416
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)]
Who is there?

79
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,916
It's hard to see.

80
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,541
What?

81
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:05,541
It is I, Hachirou of
the Kouga clan, Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

82
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,458
[HIBIKI gasps]

83
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,583
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)]
Kouga Hachirou?

84
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,041
Where is Joujin?

85
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,500
That monster?

86
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:17,166
He's already been
removed from this world.

87
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,333
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)]
So what you're saying,

88
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,541
is that Joujin is dead?

89
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:27,333
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA) laughs]

90
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,208
Come, Kouga Hachirou!

91
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:31,625
You laugh, too!

92
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,583
Suruga- <i>sama</i> ?

93
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,458
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)]
Laugh at me.

94
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:40,166
Mock the destiny which led to me
being the toy of mere ninjas.

95
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,041
Go ahead!

96
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,458
[NOBUNAGA groans]

97
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,958
[HIBIKI gasps]

98
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,166
[NOBUNAGA]
You worm!

99
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,166
Out of my way, now!
For I am Oda Nobunaga!

100
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,458
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)] I say unto
you, Demon King Nobunaga- <i>sama</i> .

101
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,833
[NOBUNAGA (TADANAGA)]
That up until the very end,

102
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,750
Tokugawa Tadanaga refuses
to be controlled!

103
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,791
[TADANAGA]
Nobunaga.

104
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,666
I shall return you to the Hell
where that devil Joujin awaits!

105
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,791
[TADANAGA]
Now, mother.

106
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,416
Your darling Tadanaga
will be reunited with you.

107
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,833
We ninjas were
nothing more than pawns

108
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,333
in this game as well.

109
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,041
Hibiki! Let us leave now!

110
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,375
[HIBIKI]
Mm!

111
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,541
[MAGOROKU]
Hmph.

112
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,666
[MAGOROKU] So this is all
that's left of our dream?

113
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,041
[MAGOROKU groans]

114
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,125
[KUJAKU whimpers]

115
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:32,333
We can still go back...
I can fix this, Master...

116
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,625
To how things were...

117
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,750
Forever, my king...

118
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,666
I give you my word...

119
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,791
I want to take
everything back again.

120
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,375
Back through the
corridors of time!

121
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,416
You damned fool.

122
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,916
Who knows what will
happen if you do that?

123
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,416
What is this place?

124
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,458
[KUJAKU] His manifestation
of Kokuzo Bosatsu.

125
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,208
He calls it the
Adamanitite Tower.

126
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,333
[KUJAKU] My personal skill,
the Inverted Halberd of Time,

127
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:09,208
allows me to turn the gears
of time backwards at a whim.

128
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,125
If the sands of time in
my hourglass were scattered,

129
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,375
there's no telling how
far we'd be able go.

130
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,916
Stop, don't do it!

131
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,041
Everything we were planning
is finished, Kujaku!

132
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,666
[MAGOROKU]
Stop, don't do it!

133
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,458
Everything we were
planning is finished, Kujaku!

134
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,666
[MAGOROKU]
All's not lost.

135
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,458
I'll contain it!

136
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,250
Your corridor of time
flows backward, Kujaku,

137
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,750
but it must remain sealed
within my Adamantite Tower!

138
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,791
[HIBIKI]
What is this?

139
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,375
I don't know.

140
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,333
None of this makes any sense.

141
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,291
We should look for another path.

142
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,750
You're right.

143
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,333
[MAGOROKU]
Give up.

144
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,250
Rinne Magoroku!

145
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,291
Is this magic your doing?

146
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,375
[MAGOROKU] Partially,
but the real blame lies with

147
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,625
Kujaku's Inverted Halberd
of Time technique.

148
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,125
And now, there are
no limits on his power.

149
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,750
So time is reversing?

150
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,583
[MAGOROKU] So it would seem,
which would explain

151
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,916
how my wounds have
been fully healed,

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,666
but it isn't only time
that has gone mad.

153
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,125
[MAGOROKU] Somehow,
when using my Adamantite Tower

154
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,458
to contain Kujaku's
mighty technique,

155
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,416
our powers began
clashing with one another.

156
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,458
And this is the result
of those two powers clashing.

157
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,000
At this point I cannot
quell the chaos myself.

158
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,500
We have been trapped in a
place where time and space

159
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,583
have lost all meaning.

160
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,000
[HACHIROU]
Impossible!

161
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,333
[MAGOROKU] And thus, there
is only one thing left for me

162
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,041
to do with the time I have left.

163
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,541
Face you in
combat and defeat you.

164
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,250
Reality crumbles,
and you'd still fight?

165
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,000
Joujin is no more,

166
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:52,375
and Nobunaga has
returned to Hell.

167
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,708
Our blood is no use to you now.

168
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,500
It makes no sense to fight!

169
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,000
You're correct,
there's no meaning.

170
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,250
But still.

171
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,041
I can feel as though
I've had my revenge.

172
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,500
[MAGOROKU]
You're angry too,

173
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:11,041
at the senseless loss
of your comrades.

174
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,708
Now, if you can
manage to defeat me,

175
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,958
this maddening space may
return to a kind of normalcy.

176
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,541
[MAGOROKU]
Of course.

177
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,250
I can't guarantee that.

178
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,791
What were you
seeking when you joined

179
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,000
forces with Joujin?

180
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,708
Perhaps I merely
wanted a place where

181
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,541
I could fight for something.

182
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,500
Now, draw steel!

183
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,833
Or are you too afraid?

184
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,250
There's no way to be
certain that your eye magic

185
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,500
will work in a realm
so divorced from reality.

186
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,000
I never had any
intention of using it on you.

187
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,208
[HACHIROU]
Now Magoroku.

188
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,625
Here I come.

189
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,041
[HACHIROU]
Give us space, Hibiki.

190
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,166
[HIBIKI gasps]

191
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,166
[HIBIKI gasps]

192
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,833
[MAGOROKU grunts]

193
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,000
[HACHIROU growls]

194
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,583
[MAGOROKU grunts]

195
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,625
Now, let's get out of here.

196
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,208
Right!

197
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,625
[gasps]

198
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,458
Saizou.

199
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,666
Uh...

200
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,916
[HACHIROU] I think that
we should follow him.

201
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,375
Come on!

202
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,666
Got it!

203
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,291
[HIBIKI]
Shikibu!

204
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,000
[HIBIKI]
Hachirou?

205
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,541
[HACHIROU] Yes, they're no
longer a part of our world.

206
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:22,833
[HIBIKI]
No. Shichigen!

207
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,416
Shichigen!

208
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:43,625
[HACHIROU] Looks like this
is where we have to go.

209
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,791
[HIBIKI]
Yes. I have faith.

210
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,666
Our friends are guiding us.

211
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,875
That's right.

212
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,833
And no matter where
this path may lead us,

213
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,583
our friends have
taken us exactly where

214
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,416
they want us to be.

215
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,208
I'm ready. Let's go.

216
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,541
Right.

217
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,333
The destruction...

218
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,250
It's beautiful.

219
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,083
The Hell that
Joujin- <i>sama</i> desired

220
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:03,083
to unleash upon this world,
has at last become

221
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,208
real before our very eyes.

222
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,666
[NEIRICHIOU cackles]

223
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,750
The fire spreads
and the castle burns,

224
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,333
until there is nothing left
but a pile of ashes.

225
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,000
Watching the
world burn down is such

226
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,541
a beautiful way to
spend an evening.

227
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,458
The daily
machinations of mankind

228
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,458
are easily disrupted
and fragile things.

229
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,208
[JOUJIN]
It's not enough.

230
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:31,250
This is hardly the beginning.

231
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:35,375
We must turn this world
into a smoldering hellscape,

232
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,666
starting with Edo.

233
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,166
[BOTH gasp]

234
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,833
The entire city is consumed
by flames, we failed.

235
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,708
The Joujinshuu.

236
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,041
How do you know to
call us by that name?

237
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,291
[HACHIROU]
The Murakumo made it to Edo?

238
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,708
Well now, quite interesting.

239
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,958
Tell me, young man,
you know our name.

240
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,500
What else do you know of us?

241
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,750
Hachirou...

242
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,041
...is this?

243
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,458
Yes.

244
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,083
Shichigen, Shikibu, and Saizou.

245
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,708
They were somewhere between
worlds when they led us here.

246
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,250
The Adamantite Tower,
intersected with

247
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,708
the Inverted Halberd of Time,
and perhaps an environment

248
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,000
was created where
anything could happen.

249
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,833
Then... where are we?

250
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:37,541
[HACHIROU] I can't be certain,
but I think we might have

251
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,833
arrived at a different "now."

252
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:43,000
Altered from the "now" where
we faced the Joujinshuu,

253
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:45,208
and lost our companions.

254
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,416
No matter what
world we find ourselves in,

255
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,416
we can't stand by
as Joujin destroys it!

256
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,458
Not while we're
still able to fight!

257
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,583
[HACHIROU] Fortunately,
they seem to not know

258
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,291
anything about us.

259
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:03,875
Instead, we know all their
tricks from the start.

260
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,875
We can win!

261
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,666
[NARRATOR] Saizou, Shikibu,
