No matter which way

do not forget that this was
your father's decision.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,291
It would be most unseemly
to complain about the results.

10
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,291
Rather, when the decree
has been announced,

11
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,833
both the one who was chosen,
and the one who was not,

12
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,000
should not waste
time with jealousy.

13
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,750
Instead, work together
for a better future,

00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:09,125
and for the glory of the
Tokugawa shogunate!

Thus, Iga is the winner.

And thus it shall be done.

Who are these men?

[KASOU]
Iga vermin.

These ones here are also
known as the Kurokuwa,

31
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,125
and they're not worthy
of being called ninjas.

32
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,000
Essentially, they're
nothing more than farmhands

33
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:08,333
with a few tricks
up their sleeves.

00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,125
I hear you
"Five Treasures of Kouga"

35
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,125
are supposed to be tough.

[GEI'IN] What reason could you

I wasn't planning
to say anything,

I needed to run things by you.

Don't try to keep me from going.

to argue with you.

During the decisive battle,
wasn't the Kouga leader

at the time rumored to have
used the same technique?

[TADANAGA] This power
gave him a great advantage.

to injure or slay him,

or to use magic against him,

were the only ones affected

103
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,833
[TADANAGA]
It's a type of illusion spell.

104

That causes the attackers
to destroy themselves.

some of the details.

place the names of ten ninja

upon these two scrolls.

117
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,666
This will entrust
the third shogun's fate

to the feud between the
Iga and Kouga clans.

[IEYASU] The Kouga will
represent the second son,

last to the bitter end,

avoid the clutches of death,

Did he work something out?

He told me that
he'd take a look at it for you,

00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,375
If only you
children could survive

160
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,041
on sunlight and morning dew.

161
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,125
--Huh?
--Hmm?

162
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,375
[HIBIKI]
Hachirou!

163
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,000
Tell me why.

164
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,333
What is it now?

165
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:54,000
[NAMENBA]
It's odd for her to be late.

166
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,166
If she isn't here,
where could she be?

167
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,333
She's just running
a little behind, Namenba.

168
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,875
You don't need to be so worried.

169
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,708
I suppose you're right

170
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:02,916
[sighs]

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,458
What is it?

172
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,458
I wonder if she bumped
into Hachirou on his way out?

173
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,041
What do you
mean, "on his way out"?

174
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,208
Is something going on with him?

175
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,583
[GORONE] He told me he
intended to leave the village.

176
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,375
What? Hachirou's leaving?

177
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,458
You should have
stopped him, Gorone!

178
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,500
[GORONE]
No.

179
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,000
Please, just stay out of it!

180
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,291
[NAMENBA gasps]

181
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,916
Why should I?

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,416
Because if Hibiki
really did meet up with him,

183
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,875
then I think it may be better to
leave things to them, for now.

184
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,166
So you believe
that she'll stop him, then?

185
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,833
I don't know,
but perhaps the whim of fate

186
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,958
dictates that they'll
never be together.

187
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,833
[HIBIKI]
What's going on?

188
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,166
Why are you leaving
without telling me?

189
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,375
Is it my powers
that you're worried about?

190
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,833
Or yours?

191
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,250
Are you afraid of
what might happen?

192
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,083
[HIBIKI]
You don't have to be.

193
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,041
I'm not scared of your power.

194
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,375
Know why?

195
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,791
Because unless I hate you,
or wanted to hurt you

196
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,041
for some reason,
you can't use it on me, right?

197
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,541
[HIBIKI] I'd never feel
that way about you.

198
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:25,250
[HACHIROU]
I know, but...

199
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,458
[HIBIKI] And when you compare it
to a technique like yours,

200
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,250
mine can do even less.

201
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,916
All I can do is disable
an opponent's power.

202
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,583
So then, why is it
that you seem so scared?

203
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,625
[GORONE] The first pair
to fight 12 years ago,

204
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,375
were Ogen- <i>sama</i>
and Danjou- <i>sama</i> .

205
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,583
They had been in love with
each other in their youth.

206
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,625
Gennosuke- <i>sama</i>
and Oboro- <i>sama</i> were

207
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,458
deeply in love as well.

208
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,958
But that's over.

209
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,791
The Kouga and the Iga will
never fight each other again.

210
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,958
Even if that is the truth.

211
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,791
I fear they were always
destined to be separated.

212
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,083
Perhaps that fate has been
inherited some other way.

213
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,958
Some other way?

214
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,500
[GORONE] As long as
those two bear the blood

215
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,500
of Gennosuke- <i>sama</i>
and Oboro- <i>sama</i> .

216
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,208
Gorone, how much do you know?

217
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,416
You just said that the children

218
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,750
carry the blood of
the two that fell in battle.

219
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,291
And I've often heard
others speak of

220
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,166
such an impossible thing.

221
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,708
But when I've asked about it,
no one can explain it to me.

222
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:27,875
Why?

223
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,625
Ninja are quite fascinating.

224
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,125
I daresay beyond
human understanding.

225
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,333
[GEI'IN]
Huh?

226
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,375
[TADANAGA] You challenge
our laws of nature,

227
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,250
with powers like turning
sweat into light.

228
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,416
[GEI'IN] There's no need to
flatter me, Suruga- <i>sama</i> .

229
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
[TADANAGA] I've even heard there
was a ninja who wouldn't die.

230
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,041
[GEI'IN]
That so?

231
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,708
[KASOU] You're referring to
Yakushiji Tenzen, most likely.

232
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,833
A powerful foe,
who was an integral part

233
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,916
of the war of the scrolls.

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,416
[TADANAGA]
Do you think it was true?

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,416
That he learned how
to defeat death?

236
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,166
[GEI'IN]
My deepest apologies, my lord,

237
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,666
but Tenzen was of the Iga.

238
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,125
I was never privy
to that information.

239
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,541
Well, I'm sure it's a
bunch of mystical nonsense.

240
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,666
[TADANAGA] And yet
Kouga Gennosuke was

241
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,375
still able to defeat
a creature such as that!

242
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:14,791
[BOTH gasp]

243
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,791
[TADANAGA] So how was he beaten
by this Iga Oboro woman?

244
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,666
He was so powerful,
it doesn't make any sense!

245
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:22,208
[HACHIROU]
You've noticed it, haven't you?

246
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,000
What?

247
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,458
I know you remember
what happened that last time,

248
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,166
when the cherry
blossoms bloomed.

249
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:38,958
[HACHIROU yelps]

250
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:41,500
[HIBIKI grunts]

251
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,541
[HIBIKI]
I finally won!

252
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,500
It's the first time
I've beaten you!

253
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,208
[gasps]
That was deliberate.

254
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,625
Hachirou...

255
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,958
Did you let me win?

256
00:15:57,041 --> 00:16:00,583
Are you taking pity on me?

257
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,166
[HACHIROU grunts]

258
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,541
I don't think
that's very nice at all.

259
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,791
No, Hachirou.

260
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,208
Don't look away.

261
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,208
[HACHIROU gasps]

262
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,583
[HIBIKI gasps]

263
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:54,291
That was just a gust of wind,
it happens all the time

264
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,083
Nothing more than that.

265
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,041
[TADANAGA]
Tell me, Gei'in.

266
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,375
[GEI'IN]
Hmm?

267
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,875
[TADANAGA] Naturally,
I assume you know the man

268
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,333
named Hattori Kyouhachirou?

269
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,625
Of course I've heard
about him, my lord.

270
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,500
Kyouhachirou is the son of the
second Hattori Hanzo- <i>sama</i> .

271
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,041
[TADANAGA]
Indeed.

272
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,125
And in the final battle,
when Oboro and Gennosuke

273
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,583
faced each other to end the war.

274
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,791
Both he and his father,
the second Hanzo,

275
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,375
were present to witness.

276
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,083
[GORONE]
Using their powers,

277
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,458
they both overextended
themselves, and perished.

278
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,250
But Oboro- <i>sama</i> stayed
alive slightly longer.

279
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:47,708
Long enough to mark
the Iga victory on the scroll.

280
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,333
That is how it was
relayed back to the court

281
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,208
of the Shogun,
and is now history.

282
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,291
But here, in this village,
the story, when told,

283
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,458
differs slightly.

284
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,416
[GORONE] Before the
last battle even began.

285
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,833
Gennosuke- <i>sama</i>
was already injured.

286
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,458
He couldn't open his eyes
to use his Eye Magic.

287
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:18,500
Gennosuke- <i>sama</i> ,
you know I love you.

288
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,666
[GORONE] And so, Gennosuke- <i>sama</i>
embraced the lifeless body

289
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,208
of his beloved Oboro- <i>sama</i> ,
and wrote the Iga victory

290
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,125
onto the scroll with
his own hands.

291
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:41,500
And then...

292
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,333
[NAMENBA]
But that would mean...

293
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,000
[GORONE] Yes,
in the end, it isn't clear

294
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,041
how much of this
tale is even true.

295
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,541
[TADANAGA] There's a story
that involves Kyouhachirou.

296
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,916
The morning when Gennosuke and
Oboro were to end the war,

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,083
Kyouhachirou had a private
meeting with Oboro.

298
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,416
[TADANAGA]
Have you ever heard that?

299
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,458
[GEI'IN]
I've not.

300
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,291
This is news to me, my lord.

301
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,000
Could there have
been some secret agreement

302
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,833
between those two?

303
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,958
The Hattori clan
was originally part of the Iga.

304
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,458
Perhaps he gave
Oboro some sort of plan,

305
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,500
so that the Iga would
be the victors.

306
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,583
Couldn't that be
possible at least?

307
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,041
When I was a boy,

308
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,416
no more than
eight or nine years of age,

309
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,541
somebody came to the Kouga
village to visit Gei'in- <i>sama</i> .

310
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,750
[NAMENBA]
Then, that was...

311
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,750
[GORONE]
Yes.

312
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,458
Kyouhachirou- <i>sama</i> .

313
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,125
[NAMENBA]
So...

314
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,125
If Kyouhachirou- <i>sama</i>
actually did save

315
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:22,750
the two children back then,

316
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,666
what was his goal?

317
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,333
I can't be certain.

318
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,375
As the acting head of espionage
for the Tokugawa clan,

319
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,083
he tried to ensure
the bloodlines of such

320
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,375
powerful ninjas continued.

321
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,000
That seems the
most obvious explanation.

322
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,708
But maybe...

323
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,458
I'd like to think that he
might've been moved

324
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,916
by their selflesness.

325
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,958
By how, despite their being
destiny to be torn apart,

326
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,083
they willingly sacrificed
their own lives

327
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,000
for the sake of one other.

328
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,750
Otherwise, it would
be far too sad

329
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,125
for Hachirou and Hibiki.

330
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,208
I don't care what happens,

331
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,791
as long as we can be together!

332
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,333
[TADANAGA]
They say it's folly.

333
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,708
[BOTH gasp]

334
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:10,583
[TADANAGA] And I understand
those who laugh,

335
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,458
and say I should give in.

336
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,583
But that isn't something
I'm prepared to do, just yet.

337
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,125
Because I still don't
believe that the decision

338
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,166
they handed down
was the right one!

339
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,583
[BOTH grunt]

340
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,791
[TADANAGA gasps]

341
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,041
Tenshin!

342
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,375
Hurry up and close
the door, you fool!

343
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,333
The cold wind
is hitting my lord,

344
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,458
and the rain is getting in!

345
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,208
[TENSHIN]
I fear I cannot...

346
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,416
Grant me forgiveness...

347
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,416
Why is that?

348
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,833
Speak up!

349
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,541
Why can you not shut the door
to keep the cold weather

350
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,458
from coming inside?

351
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:54,500
I cannot because...

352
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,250
It's because...

353
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:59,041
Look at him--his neck.

354
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,083
I can't, because I'm--

355
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,083
It's because I'm...

356
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,875
...already... dead...

357
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,500
[NARRATOR] A ninja spends
his life in training.

358
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,541
Refining his technique
to perfection,

359
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,833
so he may do what is necessary,
and honorably fulfill

360
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,958
his duty to his lord.

361
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,541
Ah. Poor old Gei'in...
