Why not grant the wish that

Either make love
to her, or slay her.

We found you lost, and
having taken pity on you,

grievous injury indeed.

The toll that carrying the

to your very core.

You could not bear
such a heavy burden.

161
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,500
...I'm willing to use Ouka
right here, without hesitation,

162
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,125
to defeat you!

163
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,125
Oh?

164
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,333
As fascinating as that would be,

165
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:36,500
remember--the Ouka belongs
to both you and Hibiki.

166
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,666
Can you summon that power?

167
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,166
After all, that is
Oboro before you.

168
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,875
If that truly is the case,

169
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:47,666
if Oboro's mind is
in Hibiki's body.

170
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,625
I'll bet my life on Oboro's
feelings for her beloved!

171
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,541
Hmph!

172
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:57,166
We'll find out her
true feelings for Gennosuke.

173
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,583
[HACHIROU]
Oboro.

[gasps]

175
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:14,625
Gennosuke- <i>sama</i> , you
finally called me by my name.

176
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,583
[KUJAKU]
Heh

177
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,958
[HACHIROU]
Oboro.

178
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,125
Gennosuke, my love.

179
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,666
Look in my eyes, my darling.

180
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,083
Stare deep, into my very soul.

181
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,916
With every fiber of my being.

182
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,291
I'll return the emotions that
your eyes communicate.

183
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,916
And you, you must try to do
the very same thing for me.

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,041
The time has come, my love, for
our energies to unite as one.

185
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,833
[HIBIKI sighs]

186
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:07,916
[HACHIROU]
Oboro!

[HACHIROU]
Hibiki.

189
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,416
[HACHIROU]
Oboro.

190
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,708
[HACHIROU]
Hibiki.

191
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,666
[HIBIKI]
Yes. That's me.

192
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,375
Utsutsu! That statue of Kanzeon.

193
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,291
Why is it there?

194
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,583
[RUI] I wonder if they're
connected to each other,

195
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:42,500
just like the red monster is
connected to the old man?

196
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,625
[UTSUTSU]
Watch out!

197
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,125
Mother.

198
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,708
[RUI gasps]

199
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,875
Rui! What are you doing?

200
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,000
Shichigen.

201
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,500
[NEIRICHIOU]
Hnn? You can't be that foolish.

202
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:41,000
Please.

203
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:44,416
Do you seriously intend to
impersonate the boy's mother?

204
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,708
And then what will you do?

205
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,083
Wake him?

206
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,375
What utter nonsense.

207
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,291
[RUI]
Here I am, Shichigen.

208
00:15:56,375 --> 00:16:00,875
Now, come cling unto
your mother's breast.

209
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,000
[laughs]
Don't you see?

210
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:07,125
Your little techniques won't
work on your friend now.

211
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,541
What's this?

212
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,791
What the devil is happening?

Come to me.

Stop it, Shichigen!

216
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,500
That woman calling
to you isn't your mother!

217
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,083
She's an impostor!

218
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,875
Unless...

219
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,666
It looks like that is your
mother, Shichigen!

220
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,458
That indecent woman
you see before you

221
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,416
is undoubtedly your mother.

222
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,458
Kill her. Kill her now!

00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,208
[UTSUTSU growls]

224
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,416
Yes, good.

225
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Bring your sword down
upon the mother you hate.

226
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,583
Now kill her!

227
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:26,875
Kill off the very remembrance of
your mother who betrayed you!

After all this time,
can't you forgive her?

I never...

I could never hate her...

I loved her, and she...

240
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:54,250
She never would have done
anything to betray her son.

But...

I was just... so young...
I couldn't forgive her...

[SHICHIGEN] I couldn't forgive
myself for not forgiving her...

...and for what
happened that day...

That's why... That's why
you stabbed yourself?
