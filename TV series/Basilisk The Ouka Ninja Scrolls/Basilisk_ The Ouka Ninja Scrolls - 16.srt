1
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:46,583
[TADANAGA] At last,
we're finally going to Edo.

2
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,083
To Chiyoda Castle.

3
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:22,166
That's strange.
Why would it stop?

4
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,791
[gasps]

5
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,166
[HACHISU]
Namenba, look!

6
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,958
[NAMENBA]
Yes. I see her.

7
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,125
What are you doing, Hibiki?

8
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:01,916
Stay down.

9
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,166
[HACHISU]
I count three of them.

10
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,416
[NAMENBA]
Three more over there.

11
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,000
We can't let them call
for reinforcements.

12
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,750
Yeah. I'll fan out right.

13
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,833
[NAMENBA growls]

14
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,500
What is it you want now?

15
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,041
A colder greeting
than I'd hoped.

16
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,375
My assistance garners no thanks?

17
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,250
As always,
you only helped us because

18
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,500
you stand to benefit somehow.

19
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,916
That said, you saved us.

20
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,916
Let's go.

21
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,625
Before you take your leave.

22
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,625
[NAMENBA]
Hm?

23
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,708
Know this.

24
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,958
More of the Rain
are lying in wait.

25
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,500
Enough men to cover all of
the approaches to the castle.

26
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,666
Will you still
charge in blindly?

27
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,666
Two against an unknown
number of enemies?

28
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,541
That's our choice to make.

29
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,750
No, we should retreat.

30
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,958
[gasps]

31
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,250
Well, Namenba- <i>dono</i> .

32
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,291
It seems we are
of the same mind.

33
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,583
Let's ready our
weapons and return.

34
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,916
We'll need to discuss
this with Gorone.

35
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,291
How splendid!

36
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,000
May I go with you
to talk to him?

37
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,791
Totally out of the question.

38
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,250
We don't trust you,
quite frankly. It's uncanny.

39
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,083
How do you always show up
at the perfect moment?

40
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,916
It was the same back
at Chiyoda Castle.

41
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,875
Doesn't every
man like to flaunt his prowess

42
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,583
in front of the woman
whom he fancies?

43
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,541
[NAMENBA]
Hmph. Let's go, Hachisu.

44
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,791
[HACHISU gasps]

45
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,625
I see.

46
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,458
Hibiki followed them
into the new Murakumo.

47
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,500
There's nothing we could do.

48
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,000
We had been
keeping watch on her.

49
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,750
But we let our guard down.

50
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,291
Come now,
you mustn't blame yourselves.

51
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,875
If she attacked us while under
the influence of some kind of

52
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:34,083
mind control, no one
could defeat her.

53
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,375
No one but Hachirou that is.

54
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
And you say this castle

55
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,541
is currently on the
move, correct?

56
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,000
Last we saw.

57
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,000
But it was moving slow
enough to keep up with on foot.

58
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:47,166
We'll have no problem
catching up to it.

59
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,666
Then wait here for now.

60
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,125
What?

61
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:53,041
Don't try to go
after it on your own.

62
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,625
I know you're right,
but it's our leader

63
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,750
who was kidnapped by the enemy.

64
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:36,416
[UTSUTSU]
So are we going?

65
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,291
[NAMENBA]
We are.

66
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,166
Are you feeling
well enough to run?

67
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,625
I'm perfectly fine,
just some residual numbness.

68
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,208
It's my pride that hurts most.

69
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,083
Protecting her is our duty.

70
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:51,458
And yet... She was able to
slip away under our watch.

71
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,458
[UTSUTSU] And you want
us to wait for the rest?

72
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,250
Don't be ridiculous!

73
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,291
With this humiliation
hanging over our heads,

74
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,750
how could we face them?

75
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,500
It's dangerous
to make such a decision

76
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,583
based solely on
fleeting emotions.

77
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,833
[GIRLS sigh]

78
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:09,375
[NAMENBA] Give them
a chance, that's all I ask.

79
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,791
Besides...

80
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,875
I'm beginning to feel
the same way that they do.

81
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,250
Don't you understand?

82
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,708
These girls have
a lifelong bond.

83
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,750
Since they first lived together,

84
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,750
they've never been
separated from her.

85
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,958
Not even once.

86
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,958
[GORONE sighs]

87
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,625
Please say yes.

88
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,708
Fine, you win.

89
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,291
[GIRLS]
Hm!

90
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,750
[GORONE] But you'll need more
firepower than you've got now.

91
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,333
I'll have something
ready for you by dawn.

92
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:45,958
[MALE ROYAL A]
What do you mean,

93
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,708
the castle has
appeared once again?

94
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:49,291
[MALE ROYAL B] That's what
the Kurokuwa messenger

95
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,291
reported to us.
Also that it's moving.

96
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,625
[MALE ROYAL C]
Impossible.

97
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,083
[MALE ROYAL A] How much
can we believe in the word

98
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,500
of this "messenger"?
It sounds highly suspect.

99
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,291
[MALE ROYAL B]
All I'm sure of is what he said.

100
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,041
It's heading east, towards Edo.

101
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,916
[IEMITSU] Tenkai, were you
lying when you told me

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,625
Murakumo had disappeared?

103
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,500
[TENKAI]
I was not, mighty shogun.

104
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,708
But in all fairness,
I said nothing about

105
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,000
the Joujinshuu
themselves disappearing,

106
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,625
only that their
castle had done so.

107
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,208
Don't be so pedantic--
remember who I am.

108
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,916
I mean you no
disrespect, your lordship.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,166
We should try to remain calm.

110
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,125
Even if the enemy
castle truly is moving,

111
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,916
we have a great deal
of time to prepare for it

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,625
as it slowly makes its way
toward Edo, your Excellency.

113
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,041
Before it arrives,
it will be dealt with.

114
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,916
So can I take you at your word?

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,666
You swear it?

116
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,916
That this time,

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,416
you'll defeat these
enemies of the state?

118
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,250
Answer!

119
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:58,291
[TENKAI chuckles] What an
utterly fascinating situation.

120
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,875
Explain.

121
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,125
[TENKAI] I never expected
the seeds of fate to change

122
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,833
the course of my life, but its
roots have grown far and deep,

123
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,500
interweaving with mine.

124
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,041
Nevertheless.

125
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,750
I will not allow
this threat to further

126
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:16,791
encroach upon Chiyoda castle.
You will be safe, my lord.

127
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,416
I swear upon the
peace that your ancestor,

128
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,708
Ieyasu- <i>sama</i> , brought
to this great nation,

129
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,666
and the prosperity
that followed.

130
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,083
[IEMITSU growls]

131
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,791
These are all we've got.

132
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,583
We're taking everything.

133
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,208
We can't carry this much stuff.

134
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,875
It's too heavy.

135
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,541
[UTSUTSU]
So we'll grab what ever we can.

136
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,166
Even with all of this,
we may not have enough.

137
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,875
It's been a while
since I went on a mission.

138
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,041
What?

139
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,125
[laughs]
It was just a silly joke.

140
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,125
Of course I can't go,
and wouldn't want to.

141
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,458
[NAMENBA]
Hmm...

142
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,208
[gasps]

143
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,208
[GORONE]
Care for a persimmon?

144
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,000
Sure.

145
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,083
[GORONE] You'll have to help
yourself, Namenba- <i>dono</i> .

146
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,291
Perhaps someday,
we'll have known

147
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,083
each other for a long time.

148
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,833
How did you know it was me?

149
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,791
Your face looks tired,
you must've traveled far,

150
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,708
but there are no droplets of
sweat beading up on your brow.

151
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,125
[GORONE] You're trying
to pass as a girl from

152
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,000
the nearby village, but you
aren't quite pulling it off.

153
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,000
Well then. I take it you're him?

154
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,708
Apologies, but could
you help me stand?

155
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:02,250
[gasps]

156
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,875
[GORONE] I could see
it etched in your face.

157
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,666
"I have to work
with a total weakling

158
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,291
who can't even walk on his own?

159
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,458
How'd I get stuck with
such a terrible assignment?"

160
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,333
I wasn't thinking that.

161
