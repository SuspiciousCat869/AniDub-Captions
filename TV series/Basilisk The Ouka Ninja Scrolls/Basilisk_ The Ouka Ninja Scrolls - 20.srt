but the tumbling of the dice.

163
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,083
They roll and scatter.

164
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,291
One stirs in slumber.

165
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,791
We dub this fitful dream life,
but death wakes us all.

166
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,250
Shikibu, get back!

167
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,833
Here comes Yasha Itaru.

168
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,250
Don't look into her mirror.

169
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,208
Understood.

170
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,750
Hold on.

171
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,583
Shichigen!

172
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,500
[HACHISU]
Hmm.

173
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,875
[gasps]

174
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,416
No, my hands...

175
00:16:55,583 --> 00:17:00,916
[HACHISU shrieks]

176
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,291
[HACHISU sobs hysterically]

177
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,666
[SHIKIBU]
Hachisu!

178
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,750
[grunts]

179
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,000
No. Why?

180
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,666
[HACHISU whimpers]

181
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,291
[chuckles] This friend of
yours is completely under

182
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,083
our control right now.

183
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:34,666
Pulling his strings like
a flesh and blood puppet.

184
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,125
[HACHISU sobs]

185
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,250
We're as good as done
with these two.

186
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,541
Exterminate the other pests.

187
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,125
[SHIKIBU]
I'll kill you!

188
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,750
[gasps]

189
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,166
[ITARU] I've heard of you,
they say you'll burst

190
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,541
if you don't wear that
special suit of armor.

191
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:05,208
Now then, take off that
shell, and we can call it a day.

192
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,833
[SHIKIBU grunts, groans]

193
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,166
[yells]

194
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,166
[ITARU]
Oh. So it is true.

195
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,541
Looks like you're about to
make quite a mess in here.

196
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:45,250
[SHIKIBU groans]

197
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:49,708
[laughs]
How utterly grotesque!

198
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,458
Filthy monster.

199
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,666
[HACHISU]
You're wrong...

200
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,000
Uh?

201
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,750
[HACHISU] The only monster
here... is you, bitch!

202
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,791
Wait. What're you doing?

203
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,791
[HACHISU] I'm about... to alter
that disgusting destiny

204
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,250
of yours forever...

205
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,541
The only way I know how...

206
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,166
[growls]
Is that so?

207
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,416
Well I'll send you to Hell, too!

208
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,583
[yells]

209
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,750
[gasps]

210
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,833
[ITARU shrieks]

211
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,958
[ITARU whimpers, shrieks]

212
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,750
My eye. I can't see a thing.

213
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,208
[gasps]

214
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,125
[HACHISU]
There it is...

215
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,000
I've shown you your
own Destiny's Passage...

216
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,250
I don't believe it.

217
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,166
Such a horrifying fate for me.

218
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,625
I refuse to believe
something so terrible is true!

219
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,000
[SHIKIBU groans]

220
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,375
[ITARU] Impossible, you were
struck by Destiny's Passage.

221
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:19,500
I was, but your spell
was broken by Hachisu's attack.

222
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,583
She taught me that
I control my own destiny.

223
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,916
[ITARU whimpers]

224
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,875
Shikibu... forget
what anyone else says--

225
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,125
decide on your
own path in life...

226
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,708
Just like I had to
so long ago...

227
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,166
Did you see me choose...

228
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,750
...Big Brother...?

229
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,958
[ITARU shrieks]

230
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,958
[SHIKIBU groans] This is the
last decision I'll ever make...

231
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,708
I'm going to die here...

232
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,250
But I'm grateful...

233
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,000
In the end, I wasn't alone...

234
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,708
And if my fate is to explode.

235
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
I'm going to take you with me!

236
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,041
[ITARU] You interrupted my
journey into death, beast!

237
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,500
How utterly vulgar of you.

238
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,500
I go with a clean conscience...

239
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,666
Hachisu and I will be reunited
when we get to Heaven...

240
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,333
[groans]

241
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,000
But for... a demon like you...

242
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,333
[ITARU wheezes]

243
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,041
[SHIKIBU
...Hell awaits!

244
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,666
[ITARU screeches]

245
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,958
Nobo akyasha kyarabaya.

246
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,791
On basara kirikiri sowaka.

247
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,000
Hibiki.

248
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:54,333
Now, lie together.

249
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,708
Take her as your own.

250
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,791
Let me see you
fornicate like beasts,

251
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,416
and set the prophecy in motion!

252
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,083
[NARRATOR]
This is the way it should be.

253
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,833
The Kouga and Iga
have always been rivals.

254
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,750
It is far more natural
for you to fight

255
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:55,458
to the death, than it is for
you to try to be friends.
