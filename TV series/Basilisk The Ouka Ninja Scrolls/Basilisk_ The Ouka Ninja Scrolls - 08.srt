1
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,375
[IEYASU]
Ninjas?

2
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,500
You would suggest leaving the
future of the Tokugawa shogunate

3
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,833
to be chosen by the victor
of a ninja contest?

4
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,125
[TENKAI]
I would.

5
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,000
The growing power struggle
between the factions

6
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:46,416
of your eldest
grandson, Takechiyo.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,541
and those of his
younger brother, Kunichiyo,

8
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,333
have reached the point
of becoming a threat to

9
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,958
the stability of
the entire nation.

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,208
Normally, as would be
befitting of a samurai family,

11
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,875
it would be perfectly acceptable
to settle the matter through

12
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,041
ten rounds of mortal combat.

13
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,083
But it would be a
tragedy to lose so many

14
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:05,625
Tokugawa samurai for
a cause that yielded

15
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,958
neither territory nor gold.

16
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,791
And therefore, use ninjas.

17
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:22,791
If we were to use the ninja
instead of your samurai,

18
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:25,791
who would care if they all
perished in a sea of blood?

19
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,041
We're already on the boat,
against orders.

20
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,625
Better to accept it.

21
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,083
Yes, I know.

22
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:23,583
Lord, there's no need
for you to feel dismayed.

23
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,958
I, Bunnoshin, have set up
both a second and third layer

24
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,291
of traps in which
to ensnare him.

25
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,416
And you're sure
that will be enough

26
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,583
to bring him down?

27
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,083
Yes, the next he'll face--

28
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,541
I call "the ears."

29
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,291
The ears?

30
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,875
[BUNNOSHIN] I have
personally selected a man

31
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,666
with exceptional hearing to
be our archery commander.

32
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,500
With his highly
perceptive ears,

33
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:48,291
he can locate a foe using naught
but the sound of his footsteps.

34
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:52,041
And thus, his own attempt
to flee will be his undoing.

35
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,458
Very good.

36
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,625
If they don't look at him,
then Hachirou's eye magic

37
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,291
can't affect them.
How many bowmen are there?

38
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,125
[BUNNOSHIN]
Twenty, in total.

39
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,458
And when a volley of 20
arrows comes flying in

40
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,375
unannounced over the wall,
even a ninja as monstrous

41
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,666
as this one, would find it
hard to survive.

42
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:30,791
[SHICHIGEN] I know that
autumn can be a painful season.

43
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,500

That's correct.

The man who shot Oda Nobunaga,
in the woods near Aekuni Shrine,

00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
was named Otowanokido.

[TADANAGA]
Hmm!

the opportunity to see

00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,458
his skill in action,
and that was all I needed.

80
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,875
He downed a rainbird,

81
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:20,541
flying faster than the eye
could see, with one shot.

82

of his great talent.

Surely... Gorouza will prevail!

I have faith in the man.

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,916
[gasps]

163
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,916
It seems we
meet again, Hadaebou.

164
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,458
I had quite a mess to deal with.

165
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:32,166
I suppose I have you
to thank for that.

166
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,083
Nonsense.

167
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,458
Suruga- <i>sama</i> 's forces couldn't
have been that dangerous.

168
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,791
I never had
an inkling of concern

169
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,166
about how things
would turn out for you.

170
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,458
I knew a man of your talents
wouldn't even break a sweat

171
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,083
defeating that rabble.

172
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,750
[HADAEBOU]
Apologies.

173
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,041
I failed to mention this
earlier, but I am a ninja monk

174
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,833
in the service of
High Priest Tenkai.

175
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,500
It was he that
ordered me to head to

176
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:08,291
the court of Suruga- <i>sama</i> ,
and work my way closer

177
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,458
to him however I could.

178
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,291
[HACHIROU]
High Priest Tenkai?

179
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,833
Here you go sir--

180
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,458
He left?

181
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,583
[HADAEBOU slurps]

182
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,833
[WAITRESS A sighs]

183
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,500
[WAITRESS A] The rain
didn't last very long at all.

184
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,291
[HADAEBOU]
Thank you. It was delicious.

185
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,166
[WAITRESS A]
Uh... You're welcome.

186
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,625
So tell me.

187
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,875
Why did you let Hachirou
just walk away?

188
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,583
I thought we came here
to bring him back!

189
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,833
Hey, Saizou! Are you listening?

190
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:52,833
[SAIZOU]
Hmm...

191
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,125
[growls]

192
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,916
[SAIZOU]
What was that for?!

193
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,291
Answer me!
We've come so far.

194
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,708
We were supposed to help
Hachirou so he'd come home!

195
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,666
You and I have
very different approaches

196
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,916
to playing the game.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Say what?!

198
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,375
You think this is
all just a game?!

199
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,083
We can't fight each other!

200
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,875
It's his choice.

201
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,083
He wants to make sure that
if any blood has to be shed,

202
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,375
it's his own.

203
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,041
[SHIKIBU] He's always
cared so much about us,

204
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,500
ever since we
were all just kids.

205
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,416
An average ninja leader
would send his men to die,

206
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,333
but Hachirou's never
been satisfied with being

207
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,041
anything less than exceptional.

208
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,208
Hah. Spoken like
a true eccentric.

209
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm so lucky to have
gotten stuck with you.

210
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,500
[SAIZOU] Don't you find
it interesting, at least?

211
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:42,791
Eccentric ninjas protecting
their "abnormal" leader?

212
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,750
You can't use
an established playbook with

213
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,291
that formula, because
the game has no chance

214
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,041
of going the way it should.

215
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,666
I can see your point.

216
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,833
But I hate your metaphors.

217
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,125
Thank you.
Now, let's head back home.

218
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,125
There's something
that's bothering me.

219
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,208
[HADAEBOU] You didn't
stick around long enough

220
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,208
to eat your soba noodles.

221
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,583
Now that I know
you work for Tenkai,

222
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,375
we no longer have
anything to discuss.

223
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,416
He was the one who
instigated the battle between

224
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,625
the Kouga and the Iga.

225
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:31,166
Are you saying
he's your mortal enemy?

226
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,291
I would have never expected

227
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,833
such a short-sighted
approach from you.

228
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:36,250
How so?

229
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,458
Simple.

230
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,791
Who is the adversary
that you currently face?

231
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,333
You should consider
that very carefully.

232
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,958
If you intend to
defeat the Joujinshuu,

233
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,125
what need could you have
for grudges long forgotten?

234
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,625
Besides, at this point,

235
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,625
it can't be more than
an old story to you.

236
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,083
So you expect me
to forget everything?

237
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,541
Throw it all away
and offer you my help?

238
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,666
[HADAEBOU]
We have a common enemy.

239
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,000
Let's focus on that
for the time being.

240
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,916
The Joujinshuu are
a legitimate threat to us all.

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,916
[HADAEBOU] If you were
to promise us your aid,

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,875
we could begin to repay you by
sharing some of Joujin's secrets

243
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,666
we've been able to uncover.

244
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,750
[HACHIROU]
Joujin's secrets?

245
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:17,875
[HADAEBOU]
Indeed.

246
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,375
[HACHIROU]
Hmph. I'm not interested.

247
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,000
You're intending to lie to us,
and use us again, aren't you?

248
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,291
[HACHIROU]
We refuse to be anyone's pawns.

249
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,500
[HACHIROU]
How awful. It's terrible...

250
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,500
[GEI'IN]
Yes, it is brutal.

251
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:36,791
However, that has always
been the destiny of the ninja.

252
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,166
And one day, Hachirou,
you will be the leader

253
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,958
of the Kouga forces.

254
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,333
You will have to be ready
to send your comrades off

255
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:47,375
to their deaths, should
the situation call for it.

256
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,416
I won't do it.

257
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,875
Hachirou...

258
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,250
[HACHIROU]
I refuse!

259
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:59,750
[HACHIROU] I wish to be
left alone, but if you insist.

260
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,750
[HADAEBOU] It was
my understanding that

261
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,791
your eye magic would be
totally useless against

262
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,333
someone who didn't consider
you to be an enemy.

263
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,958
Several centuries ago,
a monk traveled to Song,

264
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,833
where he performed a
prayer for rain to fall

265
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,583
upon the parched land.

266
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,791
The name of
that monk was Joujin.

267
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,208
That's right.

268
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,166
It was said that Heaven's favor
granted him the power

269
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,166
to make the rains fall.

270
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,208
Now, the name was
probably nothing more

271
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,291
than a coincidence.

272
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,791
But I can't be the
only one who thinks

273
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,833
the whole thing is
somewhat eerie.

274
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,916
[HADAEBOU] I've heard
it said that Joujin has

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,083
a large number of soldiers
at his disposal

276
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,083
beyond his lieutenants.

277
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,958
They are known as, "The Rain."

278
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,666
This is starting to look bad.

279
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,375
More of them keep showing up.

280
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,750
It's time to head back.

281
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,541
Rui. I'm charging straight in.

282
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,625
So follow my lead!

283
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,041
I'm right behind you.

284
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,916
Utsutsu, wait!

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,583
Keep going!

286
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,500
[RUI]
How far are we running?

287
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,666
[UTSUTSU]
How far do you think?

288
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,333
Back to the boat at the pier--

289
00:19:58,541 --> 00:19:59,708
[UTSUTSU gasps]

290
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,916
[FAKE RUI]
Wait, Utsutsu!

291
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,541
[garbled]
Utsutsu, wait!

292
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,166
[more garbled]
Don't leave me behind!

293
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,916
Utsutsu, where are you?

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,083
[UTSUTSU]
Over here, Rui!

295
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,458
[RUI gasps]

296
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:19,583
[FAKE UTSUTSU]
Over here, Rui.

297
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,041
[garbled]
Over here, Rui.

298
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
The Rain descends upon you.

299
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,541
[RUI gasps]

300
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
[RUI grunts]

301
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,125
[RUI grunts]

302
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,791
[RUI snarls, yells]

303
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,500
All the riflemen...?

304
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,958
Not a single one
of them survived?

305
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,458
[BUNNOSHIN]
Yes, my lord!

306
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,541
And what of Gorouza the Hawk?

307
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,875
[BUNNOSHIN]
Dead as well!

308
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,500
[JOUJIN]
Quite the predicament.

309
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,416
[BUNNOSHIN gasps]
Who's there?

310
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,625
[JOUJIN] Perhaps, your treason
will be brought out

311
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,041
into the light of day.

312
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:45,833
Damn you!

313
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:46,875
Where--

314
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,958
[JOUJIN] So there are
no further interruptions.

315
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,750
Greetings, my lord.

316
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,833
[TADANAGA]
Who are you?

317
00:21:55,916 --> 00:22:00,291
[JOUJIN] Could it truly be the
case, you've forgotten me?

318
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,916
[TADANAGA whimpers]

319
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,208
Your eyes tell me
you remember who I am.

320
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,041
That desperate look of fear.

[NARRATOR] A failed young man,
who once aspired to rule,

323
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,833
finds his heart in distress.

00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,916
to Murakumo Castle.

326
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,166
Oh, how they dance.
