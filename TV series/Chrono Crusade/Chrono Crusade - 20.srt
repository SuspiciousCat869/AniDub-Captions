Don't worry, Aion,

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,208
let me take care of
this one, for you.

Take the Holy Woman and go.

How clumsy.

38
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,333
Is this the best that
Heaven has to offer?

00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,708
[AION] Late as always.

But I already have

You cannot destroy the balance

00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,875

Still trying to interfere?

00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,458
You bastard.

87
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,916
[GILLIAM]
Azmaria! Remington!

88
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,916
Are the two of you all right?

89
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Y-Yes, but he...

90
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,333
...took Rosette.

91
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,333
[REMINGTON] I'm afraid I wasn't
strong enough, Sister Kate.

92
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:14,958
And even worse, Aion
escaped with Rosette.

93
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:17,625
We were able to
rescue Joshua,

94
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:22,625
but only because he is no longer
of any use to the Sinners.

95
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,583
I'm afraid we have failed.

96
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,791
Wait, Father,

97
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,833
there is one thing that I'm
going to have to ask you first.

98
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:35,375
[REMINGTON] You mean...
about me I assume?

99
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,708
[KATE] I take it you
know how far it is...

100
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,666
from New York
to San Francisco.

101
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,583
Exactly when and
how did you arrive?

102
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,791
In truth, I am not
unlike an angel.

103
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:47,958
[KATE gasps]

104
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,958
[REMINGTON] Yet, even so,
I was powerless.

105
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,791
[AZMARIA gasps]

106
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,291
[AZMARIA]
Sister Claire...

107
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,958
You really should try
to get some more sleep.

108
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,875
I'll try, but... [gasps]

109
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,000
[CLAIRE] Azmaria?

110
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,666
You don't know where
Father Remington is, do you?

111
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,625
Well, I suppose he's upstairs
with Reverend Gilliam.

112
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,791
Could you please
take me to see him?

113
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,583
I have something
extremely important

114
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,958
I need to talk to him
about, right away!

115
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,625
Oh. Oh I understand.

116
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,833
[AZMARIA] During the battle,
the head of Pandemonium

117
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,416
sent something that was
like a memory into my mind.

118
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,166
It was about how
when the devils

119
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,875
were driven out of Heaven,

120
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,750
they agreed to create
a pact with God.

121
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:22,125
You see... man
possessed knowledge

122
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,458
and would one day
fall from grace.

123
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,958
And therefore, the devils
were given the role

124
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,708
of making man fear
Heaven once again,

125
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,875
in order to guide man away from
corruption and toward salvation.

126
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,916
The ceremony
that Aion held

127
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,541
was called the
ritual of atonement.

128
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,416
The ritual used the
seven virtues that we,

129
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,583
the Apostles, symbolize.

130
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,250
These virtues are
meant to teach man

131
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,666
the strength of
Heaven's authority.

132
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,541
[REMINGTON]
In the eyes of Heaven,

133
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,375
the devils are indispensable.

134
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,666
It is because the devils exist
that man worships God.

135
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
[DUFFAU] Hmm...

136
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,750
[AZMARIA] It was said that
in the time of chaos,

137
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,875
a savior will appear and lead
the people to salvation.

138
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,166
Am I correct to think
that Rosette's stigmata

139
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,250
were meant to be a sign of that?

140
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,708
[DUFFAU] No, they
were a deterrent.

141
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:16,875
A deterrent?

142
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,750
[DUFFAU] It is true that
the atonement ceremony

143
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:23,291
may be used to call
forth reverence for God.

144
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,000
However, in the
hands of a devil,

145
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,291
it may also provide
the opportunity to

146
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,916
further taint a person's
heart with darkness.

147
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,708
The young woman's stigmata,

148
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,875
and the unique aura of
justice that surrounds her,

149
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,250
should have been enough
to deter a devil that was

150
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,958
still in the process
of ascending to power.

151
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,500
So in the end,

152
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,833
Heaven would be able to
sing the praises of victory.

153
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:50,000
Interesting. It's all
something of a paradox...

154
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,958
that such a strong
deterrent should also be

155
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,791
the weapon he needs.

156
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,416
[REMINGTON] And this is
why Aion wanted Rosette.

157
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,083
At times, justice is
accompanied by violence.

158
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,916
And Aion wanted to use
that violence as a weapon.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,750
I wonder if that's
the other ending

160
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,375
to the Apocalypse that
he was talking about.

161
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,791
The voice of
many angels.

162
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:15,208
And just how much of
this did you know?

163
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,833
I am afraid I have been
constrained in this case.

164
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,333
In fact, I am compelled
not to interfere.

165
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:27,000
Or... at least not 'til
the time is judged right.
