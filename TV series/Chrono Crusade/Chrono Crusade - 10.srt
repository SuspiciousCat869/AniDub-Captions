1
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,416
So it's you!

2
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,750
[AION] It's been such
a long time, Chrono.

3
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,250
How many decades
has it been?

4
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:36,125
That voice! Chrono, is
that bird really talking?

5
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,291
That's no bird.

6
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,250
Huh?

7
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,083
That thing is Aion.

8
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,458
He's a devil as well.

9
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,000
[AION] You talk as if
we were strangers.

10
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:46,208
But in fact
we're friends,

11
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,125
and both still
Sinners, aren't we?

12
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,208
Not anymore! I want
nothing to do with you.

13
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:57,083
[AION] Not even if I promise
to return your horns?

14
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,958
There's no way you could have
forgotten our dream is there?

15
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:07,083
I'd like to proceed to the
next step as soon as possible.

16
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,916
[AION] By the way,

17
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,625
thank you for waking him
from his slumber, young lady.

18
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,291
For that,
I'll tell you a secret.

19
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,541
The horns are the source
of the devil's power,

20
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,291
storing our Astral energy.

21
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,916
Did Chrono tell you
I broke his off?

22
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,583
Ever since, he's
been an outcast,

23
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:33,791
so weak that he's
less than useless.

24
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,291
But come with me Chrono,

25
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,208
and I'll give you
back your horns.

26
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:45,166
Let's forget about the
past, and just have fun again.

27
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,666
I want to bring back the
terror of Pandemonium...

28
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:55,958
the Chrono who slew over a
hundred million of our own kind.

29
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,750
[CHRONO chuckles]

30
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,125
[CHRONO] No...

31
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,333
I've found
something here.

32
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,000
Something that I could
never see from the skies.

33
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,291
And if I followed you,

34
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,291
everything that
I've accomplished

35
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,000
will have been for nothing.

36
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,291
[AION] So...

37
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,625
What should I do
with your horns, then?

38
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,083
You can keep them.

39
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,458
[AION laughs]

40
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,291
[AION] I thought you
would say that.

41
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,875
But not to worry,

42
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,458
I've already given
them to someone else.

43
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:49,500
[AION] My dear, your little
brother is so enchanting.

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:57,041
[AION laughs]

45
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,083
[AION] It's so unfair,
don't you think?

46
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,625
[AION] Over here.

47
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,333
[AION]
Thanks to you,

48
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:17,000
there are so many people
running around healthy,

49
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,916
perfectly cured.

50
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,500
And yet, you live in constant
fear of your next fit,

51
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,666
never knowing
when it might come.

52
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,583
Yes. That's right.

53
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,791
Don't you want
real power?

54
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,541
[AION] If you wish,
these can be yours--

55
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,250
the horns of a devil

56
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:58,375
who killed a hundred
million of his own kind.

57
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,208
Heh.

58
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,125
What have you
done to Joshua?

59
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,416
You can't!
He's a child!

60
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
[AION chuckles]

61
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,083
[AION] Your little
friend's so interesting,

62
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,458
and with such a potent gift,

63
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,791
I'm sure he'll be a great
asset to my legions.

64
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,958
Answer me!
What'd you do to my brother?

65
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:24,458
[AION laughs]

66
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,958
[AION] Why not find
out for yourself?

67
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,500
No, wait!

68
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,083
Come with me.

69
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,291
[gasps]

70
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,833
An interesting
pair of siblings.

71
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,958
Hmm. Now what might
you be plotting?

72
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,458
Chrono?

73
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,875
What you're seeing is
my true demonic form.

74
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,458
The form that you've
seen up until now

75
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:06,125
was created to conserve
my Astral energy.

76
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:09,000
We've got to hurry.
Joshua's in danger.

77
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:17,333
[YOUNG JOSHUA groans]

78
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:25,583
Aaaahhh! Aaahhh!

79
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:34,583
[YOUNG JOSHUA screams]

80
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:47,625
[screaming continues]

81
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,291
Joshua, is
something the matter?

82
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,000
[BILLY] Joshua!

83
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,375
Joshua, open this door!

84
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,166
Yeah, Joshua,
what's wrong in there?

85
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,375
Open this door, or else!

86
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,916
Ah! Joshua!

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,958
[YOUNG JOSHUA groans]

88
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,250
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
I always looked at the sky

89
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,791
instead of the ground.

90
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:18,875
[SMALL BOY]
Hey, over here!

91
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,583
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Because when I looked down,

92
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,791
I couldn't stand all
the happiness I saw.

93
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,083
[JEAN] Don't worry,
you'll get better soon, child.

94
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,541
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
I knew that, inside,

95
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,625
they must have resented
having to be nice.

96
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,958
Having to hide their pity.

97
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,500
I couldn't stand that
look in their eyes.

98
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,708
I want to be strong.

99
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,208
[REMINGTON] You'll be
leaving in one week.

100
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,750
'Til then it would be best to
take it easy and recuperate.

101
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:50,375
If I go with you,
will I become strong?

102
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,583
I can't say that
with certainty.

103
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:57,541
It will take time, and a long
period of special training.

104
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,708
If I go, will I be
able to become strong?

105
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,583
[AION] Don't you
want real power?

106
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,333
You are one of the chosen ones.

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,583
Hey, Joshua, are you all right?

108
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,375
Say something!

109
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,375
Come on!

110
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,458
[BILLY thinking]
He's so... disgusting.

111
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are there
horns on his head?

112
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,625
Is it some kinda disease?

113
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,125
What's wrong with him?

114
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,166
[YOUNG JOSHUA screams]

115
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,708

116
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,041
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
You're so mean, Billy.

117
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,500
I don't have these fits
because I like them!

118
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,208
But then again...

00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,625
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
What is that in your eyes?

123
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,416
What, Billy?

124
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,500
[BILLY] Ahh!

125
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,500
Ahhhhh!

[BILLY thinking]
What's wrong with him?

127
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,416
He's some kind of monster!

128
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,083
He's gonna kill me!
I've gotta run!

129
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:04,583
Someone save me!

130
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:05,500
Get him away from me!

131
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:09,416
Stop the noise!
Stop it now!

132
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Get out of my head!

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,416
[BILLY yells]

134
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,708
The noise... it's gone.

135
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,666
Now I see!

136
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,166
Ending the racket is simple!

137
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,541
All I have to do
is make it stop.

of my power leaves me...

Rosette, where on
earth have you been?

00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,708
What happened?
Where's Joshua?

00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,875
Joshua? He's gone mad! Crazy!

148
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,916
I don't understand.
Where is he?

right, Rosette.

00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,791
I just stopped them.

166
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,875
The noise coming from
everyone was just horrible.

167
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,583
So I decided to
make them stop.

168
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,833
Once I did,
I felt much better.

169
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,625
To be truthful,

170
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,541
I never thought my body
could feel this good.

171
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,958
And when I
stopped everyone,

172
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:45,208
I could feel this
incredible power!

173
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,791
Now that I
think about it--

174
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,125
I feel like I've gotten
incredibly strong!

175
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,375
That means that it's
all right now, Rosette.

176
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,250
You don't have to worry about
becoming a doctor anymore.

177

[YOUNG ROSETTE] Stop it!
This isn't right!

You're not... you're not
the Joshua I know anymore!

179
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:14,291
What? What did I just say?

180
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,083
Joshua.

[YOUNG JOSHUA yells]

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
[YOUNG JOSHUA]
Ah! Stop the noise!

183
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,500
Ahhh!

184
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,958
Stop it, please!

185
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,208
Stop the screaming
in my head!

Joshua!

00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,833
Ah!

188
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,125
You've gotta get
away from me!

192
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,958

[CHRONO grunts]

00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,083
Chrono...

196
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,875
What's happening
to everything?

197
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,000
The people and the trees...
and... all of it.

198
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,916
It's like they're
all freezing.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,750
[CHRONO]
It's a barrier.

200
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,541
They're frozen in time.

201
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,833
And unless we find
a way to stop him,

202
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,541
not even Joshua
himself will be spared.

203
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,666
No! Put me down!

204
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,833
I've got to save Joshua!

205
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,458
[CHRONO]
You can't do that!

206
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,958
Then you've got
to stop him!

207
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,000
Those are your horns, there
must be something you can do!

208

[gasps]

[groans]

210
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,541
The cost of saving you.

211
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,833
My reserves are so low
I can't heal my own wounds.

212
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,041
And for those of my kind,

213
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,416
running out of Astral
energy means death.

214
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,916
So... what should we do?

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,333
What can we do?

216
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,541
I don't know.

217
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,875
Without a horn or
a human contractor,

218
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,250
all of my powers are gone.

219
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,583
Contractor?

220
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:40,083
But if you had one,
you could save him!

221
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:40,916
Yes, but...

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,833
[YOUNG ROSETTE]
Then tell me!

223
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,833
Please, you've
got to tell me!

224
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,750
A contract is an invocation
that compels a devil

225
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,291
to answer the summons
of a devil master.

226
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,250
However, instead of depending
on the power of his horn,

227
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,083
the devil can also
channel energy

228
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:07,708
directly from his contractor,
thus augmenting his own power.

229
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,500
The humans cost is paid in terms
of time to dwell in this world.

230
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,958
With every task,
his life is shortened.

231
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,083
There must be another
option, Rosette,

232
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,500
some way, some how.

233
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,750
[YOUNG ROSETTE] But I--

234
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,541
It would mean an existence
of pain and loss!

235
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:29,083
A life unwinding twice as fast
as that of everyone you love!

236
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,666
[laughter]

237
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,208
Please think, Rosette.
Is this what you really want?

238
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,333
You know how I
feel about this.

239
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,625
I've sworn to protect
Joshua... with my life.

240
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,333
And even though I didn't
know everything that meant,

241
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,583
I won't break that promise.

242
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,375
You don't have to worry about
becoming a doctor anymore.

243
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:03,083
[YOUNG ROSETTE] My brother
hated being the object of pity.

244
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,958
And I can't let
everything end this way.

245
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:10,541
That's why...
I have to face him,

246
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,041
and remind him of
what we said we'd do...

247
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,875
of the promises we made...

248
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:19,583
about seeing things no one's
seen, becoming explorers.

249
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,708
And that I'm still here to make
those dreams come true for him.

250
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,208
Yes!

251
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,916
And if the cost
of doing that means

252
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,166
sacrificing everything
else that I have,

253
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,083
then I'll do it, Chrono. I must!

254
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,458
But I... know I
can't do it alone.

255
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,708
I also need you, Chrono.

256
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,125
I need your
strength and wisdom.

257
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,958
So help me... for the
dream that we shared.

[CHRONO sighs]

259
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,291
[CHRONO]
I understand.

260
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:03,000
I shall make a contract
with you, Rosette Christopher.

261
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,750
This is the symbol
of that contract.

262
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:17,083
But when the hands stop,
your life will end.

263
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:38,083
The clock is still
ticking off my time alive.

264
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:55,000
I've often wondered what
might have become of us

265
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,125
if Father Remington hadn't
shown up in his car just then.

266
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,541
If not for him,

267
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,291
we would have never been
able to get as far as we had.

268
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,000
And my hours on the clock
might have already run out.

269
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,166
Even so, the time that
still remains is very short.

270
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,666
And with every new sunrise,

271
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,541
I wonder if this was
truly for the best.

272
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:15,625
Of course it was
for the best!

273
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,958
Rosette...

274
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,166
Second guessing ourselves
won't change anything!

275
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,875
And if it would bring back
Joshua and restore everyone,

276
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:23,875
then I'd...

277

[AZMARIA]
But you mustn't!

328
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,625
[KATE] Rosette, the dignity
of our order is on the line.
