1
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,958
Huh?

2
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:57,083
[ANNA] Ugh.

3
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,041
[ANNA] All right, then.

4
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,333
Huh?

5
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,041
[ANNA screams]

6
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,041
[AION whistles]

7
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,916
Good morning,
great city of Babylon.

8
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,208
This era has turned
out quite nicely.

9
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,041
Don't you agree, my friend?

10
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,458
[gasps]

11
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,875
[REMINGTON] Sister Kate!

12
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,791
The central committee
of the Magdalene Order

13
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,291
has just called for
an emergency meeting.

14
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,833
You must hurry.

15
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,250
I'll take care
of things here.

16
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,500
All right.
I'm counting on you.

17
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,875
Minister, are things
really that bad?

18
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:11,166
There are still too many
uncertainties right now.

19
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,041
The same thing's been
reported at every church.

20
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:19,000
In each case, a black sun and
a red moon have been observed.

21
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,833
These omens are
very troubling.

22
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:23,833
[whispered] A red...

23
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:27,208
I've seen it, Father.
The red moon.

24
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:31,166
It's just like before.
All of the signs Aion has come.

25
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,583
[loud clang]

26
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:35,916
[DRIVER A] What the--?

27
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,875
What? Huh?

28
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,583
[screaming]

29
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,250
[JOSHUA] Ah, the first
angel sounded,

30
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:57,083
and there followed hail
and fire, mingled with blood,

31
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,708
and they were cast
upon the earth.

32
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,458
And the third part of
trees was burnt up,

33
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,083
and all green
grass was burnt up.

34
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,416
Isn't Aion incredible?

35
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,500
I wanted to see
the red hail, really.

36
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,875
If that's your desire,

37
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,458
then would you like
to go to Manhattan?

38
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,041
Lord Aion did say he would
enjoy having your company

39
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,666
if you wished to come.

40
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,625
Eh, I so hate cities.

41
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,791
The noise of the crowds
is too strong!

42
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,458
Please forgive me, Joshua.

43
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,666
Perhaps I should not
have mentioned it.

44
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,875
It's fine. But why are...
these carrots here?

45
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,333
Vegetables are
healthy for you.

46
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,416
[JOSHUA] Hmm?

47
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Lord Joshua?

48
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,416
[JOSHUA] I smell tainted meat.

49
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,458
[VAGRANT] The sun turned
black like sackcloth

50
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,000
made of goat hair.

51
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,875
The whole moon
turned blood red,

52
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,500
and the stars in
the sky fell to Earth,

53
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:57,500
as late figs drop
from a fig tree

54
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,083
when shaken by a mighty wind.

55
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:06,166
The sky receded like a scroll,
rolling up in the heavens.

56
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,958
[VAGRANT yells]

57
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:14,458
[VAGRANT screams]

58
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,833
[KATE] As you all know
by now, Manhattan,

59
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,458
and especially the area
known as Central Park,

60
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:23,500
is an important focus for
supernatural occurrences.

61
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,125
The predecessors of the
Magdalene Order discovered

62
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,375
that this place was connected
to the limbo of Pandemonium.

63
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,541
For that reason, they
erected a seal to act

64
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,458
as a protective boundary.

65
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,666
We believe that the
current outbreak of living dead

66
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,416
appearing across the city

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,875
is the result of that
seal being breached.

68
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,875
The purpose of the red hail
that fell this morning

69
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,125
was to break the seal.

70
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,458
[COUNCIL LEADER] Sister Kate,

71
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,583
you are to act with
all possible speed

72
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,291
in restoring the Seal
of the Seven Wings.

73
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,208
[KATE] I understand, senior.

74
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:53,458
[AZMARIA] Wait, Rosette!

75
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,500
[ROSETTE] What?

76
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,083
[AZMARIA] Wait. I'm going too.

77
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,625
You don't know how
frightening Aion is, Azmaria.

78
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,333
That's right. And you know
Aion wants the Apostles.

79
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,875
You already know that
Aion took my brother Joshua

80
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,708
simply because he's an Apostle.

81
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,833
Our job is to protect
you from him.

82
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,750
Well maybe I'm tired of being
protected all of the time.

83
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,458
I want to fight for myself!

84
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,833
[ROSETTE and CHRONO] Uhh...

85
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,333
Get in.

86
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,625
[REMINGTON] The spiritual
blockade is now complete.

87
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,416
All that's left is to
seal off the miasma.

88
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
We're going to restore
the Seal of the Seven Wings.

89
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,958
All of you, go to your
assigned positions.

90
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:35,000
Once you have completed
your tasks, you will contact me.

91
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,458
But sir, Rosette
still isn't here.

92
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,583
Oh, that girl.

93
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,833
How can she be
late for this?

94
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:41,875
[REMINGTON sighs]

95
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,708
[REMINGTON] Everyone else,
do your duty!

96
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,458
[MILITIA] Yes, sir!

97
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,375
I'm so sorry we're late, sir!

98
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,375
[AZMARIA] Rosette!

99
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,125
Wait! If you get covered
in that, you'll die!

100
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,666
[REMINGTON] I'm afraid
it's as Chrono says.

101
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,500
The miasma is evil,
accumulated in Pandemonium

102
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,541
which now has physical form.

103
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,500
Evil that's claimed
a number of victims today.

104
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,625
Evil? But what kind?

105
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:05,750
From human hearts.

106
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,833
From hearts?

107
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,250
Ones filled with greed. Evil.

108
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,708
Spiritual decay
is the very stuff

109
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,541
on which the devil world feeds.

110
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,000
That's so disgusting.

111
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:17,500
You mean something horrible like
that is really under Manhattan?

112
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,791
[REMINGTON]
We say "below,"

113
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,208
but we don't mean that
it's literally there.

114
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,416
Now please hurry
to your positions.

115
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,416
[ROSETTE] Understood, sir.

116
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,458
[CHRONO] Here you go.

117
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,750
You use these just
like you would use

118
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,666
the Principatus class,
understand?

119
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,958
[AZMARIA] Right.

120
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,083
Get that barrier up
right now, you two!

121
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,416
[CHRONO and AZMARIA] Right!

122
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,333
It's just one after another.

123
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,375
I'm finished.

124
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,583
[CHRONO] All right.
Just one more!

125
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,708
Right.

126
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,833
--[CHRONO] Here you go.
--[AZMARIA] Thanks.

127
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:54,833
[CHRONO] Come on, hurry.

128
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,208
[AZMARIA] Right!

129
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,916
[AZMARIA screams]

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,125
--[CHRONO] Rosette!
--[ROSETTE] Chrono!

131
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,416
[SATELLA] Kommen sie.

132
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:14,000
I command you, take form now!

133
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,333
Bring forth jewel drop!

134
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:20,333
Rain down,
like a thunderstorm!

135
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,583
Tear the ground asunder!

136
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:25,458
My clear February!

137
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,541
[REMINGTON] Hmm.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,708
Guten Tag.
In trouble again?

139
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:47,833
Satella. Why are you here?

140
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,750
The New York Police have
retained my services.

141
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,791
Perhaps someone doesn't
completely trust your order

142
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:53,958
to do the job.

143
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,500
Shut up, you pill.

144
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:58,791
The New York Police aren't
exactly known for integrity.

145
00:09:58,875 --> 00:09:59,583
Such sour grapes.

146
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,708
Just hurry up and
put up that barrier.

147
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,375
It's outside my area
of expertise, after all.

148
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:05,958
Grr. I know that!

149
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,041
Chrono! Azmaria! Back to work!

150
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,791
Him!

151
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,125
What?

152
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,625
He's here. Now.

153
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,208
This feeling...

154
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,625
A devil!

155
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,583
[AION chuckles]

156
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,000
Who, me?

157
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,583
I am the Alpha and Omega.

158
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,625
The beginning and the end.

159
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,083
The start and the finish.

160
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,833
Aion!

161
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:08,833
Aion?

162
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,416
[AION chuckles]

163
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,500
You know, I had thought you'd be
able to tell that I was coming.

164
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,666
Kommen sie. Reveal
your form, juwel ritter.

165
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,666
Satella, no!
He's not a normal--

166
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,625
Devil! All of whom
must be destroyed!

167
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,583
[SATELLA] Ah!

168
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,583
[SATELLA] Huh?

169
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,416
[AION] My, my. What an admirable
thing you just did, Chrono.

170
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,875
[CHRONO groans]

171
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,000
Chrono!

172
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,125
[AION] Where is the
Chrono who was trying

173
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,458
to help me change Pandemonium?

174
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,833
Come back.
Let's work together again.

175
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,625
This world of humans
isn't so bad, is it?

176
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,166
And we can live here,
because these people,

177
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,625
this nation, this whole world

178
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,666
has welcomed us,
through greed and avarice.

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,916
It's ours for the asking.

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,250
Sorry. I'm not like you.

181
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,291
[AION] I see.

182
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,000
[CHRONO yells]

183
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,541
[ROSETTE] Ah! Chrono!

184
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,625
Ah, dear Rosette Christopher.

185
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,750
You've grown into such
a lovely young lady.

186
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,375
Where's Joshua?

187
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,208
[AION] If I don't answer,
will you shoot me?

188
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,625
Who else knows where
your sweet Joshua might be?

189
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,166
[CHRONO groans]

190
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,708
[weakly] Rosette.

191
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,958
Heh. Predictable...
Mary Magdalene.

192
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:43,083
But that's enough.
I'm here for someone else.

193
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:46,416
Come on out,
little Apostle girl.

194
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,833
The disasters that
have occurred today

195
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:52,125
are my way of welcoming
you into the fold.

196
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,250
[MILITIA A] Group three,
barrier preparations complete.

197
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,666
[MILITIA B]
Group five, complete.

198
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,833
[MILITIA C] This is group six.
Preparations are complete.

199
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,083
That's understood.

200
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,500
All groups, stand by and
maintain your positions.

201
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,375
[gunfire]

202
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,166
[CLAIRE] Sir, we still
haven't heard from Rosette.

203
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,041
[ANNA] What is that girl doing?

204
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,166
Don't get distracted, you two!

205
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:26,083
[REMINGTON] Rosette...
It couldn't be.

206
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:30,041
[AION] Rosette,
you're so, so mistaken.

207
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:37,625
The truth is that my
actions saved Joshua.

208
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,125
Saved him?

209
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,333
Don't listen, Rosette!

210
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,583
[AION] Listen, you who
wishes to kill all devils.

211
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:49,250
Listen, my dear
little Apostle girl.

212
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,291
[AZMARIA gasps]

213
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,625
[AION] The truth is
that this is His fault!

214
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,416
All of those tragedies
that happened to you,

215
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,625
all of the horrors
that made you stumble,

216
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,208
were nothing more than traps,

217
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:03,041
set by the being
you call your "God."

218
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,833
Tell me,
Rosette Christopher,

219
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,333
have you heard
his voice even once?

220
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,750
Rosette! You mustn't listen!

221
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,375
[CHRONO] No!

222
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,583
[ROSETTE] Chrono!

223
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,166
Don't kill him!

224
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,250
If he dies, I'll never
find my younger brother!

225
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,666
There's no way a devil's
going to help you!

226
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,958
[ROSETTE] Please...
Please, Satella.

227
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,333
[AION laughs]

228
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,166
Isn't this fun?

229
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,791
Even at a time like this,

230
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:36,791
the one you worship won't speak
one little word to save you.

231
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,958
Believe me, this is
your world as it is.

232
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,916
He doesn't see anything.
He doesn't save anyone.

233
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,708
You understand this,
don't you, Apostle girl?

234
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,500
This, while you were cursed
with his so called blessing.

235
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,666
The curse that you
carried every day.

236
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,166
Such hypocrisy and deception.

237
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,166
He's naught but
a minor villain,

238
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,916
oozing honeyed words
and destruction,

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,875
grown arrogant from His
own inflated ego, your God.

240
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,666
And what about you,
our young Apostle girl?

241
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,416
Your search for a place
where you could be at peace.

242
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,000
How long and difficult
has your path been?

243
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,083
And then there's you,
jewel witch.

244
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,625
Ten years spent searching
for the family that you lost,

245
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,458
without any clues.
It must have been painful.

246
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:25,916
But I can save you all from
the curse of the Almighty God.

247
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,125
Don't you see?

248
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,916
It was from this
that I saved Joshua.

249
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,458
[ROSETTE] Stop saying
that, you bastard!

250
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,125
[AION] You're pointing that
gun at the wrong person.

251
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,916
The one you need to
defeat is in Heaven.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,708
Of course, creatures such as
yourselves cannot defeat Him.

253
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,875
But I can. Right, Chrono?

254
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,458
Isn't that the reason
why we accepted

255
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,791
being branded as Sinners?

256
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,041

00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,958
We should work... together.

00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:19,000
Apostle, for this purpose,
I need your power...

261

Azmaria Hendric.

262
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,666
Let me save you, my child.

[AION] Desist. You're not going
to shoot, and you know it.

I won't let you have Azmaria!

But you gave me
your brother.

[AION] Oh, poor, poor
Rosette Christopher.

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,000
But I can save even you.

Rosette!

273
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,958
[AION] Give yourself over
to me, Mary of Magdalene.

That's right!

It's time for you to spread
your Sinner's wings, Chrono!

Please, please
don't hurt my friends.

288
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,166
I'm begging you.

289
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,708
[AION] Just what I would
have expected from someone

290
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:12,125
who received God's blessing
as the Apostle of Charity.

291
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,833
No! Don't!

292
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,375
Doing this won't make
anything better, Azmaria.

293
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:27,000
[AION] Come with me... Apostle.

294
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,041
[AION] Gah!

295
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,416

00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,791
He's gone.
But will he be back?

298
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:43,416
Yeah. It's just started.

299
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,083
That thing that we defeated
wasn't the real Aion.

300
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,916
[AION] So, that's what
happens with a Shadow?

301
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,416
But for you to take the trouble
of sending out your Holy Mother.

302
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,375
A sly move indeed.

303
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,708
Perhaps a change
of strategy then.

304
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:05,041
Chrono, I'll leave that
Apostle with you for now.

305
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,250
[KATE] The restoration of
the barrier was successful.

306
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,625
But there is a much
bigger problem.

307
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:15,291
The secret plans of the
Sinners and their allies.

308
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,625
[COUNCIL LEADER]
There is also the matter

309
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,791
of the sealed third prophecy.

310
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:22,750
We must carefully fathom
what the Lord's intentions are.

311
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:29,416
[FIORE] That's right.
He's had another fit.

312
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,958
[JOSHUA] I'm looking
forward to it, Fi.

313
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,625
I want to meet
the others soon.

314
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,250
The other Apostles.

315
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:42,291
[FIORE] It appears that
I am not good enough.

316
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:47,250
I really think his real
older sister might be...

317

[ROSETTE laughs]

318
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,041
[ROSETTE] Oh, my gosh!

319
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,041
Father Remington asked
me out on a date!

320
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,375
[CHRONO] Oh.

321
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,541
[REMINGTON] Um, Rosette,
we've all been rather busy

322
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,375
with these cases, haven't we?

323
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,541
Perhaps we should spend a little
time talking about our future.

324
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,583
[ROSETTE] And just like that,
the two of us will board a train

325
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,458
and go away together.

326
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,583
[ROSETTE] Just kidding.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

327
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,375
[CHRONO] The weather report
says it's gonna rain tomorrow.

328
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,041
[REMINGTON]
Next episode, "Puppet."

329
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,958
[ROSETTE] What?
You're giving me a doll?

330
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,291
[ROSETTE] What do you
think I am, a kid?
