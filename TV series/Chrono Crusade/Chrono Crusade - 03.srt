you finished yet?

[GIRL A] In a little bit...

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,291
[GIRL B] Oh, you made a
flower ring! It's pretty.

6
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,666
[BOY] Hey, look at that!

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,125
[BOY] Oh.

00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,666
[gasps]

00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,916
[REMINGTON] It is called
the Prophecy of Fatima.

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,208
Three prophecies, entrusted by
the Virgin to three shepherds.

11
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:50,208
The first, that the Great War
would soon end, came to pass.

12
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,666
The second, that
in twenty years,

13
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,750
an even greater war will occur.

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,416
And the third,
still a mystery,

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,375
which the Pope in Rome
has ordered sealed away.

16
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,708
However, thanks to
certain inquiries,

17
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,916
the Order has come to
at least one conclusion.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It concerns "The Servants."

19
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,458
The appearance of
God's Apostles,

20
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,708
those who must be protected
by the Order of Magdalene,

21
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,166
no matter what the cost.

[ROSETTE] Shh.

24
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,291
[CHRONO whispering]
So, that girl's an Apostle?

25
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,375
[ROSETTE whispering]
That's right.

26
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,541
She's from Fatima, in Portugal.

27
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,666
She's only twelve, but she's
already a well-known soprano.

28
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,958
Her name is Azmaria Hendric.

29
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,083
[AZMARIA singing]

30
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,041
She was a singer
with an orchestra,

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,250
but got separated
when she got here,

32
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:50,333
and now they're forcing her to
sing into those weird machines.

33
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:53,458
And as for the orchestra,
it just vanished.

34
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:57,375
Father Remington's
looking into it, but...

35
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,333
You devil.

36
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,833
What? No, I just
looked over--

37
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,333
[ROSETTE] Shh. That's not
important right now. Look.

38
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,750
[CHRONO] Huh?

39
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,250
[ROSETTE] Do you see that
man in the first row?

40
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,958
That's Ricardo Hendric,

41
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,958
the hotel king and
owner of this theater.

42
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,625
He's also a big cheese
in devil worship.

43
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,291
[CHRONO gasps]

44
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,625
No, it couldn't be.

45
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,083
You know Hendric?

46
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,125
No, the man beside him.

47
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,875
[ROSETTE] What? Are you sure?

48
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,541
[CHRONO] Pretty sure.
We've bumped heads.

49
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,000
[ROSETTE] A devil?

50
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,666
Well, it proves one thing.

51
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,833
Hendric's success came
with a devil's contract.

52
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,000
[ROSETTE] So a girl who may be
one of the Apostles of God

53
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,833
is in the hands of
a master of devils.

54
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:43,166
Sounds like an explosive
combination, doesn't it?

55
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,500
[RICARDO] What do
you think, Lerajie?

56

[LERAJIE]
It's no use.

57
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,041
It's not even half of

[RICARDO] That's enough!
Go back to your room!

61
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,291
[AZMARIA] What? But I...

62
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,875
I said go!

63
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,500
Yes, as you wish sir.

64
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,625
[ROSETTE] That's our cue.
Let's get a wiggle on.

65
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,291
[CHRONO] Right!

00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,416
[AZMARIA] Yes, ma'am!

67
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,416
It's been two months
since we obtained that girl.

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,125
Are you sure that
she's the one?

69
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,000
No need to worry.

70
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,375
Although there are
still inconsistencies,

71
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,916
we're definitely beginning
to achieve results.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,666
She will awaken soon.

[RICARDO coughs]

[LERAJIE] I am aware that
little time remains.

Do not fail me.

00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,541

Your habit, nun-girl!

This is no time to be
gambling around in a casino!

But boopsie, we've come
all this way to Sin City,

so why not sin a little?

And besides, how often
does a girl get to wear

86
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,458
something like this?

Don't try to tell me
you don't like it, too.

Look, Chrono, look...

00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,291
Give me a coin!

Wah! I don't want to go.

private floor.

it's real hard not
getting spotted.

Don't complain, at least
you're inside the building.

[ROSETTE]
Well what'd you expect?

110
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,375
It sure would have blown this
vamp cover if I'd brought a kid.

Just remember, I'm counting

I'm sorry I scared you,
but I'm not a sinister type.

00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:08,291
Of course, that's probably not
very persuasive, considering.

Please, miss.

Please don't tell anyone that
you saw me hiding in here.

Calm down. It'll be fine.

In fact, bumping into each other
was a stroke of luck...

Do I know you, miss?

Heh, heh. I'm Sister Rosette,
and I've been sent

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,750
by the Order of Magdalene
to rescue you.

You're a Sister?

Yep, sometimes all that glitters
isn't a gold-digger, kid.

Now let's get while
the getting's good.

Don't worry, just
leave it all to me.

you must know

that this is a private floor,

153
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,000
so why would you be here?

I'm waiting for
your answer, please.

[AZMARIA] Please, sir, wait.

This guest was simply
looking for something,

and I was trying to help her.

158

If that is so, I suggest
we leave her to those

return to your room.

321
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,125
I can guess
where she's gone.

322
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,666
I'll go to that place
and retrieve them.

323
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,208
[ROSETTE] Hey!

324
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:42,666
Stop lollygagging
and get down here!

325
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,625
[CHRONO] Come on. Let's go!

326
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,833
This place is a lot
like the spot where

327
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,208
Rosette and I first
met each other.

328
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,083
That would have been when
she was about your age.

329
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,666
She was a stubborn,
obstinate girl, too,

330
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,041
unable to let others
see her tears.

331
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,041
Actually, now that
I think about it,

332
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,041
she probably sees
herself in you.

333
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,416
In me?

334
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,958
[CHRONO] Ah!

335
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,166
[ROSETTE laughs]

336
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,083
What is with you two?

337
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,541
I've never seen
such fretful faces.

338
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,083
That's overdoing it,
Rosette.

339
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,250
That was horrible.

340
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,333
[giggles]

341
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,208
Then if I'm so awful,
maybe you should

342
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,000
stop complaining and
do something about it!

343
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,166
[AZMARIA] Uh! Why, you!

344
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,583
Take that! And that!

345
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,958
Woo hoo! Ha! You missed!

346
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,666
You're too slo-- Ahhh!

347
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:38,833
Yeow.

348
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,000
[AZMARIA laughs]

349
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,500
[AZMARIA] You're too
slow, too, Rosette!

350
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:42,791
And now you're wet!

351
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,083
Take that! And that!

352
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,541
Take that! And that!

353
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,166
[ROSETTE] Gotcha! Gotcha!

354
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,375
There!

355
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,166
What's with you being
the only one untouched?

356
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,208
Yes, it's so much more fun
once you take the plunge!

357
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,666
[CHRONO] Well, in that case!

358
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,375
[splash]

359
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,291
[ROSETTE] Here you go.

360
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,208
[AZMARIA] Thank you.

361
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,416
[ROSETTE] So, it looks like
you've cheered up a bit.

362
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,958
[AZMARIA] Oh.

363
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,291
I can see the emotions
on your face.

364
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,458
When you're having
fun, have fun.

365
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,291
And when you're
angry, act angry.

366
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,958
And when you want to
cry your eyes out, do it!

367
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,708
Because after you've
cried, you feel better.

368
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,291
You know, you will be
able to smile again,

369
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,875
but when you keep your
problems to yourself,

370
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:53,166
and force yourself to smile, the
person it's hardest on is you.

371
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,666
At least, that's what
everyone tells me.

372
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,500
Achoo!

373
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,208
[CHRONO] Ugh. That's nasty.

374
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,291
You've caught a chill
acting like an idiot.

375
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,125
Be still, let me wipe
that runny nose.

376
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,375
[AZMARIA laughs]

377
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,375
Huh?

378
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,958
That's nasty.

379
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:20,125
[group laughs]

380
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:21,583
[CHRONO] Ah!

381
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:24,833
[LERAJIE] I have come to return
you home, my young mistress.

382
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,541
[AZMARIA] Lerajie!

383
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,250
[LERAJIE] All of the
preparations are now in order.

384
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,666
Did you enjoy your
brief taste of freedom?

385
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,250
[ROSETTE] Oh no, my gun!

386
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:41,000
Sinner Chrono, it's
been such a long time.

387
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,333
Viscount Lerajie.

388
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,041
[LERAJIE] Hmph! Locked into
a form such as this.

389
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,333
Have you fallen so far that
you cannot break free?

390
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,291
Well, that will end now.

391
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,125
Death is so final.

392
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,416
[LERAJIE laughs]

393
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,250
[AZMARIA] No! Wait!
I'll go with you...

394
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,916
if you promise not to
hurt these people.

395
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What are you saying?
You can't do that!

396
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,458
Azmaria, no!

397
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,833
[AZMARIA] It can't be helped.

398
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:12,791
I told you, I always bring
misery to the people around me.

399
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,333
But thank you for today.
I will never forget it.

400
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,166
Azmaria!

401
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,125
How noble.

402
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,333
So young, yet so willing
to sacrifice herself.

403
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:29,625
But for naught!

404
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,208
[ROSETTE] Are you all right?

405
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,333
[LERAJIE] I'm afraid the fates
of these two were preordained!

406
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,625
[AZMARIA] No! You promised!

407
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,583
[LERAJIE] Time to die!

408
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,958
[AZMARIA] No!

409
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,875
[AZMARIA] It's always my fault.
Everyone gets hurt.

410
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:26,708
[AZMARIA] Rosette,
Chrono, please don't be...

411
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,625
[ROSETTE]
Ah, don't worry, I'm fine!

412
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,041
[AZMARIA] Rosette?!

413
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:32,291
[CHRONO] Yeah, well if
Rosette's got one good point,

414
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,541
it's that she's durable.

415
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,375
[AZMARIA] Durable? Is that
word quite strong enough?

416
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,375
[ROSETTE] Now I'm going to
give that guy in the pointy hat

417
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,416
a real working over!

418
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,625
Sinner, Attack!

419
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,541
[CHRONO] What? You mean me?!

420
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,416
[AZMARIA]
Next episode, "Sinner."

421
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,875
[ROSETTE] I'm going to
break the seal, Chrono.
