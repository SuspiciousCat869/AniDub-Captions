[YOUNG FIORE] What's wrong?
Did mother scold you?

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,666
She said, "You're so different
from your big sister."

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,333
[YOUNG FIORE] Do not cry.
You can do it.

[YOUNG SATELLA] Un-unh.

00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,166
[YOUNG FIORE]
Here's what I think.

9
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,583
The power of emotions
that you feel inside...

10
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,291
can transcend a
person's talent.

11
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,000
[YOUNG SATELLA] Transcend?

12
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,541
[YOUNG FIORE]
It means "overcome."

13
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,291
And not just talent,
but destiny.

14
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,375
And even a person's death.

15
00:02:55,458 --> 00:03:00,833
I believe strong feelings
can overcome everything.

00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,333
[YOUNG SATELLA] Huh?

18
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,875
For this reason,

This should allow
you to battle Aion

Right now the Order is

They can't stop you from
facing him on your own,

can't provide you

You must use this weapon
to defeat Aion, Chrono.

No matter what, you
can't allow yourself

to change to your true form.

166
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,541
Kommen!

167
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:44,083
Seize her, like the grape vines
that proclaim their ripeness!

168
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,416
Combine! Abundant October!

169
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,541
Furchtbar Waage!

[FIORE gasps]

171
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:11,375
[SATELLA] There's no escaping
this time, Big Sister.

172
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,166
Please, tell me why did you ally
yourself with Aion, Florette?

173
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,250
[FIORE]
My name is Fiore!

174
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,708
It's Florette!

175
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,125
You're my sister, and your
name is Florette Harvenheit!

176
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:28,833
[FIORE] No. I am nothing
more than a doll.

177
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,583
Just a shadow.

[YOUNG SATELLA]
Mother! Mother!

[YOUNG SATELLA cries]

180
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,791
Mother! Mother!

181
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm warning you,
leave now!

182
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,875
I will not allow
this to continue!

00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,333
Kommen sie!

184
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,208
Aahhh!

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,708
Florette!

00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,916
[YOUNG SATELLA cries]

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,250
Florette!

188
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,625
[YOUNG FIORE] It's all right.

189
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,666
Don't worry,
I'm going to protect you.

190
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,958
Florette! Florette!

191
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:26,666
[YOUNG SATELLA cries]

192
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,416
[YOUNG FIORE] I promise.

193
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,708
I promise I will protect you.

194
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,708
Always.

195
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,541
Please don't cry.

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,666
Sister?

197
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,875
[FIORE] I exist only
to protect Lord Joshua!

198
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,500
[SATELLA] But I'm
the one you protected!

199
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,625
I'm your sister!

200
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,750
Aion has replaced
all of your memories.

201
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,791
Why can't you see that?!

202
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,375
Kommen.

203
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,916
Erscheinen.
The Honest September.

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,750
Zauber Jungfrau.

205
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,041
But how?
You're inside my barrier?

206
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,875
And you have no jewels.

207
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,708
[SATELLA yells]

208
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,041
[SATELLA] Please!

209
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,083
Stop it, Big Sister!

210
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,375
Wake up! Remember who you are!

211
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,708
Ahhh!

212
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,916
Please, you're my sister,
I don't want to fight you!

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,166
[FIORE] Until you release this
barrier, I will show no mercy.

214
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,958
[ANNA] There.

215
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,666
We're counting
on you, Anna.

216
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,875
Just leave it to us.

217
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,166
Okay, it's
Sergeant York time.

218
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,083
[MARY] Right.

219
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,833
[CLAIRE]
Let's get a wiggle on.

220
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,208
[CHRONO sighs]

221
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,958
[AION]
So you've come.

222
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,708
There's no need to worry,

223
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,833
for the Lord is always
standing by your side.

224
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,416
[CHRONO]
Rosette, it's us!

225
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,541
[ROSETTE] Hm?

226
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,125
[CHRONO gasps]

227
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,500
Just what did you do to her?!

228
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,500
But I didn't do anything.

229
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,833
She's acting out of
her own free will.

230
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:28,208
She hands out mercy and miracles
in the name of Magdalene,

231
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,416
all for her own atonement.

232
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,208
No, Chrono,
don't do it here!

233
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,333
There are too many innocent
people who might get hurt.

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,666
[ROSETTE] Aion...

235
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,333
[CHRONO gasps]

236
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,416
...shouldn't we
be going now?

237
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,125
[AION] As you wish.

238
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,833
Aaahhhh!

240
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,333
[WOMAN E] That man
did something to her!

241
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,708
[CROWD]
She's bleeding!

242
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,333
[MAN]
Someone call a doctor!

243
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,833
[MAN B]
What is going on?

244
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:15,541
He looks like a devil.

245
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,000
You're right, he's a devil!

246
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,208
--A devil?
--What's a devil doing here?

247
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,916
Behold, for an imposter
will never escape

248
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,875
the power of the Lord.

249
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,000
No matter what form he takes,
he will be exposed.

250
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,083
Those who do not
know the Lord

251
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,708
cannot lay hands
on the Holy Woman.

252
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,458
He means to defile
the Holy Woman.

00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,083
[MAN F] He's a devil!
Kill the devil!

of the Magdalene Order!

258
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,916
[CROWD]
Kill him now!

Please, Florette, stop this!

[FIORE]
I'm not Florette.

263

Your sister died
ten years ago.

264
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,083
I am the fleeting rage
that Florette left behind

265
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,958
in this world.

266
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,958
I am a doll,
fashioned by Lord Aion

267
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,166
from her lifeless body.

268
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,958
[SATELLA gasps]

269
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,041
My heart is a cold
hardened jewel,

270
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,083
not a thing of weak flesh.

271
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,500
[SATELLA] It can't be.

272
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,083
[FIORE] As long as I have it,
I can endure forever.

273
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,333
[SATELLA] No.

274

[FIORE] I will always
be Lord Joshua's sister.

That's a lie!

Strong emotions can
overcome everything...

277
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,000
talent and destiny,
and even a person's death!

278
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,708
Isn't that what you said?!

279
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,541
Then where did
my big sister go?!

280
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,416
Her past... her smile...

281
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,083
everything has been lost...
leaving only my memories.

282
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,541
Give me back my big sister!

[SATELLA] My beloved Florette,
who was always so kind...

She's been...

Aaahhh!

[FIORE]
These efforts are useless.

I am only a shadow of what was.

288

[SATELLA]
...consumed by a devil!

[SATELLA]
It's not... over yet.

ever come back...

Chrono, go after her.

Rosette is bound by the past,
exactly like me.

You must cut
that bond quickly.
