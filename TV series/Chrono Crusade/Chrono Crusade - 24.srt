1
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,125
Here you go!

2
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:30,916
[ghostly moan]

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,083
Ahh!

4
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:32,750
[BILLY]
Can't catch me!

5
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,083
[SEIRA] Hey!

6
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,708
Kevin, come back here and
help us with the chores!

7
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,125
It's you and Billy's
turn to do it today!

8
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,416
[NELLY]
It's your turn!

9
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,416
[SEIRA] Honestly!

10
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,166
[NELLY] Honestly!

11
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,541
--Huh?
--Huh?

12
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:45,750
Hello you two.

13
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,833
Sister Azmaria!

14
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,291
Sister!

15
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,625
[JEAN] As you can see, the
children are doing wonderfully.

16
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,291
As always, thank you for
everything you've done.

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,208
[KATE] Oh no,
it's wonderful to see

18
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,208
that the children
are doing so well.

19
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,166
[JEAN] Mhmm. From the
moment we were revived,

20
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,708
it's been just like before.

21
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,833
I'm certainly glad that we're
living here in the country.

22
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,125
Four years have
passed in New York,

23
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,791
so I'm sure it's
changed quite a bit.

24
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,625
Yes, it has.

25
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,791
[JEAN sighs]

26
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,375
By the way, has Rosette...

27
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,416
[KATE] No, we still
haven't found her.

28
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,958
What a shame.

29
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:28,125
Please Sister,
sing us a song!

30
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,333
But I haven't even finished

31
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,375
reading you the
story yet, Nelly.

32
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,208
I'd like to hear you
sing, too, Sister.

33
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,416
I don't know why,
but for some reason,

34
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,541
when I hear you sing
it really relaxes me.

35
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:42,375
But... my power is gone.

36
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,208
[SEIRA]
You've said that before.

37
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,833
It was called
spiritual power, right?

38
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,375
But that isn't
exactly what I mean.

39
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,333
It's just that it makes me
feel warm inside when you sing.

40
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,375
Your song echoes
in my heart.

41
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,333
It really does.

42
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,416
It really does!

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,083
Thank you, Seira, Nelly.

44
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,458
In that case I'll sing!

45
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,125
[NELLY] Wah!

46
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:13,708
♪ Lo, He comes with
clouds descending ♪

47
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:19,625

48
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:28,458

49
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,583
♪ God appears on
Earth to reign... ♪

50
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,416
I'm certainly glad
Sister Azmaria is here.

51
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,333
She's a godsend.

52
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,458
Her singing voice
is remarkable,

53
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:43,166
and it has such a wonderful
effect on the children.

54
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,583
Actually though,
she keeps telling me that

55
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:50,291
she wants to become a Sister,
exactly like Rosette.

56
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,791
Oh yes, there's something
I forgot to tell you.

57
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,458
Yesterday, the children said

58
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,333
they want to go
and visit Joshua.

59
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,541
You mean take
them to New York?

60
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,416
But if they see
him as he is now,

61
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,625
they're certain to feel
the difference in time.

62
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:08,208
I imagine they are simply trying
to help Joshua in their own way.

63
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,416
And after all, we cannot avert
our eyes from reality forever.

64
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,125
Remington, have you
been down here before?

65
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,333
[REMINGTON] Once before,

66
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,166
when I first brought Rosette
and Chrono to the Order.

67
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,916
If you knew this
place was here,

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,166
then why didn't you
tell me about it?

69
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,250
I'm sorry, it was
because I had to conceal

70
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,083
the knowledge of Magdalene
deep within myself.

71
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,000
I see.
I did the same.

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,375
Just as I thought.

73
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,500
Rosette and Chrono did
come here, after all.

74
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,375
[ELDER] It's been
a while, Magdalene...

75
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,166
But I imagine
I'll be coming along

76
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,625
to join you before too long.

77
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:05,208
[REMINGTON gasps]

78
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,416
[ELDER] Huh?!

79
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,041
[ELDER] Horns!

80
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,875
Are they Chrono's?

81
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:16,375
No. More than likely,
they belong to Aion.

82
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,000
But what are
they doing here?

83
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,500
[REMINGTON] Perhaps Magdalene
made an effort to calm Aion,

84
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:27,708
and Rosette and Chrono
are both so kind.

85
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,083
[gasps]

86
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,291
So that's the answer.

87
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,291
[ELDER]
Huh?

88
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:40,708
[REMINGTON] Aion's horns
have the power to move time...

89
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,500
the exact opposite of Chrono's.

90
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,000
The release of
the time freeze

91
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,541
could never have
been accomplished

92
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,875
without using the power
of Aion's horns.

93
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,000
Just what are
you trying to do?

94
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,583
[ELDER] Because of
what this place is,

95
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,875
I thought Rosette might be here.

96
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,333
But no good.

97
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,333
It's ironic, isn't it...

98
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,958
that we needed
our enemy's power?

99
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,333
Aion's power wasn't
just moving time.

100
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:11,333
His deeds have advanced
the times themselves.

101
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,208
[REMINGTON]
Although its span was brief,

102
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:17,333
the overabundance of faith
in Rosette's stigmata

103
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,125
gripped the entire country

104
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,375
and blurred the line between
justice and violence.

105
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,291
[ELDER] A realization of
the second Prophecy.

106
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,416
A great war will begin...

107
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,208
in the near future without fail.

108
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,666
I wonder why your
boss won't stop it.

109
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,875
Why? I've no
desire to ask.

110
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,458
So you really hate
Him now, do you?

111
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,500
Oh, I have no
hatred for Him.

112
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,291
I have simply ended
our relationship.

113
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,333
I've no attachment
to torn wings.

114
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,041
But by losing them,

115
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:52,583
you will acquire an even
heavier cross to bear.

116
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,166
It's the least I can
do as an atonement.

117
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,750
[DETECTIVE B] The Crusaders
just keep rolling in.

118
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,875
They still claim it's
all for the Holy Woman

119
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,666
and the revolution.

120
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,208
Fortunately, there isn't
any lateral communication yet,

121
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,125
but I shudder to think what will
happen when they come together

122
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,708
and start this Crusade
they've been waiting for.

123
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,458
That'll be a right mess.

124
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,958
[PRISONER A] Is that
the Holy Woman?!

125
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:19,708
[ANNA] Ahh!

126
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,458
Pipe down, you!
That's enough!

127
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,208
[PRISONER A] They dare to put a
Crusader in a place like this?!

128
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,875
They're agents of the devils!

129
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,416
Bring down Heaven's punishment!

130
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,625
[PRISONER B] She's here?!

131
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,833
[PRISONER C]
The Holy Woman is here!

132
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:33,291
[PRISONER D]
The Holy Woman!

133
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,791
And the worst thing is
it isn't over yet.

134
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,416
[MARY] 
Mm-hmm.

135
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,166
[MARY]
Stop the car!

136
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,375
[MARY] Rosette!

137
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,333
Mary!

138
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,416
Wait! Rosette, wait!

139
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:58,625
Rosette!

140
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,000
Excuse me?

141
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:04,375
Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

142
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,958
Mary...

143
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,166
I'm sure that she'll
be back some day.

144
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,333
After all, she is
Rosette you know.

145
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,458
So, let a smile be
your umbrella, okay?

146
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,833
[MARY] Okay.

147
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,541
[door opens]

148
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,458
[typing sounds]

149
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,250
I'm back.

150
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,041
[CLAIRE]
Oh, welcome home, Father.

151
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,333
You forget that I'm not
a minister anymore, Claire.

152
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,375
I'm sorry, sir.

153
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,083
[REMINGTON] Hmm?

154
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:37,625
Oh, Joshua was working on
this picture a few hours ago,

155
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,291
but then he stopped
to write a story.

156
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,708
[REMINGTON]
A story, eh?

157
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,916
[CLAIRE] Yes, I think this
was one of the illustrations.

158
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,291
[REMINGTON]
So, Joshua...

159
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,708
Oh, hi Ewan.

160
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,416
[REMINGTON]
You're writing a story, huh?

161
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,750
[JOSHUA]
Mhmm, an adventure novel.

162
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:56,166
Well, you've always wanted to
become a novelist, haven't you?

163
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,333
[JOSHUA]
Yeah, but it's pretty hard.

164
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,583
But Sister Claire taught me
how to use the typewriter

165
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,125
and I'm finally
getting the hang of it.

166
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,625
And would this drawing
be one of the scenes

167
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,208
from the novel
you're working on?

168
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,583
That's right!

169
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,916
This part here is
called the Astral Line.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,458
See it's this great river of
life that flows through space.

171
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,250
[REMINGTON] Did you think
that up yourself?

172
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,500
[JOSHUA] Of course.
This girl is the main character.

173
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,166
She's very strong,

174
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,458
and in order to defeat the bad
guys who want the Astral Line,

175
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,083
she goes on a journey
to battle them with

176
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:30,083
her younger brother and her
partner who's from outer space.

177
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,583
It sounds interesting.

178
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,208
You really think so?!

179
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,833
Well, then when I'm finished,
will you read it first?

180
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,291
[REMINGTON]
O-Of course!

181
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,208
[REMINGTON]
Claire, thank you for today.

182
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:47,041
Give Sister Kate my regards.

183
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,291
Sure, I'll tell her.

184
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,250
Will he stay like this?

185
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,750
Will Joshua have the heart
of a twelve year old forever?

186
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,333
Caught between God and Man,

187
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,791
he destroyed his own heart
in order to protect himself.

188
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,208
Joshua is proof of my sin.

189
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,833
But you can't
mean that, sir.

190
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,583
[REMINGTON]
I am... a Sinner.

191
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,000
[REMINGTON]
Rosette, where are you?

192
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,583
[CHRONO] Rosette...

193
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:50,583
Come sit with me,
the sun's so warm today.

194
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,291
You know, I really
do like this view.

195
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,458
I wish that I could just
go on looking at it forever.

196
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,708
[ROSETTE] Hey...

197
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,791
[CHRONO] Hm?

198
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,875
[ROSETTE] I was thinking
about undoing the seal.

199
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,291
If I did it, then you could
heal all of your wounds,

200
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,833
and everything would be jake.

201
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,750
[CHRONO]
Oh, applesauce, Rosette.

202
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,833
Being here with you is what's
really important right now.

203
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,791
And I don't want to
lose anything else...

204
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,000
...not ever again.

205
00:12:55,958 --> 00:13:01,333
I think about them sometimes and
wonder how everyone is doing.

206
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,750
[CHRONO] Uh-huh.

207
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:07,666
But for right now, I'd rather
just be here with you.

208
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,375
In these last few months
we've spent together,

209
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:30,625
I've wanted to say
so many things to you,

210
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,833
but the words
just won't come.

211
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
[CHRONO]
Let's go back inside.

212
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,458
I think you should
lie down and rest.

213
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,916
[ROSETTE] But I don't
want to rest yet.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,500
Not yet.

215
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,375
I'm just...

216
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,958
[sobbing]

217
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,833
...so scared, Chrono!

218
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,333
[ROSETTE] I'm scared!

219
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,166
I don't want to die!

220
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,041
[sobbing]

221
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:13,208
I... just want to
live a little longer.

222
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:15,041
Is that so wrong?

223
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,708
Oh, Rosette...

224
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,500
[ROSETTE cries]

225
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:48,625
[ticking]

226
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,625
Chrono...

227
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,791
[ROSETTE] Thank you.

228
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,166
[ticking stops]

229
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,833
[phone rings]

230
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,833
Yes?

231
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:35,666
[gasps]

232
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,583
Where are they?

233
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:50,000
[crying sounds]

234
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,833
[AZMARIA sobs]

235
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,375
[REMINGTON]
They found them?

236
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,958
But it's been so long.

237
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,333
[KATE] Yes, nearly
six months in fact.

238
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:51,125
But it appears that the two of
them found some happiness first.

239
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,875
Remington, I have to
ask you something.

240
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,666
And what is it?

241
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,000
[KATE] Will the soul of someone
who has made a contract

242
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,958
with a devil be
condemned to Hell?

243
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,583
No, that's just superstition.

244
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:12,416
Thank you. Thank you
for saying that.

245
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,041
That girl... truly believed.

246
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,583
Even though she
contracted with a devil...

247
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:22,458
She always followed
the teachings of mercy.

248
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,500
I believe Rosette's soul
was the most virtuous spirit

249
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,000
that I will ever know.

250
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:33,083
Remington, do you have
any desire to come back?

251
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,708
I'm afraid I can't, Sister.

252
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,791
[KATE]
I understand.

253
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:49,958
But Remington, I will
not abandon my faith.

254
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,833
Yes, I see. I thought
that you would say that.

255
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:58,125
Thank you for telling
me, Sister Kate.

256
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,541
You're working
rather hard, Joshua.

257
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,916
[JOSHUA]
Of course I am!

258
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,166
I have to finish drawing it so
you can look at it, don't I?

259
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,125
There's no need
to be in a rush.

260
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,833
I have all the time
in the world to wait.

261
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,166
It won't that long,
I'll be done real soon 'kay?

262
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,125
[REMINGTON] Sure.

263
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,791
[REMINGTON] And the times
continue to move.

264
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,250
As we head toward
the second Prophecy,

265
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,250
things are approaching
the boiling point.

266
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:33,166
In Chicago, the Saint
Valentine's Day Massacre...

267
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,750
in Berlin, Bloody May Day...

268
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,125
in Jerusalem, the
Wailing Wall Incident...

269
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,041
and Black Thursday.

270
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,375
The worst crash ever to hit
the New York Stock Exchange.

271
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,083
It stirred up
uncertainty and despair

272
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:55,291
and inspired a rash of suicides.

273
00:18:55,375 --> 00:19:00,250
Its impact will be felt
throughout the world.

274
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,708
In Germany,

275
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:05,541
a rising faction is calling
for general conscription.

276
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:13,041
This era is clearly trying to
choose the path to turmoil.

277
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:17,750
Why? So many people
will die again.

278
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,041
Why?

279
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,208
[KATE] Can this
truly be Your will?

280
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,375
At least Rosette and
the others were spared

281
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,333
from seeing what is to come...

282
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:29,958
the Prophecy...

283
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:34,250
the one of war that is
soon to be fulfilled.

284
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,375
In that, one could say,
that they were truly blessed.

285
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,208
[knocking]

286
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,958
Come in.

287
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,125
Yes, what is it?

288
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,666
There's a report
from the Miami branch.

289
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,375
They say another person
with stigmata has appeared.

290
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,083
Stigmata?

291
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,125
[KATE] Is this the
revelation of a new age?

292
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,166
[AION] It is the dawn
of a wondrous age.

293
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,208
I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the beginning and the end.

294
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,791
One plot has
been completed,

295
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,416
in order to open the next door.

296
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:32,250
[AZMARIA] Rosette, Chrono,
I will become stronger!

297
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:35,125
So please, watch
over me, okay?

298
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,250
[REMINGTON]
Great forefathers...

299
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:54,958
Just like you, I am
a spectator to this era,

300
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:58,375
until I have atoned for my sins.

301
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,583
I will live forever.

302
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,583
[thud]

303
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:13,333
[AION] I am eternity
given birth by desire,

304
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,333
the shadow cast by God.

305
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,875
Pandemonium was
filled with light,

306
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,333
and Heaven with darkness.

307
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,125
Look at the times.

308
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,750
No matter how hard
people struggle,

309
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,875
their fates are in our hands.

310
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,625
[gunshot]
