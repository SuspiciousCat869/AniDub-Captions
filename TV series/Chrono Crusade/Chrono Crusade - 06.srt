1
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,750
[UNDERLING A] Is it copacetic
to be handling this stuff, boss?

2
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,750
[BOSS] Pipe down
and do your job.

3
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,125
As long as they're sealed,

4
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,708
these crates are nothing
more than shipments of art.

5
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:37,208
Whoa!

6
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,291
It can't be!

7
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,333
The seals on these are
supposed to be perfect!

8
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,166
[SATELLA] Do you suppose
it might be scared...

9
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,291
of little old me?

10
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,375
Quite an impressive bit of
smuggling you have here, nicht?

11
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,041
But it wouldn't have been worth
hunting for if it weren't.

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,083
Yeah? And just
who're you?

13
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,083
I'm a hexen, dummkopf.

14
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,208
Hein juwel hexen!
A jewel witch!

15
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:14,083
[REMINGTON] And it came from
a mafia accountant, you say?

16
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:15,583
[KATE] Yes, that's
what the militia

17
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:17,833
we sent to Chicago reported.

18
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:19,958
They plan on using
them as enforcers

19
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,166
for their
illegal operations.

20
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,208
[REMINGTON] I'd prefer to
stay out of the disputes

21
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,666
of this fleeting world,

22
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,791
but these powers are just
too much for them to handle.

23
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,250
And the full extent of
their folly will not be known

24
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,916
until it is staring them
right in the face.

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,208
So, who are you sending after
these smugglers, Sister Kate?

26
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,791
[KATE] Oh, saints preserve me,

27
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,416
there was only one
militia available.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,583
So, it's Rosette's
first mission.

29
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,958
And I'd so wanted
to see her off.

30
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,416
She was enthusiastic,
I gather?

31
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,666
[KATE] The problem is that
she's too enthusiastic!

32
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,541
And the Elder gave her
some strange new bullets!

33
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,708
But she's taking an
escort with her, right?

34
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:03,500
She must understand
the situation.

35
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:07,250
[KATE] Oh, wouldn't it
be nice if she did?

36
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,625
[ROSETTE] Huh? It's not here.

37
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,125
[CHRONO] Um, Rosette,

38
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,625
are you certain this
is the right warehouse?

39
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,375
[ROSETTE] That's strange.

40
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:21,166
I was sure this is where
they said it happened.

41
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,708
[CHRONO] Hey, what's wrong?

42
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,250
Um... it's nothing.

43
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,625
Just focus on your job,
and you'll be fine.

44
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,083
Well, I'll try.

45
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,208
Ain't this a kick?

46
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,916
We came here all fired
up to fight bad guys,

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,083
and now we find out
someone fed us a lie!

48
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:36,208
Ah! This is so not fair!

49
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,958
[explosion]

50
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:41,250
[CHRONO] Oh, no!
It was one block over!

51
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,250
[ROSETTE] Follow me, men!

52
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,958
--[CHRONO] Right!
--[AZMARIA] R-Right!

53
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:49,000
[AZMARIA] This is my first
mission. I've got to do my best!

54
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,458
[AZMARIA] Huh? Ah!

55
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,750
[AZMARIA screams]

56
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,333
[AZMARIA screams]

57
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,708
[ROSETTE] Oh, no!

58
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,666
Are you all right?
Were you hurt, liebchen?

59
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,375
Oh, no, I'm fine.

60
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,958
That's good. Now scram,
kid, so I can work.

61
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,291
What?

62
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,375
[SATELLA] Hmph. I can't
believe such a small child

63
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,666
would attract such
a large monster.

64
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,291
Kommen sie!

65
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:35,208
Spirit, I command you!
Now take form, my brave May!

66
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,708
Rip them apart!

67
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,750
Like a glimmer twinkling
amongst the green leaves!

68
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,458
Mutigster!

69
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,875
Erlöschen!

70
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,166
[AZMARIA] Jeepers.

71
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,916
[CHRONO] A jewel summoner.

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,291
[ROSETTE] Hey, lady!

73
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,666
Who in the heck are you?

74
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,375
[SATELLA] Hmm?

75
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,875
And you'd be...
the Magdalene Order.

76
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,666
[ROSETTE] The warehouse!

77
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,291
[roaring]

78
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,666
Now Hell's breaking loose.

79
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,416
--[tires screech]
--[SATELLA] Huh?

80
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,375
[SATELLA] You won't get away!

81
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:42,291
[ROSETTE] Hey, you're not just
going to leave, are you?

82
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,500
I thought the reason
your order existed

83
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,333
was to handle these things.

84
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:46,875
Was I wrong,
Miss Magdalene?

85
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,625
Look, you're the one
who made this mess,

86
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,333
so it's your job to clean
it up, you dumb dora.

87
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,583
[roaring and gunshots]

88
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,833
Azmaria, put up the barrier!

89
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,291
Right!

90
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,291
It appears that
I have no choice.

91
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,208
Let's clean this mess
up quickly then.

92
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,458
By the way, my name
is Rosette Christopher.

93
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,541
And you'd be?

94
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,166
Satella.
I'm Satella Harvenheit.

95
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,958
[ROSETTE] All right,
let's get started!

96
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,500
Erlöschen!

97
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,500
Whew. Just one more left.

98
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,625
Azmaria! Behind you!

99
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,041
[AZMARIA screams]

100
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,791
Azmaria!

101
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,375
[CHRONO] Ah! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

102
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,875
Oh! I'm sorry!

103
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,041
Oh, no, not this time!

104
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,958
I'm so sorry,
this is all my fault.

105
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:58,666
I'm all right, really.

106
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,583
Take that! And that!
And that! And that!

107
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,083
I'm sorry, does it hurt bad?

108
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,625
[SATELLA] That boy,
he couldn't be...

109
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,833
It looks like the smugglers
released some of the goods

110
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,250
in order to buy enough time
to take it on the lam.

111
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,875
[SATELLA] You there, what in
the world are you thinking?

112
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,208
He was burned by
holy water, wasn't he?

113
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,458
How can you be a Sister

114
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,750
when you fight alongside
something like that?!

115
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,250
And what is he up to...

116
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,833
...worming his way into
the Magdalene Order?

117
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,666
Chrono is the best partner
anyone could ask for.

118
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,875
He's not like the others.

119
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,458
No matter what form
he might take,

120
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,958
he's still the same inside!

121
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:44,166
A bloodthirsty monster!
A devil is a devil!

122
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,500
What game are you playing?

123
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,125
Tell me now, you monster!

124
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,166
[ROSETTE] Leave him alone!

125
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,791
Stop, Rosette!

126
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,541
Listen, please!

127
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,791
Chrono really isn't bad.

128
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,208
I know that I haven't
known him personally

129
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,625
for all that long yet,

130
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,958
but I know he's very kind.
He really is different.

131
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,041
Besides, there are a lot of
other people in the world

132
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,333
who are much worse.

133
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,291
[SATELLA] I can't believe
that stone ran out

134
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,041
at a time like this.

135
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,000
Just make sure he doesn't
eat you for a bedtime snack.

136
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,625
[CHRONO] Cut it out, Rosette.

137
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,750
[ROSETTE] Huh? But why?

138
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,500
Don't you get mad when
someone acts like that?

139
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,250
Well...

140
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,458
It's not like she's
entirely wrong.

141
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,291
But Chrono...

142
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,541
[AZMARIA] "Satella Harvenheit,

143
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,916
a bounty hunter who
specializes in devils.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,416
She is also known
as the 'Jewel Witch'.

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,625
She makes no distinction between
any of the devil factions."

146
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,833
That's what it says.

147
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,833
[ROSETTE] Yes, ma'am. Right!

148
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,750
I'm so sorry. Yes.

149
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,125
When I return,
I'll be sure to...

150
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,166
Yes. Uh...

151
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,958
[CHRONO] Was Sister Kate
having kittens?

152
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,333
[ROSETTE] She said to continue
the mission on foot.

153
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,458
[AZMARIA laughs lightly]

154
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,583
And this time it
really was an act of God!

155
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:20,958
So why am I the one
having to do penance?

156
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,875
[shower runs]

157
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,708
[SATELLA gasps]

158
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,291
[SATELLA] That devil...

159
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,333
[SATELLA] Ahh!

160
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,583
[SATELLA] How could one of
the Magdalene's militia

161
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:01,208
have a devil as her partner?

162
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,916
A devil?

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,750
Really. Who can you trust?

164
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,916
This whole world's going
to Hell in a hand basket.

165
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,583
Indeed, mistress.

166
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,791
[BOSS] Dammit! The whole
warehouse district

167
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,625
has been sealed off, and
there are cops everywhere.

168
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,958
[UNDERLING A] Wait a second,
what are you doing there?

169
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,375
[BOSS] Stow it!

170
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,583
I'm not going to sit here
and wait to get arrested!

171
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,416
[AZMARIA] This is...

172
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,750
[ROSETTE] It's best not to look.

173
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,708
Such pointless gluttony.

174
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,666
I can still feel its desire
to devour all forms of life.

175
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,458
Such strong desires
suggest undead.

176
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,166
[SATELLA] How impressive
that you know so much

177
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,750
about your own kind.

178
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,916
[ROSETTE] Hey! You're that
jewel whatzit from last night!

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,666
So what do you
want this time?

180
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,875
Oh I've come here
after the smugglers.

181
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,916
It is my job.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,541
So you've been up
the whole night, too?

183
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,166
No, I wouldn't waste
my time so inefficiently.

184
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,166
Once I had the basic
facts, I went back home

185
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,000
and took a long relaxing
shower to refresh myself.

186
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,583
Meanwhile we've
been out walking

187
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,166
from one crime scene
to another all night!

188
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,833
[SATELLA] Which means the
danger's still spreading

189
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,291
unchecked, I guess.

190
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,541
This is becoming
a real nuisance.

191
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,958
[ROSETTE] And who's
to blame for that?

192
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,666
Didn't you say you'd
find the smugglers?

193
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,000
And I did find them...
or their corpses.

194
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,291
[AZMARIA gasps]

195
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,583
[SATELLA] Although perhaps
"scattered leavings"

196
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:58,083
would be more accurate.

197
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,750
The scene there was
pretty much like this.

198
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,500
Did the smugglers unleash
more of them last night?

199
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,041
Or did they escape by
breaking the seals themselves?

200
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,166
It's the same
to me either way.

201
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,166
Thanks to this,
I'm looking at a big loss.

202
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,000
Why would you say
something like that?

203
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,291
I'm not compensated
for dead bodies.

204
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,958
Not all of us work for
charity like you do, Sister.

205
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,166
Hey, we put our lives
on the line, too!

206
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,166
[CHRONO] Let it be, Rosette.

207
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,708
But exactly why
are you here?

208
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,958
You're not getting
paid for this, are you?

209
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,416
[SATELLA] It's what I do.

210
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,125
And once I've taken on a job,

211
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:36,625
I've committed myself to the
bitter end, Hell or high water.

212
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,916
Well, good for you!

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,416
Looks like some of that
padding might be moral fiber.

214
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,708
What was that?!

215
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,791
Why don't we work together
on this, Buttercups?

216
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,041
After all, we are working
toward the same goal.

217
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,708
You... You can't be serious!

218
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,625
There's no way I'm
working with a devil!

219
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,166
No way!

220
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,000
[ROSETTE chuckles]

221
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,166
[SATELLA] Stop following me!

222
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,583
[ROSETTE] You just happen to
be walking in front of us.

223
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:16,458
[SATELLA] I'm following the
devil's aura, you dummkopf!

224
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,625
What a strange coincidence.
That's what we're doing, too!

225
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,750
I wonder why we're both
going in the same direction.

226
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,125
[AZMARIA]
Chrono, is there a good reason

227
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,000
why we have to run
after Satella?

228
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,583
I've been wanting to ask
Rosette the same question!

229
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:51,916
[ROSETTE] And we've
been up all night, too!

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,625
Your competitive nature
is going to kill us.

231
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,916
[ROSETTE] I'm just
a little stubborn.

232
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,333
But that vamp over
there is a worthy rival.

233
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:04,166
[SATELLA] Well, thanks for that.

234
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,375
[ROSETTE sniffs]

235
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,416
I smell something yummy.

236
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,583
[CHRONO] Hot dawg! Hot dogs!

237
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,041
[ROSETTE] Food!

238
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,708
[CHRONO] I'm seeing
a man about a dog.

239
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,958
Chrono! Make sure that
he puts double mustard

240
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,416
and ketchup on mine! Got that?

241
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,666
[AZMARIA] And Chrono,

242
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,875
tell them not to put any
mustard on mine, please.

243
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,250
Otherwise I won't be
able to stop hiccupping.

244
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:41,833
Here.

245
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,458
[noisily eating]

246
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,583
[SATELLA] Listen to that! Do you
know how vulgar you sound?

247
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,000
[ROSETTE coughs]

248
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,041
[SATELLA] Is this even
supposed to be edible?

249
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,625
Not a word of thanks,
and then you say that?

250
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:06,833
There's not the slightest
hint of it ever being smoked.

251
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,250
This scrap meat
is so awful,

252
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,041
I don't think it could
be called a wurst.

253
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,416
Uh, what's a wurst?

254
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,333
Oh, that means
sausage in German,

255
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,291
so you must be from Germany!

256
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:16,958
Oh, I'm sorry.

257
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,208
[SATELLA sighs]

258
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,916
You're very astute.

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I came to America just
after the Great War.

260
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,458
It's almost ten years now.

261
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,166
Uh, ten years?

262
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,708
On business?

263
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,125
[SATELLA] Searching for someone.

264
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,208
I searched, and I
searched and searched.

265
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,250
And before I had realized it,

266
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,125
ten years had passed away
in the blink of an eye,

267
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,333
until I'd exhausted
all of my clues.

268
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:45,041
All I've done is
watch time pass.

269
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,583
[ROSETTE] So why don't you quit?

270
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,041
If you keep feeling sorry
for yourself like that,

271
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:54,708
you won't see a clue even if
it's right in front of you.

272
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,291
That's probably why your search
has taken you ten years.

273
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,416
I'm amazed you
haven't given up.

274
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,541
Please Rosette,
you've said enough.

275
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,958
We both know
how hard it is

276
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,583
to keep looking for
someone year after year.

277
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,791
Or have you somehow
forgotten about that?

278
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,041
[AZMARIA] Goodness gracious!

279
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,625
Great ball of fire!

280
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,000
[CHILD A] I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

281
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,250
[ROSETTE] Grr.

282
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,583
Now you hooligans have
really gone and done it!

283
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,041
All right, boys!
Line up over there!

284
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,166
[KIDS] Ahh!

285
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,916
[ROSETTE] Azmaria,
you come here, too!

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,583
[AZMARIA] What? But... But I...

287
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,166
[ROSETTE] Here we go.

288
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,291
[ROSETTE] Get it, Azmaria!

289
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,666
[KIDS] Over here! Over here!

290
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,208
[CHRONO] I'm sorry.

291
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,958
And I'm sure Rosette
knows she was wrong, too.

292
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,583
Actually, the two of us
have been searching

293
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,125
for her younger brother.

294
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:02,041
So we understand how you feel.
How frustrated you must be.

295
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:05,000
But Rosette won't give up,
no matter what!

296
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,083
She says that if your
wish is strong enough,

297
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,083
then it will come true.

298
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,416
Go!

299
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,833
[CHRONO] And I'm sure
it will, someday.

300
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,583
[ROSETTE] Haha! That's great!

301
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,208
[BOY] Sister, you
kicked it too hard!

302
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,333
[BOY screams]

303
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,000
[CHRONO] Run!

304
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,708
Chrono!

305
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,000
Nuts!

306
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,958
[SATELLA] Erlöschen!

307
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,166
[AZMARIA] Chrono!

308
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,333
[CHRONO] Azmaria,
erect the barrier!

309
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:01,875
What?

310
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,083
[CHRONO] It's the same monster
we fought yesterday! Hurry!

311
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,458
All right.

312
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,333
Horsefeathers! Nothing
I do seems to hurt this guy!

313
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,791
He's the cursed king
of an ancient nation.

314
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:10,958
He was wrapped in evil,

315
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,125
and is cursed to remain
one of the undead.

316
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,416
To maintain his longevity,

317
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,708
his legion of familiars
consumed his people,

318
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:20,875
so that even if his physical
body died, his desire would not.

319
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,291
[ROSETTE] Then I'll
stop it for him!

320
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,291
Erlöschen!

321
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,666
[AZMARIA] It's the fourth one.
Starting the barrier!

322
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,208
I did it!

323
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,833
[AZMARIA screams]

324
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,208
Azmaria!

325
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,666
Let her go, monster!

326
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,291
[CHRONO] He's absorbed
his minions!

327
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,083
[SATELLA] Ah!

328
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,125
[CHRONO groans]

329
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,125
Ahh!

330
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,125
Take that!

331
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,541
[roars]

332
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,125
[ROSETTE] No effect!

333
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,541
I could never bear
the mark of shame,

334
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,875
should it become known that
I owed my own life to a devil.

335
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,291
Now's the time!

336
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:49,625
[ROSETTE] Okay.

337
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,583
Bring peace to the lost
lambs who fear the night.

338
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,416
Give rest to...
the fangs of the wolf,

339
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,166
and call the hammer of
death unto the devil.

340
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,125
[ROSETTE] Are you
all right, Chrono?

341
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,333
[CHRONO] This is nothing.
I'll be fine.

342
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:23,125
What's important is that
you did good, Azmaria.

343
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,625
That's right.

344
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,875
It's thanks to you that there
wasn't much damage today.

345
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,791
[CHRONO] It's true, Azmaria.
You've proven yourself.

346
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,500
[ROSETTE] Oh, Satella!

347
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,833
About what I said earlier...

348
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,458
[SATELLA] I trust no devil.

349
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:41,875
I never have,
and I never will.

350
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,708
[SATELLA] The Magdalene Order
must be in trouble.

351
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,416
Why else would they put
a second-rate Sister

352
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,458
on the front lines?

353
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,541
[ROSETTE] What do you
mean "second-rate"?

354
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,125
[SATELLA] And working
with a devil.

355
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,500
How degrading, and so pathetic.

356
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,583
[ROSETTE] Chrono is different
from those other devils.

357
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,083
He's special!

358
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,583
He cooks, he cleans, he sews,
and he even does laundry.

359
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,041
[SATELLA] And these are
things to be proud of?

360
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,416
[CHRONO] Next episode, "Devil."

361
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,333
[ROSETTE] Chrono is completely
different from him!
