1
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:21,291
[FIORE] Lord Joshua?

2
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,166
Huh?

3
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,666
Lord Joshua?!

4
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,583
[JOSHUA] Ah!

5
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,791
[FIORE] Lord Josh--

6
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:41,833
[JOSHUA groans]

7
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,375
[FIORE] Joshua...

8
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:48,541
Sister? The noise is horrible.

9
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:52,166
If I don't drown it out
like this... I...

10
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,958
There's nothing to worry
about, Lord Joshua.

11
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,791
Please, let me take
you back to your bed.

12
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,541
[JOSHUA whimpers]

13
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:04,541
I'm sorry, but if you stay like
this, you'll catch a cold.

14
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,750
[JOSHUA] Leave it on!

15
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:18,583
[JOSHUA] Again... the noise
keeps coming back...

16
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:23,125
Again and again...

17
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:26,375
And it's getting worse.

18
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,625
I can feel it in my head!

19
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:35,666
[AION] So, it's no good unless
it's his real sister after all.

20
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,250
[FIORE] Lady Rizel has
already gone to get her.

21
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,708
Has she now?

22
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:46,000
She said it was...
unseemly, sir.

23
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:55,083
[train whistle blows]

24
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:07,416
[ROSETTE] Only seventy hours
'til we reach San Francisco.

25
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,375
Compared to the last
four years, that's nothing.

26
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,416
If I just sit still,

27
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,333
this train will take me
to where Joshua is.

28
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,000
[CHRONO] Rosette?

29
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,041
Sorry, did I wake you?

30
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,458
Unh-uh.
Can't you sleep?

31
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,291
Not really. I've never been
very good at staying still.

32
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,541
You can't relax unless you're
destroying something, eh?

33
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,916
[ROSETTE] Hey, just what are
you implying I am, you heel?

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,916
Nothing, just that this is
how you need to be, Rosette.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,416
[AZMARIA murmurs]

36
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,541
[CHRONO] Shh!

37
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:50,166
[train whistle blows]

38
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,458
[bells ring]

39
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,041
[MARY] I keep wondering...

40
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,500
how Rosette and the others
are doing right now.

41
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,416
[CLAIRE] It's Azmaria
I worry about the most.

42
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,291
Do you think she'll be
all right, Sister Kate?

43
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,166
But what if she gets attacked
by monsters or something?!

44
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,375
Don't be so obtuse!

45
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,458
Rosette and Chrono are
out there with her!

46
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,291
[KATE chuckles]

47
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,958
That much is true.

48
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,291
However, let's say a
special prayer for them.

49
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,333
Now that they have
gathered their courage

50
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:22,541
and gone to face the
destiny that awaits them.

51
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,541
[AZMARIA] Hmm...

52
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,375
What's with that smile?

53
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,875
Judging from the
look on your face,

54
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:34,416
you must have had
some wonderful dreams.

55
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Not quite, but
when I woke up,

56
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,333
both of you were
there beside me,

57
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,500
and I guess that
just made me feel

58
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,708
really happy for some reason.

59
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,041
[ROSETTE] Huh?

60
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:48,041
So I'm happy... because
I know this isn't a dream.

61
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:48,875
You see?

62
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,416
And yet the truth is

63
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,541
that I'm actually
leading you into danger.

64
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,041
[AZMARIA] Huh?

65
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,791
[ROSETTE] And I'm wondering
if it's really for the best.

66
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,458
But this is what I wanted!

67
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,500
I don't want you
worrying about it!

68
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,333
And finding the
Sinners will be...

69
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:07,375
lots easier if
I'm around, right?

70
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,541
You know, you're
one tough kid.

71
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,625
[AZMARIA giggles]

72
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,083
[door opens]

73
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,250
[JIMMY] Oh, banana oil!

74
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,541
Oh my, it's so crowded.

75
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,500
What a bother.

76
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:23,458
[JIMMY] I wanna sit, Mama.

77
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,833
Um, you can sit over
here if you'd like.

78
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,041
[MOTHER] Oh my,
I'm so sorry, Sister.

79
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,500
Are you quite sure?

80
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,500
Sure! We can switch out and
take turns sitting, okay?

81
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,291
Chrono, move those bags.

82
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,541
Right.

83
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,875
You're all so terribly kind.

84
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,458
Well, say thank you, Jimmy.

85
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,458
Thank you, thank you, sir!

86
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, you're welc-- [gasps]

87
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,500
[CHRONO] This feeling...

88
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,500
As if something or
someone was watching me.

89
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,208
Could this boy be...

90
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,583
[WOMAN] Ahem, could you
please clear the aisle?

91
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,541
[CHRONO] Eh?

92
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,583
[ROSETTE and CHRONO]
Satella!

93
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,083
You Magdalenes!

94
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,333
You have no idea how to
behave in public, do you?

95
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,375
[CHRONO] Ah, so that's what it--

96
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,208
[ROSETTE] Now wait a second!
What are you doing here?!

97
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,541
Working, of course.

98
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,750
I have an assignment
out on the west coast.

99
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,541
On the other hand,
why are you here?

100
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:15,875
Is this the freight car?

101
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,250
[ROSETTE grunts angrily]

102
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,625
[train whistle blows]

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,375
Come on, Jimmy!

104
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:26,791
You and your Mama can
come inside now, it's fine.

105
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,416
It seems that a
certain rich lady

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,625
who doesn't know how to
behave in proper society,

107
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,416
rented an entire car.

108
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,625
There's really lots of room!

109
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,000
But I don't think...

110
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,583
Oh no, go right ahead.

111
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,333
After all, with
this many rooms,

112
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,250
there's no way she
could use them all.

113
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,458
Isn't that right, Princess?

114
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,791
Do as you wish.

115
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,166
But I could have sworn that
when you rented a train,

116
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,541
you rented the entirety
of it at once.

117
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,666
[ROSETTE] Oh, you're
just so infuriating!

118
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,541
Oh my goodness.

119
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,416
Um, Sister. I know
it's not very much,

120
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,583
but perhaps you'd like to share
these with all of your friends!

121
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,708
Oh, thank you so very much!

122
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,666
[SATELLA] I swear, the way
you reverse emotionally

123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,000
over food has to be some
kind of paranormal talent.

124
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,875
[ROSETTE] Hmph! Well,
I know a certain jewel witch

125
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,500
who's not getting any then.

126
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,333
Ooh, they're muffins!

127
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,666
[gasps]

128
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,458
[MOTHER] My dear Sister Rosette,

129
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,583
I have something very
urgent to discuss with you.

130
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,708
Meet me in the
cafeteria immediately.

131
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,625
However, you must come alone.

132
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,416
[ROSETTE] Uh... Hey, wait!

133
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,333
[CHRONO] Huh?

134
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,041
It wouldn't be right
for us to eat

135
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,875
all these muffins by ourselves.

136
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,416
I think I'll go and
give Jimmy one.

137
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,750
[CHRONO] Eh?

138
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,458
Uh, well, you know, a treat
always tastes better

139
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,708
when you share it
with someone else.

140
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,833
I'm going back for just
a little bit, okay?

141
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,416
But Rosette!

142
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,291
All right, you. I want
to know who you are!

143
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,541
Huh?

144
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,250
[chattering]

145
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,291
Just who in the hell are you?

146
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,250
And why do you have
Joshua's picture?

147
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,625
[OLD MAN] You should
calm that temper...

148
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,250
...dear Sister Rosette.

149
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,875
[MAN A] But how good
of you to come at last.

150
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,833
[WOMAN] We've been waiting
for you for so long.

151
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,583
You're the one from before.

152
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,958
It's been a while since
we met, dear Sister.

153
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,041
But I've come back for
you... as promised.

154
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,208
[train whistle blows]

155
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,750
A-A-Ahhh!

156
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,083
[CHRONO] Azmaria!

157
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:58,208
Did you fall again?
You do that a lot, don't you?

158
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,666
[AZMARIA] I'm sorry, ma'am.

159
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,541
I guess I'm just worried about
Rosette and can't concentrate.

160
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,625
She's probably stopped by
the dining car or something.

161
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,500
That girl eats like
a horse, after all.

162
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,583
[ROSETTE] I know all
about your perversions.

163
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,291
So what do you want?

164
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,666
[MOTHER] Please,
there's no need to rush.

165
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,041
Let's be friendly about this.

166
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,000
[ROSETTE] And why
would I want to?

167
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,458
[MOTHER] Perhaps because you
want to see Lord Joshua.

168
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:33,208
Lord Joshua? Are you
saying my brother's all right?

169
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:36,458
Yes. Quite well, considering.

170
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,875
Although he says the
noise bothers him.

171
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,833
The noise?
He's... not in pain, is he?

172
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,291
Well he's always screaming.

173
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,541
And to be honest, I wish that
he'd just go elsewhere.

174
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,666
But no one asks me.

175
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,458
And why Lord Aion
is so fixated

176
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,750
on that one is
something I'll never...

177
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,666
[ROSETTE] What's with her?

178
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,375
Why is she so...

179
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,750
[MOTHER] But back to business.

180
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,708
I'll be changing
your travel plans now.

181
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,416
[explosion]

182
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,583
[ROSETTE] Ah!

183
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,666
[train whistle blows]

184
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,000
[MOTHER] I'm afraid that
leaving your friends behind

185
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,583
was quite necessary.

186
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,875
After all, it would be
rather inexcusable

187
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,791
to bring Chrono
before Lord Aion.

188
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:25,375
[laughter]

189
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:28,541
[MOTHER] But since your precious
Lord Joshua is calling for you,

190
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:31,125
even from the depths
of his suffering...

191
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:33,916
Perhaps seeing you
will comfort him.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,541
Or, if you're so inclined,

193
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,541
you could even end it all
with your precious gun.

194
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,625
[MOTHER laughs]

195
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,833
[ROSETTE] Damn you!

196
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,250
[MOTHER] Ah!

197
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,166
I want you to stop
the train right now,

198
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,125
and set the passengers free!

199
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,916
Do it now!

200
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,833
Please, Sister Rosette,
forgive me.

201
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,458
And forgive my son.

202
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:58,916
[RIZEL laughs]

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,833
[RIZEL] Are you going
to shoot her, Sister...

204
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,291
this innocent
little marionette?

205
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,708
She's just a
human in my web.

206
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,250
J-Jimmy!

207
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:14,291
[MOTHER sobs]

208
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,625
[RIZEL laughs]

209
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:22,875
[RIZEL] Oh that face! I so
wanted to see that face!

210
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,833
What can you do?

211
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,833
What shall we
do next for fun?

212
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,750
What with this lovely Sister?

213
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,041
[MOTHER laughs]

214
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:39,458
Aaahhh!

215
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,625
A barrier!

216
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
Ahh!

217
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,708
Chrono!

218
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,625
Heh. I thought that muffin
guff was suspicious.

219
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,708
When it comes to lying,
you're no Barrymore, Rosette.

220
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,375
Ha, hah!

221
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,208
Thanks, Chrono, I owe you!

222
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,750
Uh, Rosette!

223
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,333
Where'd the Life Pod go?

224
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,500
[ROSETTE gasps]

225
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:02,875
[RIZEL laughs]

226
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,083
[RIZEL] So you finally noticed.

227
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,458
I found myself such a lovely
new toy to play with.

228
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,041
[CHRONO] She's in first class!

229
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,916
[ROSETTE] Satella! Azmaria!

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm sorry, Rosette.

231
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:25,125
Satella was trying
to protect me.

232
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:25,833
Where are you?!

233
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,458
[RIZEL laughs]

234
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,875
[RIZEL] How many times
do I have to remind you?

235
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,916
My puppets are still humans.

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,916
But if you want to
shoot so badly...

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,291
[TRAIN MAN] Stand over there.

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,833
Enough talk!

239
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,833
Ahh!

240
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:45,166
Okay!

241
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,375
[whispering] Please, Rosette.
Let's just do as they say.

242
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,875
[AZMARIA whimpers]

243
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,833
[RIZEL laughs]

244
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,875
[TRAIN MAN] And now... you...

245
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:00,958
Shoot him.

246
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,833
[ROSETTE gasps]

247
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,791
No, Rosette!

248
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,875
[RIZEL laughs]

249
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,041
[RIZEL] Hurry up and fire,
Sister Rosette!

250
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,416
Just do it!

251
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,791
Go ahead and shoot me!

252
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,666
No, Chrono! You can't!

253
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,500
Rosette, aim right here.

254
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,916
And don't miss. The center.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,958
[AZMARIA] No, Rosette!
You can't shoot Chrono!

256
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,166
[ROSETTE]
Azmaria, please Azmaria.

257
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,750
I need you to pray
for Chrono for me.

258
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,791
[AZMARIA yells]

259
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,791
[ROSETTE] Chrono!

260
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,708
Chrono?

261
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,000
[ROSETTE] Excuse me!
Until we get back,

262
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,291
please don't leave this car.
No matter what happens!

263
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,333
Oh, and Satella, try not to
get knocked out this time!

264
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,125
[SATELLA] What?
What did you say?

265
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:41,500
[CHRONO] Okay, okay,
that's enough, you two.

266
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,375
[MOTHER chuckles]

267
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,833
[door opens]

268
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,125
[ROSETTE] Here we go.
Watch your backs.

269
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,000
There!

270
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,333
[ROSETTE gasps]

271
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,791
[ROSETTE yells]

272
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,041
[CHRONO] Rosette!

273
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:20,333
[RIZEL laughs]

274
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:25,000
[RIZEL] So we finally
meet, Big Sister.

275
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,583
It's not what I'd planned,

276
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:32,083
but as long as I bring you back
it should be satisfactory.

277
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,833
Chrono!

278
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,958
[RIZEL] And now that
those nuisances are gone,

279
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,416
our real journey
can begin at last!

280
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,958
[ROSETTE]
What about the engineers?

281
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,500
Release your hostages first!

282
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:45,000
[RIZEL laughs]

283
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,375
[RIZEL] Don't be ridiculous!

284
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,666
There aren't any
hostages on this train.

285
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,125
I ate them all.

286
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,083
[ROSETTE gasps]

287
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,416
Ahhh!

288
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,208
Ahhh! Damn you!

289
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,916
[RIZEL laughs]

290
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,750
[RIZEL laughs]

291
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:14,208
[RIZEL] Sorry, Sister. Now that
you're in my web, I have you.

292
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:18,000
Come quietly and Lord Aion
will be most pleased.

293
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:21,000
[ROSETTE] There she
goes about Aion again.

294
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,125
[RIZEL laughs]

295
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,791
[RIZEL] Poor little fly,
alone you have no hope.

296
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,208
But I'm not alone!

297
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,375
[RIZEL] Hmm?

298
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,250
Because I know that
Chrono's all right.

299
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,375
I've always been
able to sense him.

300
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,208
And because of that,
we're never alone!

301
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,208
[RIZEL] Mm. Still trying
to act tough, are you?

302
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,541
[ROSETTE] I'm just
telling the truth, Rizel.

303
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,500
I believe in Chrono.

304
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,666
You're the one...
who's really alone!

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,333
Aahh!

306
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:57,000
[ROSETTE screams]

307
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,250
[RIZEL laughs]

308
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,333
[RIZEL] That's quite a nice
look for you, Sister.

309
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,500
So... comely.

310
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:10,166
Too bad we can't show
it to your friends.

311
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,875
Little fool!

312
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,125
I told you,
resistance is pointless!

313
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,916
[gun clicks]

314
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,166
[RIZEL] No bullets?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

315
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,875
What wonderful timing.

316
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,541
If I don't end it
here and now,

317
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,291
Lord Aion would
probably scold me.

318
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:29,166
[ROSETTE]
Aion this! Aion that!

319
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,083
You're such a dumb dora.

320
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,000
You know how important
he thinks Joshua is.

321
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,833
And yet you're not worth
a second of his time.

322
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,208
That's why you're so
desperate to bring me...

323
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,250
So he'll notice you.

324
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:44,250
You know nothing about it!

325
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,583
You're such a pathetic sap.

326
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,333
There's no one who cares
about you, not even Aion!

327
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,208
Be silent!

328
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,500
Just try and make me!

329
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,125
[train whistle blows]

330
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,083
[ROSETTE] No one loves you,
you monster.

331
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,333
[RIZEL] Shut up!

332
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,666
[ROSETTE] It's tough,
isn't it? And it hurts.

333
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,916
[RIZEL] Silence!

334
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,208
[ROSETTE] And no matter
how much you love him,

335
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,166
he'll never notice you, never!

336
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,708
Don't worry. God will
have pity... even on you!

337
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,583
Shut up you little bitch!

338
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:14,000
[ROSETTE]
I'll pray for you, Rizel.

339
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,708
Oh Lord, please
save this mad woman

340
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,333
from her unrequited love!

341
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,041
[RIZEL screams]

342
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,458
[ROSETTE yells]

343
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,125
[gunshot]

344
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,333
[RIZEL screams]

345
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,041
Ahhhh!

346
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:38,625
Go up! Geh aufwaerts!

347
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,333
Chrono...

348
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,208
[CHRONO chuckles]

349
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,083
[loud thud]

350
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,666
I'm going to kill you!

351
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,708
I'll rip out your organs!

352
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,125
I'll drain your blood dry!

353
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,416
[RIZEL screams]

354
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:35,500
Lord Aion, I failed.

355
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:50,125
[train whistle blows]

356
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,000
Alas, poor Rizel.

357
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,750
And it all
came to naught.

358
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,416
[CHRONO] We're destined
to get into trouble

359
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,666
no matter where
we go, aren't we?

360
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,750
[ROSETTE] It's just what
happens, you know?

361
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:29,583
[CHRONO] I was really looking
forward to riding on the train,

362
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,541
but with a pile of scrap
metal for an engine...

363
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,833
[ROSETTE] You're a devil,
so stop harping, okay?

364
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,541
We're in San Francisco.

365
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,666
[CHRONO] I hope they plan on
building some new bridges.

366
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,041
I'd better go see them
before they're gone!

367
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,083
[ROSETTE]
Next episode, "Prayer."

368
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,541
[CHRONO] Please let us end this

369
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,833
without destroying
anything else.
