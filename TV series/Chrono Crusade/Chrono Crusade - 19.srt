00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,041
[JOSHUA] Huh?

4
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,291
[ROSETTE] Joshua...

5
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,791
[ROSETTE]
You are Joshua, right?

6
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:55,083
[fireworks continue]

7
00:02:55,166 --> 00:03:00,541
You've... grown so tall...
and so very thin.

8
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,791
And I've... been so
worried about you.

9
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,625
It's nice to meet you.

10
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,958
[ROSETTE gasps]

11
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,500
My name is Joshua
by the way.

12
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,500
I'm waiting for someone
to meet me here...

13
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,208
my sister.

14
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,916
What are you
talking about?

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,625
It's me, Rosette!
Don't you recognize me?

16
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,875
[JOSHUA] I see...
what a coincidence,

17
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:32,541
my big sister's name
is Rosette, too.

18
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,000
[AION] The siblings reunite.
How bittersweet.

19
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,583
I'm not holding back anymore.

20
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,041
Joshua, get back.

21
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,750
[AION] Shoot me.

22
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:59,666
That's what you've wanted
all along, isn't it?

23
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,250
[JOSHUA] It's just wrong to
point your weapon at him.

24
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:28,541
[JOSHUA groans]

25
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,416
Joshua!

26
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,208
[JOSHUA groans]

27
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,458
[FIORE] Lord Joshua...

28
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,875
I can hear them, Sister.

29
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,500
I can hear all of
the noises again.

30
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,208
As if someone was
calling out for me.

31
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,583
Who can it be?

32
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,750
[FIORE] You mustn't use
your power carelessly.

33
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,125
I've warned you so many times.

34
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:58,458
But she was... she was...
was going to shoot Aion.

35
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,416
Wouldn't that have been bad?

36
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,541
Or is she the one
calling me?

37
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,375
[AION] The years
have seemed long,

38
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,958
haven't they,
Rosette Christopher?

39
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,958
Joshua's needed that
one all this time,

40
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,791
because of his love
for his sister.

41
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,750
Joshua, she's our guest
of honor this evening,

42
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,125
try to be more friendly.

43
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,166
Soon your dream
will be realized.

44
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,333
Just leave everything to me.

45
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,666
Can't you feel it?

46
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,291
At long last, the two of us

47
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:40,083
will be able to touch
the Astral Line... together.

48
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:44,208
Soon, Sister,
just like we promised.

49
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,291
Four long years.
What a cruel length of time.

50
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,541
It's your fault!

51
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,875
You're the one that threw
everything into chaos!

52
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,333
[AION laughs]

53
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,333
[AION] Silly girl. I promised
you salvation, didn't I?

54
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,083
Joshua knows who his
greatest ally is.

55
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,166
Don't you think it's
about time for you

56
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,750
to throw away that
liar's crucifix as well?

57
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,500
It will make things
so much easier.

58
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:26,291
And now, remember the ache
that I carved into you?

59
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:31,291
[ROSETTE groans]

60
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,750
Ah. Heavens.

61
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,583
Is that meant to be a warning?

62
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
Hello, Aion.

63
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:53,416
[indistinct chattering]

64
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,708
Right! So, are you thirsty?

65
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,583
I was thinking about going
to buy something to drink.

66
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,458
Oh, I can get
drinks if you want.

67
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:04,791
Well, actually, such a
thing should be my duty.

68
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,583
[SATELLA] Oh, it's all right.
You two wait here.

69
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,166
[AZMARIA] Uhh...

70
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,541
[SATELLA hums]

71
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,791
Look at her.

72
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,333
Miss Satella sure has
cheered up, hasn't she?

73
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,250
Yes, but the fact that
milady has begun to display

74
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,791
such a gentle side is
the thing which brings me

75
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,166
more happiness
than anything else.

76
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,875
[AZMARIA] Huh?

77
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,250
It was you and
your friends

78
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,458
that made this possible,
Mistress Azmaria.

79
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:33,000
Me? Oh, no, sir.
I haven't done anything.

80
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,166
Or, have I?

81
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,625
Indeed, it is due to her
encounter with your kindness

82
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:44,833
that milady became capable
of discovering her own.

83
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:49,166
I owe all of you
my deepest gratitude.

84
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,541
Oh, we didn't do
anything really.

85
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,875
[STEINER chuckles]

86
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,541
Ahhh!

87
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,000
Ah! What's wrong, Mr. Steiner?

88
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:03,291

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,708
Oh what fun!
And it's almost time.

91
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,500
Hey, you're watching,
aren't you?

92
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:28,416
Will you stop it?
Or is this okay with you?

93
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,625
Well whatever happens,
it's not my fault.

94

[SATELLA gasps]

95

[SATELLA] Steiner!

96
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,541
Steiner! Hold on!

97
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,708
[SATELLA gasps]

98
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,166
Speak to me, Steiner!

99
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,541
Mistress Satella?

100
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,791
What happened to you?

101
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,666
Please forgive me, milady,
Mistress Azmaria...

102
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,500
Please hurry.

103
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,083
I beg you not to worry
about me right now.

104
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,583
Ah, Lady Satella...

105
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,625
Steiner, no!

106
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,458
Steiner!

107
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,125
So, you've come.

108
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:22,208
[JOSHUA groans]

109
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,541
The horns.

110
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:35,500
We need to retreat
for now, Rosette.

111
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,208
We're unarmed, and we don't
have a battle plan, yet.

112
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,875
This time they
beat us to the punch,

113
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,708
so we have to take the loss.

114
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,791
But why? Why are you
talking like that?

115
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,916
There has to be
something we can do!

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,666
[CHRONO] No, Rosette.

117
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,958
You can't let the last
four years be for nothing.

118
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,041
[ROSETTE] Azmaria!

[MILITA GIRL A]
Yes, sir. Right.

126
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,041
[GILLIAM]
I understand.

127
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,916
We've got to report this
to the Central Council

128
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,916
and the New York branch at once.

129
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,833
The atonement ceremony...
so they've begun.

130
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:30,750
[AION] You remember our dream,
don't you Chrono?

131
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,958
That's right, it's begun.

132
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,458
The stars have finally
announced the time.

133
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,000
You bastard.

134
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,458
[JOSHUA groans]

135
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,541
Aion!

136
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,208
Why are they being
so mean to me?!

137
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,250
They've come to take this
away from me, haven't they?

138
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,458
Joshua!

139
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,875
[AION] And what will
you do if they have?

140
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,750
This power belongs to me.

141
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,875
No one else can have it.

142
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,291
Big Sister, stand back.

143
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:07,125
This time... I'm going
to protect you.

144
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,583
[CHRONO] Ahh!

145
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,833
[SATELLA gasps]

146
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:20,666
[ROSETTE]
No, Chrono!

147
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,541
Chrono! Chrono! Chrono!

148
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,625
Chrono!

149
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,041
It's gone.
The noise has stopped.

150
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,750
I don't hear her
voice anymore.

151
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,416
Aion, maybe it would
have been better

152
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,041
if I had killed him sooner.

153
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,000
[AION] You might be right.

154
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:52,166
Ooh, it's proceeding nicely.

[KATE] What did you say?

165
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,666
[FEMALE] We have an urgent
dispatch from San Francisco.

166
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:55,166
[GILLIAM] The Astral reactions
inside the city are increasing.

167
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,666
They're now seven
times above normal.

168
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,875
Go on, Elder.

169
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,166
Well, Gilliam,
you had better

170
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,875
advise all districts
to evacuate right now.

171
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:04,875
[GILLIAM] Evacuate?

172
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,041
Elder, just what do you
mean by "all districts"?

173
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,875
The order to do
that can only come

174
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,750
from the entire
assembled council.

175
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,083
You're still as stiff
and high-bound as ever.

176
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,833
Once large-scale
panic breaks out,

177
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,416
it will be too late
to change course.

178
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,583
[CHAIRMAN] But each area must
have time to follow procedure.

179
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,958
If the worst happens,

180
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,208
San Francisco could be wiped
off the face of the map!

181
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,875
Manhattan was nothing
compared to this.

182
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,000
What we are facing here is
an unprecedented holocaust.

183
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,958
I know that, but...

184
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:34,916
Gilliam, do as I said,
twenty-three skidoo!

185
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,083
[GILLIAM] Yes, sir!

186
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,166
[CHAIRMAN]
Elder... could this mean...?

187
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,041
They've brought all of
the Apostles together.

188
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,666
Then they must have Azmaria!

189
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,000
Contact Rosette and
the others immediately!

190
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,000
Remington, we've got to--

191
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,083
What is it, Sister?

192
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,958
I know he was standing
there a moment ago.

193
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:55,083
[AION] Calamity has come.
The end is nigh.

194
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,958
Great city,
powerful city of Babylon,

195
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,833
in this instant, your
judgment has arrived.

196
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,000
The soul of atonement...

197
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:25,000
[ROSETTE yells]

198
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,250
[ROSETTE screams]

199
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:28,791
[AION chuckles]

200
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,375
A Seraphim-class
reaction is confirmed.

201
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,083
Station six reports it's
counterbalancing the miasma.

202
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,375
And what about
the Astral Line?

203
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,041
It appears to be
maintaining its position.

204
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,416
[ROSETTE screams]

205
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
[SATELLA] Rosette!

206
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
[AION] Well, Fiore...

207
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,333
It shall be done.

208
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,708
Kommen sie!

209
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,958
A jewel summoner?

210
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,458
[SATELLA] Sister?!

211
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:41,000
[ROSETTE groans]

212
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,291
These warnings of yours are
quite pointless, you know?

213
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,000
[SHADER] Okay, let's see.

214
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,166
Huh?

215
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,958
[SHADER] We did it! Ascension!

216
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,375
Rosette!

217
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,125
[weakly] Rosette...

218
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,583
The true purpose of this
ceremony was to awaken you,

219
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,166
my dear Mary of Magdalene.

220
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,083
To achieve that,

221
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:38,541
we required but one thing:
the last virtue.

222
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,750
The absolute power of
Heaven that devils desire

223
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,750
is called justice.

224
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,375
Do you understand?

225
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,125
You're a greater Apostle
than your brother,

226
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:53,583
for the power of faith was
required to bring you forth.

227
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,208
Rosette...

228
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:04,000
Wait, kitten, your
turn is coming next.

229
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,791
Ah!

230
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,875
[AION] Driven by justice

231
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:18,291
and endowed with the love
of Mary of Magdalene,

232
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,791
you've slain the head
of Pandemonium

233
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,625
and become Mary
who brings the light.

234
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,750
[ROSETTE gasps]

235
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,750
What a magnificent
delight you are.

236
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,166
With justice and love,
you use the faith you embody

237
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,958
to fan the flames of
both hatred and love

238
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,250
to unparalleled heights.

239
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
We're the same, you and I...

240
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,375
destroyers who
speak of salvation.

241
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,166
Relinquish your soul.

242
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,541
Cast away your faith
and embrace your freedom.

243
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,666
That is salvation.

244
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,166
I can do it if you come with me.

245
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,666
[weakly] Never.

246
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,958
[AION] I won't let those four
long years be for naught.

247
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,541
[ROSETTE] No...

248
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,083
[ROSETTE] Chrono...

249
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,291
[CHRONO] She's crying.

250
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,708
I remember now.

251
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,125
I swore to you...

252
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,875
that I wouldn't make
a mistake ever again.

253
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:26,000
Ever... again!

254
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,125
The sweet taste of God.

255
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,541
[CHRONO]
Don't do it, Rosette.

256
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,375
I will not
waste your life!

257
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:03,041
[CHRONO screams]

258
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,166
Ooh, Chrono's serious.

259
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,208
Ooh, I'm so scared!

260
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,000
[AION] Come, Mary,
come be with the Savior.

261
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,541
Please, Chrono,
kill him now.

262
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,208
Just end it.

263
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,208
[CHRONO] Aion!

264
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,791
Aahhhh!

265
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,208
[ROSETTE] So, I wonder if
I can say how I feel now.

266
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,708
[AZMARIA] Rosette's
smile is kind of scary.

267
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,833
[ROSETTE] More importantly,
what's going on right now?

268
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,791
Who is this Mary of Magdalene?

269
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,750
What's with that
disgusting head?

270
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:34,291
I'm an Apostle?
Is that even possible?

271
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,708
[CHRONO] Calm down, Rosette!

272
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,083
[AZMARIA]
That's right, now we know

273
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,958
that you're the same
as me and Joshua.

274
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,625
[ROSETTE] And Joshua isn't
doing what I tell him, either!

275
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,958
[AZMARIA]
Next episode, "Poison."

276
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,666
[ROSETTE] I refuse
to accept this ending!
