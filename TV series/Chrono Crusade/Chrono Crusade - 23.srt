Are you Chrono?

Um, yeah.

It's from Rosette...

[CHRONO groans]

00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,083
Rosette, I read your letter,

00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,375
but I don't understand!

16
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:19,250
You said you wanted me to
give something back to you...

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,625
What did you mean?

18
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:23,541
[AION]
She means her time.

19
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,083
[CHRONO]
I asked her!

20
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,000
[inaudible]

21
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:33,166
I want back... my lost time.

[CHRONO gasps]

23
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,291
Ooh, she wants to
cancel your contract.

24
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,333
[ROSETTE] I want
to save everyone.

25
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,250
And such a fitting
place to be released

26
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,375
from a deal with a devil,
don't you agree?

27
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,375
Stop playing
with our hearts!

28
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,083
Playing with your
hearts? Not moi.

29
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,416
The one who's playing with you
is that great heavenly hypocrite

30
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,125
who's always
standing idly by.

31
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,500
How unfaithful
you are, Chrono.

32
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,458
You still have feelings
for Magdalene,

33
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,791
and yet here you are pursuing
Rosette Christopher.

34
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:08,375
Hmph. Oh well, lust is one of
the cardinal sins, after all.

35
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,458
But I suppose you would
call it love, wouldn't you?

36
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,416
If that's how you feel,
then why are you here?

37
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,291
Can't you see that Rosette
would be so much better off

38
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,916
if you were dead?

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,416
As long as you live,

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,541
her life continues to
tick, tick, tick away.

41
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,458
I see... you are truly
determined to kill Rosette...

42
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,083
taking the life of
the woman you love

43
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,416
is becoming something of
a habit with you, isn't it?

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Have you ever considered
changing your name

45
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,958
to the God of Death?

46
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,625
I've heard enough!

47
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,458
Why won't you
give it back to me?

[CHRONO gasps]

just kill him?

[CHRONO screams]

51
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:02,750
[CHRONO]
Why? Back then... why?

52
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:11,500
[AION] So, what became of that
woman you seduced earlier?

53
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,625
I grew weary of her.

54
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,208
[AION] This era amuses me.

55
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,708
So many choose to walk
the path to destruction.

56
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,375
It means the time is right.

57
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,666
[CHRONO] Yes.

58
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,083
[AION] So much corruption,
it makes me shiver.

59
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,250
[CHRONO] It's quite
an aphrodisiac.

60
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,291
[AION] God's absence
has blurred the line

61
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,875
between Pandemonium and Earth.

62
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,916
People can hear
only our voices now.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,791
They have found
that lust and pleasure

64
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:44,208
provide opportunities
that prayer cannot.

65
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,333
Heaven is pitiful.

66
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:50,541
Humans were given hearts and
minds, yet because they think,

67
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,166
His light can no
longer reach them.

68
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,166
[CHRONO]
But it can reach us.

69
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,500
[AION] Pandemonium is nothing
more than God's contractor...

70
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,375
a clown who praises Heaven.

71
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:05,125
[CHRONO] Being a clown
is a sad existence.

72
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:09,250
They excite us and let us
sharpen our fangs and claws.

73
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,333
We will sacrifice
the world of man.

74
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,375
[CHRONO gasps]

75
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,333
With the clown's head

76
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,000
and the maiden who is most
beloved by God in our arms,

77
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,000
we will use the language
and violence of man

78
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,375
to make Heaven into Earth
and Earth into Heaven.

79
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,083
But that's...

80
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,416
The word for it is "sin."

81
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,583
But I call it freedom.

82
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,291
Freedom...

83
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,583
[AION] We will conceal the
marks of being incomplete,

84
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:43,583
and as truly complete beings,
recreate the world.

I hadn't taken his hand.

[ELDER] The impudence!
It's despicable!

90
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,875
They're saying that
the Magdalene Order

91
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,541
is a band of heretics.

92
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,916
It's malice
masquerading as justice.

93
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,458
[ELDER] Thanks to
Gilliam's connections,

94
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,916
we'll be guests
here for a few days.

Sister Kate is trying
to return to New York.

96
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:52,125
Hmm... Thinking of Rosette, eh?

97
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,625
At this rate, I fear
she will become a martyr.

98
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,375
[ELDER] Yes, and Joshua as well.

99
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,375
Oh, hello.

If you came to see the Astral
Line, you're just in time.

It's already really close,
so it shouldn't be long.

102
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,166
I just hope my big
sister gets here soon.

103
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,375
If we don't explore it now,
we won't get another chance.

104
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,875
What's that?

105
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:30,291
[CHRONO] Father Remington
brought them back to me.

106
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,708
They're my horns.

00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,458
Satella... and Fiore...
and Mr. Steiner...

108
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,541
I killed all of them.

109
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:42,125
They're dead because
I chose freedom.

110
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,166
When Aion cut off
Pandemonium's head,

111
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,041
I should have killed him.

112
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:48,541
None of this would
have happened

113
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,916
if I had been strong enough to
overcome my desire for freedom.

[PHOTOGRAPHER]
Um, pardon me, Miss.

119
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:09,833
I thought I
recognized you.

120
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,416
You're the young lady from
the carnival, aren't you?

121
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,583
And let me tell you,
I sure was surprised

122
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,708
to find out that the girl
with you was the Holy Woman!

123
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,708
And you are...?

[PHOTOGRAPHER]
Oh, excuse me, Sister.

125
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,625
I work for a local
photography studio.

126
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,625
I tried at the Magdalene Order,
but it was verklempt.

127
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,375
I've been looking all over
for you and your friends.

128

Here, your picture is ready.

00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,458
[PHOTOGRAPHER] And, um...
there's something else.

130
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,791
I happened to see the Holy
Woman in town the other day,

131
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,500
and I took a picture.

132
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,750
I just had to
show it to you.

133

[PHOTOGRAPHER] You know,

136
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,250
it'll be a long time before
San Francisco is rebuilt,

137
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:59,750
but I'm going to photograph
every stage of its rebirth.

138
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,333
With everything that's
going on in this country,

139
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,166
the times we're
living in right now...

140
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,083
I just want to leave
my pictures behind

141
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,625
until the next
generation, you know?

00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:10,833
See ya!

143
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,250
Wait a minute!

00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,958
Um... What I mean is...
thank you very much for this.

145
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,708
[AZMARIA] This is proof.

146
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:25,416
Proof of that precious moment
when we were all still together.

147
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,583
Thank you for
leaving it behind.

[REMINGTON] Sister Kate...

149
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,875
[KATE]
Where's Rosette?

150
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,416
She's vanished.
Now we're back to square one.

151
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,833
Maybe not.

152

What is that?

153
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,666
[KATE] A picture of Rosette
that a local cameraman took.

154
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,916
[ELDER] Hmm?
This is completely...

155
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,666
[REMINGTON] I suspect Aion
is using the disturbances

156
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,875
in San Francisco as a test

157
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,250
for those who've
succumbed to despair.

158
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,750
Rosette's stigmata are
a powerful source of hope.

159
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,708
Aion will use that
hope as a weapon

160
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,708
to guide this country to
the brink of total chaos.

161
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,458
[KATE] And what will
await us if he succeeds?

162
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,791
The realization of the
second Prophecy of Fatima.

163
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,166
An even greater war.

164
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,625
[REMINGTON] I believe
we are being tested.

165
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,875
[KATE] For what?!

166
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,791
What exactly is the Lord
trying to make us do here?

167
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,958
[ROSETTE] I bid thee, bring
peace to the lost lambs,

168
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,541
give rest to the
fangs of the wolf,

169
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,583
and call the hammer of
death unto the devil!

170
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:41,666
[AION] There are no
virtuous people, not a one.

171
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,208
There are no
enlightened men.

172
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:47,333
There are no humans
who turn to God.

173
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:52,791
All have gone astray,
and nothing restrains them.

174
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,875
There is no virtue.

175
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,625
It is dead.

176
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,291
Within the last four weeks,

177
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:06,541
more than two hundred riots have
broken out across the country.

178
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,708
The police alone
cannot control it,

179
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:11,416
so the National Guard
has been mobilized,

180
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,375
and not even the
police are immune.

181
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,916
[gunshots]

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,750
Ahh! Ahhh!

183
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,625
[DETECTIVE]
I can still hear it.

184
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,958
I can hear the noise.

185
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,250
The noise?

186
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,083
[KATE] Yes. He claims to
hear the voices of devils.

187
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,333
[CHAIRMAN] Devils?

188
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,541
[KATE] Correct.

189
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:31,541
He seems to think that someone
is trying to trick him.

190
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,000
And there's more, sir.

191
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,875
Explain
these wounds!

192
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,708
[DETECTIVE]
These wounds protect me.

193
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,208
From what?

194
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,500
[DETECTIVE] I carved the
seals of the Holy Woman

195
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,916
into my body to protect
myself from the noise.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,708
Only there are still
too many people

197
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,625
who make me hear the noise.

198
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,875
I will kill all of
them and become free!

199
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,750
And when you've
gained your freedom...

200
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,041
what happens then?

201
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,750
What did the Holy
Woman tell you?

202
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,791
[DETECTIVE]
That Heaven becomes Earth

203
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,750
and Earth will become Heaven!

204
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,166
[REMINGTON] And where does
the Holy Woman appear?

205
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,833
Wherever the Holy Woman
decides to appear.

206
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,333
We Crusaders just
do as she says.

207
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,791
[CHAIRMAN] Crusaders?

208
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,625
[KATE] Yes. Those who inflict
the stigmata upon themselves

209
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,333
refer to it as a sign
of the new Crusade.

210
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,500
Therefore, the warriors who bear
these marks upon their skin

211
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,958
call themselves Crusaders.

212
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,625
[CHAIRMAN sighs]

213
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,375
They are just common
killers in the end.

214
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,875
[KATE] Perhaps, but they
qualify their actions

215
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,791
by claiming it is a
battle for justice.

216
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:35,833
[CHAIRMAN] Justice?

217
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,750
[KATE] So they say.
Yet in truth,

218
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,541
it is only violence that
has spun out of control.

219
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,916
[CHAIRMAN] And Sister Rosette
is at the center of all this?

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,583
Where is she?

221
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,041
Unfortunately, we have
not found her.

[CHRONO winces]

These wounds...
they just won't heal.

225
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,041
Is this the same
kind of pain

226
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,916
that I've inflicted upon
you for all these years?

227
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,708
Why won't you give
it back to me?

228
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,125
[CHRONO]
What can I do to make up for

229
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,000
everything that
I've put you through?

What can I do?

231
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:21,500
[ROSETTE]
Chrono is still alive.

232
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,541
[AION] He wants to kill you,
no matter what the cost.

233
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,958
And you'll die
without saving anyone.

234
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,291
[ROSETTE]
That cannot be.

235
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,416
I will take back
my own life myself.

Good girl.

238
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,875
[AION] Can't you see
that Rosette would be

239
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:46,791
so much better off
if you were dead?

240
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,166
As long as you live,

241
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,291
her life continues to
tick, tick, tick away.

[CHRONO] I'm a devil.

243
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:57,916
Even if I'm given comfort,
all I can do is take.

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,583
So that in the end...

245
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,916
[AZMARIA]
Are regrets all you have?

[CHRONO] Azmaria?

You're not the only one
with regrets, you know!

248
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,958
I couldn't help her either!

249
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,291
And now, Rosette is
suffering by herself!

We both fought
alongside Rosette!

[CHRONO gasps]

And Miss Satella, too.

00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,333
Maybe there was something
I could have done to help her,

but... now it's too late
to change any of it!

But... the friendship...

the time we've had
together means something!

the good things we shared!

precious moments didn't exist.

I can keep going because
I have you with me.

It's because my time is limited
that I don't have any doubts.

Rosette never ran away.

But I ran from Pandemonium...
and from Aion...

was going there alone.

00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:44,750
...of that last stigmata?

321
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,250
Chrono... I...

322
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,291
Aghh!

323
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,833
So these are your horns?

324
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:54,833
Chrono!

325
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,791
I told you I was
going to design

326
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,041
the other ending
to the Apocalypse.

327
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,750
Your power's already
been surpassed.

328
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,416
Chrono!

329
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,541
Aaahhh!

330
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,625
Ai... on!

331
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,000
Chrono... Chrono... Chrono!

332
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,333
[weakly]
Don't do it, Rosette!

333
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,625
But I must.

334
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:29,041
I'll give it all to you, so that
you can fight him, Chrono.

335
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,875
If giving my life can
truly save a lot of people,

336
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,750
then it's all right if I die.

337
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:41,833
Even if this is just God's plan
to restore a corrupt world.

338
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,833
I'm the one that
will make the choice.

339
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,500
That is our greatest power.

340
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:52,666
That's the reason that
God granted us wisdom.

341
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,041
It's why he gave us hearts.

342
00:19:55,791 --> 00:20:00,250
[CHRONO screams]

343
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,666
I understand now.

344
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,083
Aion!!!

345
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,166
[CHRONO] Now I see that
we need to be incomplete.

346
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,000
[AION] And making
you believe that

347
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,166
is just one of their tricks.

348
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,125
Chrono...

349
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,625
[AION yells]

350
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,583
Chrono!

351
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,416
Why hast thou forsaken...?

352
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,125
Aaagghh!

353
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,875
[weakly] Chrono...

354
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:01,375
[ANNA and MARY] Rosette!

355
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,000
[AZMARIA] Rosette?

356
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:02,958
[CLAIRE] Chrono!

357
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:06,541
[GIRLS] Rosette! Chrono! Chrono!

358
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,916
[REMINGTON gasps]

359
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,041
[REMINGTON sighs]

360
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:15,291
[AZMARIA] Father Remington...
This is all we could...

361
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,166
What of Rosette and Chrono?

362
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,208
[AZMARIA sobs]

363
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:24,083
[REMINGTON]
I see. So it's over.

364
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,416
[AZMARIA] No...

365
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,583
I-I believe that wherever
she is, Rosette's alive.

366
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,250
I'm sure of it.

367
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,541
[ROSETTE] I'm sure it
sounds like a cliché,

368
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,166
but I've always dreamed
of my own house.

369
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,416
[CHRONO] Your own house?

370
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,375
[ROSETTE] Mm-Hm.
A house on a grassy field.

371
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:34,333
I'd plant crops and tend sheep,
and sit by the fire at night.

372
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:37,666
[CHRONO] No matter where we go,
as long as I'm with you,

373
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,500
I've found my home.

374
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,458
[ROSETTE] It's the
last episode, "Chrono."

375
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:46,208
[CHRONO] Let's go back,
Rosette... to our home.
