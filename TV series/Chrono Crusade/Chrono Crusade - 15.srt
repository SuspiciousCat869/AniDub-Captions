1
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,916
[thunder]

2
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,666
[bell rings]

3
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:24,583
I understand that the one
known as Chrono is here.

4
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,833
My apologies, but who
might I say is asking?

5
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,375
[STEINER] Hmm.

6
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,958
[DUFFAU] Just tell him,
"The Duke is here."

7
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,875
[CHRONO] Duffau!

8
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:36,916
Chrono?

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,791
[gasps]

10
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,083
[ROSETTE] A devil.

11
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:41,041
[lightning]

12
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,416
That's right, and this
one's a pursuer.

13
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,041
Steiner, back
away from him.

14
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,250
Such a rash child!

15
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:51,291
I am not here to fight.
Not with you.

16
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,791
[CHRONO] What?

17
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,125
[DUFFAU] We are all incomplete
creations, Sinner Chrono.

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,000
And you humans as well...

19
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,625
all cursed by
the number six.

20
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,333
Hence, we have
a common foe.

21
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,000
A common foe?

22
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,666
Let us join together to
defeat the Sinner Aion!

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,583
And for the sake of
retrieving the lost darkness.

24
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:17,375
Place the head of Pandemonium
back beneath the earth.

25
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:23,083
Therefore, I extend the olive
branch and ask for your help.

26
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,666
[CHAIRMAN] No, we cannot
approve of this.

27
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,000
For we who serve the Lord,
to work together with

28
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,666
these creatures is absolutely
out of the question.

29
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,208
But sir, in this case,
isn't it possible

30
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,708
that they have no choice
except to seek our aid?

31
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,500
Even so, it is in their
nature to use this

32
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,750
to further their own agendas.

33
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,416
They are what they are.

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,625
It is my understanding
that the one called Duffau

35
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,333
holds the status of a duke

36
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:02,291
and wields great influence
in the realm of Pandemonium.

37
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,125
I believe we should listen quite
carefully to what he has to say.

38
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,083
[CHAIRMAN sighs]

39
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,250
[CHAIRMAN] It was the New York
branch's acceptance

40
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,291
of a non-human that caused
this to come to pass.

41
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,041
[KATE] We are well
aware of that, sir.

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,750
However, there are other things
we would have you bear in mind.

43
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:23,083
[CHAIRMAN] Then enlighten us,
Sister Kate.

44
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:25,500
Chrono's contributions
to the Order of Magdalene

45
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,500
have not been small.

46
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,458
It's thanks to his efforts that
so many cases have been closed.

47
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,375
And actually this
could prove to be

48
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,708
an excellent opportunity
for us as well.

49
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,833
[CHAIRMAN] Hmm?

50
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,916
[REMINGTON] Until now,
our ability to obtain

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,833
information concerning
Aion and his plans

52
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:45,416
has been limited to scraps of
intelligence and pure deduction.

53
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,541
But no longer.

54
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,291
This alliance
could prove to be

55
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,250
an invaluable font
of information!

56
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,750
And I say we
should accept!

57
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,875
[COUNCILMEN murmur]

58
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,291
[KATE] For us to simply say that
his kind betrayed our Lord

59
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,083
and judge on
that basis alone,

60
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,541
would be bias of
the worst order.

61
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,333
It was Chrono and
our Sister Rosette

62
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,500
who taught us the
truth of that lesson.

63
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:12,166
And in this judgment,
I shall trust them completely.

64
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,416
This could be the worst judgment
since the fruit of knowledge.

65
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,333
We must have the courage
to take this step forward.

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,125
[CHAIRMAN chuckles]

67
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,375
Do you know...

68
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,458
...how much like
Rosette you've become?

69
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,166
[KATE] Hmm?

70
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,625
[REMINGTON chuckles]

71
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,291
You never learn anything
if you never try anything.

72
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:34,666
I think that's what she'd
say if she were in my shoes.

73
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,291
[GURIO] Great Lord Duffau.

74
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,916
How fares Pandemonium?

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
[CARV] I couldn't keep my
eyes open. Too much light.

76
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,500
I see.

77
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,708
[GURIO] And what
of Chrono, Lord?

78
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,375
[DUFFAU] We shall
wait until dusk.

79
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,250
He'll come with
their answer then.

80
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:12,416
Those clothes look
quite nice on you.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,875
Oh, these things?

82
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,625
I borrowed them from
Satella's closet.

83
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,541
The council finally
contacted us, you know?

84
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,083
Then did Sister Kate
say what we...

85
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,541
She said that she's
leaving it up to us.

86
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,958
The council's
not on board yet,

87
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,416
but she said she'll
handle it somehow.

88
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,333
It's so strange.
Even this far away,

89
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,208
I'm still causing problems
for poor Sister Kate.

90
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,041
Oh, but that's not
true at all, Rosette!

91
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,458
You know, I don't
even know why.

92
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,666
[AZMARIA] Huh?

93
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,750
When I heard those other demons
calling Chrono a Sinner,

94
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,291
I never asked him why.

95
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:53,500
[clock ticks]

96
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:56,583
[SATELLA] The head of
Pandemonium he said.

97
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,291
[CHRONO] Huh?

98
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,750
So explain please.

99
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,000
Your bearded friend
was quite discrete,

100
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,208
but I want to know what
it was you Sinners did.

101
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,625
[CHRONO sighs]

102
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,041
[AION] Let us go!
The free world awaits!

103
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,250
[CHRONO] Aion, that's...

104
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,583
[AION] Yes. Pandemonium's head.

105
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,875
This is a revolution, after all.

106
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:24,208
The era of the old guard
shall end today!

107
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,125
We're going to destroy eternity!

108
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,541
Aion, how...

109
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,125
[SHADER] Uh-uh you're late!

110
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,208
Just what have you
been up to, Chrono?

111
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,500
Sh-Sh-Shader...

112
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,916
[AION] So, you came.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,750
[SHADER] Bah!

114
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,833
We can't be doing this...

115
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:47,416
It's time to take
the plunge at last!

116
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,708
[CHRONO] Our dream...

117
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,125
[AION] That's right.

118
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,583
And you'll do anything as long
as it's for our dream.

119
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,625
But is this cause true?

120
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,375
[VIEDE] Hey! Aion!
Let's do this already!

121
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,625
Time to kill.
No more killing time.

122
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,875
[laughs]

123
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,625
Chrono, I'll ask once more.

124
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,666
Are you prepared
to take the plunge?

125
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,958
[CHRONO exhales]

126
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,541
Music to my ears...

127
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,458
[CHRONO] The one that
fell from Heaven...

128
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:26,375
...became Pandemonium.

129
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:27,250
[SATELLA gasps]

130
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:30,458
An angel? You don't mean...

131
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,083
Pandemonium hated God
with all its being

132
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,708
and granted knowledge
to man, made in His image.

133
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,625
Heaven, Earth, and man formed

134
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,708
a never-ending cycle
of faith and hatred,

135
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,583
and changed into the
order we call this world.

136
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,583
[SATELLA] What? That...

137
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,625
[CHRONO] Aion said that he
wanted to change this order...

138
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,833
...to create a world where
desire is not a sin.

139
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,666
When desire is born,

140
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,416
then and only then,
will hope shine.

141
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,666
In the same way,
devils must exist,

142
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,166
so we can see the holiness
and authority of God.

143
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,916
That's why Aion said he wanted
to be free of Heaven's yoke.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,166
[AION] Let us go!
The free world awaits.

145
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,958
But in truth, the price
of freedom was...

146
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:17,583
Looking back, I can see
that's what Aion wanted.

147
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,875
[ROSETTE] Huh?

148
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,666
[AION laughs]

149
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,583
Aion, what have you done?!

150
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,541
Ahh, why such a
long face, Chrono?

151
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,750
Can't you see this leaves
no one to challenge us?

152
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,541
[AION] Look at her...

153
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:41,458
Pandemonium can't say
anything... not anymore.

154
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,291
We are free!

155
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,541
You're going to
destroy the darkness!

156
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,375
[RIZEL] Why are you
getting so mad, Chrono?

157
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,750
Burn it. It's going to burn...

158
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:53,750
This is great!

159
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,541
I'm so excited!

160
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,000
This is all going to
be such fun, oh yes!

161
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,583
[CHRONO] Duffau...

162
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,666
You bastards! Don't you
realize the consequences

163
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,333
of what you've done?

164
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,750
You're a bit too late, Duffau.

165
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,500
So, Aion, it was you.

166
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,375
[AION laughs]

167
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:22,250
I was wondering when those
old bats would show up.

168
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:26,291
Old bats? Ha! They look
like sitting ducks to me.

169
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,166
And I say they can drop dead!

170
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,375
[roaring]

171
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,541
[AION] It's time, Chrono.
You're an accomplice now.

172
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,958
It's with us or against us.

173
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,333
[SHADER] That smarts!

174
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,500
[DUFFAU] You're mine!

175
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:01,875
[CHRONO] Aion!

176
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,500
[DUFFAU] Chrono, put the head
back while there's still time!

177
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,875
This is a revolution,
you old fool!

178
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,916
[DUFFAU] Can't you fools
see what you've done?

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,708
Attack and slay them all!

180
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,125
Don't leave a single one alive!

181
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,583
Ahhhh!

182
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:50,791
Ah! Woolen bloomers!
Heading to Frisco, are you?

183
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,250
Uh-huh! Sister Kate's
sending us.

184
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:58,125
She told us we're supposed to
support Rosette any way we can.

185
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,458
[ELDER] Ah, yes.

186
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,833
And speaking of Rosette,

187
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:04,250
I've brought some good
luck charms for her.

188
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,916
I fear that the
fight will probably

189
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,708
only get fiercer from here,

190
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,375
so with that in mind,
I've whipped up

191
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,666
some new Gospel-specific
automatic clips for her.

192
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,041
And of course,
I've put together

193
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,333
a supply for you three
lovelies as well.

194
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,291
Thank you so
very much, sir.

195
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,708
Rosette will be
as happy as we are.

196
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,958
You girls stay firm
out there, all right?

197
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,125
Right!

198
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,541
We were hand-picked
by Father Remington

199
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,291
specifically for this mission.

200
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:29,041
So we understand
exactly what it is

201
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,833
we're getting into,
Elder, sir.

202
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,083
And we're gonna
go give 'em Hell!

203
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,750
Ooohhh! I'm so proud.

204
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:40,208
But things are going to get
awfully lonely around here.

205
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,958
Oh Elder...

206
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,125
[girls yell]

207
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,208
Oh, you've all grown up
so magnificently.

208
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,333
I want you to
keep me abreast...

209
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,875
For Heaven's sake, sir!

210
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,208
The Virgin's watching,
you pervert!

211
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,416
[thonk]

212
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,666
[ELDER] Lord, please
forgive these girls

213
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,041
who would strike
a helpless old man!

214
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,875
[CLAIRE] The Lord works
in mysterious ways!

215
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,666
[thonk]

216
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,625
[car approaches]

217
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,916
[GILLIAM] My name is Gilliam,

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,250
from the Order of Magdalene's
west coast branch.

219
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,083
Sister Kate asked me to come,
to serve as a witness,

220
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,000
and to help you
in any way I can.

221
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,958
I've also brought a complete
set of militia equipment

222
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,541
to replace yours.

223
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,583
They, and I, am
at your service.

224
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:59,541
Thank you for the offer, sir.

225
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,333
I'm Sister Rosette.

226
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:05,458
And you would be
Chrono, correct?

227
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,750
I've repaired your equipment
kit and brought that as well.

228
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:17,041
[DUFFAU] So, have you
come to a conclusion?

229
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, the Order of Magdalene

230
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,958
will abide by Rosette
and Chrono's decision.

231
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:33,916
[AION] Ah. Can you hear it?

232
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,541
It's the call of desire.
Such a lovely era...

233
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,958
Lady Shader
has sent word.

234
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:44,291
The preparations
are complete, sir.

235
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,166
[SHADER] Hmm?

236
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,791
Oh, good morning!

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,541
Darling, sweet Fi my dear.

238
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,666
Ah!

239
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,458
Thank you... Sister.

240
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,458
My, oh my.
You are close.

241
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,708
[AION] Enough. Show me.

242
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,500
Yes, sir!

243
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,875
[SHADER] As you can see,
I've finally finished it.

244
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:27,583
And making incomplete complete
wasn't easy, let me tell you.

245
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,833
It would have been nice if
they'd written the instructions

246
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,958
in words that were a little
easier to understand.

247
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,291
It took a bit of
figuring on my part.

248
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:37,375
And lots of wracking my
poor little brains out.

249
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,833
The shining wings
that we've claimed,

250
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:43,125
guided by the seven virtues...

251
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,833
[SHADER sighs]

252
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,083
The Book of
Atonement says

253
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,333
forgiveness for
the fallen angels

254
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,125
will only occur when
the head of Pandemonium,

255
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:55,083
six of the Apostles, and the
seven virtues are assembled.

256
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,250
Then the drops
of Atonement

257
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,958
will be born in the
great river of souls.

258
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,083
[AION] And Heaven will become
Earth, Earth will become Heaven,

259
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:05,333
and time will once again
paint a spiral.

260
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:07,916
The alternate ending
to the Apocalypse

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,333
is finally
within our grasp.

262
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,583
And all we need now
is the song of Charity.

263
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,083
That's true, but Chrono
and Mary Magdalene

264
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,125
will be bringing it soon.

265
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,166
Let's have
a welcoming party!

266
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,166
And I'll be in
charge of welcoming.

267
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,791
Joshua still possesses
such incredible power.

268
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,875
[SHADER] I wouldn't have been
able to make this magic circle

269
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,125
if he weren't here.

270
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,625
Please, Lord Aion,

271
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,000
may I take Lord Joshua
back to his quarters now?

272
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,041
All of this has tired him,
and I fear that--

273
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:42,083
[JOSHUA] No, I'm fine.
Don't worry, Big Sister.

274
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,916
Please, my lord.
You mustn't drain yourself.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,833
[JOSHUA grunts]

276
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,000
Stinking humans.
You sicken me.

277
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,041
Rizel was as good as killed
for this little worm.

278
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,041
What makes him
worth such a price?

279
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,000
[SHADER laughs]

280
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,333
Genai, why are
you so angry?

281
00:16:56,416 --> 00:17:00,166
Please let go of him.
You cannot harm Lord Joshua.

282
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,083
All of you know how vital
his mission is to us.

283
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,375
[GENAI growls]

284
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,750
[GENAI] You human bitch!

285
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:09,791
Since when have you talked
to your masters like that?

286
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,500
[AION] Behave yourself, Genai.

287
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,583
[laughs]

288
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,083
Feeling pent up, are we?

289
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,416
[coughs]

290
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,625
Thank you for that,
Big Sister.

291
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:30,375
Why is it always you who ends
up protecting me in the end?

292
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,791
[DUFFAU] I fear that
our time has run out.

293
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,250
In taking the head
of Pandemonium,

294
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,500
Aion has caused
the light of Heaven

295
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,333
to begin to flow
into the darkness.

296
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,125
As the darkness vanishes,

297
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,791
so will the balance
on which Heaven rests,

298
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:52,875
and this will bring disaster
upon your human world.

299
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,125
Chrono, tell me...

300
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,166
For what purpose is Aion
gathering all the Apostles?

301
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,833
I'm not sure that
I've figured out

302
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,291
what Aion actually has in mind.

303
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,458
He never told me
his true plans,

304
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:10,208
but he was always saying that
he'd "become the Creator."

305
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,666
And for that he'd
destroy the world?

306
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,541
He's not going
to get the chance.

307
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,000
Huh?

308
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,291
I guess this makes it two
contracts that I'm bound by.

309
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,208
[SATELLA] Don't do it!

310
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:23,750
Satella?

311
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,833
Seeking help from a devil?

312
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,041
Proposing an
alliance with them?

313
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,916
Just how are you different
from a devil worshipper?

314
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,500
Where has your faith
gone, Rosette?

315
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,291
Right here.

316
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,083
[gasps]

317
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,791
So that's the
mysterious timepiece

318
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,250
I've heard so much of.

319
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,375
[DUFFAU] So, you are
running out of time as well.

320
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a price
I'm willing to pay.

321
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,208
Hold on, I'm the one

322
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,250
who's going to settle the
score with Aion, Rosette.

323
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,416
Look, all I know is there's
a battle to be fought.

324
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,791
And if that means I
have to fight, so be it.

325
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,916
And I will fight, sir.
I'll fight with you by my side.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,958
Such noble words.

327
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:10,458
Truly you are deserving of
the name Mary of Magdalene.

328
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,208
Just what does that mean?

329
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,833
Aion called me
that name as well.

330
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,375
You mean you don't know?

331
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,500
It wasn't just your brother.

332
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:23,458
You were gifted with a legacy
by the will of Heaven as well.

333
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:27,166
[ROSETTE] Hm, don't pull my leg.
There's no way that that's true.

334
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,333
I don't have healing
powers like Joshua,

335
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,625
or glowing wings like Azmaria,
or anything like that.

336
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,541
[DUFFAU] Mary,
the Bringer of Light,

337
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,708
as you are called
by the church.

338
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,750
You, whose delicate fate

339
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,666
is about to be
possessed by darkness,

340
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,000
because your true
form has been twisted.

341
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:51,958
In a short time, marks will
be engraved in your body.

342
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,791
They will protect you
from what is to come.

343
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,833
What marks?

344
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,791
[KATE] Yes, thank you.

345
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,166
We appreciate your assistance,
Reverend Gilliam.

346
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,416
If you can, we would
be most grateful

347
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,125
if you could keep your eye
on Rosette and the others.

348
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,250
[GILLIAM] Oh, I will,
but I must admit,

349
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,083
I was rather impressed
at your willingness

350
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,166
to challenge the will
of the council.

351
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,333
[KATE] I've known it was
going to end up like this

352
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,208
since the day we took
responsibility for Chrono.

353
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,625
[GILLIAM] Yes, but something
about you has changed as well.

354
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,916
Also, concerning Rosette...

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,708
Something Duffau
said troubles me.

356
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,291
[SATELLA] Now wait
a second, Rosette.

357
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:32,916
Are you sure that
you're fine with this?

358
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,250
[ROSETTE]
Perfectly fine.

359
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,375
And let's not forget
what a treasure trove

360
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,416
of information these
devils will be for us.

361
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,000
Information?

362
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,875
About things like your
sister, for instance.

363
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,458
[SATELLA gasps]

364
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,333
[ROSETTE] So we'll be in your
hair for a little while longer.

365
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,666
Oh, and I'd like to
take a bath before bed,

366
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,416
could you take care of
that for me, Steiner?

367
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,666
Yes,
Lady Rosette.

368
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,625
[SATELLA sighs]

369
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,791
Well, in that case,

370
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,750
I'll bill my expenses
to the Magdalenes.

371
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,916
Rosette is so
persistent, isn't she?

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,875
That's why I want to
stay by her side forever.

373
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,458
What did you say?

374
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,208
Heh, heh! Nothing.

375
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,541
[ROSETTE sighs]

376
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,333
What did he mean by "marks"?

377
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,125
Ah!

378
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,416
Ahhh!

379
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,458
In a short time, marks will
be engraved in your body.

380
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,375
[ROSETTE yells]

381
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,958
[AZMARIA] Rosette!
Is something wrong?

382
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,208
[ROSETTE] No! It's nothing!

383
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,416
[AZMARIA] Chrono overcame
such a terrible past,

384
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,541
and Rosette made a contract
with a terrifying devil!

385
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:29,208
I get so intimidated by how
incredible everyone else is.

386
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,500
[SATELLA] But you have the power
of God's Apostles, don't you?

387
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,708
[AZMARIA] Things appear
when I sing, that's all.

388
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,041
Like you, Miss Satella,

389
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,583
you can make things pop
out of jewels, can't you?

390
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,458
[SATELLA] You make it sound like

391
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:41,166
I'm some kind of
street performer!

392
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,208
[ROSETTE]
Next episode, "Believer."

393
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,000
[AZMARIA] I'm going to sing
more than ever before!
