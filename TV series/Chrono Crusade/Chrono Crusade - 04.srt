1
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,916
[REMINGTON] They called
it the Roaring Twenties,

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,333
but in the shadows of
prosperity, the monsters waited.

3
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,083
To combat this evil,

4
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:26,333
the exorcist Sister Rosette and
her soul-bound devil, Chrono,

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,250
were ordered to
rescue Azmaria,

6
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,208
a young girl associated with
the prophecies of Fatima.

7
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,708
However, while they were able to

8
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,833
briefly steal
the girl to safety,

9
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:39,166
in the end she was taken back
by Chrono's ancient foe,

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,958
Lerajie and his human
master, Ricardo.

11
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,250
[CHRONO] Ah!

12
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,541
[REMINGTON]
Now two questions remain:

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,750
What is the source of
Azmaria's power to heal?

14
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,541
And what are Ricardo
and Lerajie's true goals?

15
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:33,416
[footsteps]

16
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,125
[LERAJIE] Look what I found.

17
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,125
[AZMARIA] Ah!

18
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,125
[AZMARIA screams]

19
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,166
[LERAJIE] Wah!

20
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,916
[LERAJIE] Why... Master?

21
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,250
Who ordered you to set
the ground below us ablaze?

22
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,375
Forget the Sinner!

23
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,625
As long as these chains exist,
you cannot defy me.

24
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,958
And I will have you do no
man's bidding except my own.

25
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,750
Not as long as the contract
between us exists.

26
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,291
Is that understood?

27
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,333
As you wish.

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,083
Servant of Fatima,

29
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,375
this is your life's
final stage.

30
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,750
Final?

31
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,458
[RICARDO] This body of mine
lacks the spark of life.

32
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,000
You will bring back that fire.

33
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,000
She's awake!

34
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,041
Are you all right?

35
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,750
Thank goodness.

36
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,000
[ROSETTE] Why are you all...
Where's Chrono?

37
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,666
[REMINGTON]
So, you've come to at last.

38
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:22,541
[REMINGTON sighs]

39
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,375
I fear that the
foe we now face

40
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,166
is in a different league
from any we have met before.

41
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,333
Chrono.

42
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,541
[ANNA] Rosette, I'm so sorry.

43
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,541
[ROSETTE] What?

44
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,875
I'm afraid that I've
been avoiding you,

45
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,500
since we learned about
Chrono... being a...

46
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:39,416
We all have.

47
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,916
Me too.

48
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,375
[ROSETTE] No, no, it's all
right. It doesn't bother me.

49
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,250
But, we...

50
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:52,250
It's fine. Fear is just
a natural response...

51
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,416
to someone who's different.

52
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,250
[ROSETTE winces]

53
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,250
Are you all right, Rosette?

54
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,291
[ANNA] Wait!
You mustn't move yet!

55
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,291
There's no time
to worry about this.

56
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,833
[ROSETTE] Chrono.

57
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,250
[CHRONO] Ah?

58
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,291
[CHRONO] No, you mustn't.

59
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,291
Please.

60
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:33,875
[ROSETTE] But, Azmaria is...

61
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,125
You saw her...
how she smiled.

62
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:43,416
Twice! Twice I've failed her.

63
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,541
You're the only one
that can rescue Azmaria!

64
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,541
You're her only hope!

65
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,500
If you called on your powers,

66
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:55,916
you could heal your
injuries instantly!

67
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You could do it
and save her.

68
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,291
If I use them...
your life will be...

69
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,833
[ROSETTE] I don't care!

70
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,875
We've got to save Azmaria.

71
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,583
There's something
I have to tell her.

72
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:13,000
Please, Chrono,
I'm begging you!

73
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:18,750
The source of Chrono's power
is the soul of his contractor.

74
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,750
Rosette...

75
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:30,625
[RICARDO] You see, my dear,
this body of mine

76
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,166
was blown to bits during
that loathsome war.

77
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,791
--[AZMARIA gasps]
--[RICARDO laughs]

78
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,750
[RICARDO] But it's not
possible for it to die, either.

79
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,125
For I had signed
a pact of undeath

80
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,583
with my contractor, Lerajie.

81
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:46,375
Thus my physical
body was restored.

82
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,958
But a man is
more than flesh.

83
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,166
Only the corpse itself
was brought back.

84
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,375
While intact,
it is lacking life.

85
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,583
Because of this, I rot!

86
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,875
[RICARDO groans]

87
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:07,500
I rot because Lerajie's
power has become imperfect.

88
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,875
Once, there was nothing
that he could not do,

89
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,041
but he has since fallen.

90
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:17,625
My powers were lessened
by the Sinner, Chrono.

91
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,208
Chrono.

92
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:27,791
And now you will open
the gate to Heaven for us.

93
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:33,125
A Servant of Fatima, yes,
an Apostle of the most high!

94
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,625
The terms of my contract
must be fulfilled,

95
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,583
no matter what the cost.

96
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:40,000
And if this imperfect
devil's powers

97
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,250
are inadequate to
the task desired,

98
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,375
then I am forced to use the
power of one who is perfect.

99
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,791
The power of God himself!

100
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:54,500
[LERAJIE] Let us
begin the ceremony.

101
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,333
Servant of Fatima,

102
00:08:56,416 --> 00:09:00,625
illuminate us with the miracle
the Virgin entrusted to you.

103
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,666
Now, let us hear you sing!
Let us hear you praise God.

104
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,750
[ANNA] Those lights...
what are they?

105
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,625
[ROSETTE] Huh?

106
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,666
They're Astral Lines.

107
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,166
Astral Lines?

108
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,833
Could it be...

109
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,708
...that the power
of the Apostles

110
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,583
comes from the
Astral Lines of Force?

111
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,750
But what are these
Astral Lines?

112
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,583
[REMINGTON] The streams which
compose the Astral Plane,

113
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,750
a great gathering of spiritual
energy that encircles the Earth.

114
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,083
Think of it as a river,

115
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:55,875
from which all newborn
things are given life,

116
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,458
and to that endless flow, the
souls of the dead must return,

117
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,125
like drops in the river of life.

118
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,416
The source
of all life.

119
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,000
This doesn't make any sense.

120
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,500
What is God trying
to make Azmaria do?

121
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,708
[AZMARIA screams]

122
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,583
[RICARDO] That's it!
Scream even more!

123
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,416
Scream! And scream again!

124
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,541
The Astral power your
voice has summoned

125
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,708
lights the fires of life
in this rotted body.

126
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,666
[screaming continues]

127
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,208
[ANNA]
What do you mean "no"?

128
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,791
I thought that the plane was
supposed to be ready ages ago!

129
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,583
It can't be...

130
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,541
Please, Chrono, help me!

131
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,666
Please.

132
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,416
I don't want Azmaria to
keep suffering like this.

133
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,541
And I know you feel the same
way deep inside. I know it!

134
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,333
[CHRONO] Don't throw your
life away so cheaply.

135
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,541
[ROSETTE] Stop it!

136
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,541
The longer you delay,
the harder it's going to be!

137
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,500
Chrono!

138
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,750
[CHRONO sighs]

139
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:13,208
[CHRONO]
Ten minutes. No longer.

140
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,583
Thanks, Chrono.

141
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:38,583
[CHRONO yells]

142
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,583
[gasps]

143
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:18,375
[AZMARIA]
Ahh! Aaahh!

144
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,500
Huh?

145
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,583
[RICARDO] Lerajie!

146
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,333
That's enough.

147
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,666
[RICARDO] Why have
you stopped it?

148
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,958
Aaahh!

149
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,791
[LERAJIE] Thank you
for all the hard work

150
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,666
you've put into
this plan, Master.

151
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,916
However, I'm afraid that
our intent was never truly

152
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,916
to bring back your life,
as you can see.

153
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
A receptor!

154
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,666
[LERAJIE] That's right.

155
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,125
A receptor into which

156
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:01,125
most of this lovely
Astral energy has gone.

157
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,958
Damn you!

158
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,166
It flows into me,
the Astral radiance,

159
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,416
and with the
blessings of God,

160
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,958
I'm going to break these
chains of yours, Master.

161
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,833
[RICARDO gasps]

162
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:21,500
Lerajie! Ahh!

163
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,916
[LERAJIE laughs]

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,375
[LERAJIE]
And with this, I'm free!

165
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,625
Are you...

166
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,166
Everything's jake, 'kay?

167
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,708
Here we go.

168
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,833
Azmaria!

169
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,250
[LERAJIE grunts]

170
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,041
Lerajie!

171
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,500
What in Hell is he?

172
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,000
[CHRONO] A pursuer.

173
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,625
[ROSETTE] Azmaria!

174
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:05,250
[LERAJIE] There are so many ways
in which an Apostle can be used.

175
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:09,833
Neither you nor
Aion shall have her!

176
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,958
[LERAJIE chuckles]

177
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,041
[LERAJIE] You know, Sinner,
I wonder what Aion would think,

178
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,875
seeing you as you
are now, a dog of God.

179
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,500
Aion.

180
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:28,291
Rosette, you rescue Azmaria.
I'll take care of Lerajie.

181
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,666
[ROSETTE] But what about them?

182
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,125
The only living humans
on this entire ship

183
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,875
are Azmaria and yourself.

184
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,750
What? Then what kind
of creatures are they?

185
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,666
[CHRONO] Legion. Lower class
devils in human form.

186
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,041
[LERAJIE] I'll be claiming your
skull as my prize, Chrono.

187
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:50,208
And with that trophy, an even
greater rank shall be mine!

188
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,458
Get the Apostle
out of here at once!

189
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,541
[gunfire]

190
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,500
Azmaria...

191
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,625
It's losing altitude!

192
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,708
[CHRONO groans]

193
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,000
[LERAJIE] You're not as
strong as you used to be.

194
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,875
Did becoming God's dog mean
having your fangs pulled?

195
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,833
I didn't have a use for them!

196
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,250
Those eyes! That voice!

197
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,583
Is the shadow that
once struck fear

198
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,833
in the hearts of devils
everywhere vanquished?

199
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,833
What did you lose besides
your rank? What else?

200
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,250
[CHRONO] I think you'll find
that I've gained much more!

201
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,958
[AZMARIA yells]

202
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,333
[ROSETTE] Azmaria, get down!

203
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,833
[ROSETTE exhales]

204
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,750
[AZMARIA] Rosette!

205
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,916
Thank you.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,666
[ROSETTE] Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

207
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,000
[AZMARIA]
What about you, Rosette?

208
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,708
[AZMARIA] Ah.

209
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,583
[AZMARIA] Is that...
really Chrono?

210
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,500
That's right,
Chrono, the Sinner,

211
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,833
the Broken Horn,
the one they cast down.

212
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,958
But whatever name you
choose, he's a devil.

213
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,458
Ah! A devil?

214
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:36,916
[ROSETTE] Hm.

215
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,041
He doesn't look like one,
but that's because of this.

216
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:47,833
This special seal restrains
Chrono's power. It has to.

217
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,458
Chrono's powers
feed on the soul...

218
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:52,708
the life of his contractor.

219
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,166
And every time he
uses his powers,

220
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,416
the shorter the life of
his contractor becomes.

221
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,541
[AZMARIA gasps]

222
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,000
Are you saying that...

223
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
[ROSETTE] That's right.

224
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,916
The odds are good that
I won't live to see... thirty.

225
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,875
[AZMARIA] But how?

226
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,625
How could you
sacrifice so much?

227
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,875
How can you do this,
knowing that you'll...

228
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,916
Let me ask you the reverse.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,875
How is it that you can
give up so easily?

230
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,541
[ROSETTE sighs]

231
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,500
I can't understand
that attitude.

232
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,250
"It's bad luck."
"I have no choice."

233
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:46,583
People who passively
accept their fate...

234
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,083
Because no one knows their
future, least of all me.

235
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,833
So I don't dare
put things off.

236
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:56,500
I have to do what I can,
while I can still do it.

237
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:01,208
So, I'll be kicking and
screaming till the very end.

238
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,083
[ROSETTE chuckles]

239
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,958
[CHRONO groans]

240
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,083
[LERAJIE] This is
the power of God!

241
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,833
[LERAJIE laughs]

242
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,833
I gave her my word,
my promise.

243
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,333
[LERAJIE]
To your contractor, hm?

244
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,166
[CHRONO] I have a mission.

245
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,375
And until I make
good that promise,

246
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,833
I'm afraid I can't let you
pursuers take my head!

247
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,000
Wah!

248
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,208
[gasps]

249
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:33,166
[LERAJIE] Not bad!
Now let me give it back!

250
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,208
[CHRONO] Rah!

251
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,750
Worried about your human?

252
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:41,125
I can hear the clock tick...
the sounds of her breath.

253
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,000
How many beats does
she have left, Sinner?

254
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,250
[CHRONO yells]

255
00:18:56,333 --> 00:19:00,458
[CHRONO] Rosette!
No! Don't come out here!

256
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,583
[LERAJIE] Allow me to end your
attachments and worries...

257
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,666
forever!

258
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,333
[CHRONO] No!

259
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,666
[CHRONO] Ah!

260
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,875
[LERAJIE laughs]

261
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:20,041
[LERAJIE] Agh! What was that?

262
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,875
[LERAJIE] Damn you!

263
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,791
[CHRONO] You underestimate
the power of humans.

264
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,916
[LERAJIE] Wah!

265
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,083
[ROSETTE] Azmaria!

266
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,583
[ROSETTE] Ahhh!

267
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,208
[AZMARIA] My wings have always
called forth unhappiness,

268
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,416
but now...

269
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,625
I'll do what I can,
while I can still do it.

270
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,166
[AZMARIA] If I struggle
with all my might...

271
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:39,041
[AZMARIA] I wonder if something
might begin to change.

272
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,208
[ROSETTE and CHRONO] What?

273
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,458
Your powers...

274
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,291
...don't work anymore?

275
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,833
[AZMARIA] Mm-hmm.

276
00:20:56,916 --> 00:21:00,791
It appears as though I used
my power too much, too quickly.

277
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,625
[ROSETTE] Whoa!

278
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:07,958
They think it will be a while
before I can recover completely,

279
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:13,166
a month or two, half a year,
or possibly even longer.

280
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,375
So it appears that there
really is no longer

281
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,291
any reason to keep me here.

282
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:26,333
Where... should I go now?

283
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,208
[ROSETTE] Listen up!

284
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,333
There's a position open,
in the choir, they say.

285
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,250
The only requirement is that
you have to be older than ten.

286
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,750
With your voice,
we'd be glad to have you.

287
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,416
If it's your choice.
What do you say?

288
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,083
[AZMARIA] Mhmm.

289
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:46,958
[AZMARIA laughs]

290
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:21,500
[ROSETTE] This place
is driving me crazy!

291
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,333
The rules are strict,
the food is plain,

292
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:26,291
we get up at the crack of dawn,
and go to bed too early!

293
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,000
Why can't a girl
have a little fun?

294
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,458
It's too much stress!

295
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,625
[AZMARIA] But that's no reason
to just leave, is it?

296
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:35,250
[ROSETTE] Oh, the wind of
freedom is calling to me.

297
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,666
[AZMARIA] Rosette!

298
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,500
[CHRONO] Oh, let her go,
she's just being selfish again.

299
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:41,416
[ROSETTE]
Next episode, "Militia."

300
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,541
[AZMARIA] Yeah! I want to
become just like Rosette!

301
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,750
[CHRONO] Are you okay with that?
