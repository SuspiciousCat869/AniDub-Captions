1
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,291
Hurry! Hurry!
We're gonna be late!

2
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,333
You're the one who had
to take a nap, remember?

3
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:38,500
[AZMARIA] Oh, Rosette, I--

4
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,541
[ROSETTE] Sorry, Azmaria!

5
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,916
We're in a rush,
no time for chit-chat!

6
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,208
[AZMARIA] Oh...

7
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,958
[ROSETTE pants]

8
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:55,333
[ROSETTE] S-Sorry for being
late, I brought Chrono with me!

9
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:07,083
[KATE] It's the first time a
devil has entered this room.

10
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
[ROSETTE laughs]

11
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,041
I assume you know the
reason that you're here.

12
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,708
Did you find
anything indicating

13
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:18,208
a connection between
Lerajie's recent actions...

14
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,083
...and those of Aion?

15
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:28,291
No, ma'am. We think this
was just Lerajie's scheme.

16
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,166
From what we can tell,
he was only planning

17
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,125
to absorb the Astral Lines in
order to revive his own power.

18
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,166
Is that so?

19
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,375
Rosette, I apologize if this has

20
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,166
brought up some
painful memories.

21
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,375
As if I could ever
forget what happened!

22
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,583
Not when Aion's the devil

23
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,166
who took my brother,
Joshua, from me!

24
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,166
I could never forget!

25
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,625
[REMINGTON] Thanks to Azmaria,

26
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,750
we now understand the
role of the Apostles.

27
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,208
If they are able to
summon the Astral Lines,

28
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,500
then the reason for which Aion
took Joshua is now clear.

29
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:02,208
He's seeking a way to
acquire the power of God.

30
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,166
But if he's trying
to do that, sir,

31
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,916
what do you think
Aion's real goal is?

32
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,583
[KATE] We think he's planning
a war against Heaven.

33
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,833
And that which drives him,
is not Satan's plan,

34
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,666
but a desire to
remake the universe

35
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,500
to his own warped vision.

36
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,916
I fear that's the only
conclusion that makes sense.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,333
You should also know this:

38
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,125
For Aion's war to succeed,

39
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:30,416
it will be necessary for him to
possess both Joshua and Azmaria.

40
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,875
[ROSETTE gasps]

41
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,666
In the time before we
were called the Sinners,

42
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,291
there was something
that Aion used to say--

43
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,541
that the only thing one born
imperfect should strive for

44
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,583
is to become perfect.

45
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,375
He swore to create his
own end of the world...

46
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,250
To make his own apocalypse.

47
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,958
[ROSETTE]
Another end of the world?

48
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,708
He'll destroy the destinies
of Joshua and everyone else,

49
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:01,375
just to play God!

50
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:04,416
The only reason I came here was
to get help finding my brother.

51
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,666
And from what I've seen,

52
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,208
I'm ready to give those
monsters a decent fight!

53
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:08,791
Rosette!

54
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,166
Please, Sister!

55
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,041
Please assign me the mission
of finding the Apostles!

56
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,875
I swear I won't let you down!

57
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:16,458
I've told you that's
still under inquiry!

58
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,375
Besides, what could you
possibly do on your own?

59
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,416
We're talking about my
little brother, dammit!

60
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
[KATE] Enough!

61
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,791
You're too emotionally
involved in this right now.

62
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,333
If you can't
control yourself,

63
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:30,375
someday you won't even see
what's right in front of you!

64
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,833
You're part of this Order!

65
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:34,750
You can't afford to forget
the rules that we operate by!

66
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,166
[ROSETTE] But--

67
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,750
[KATE] If you must know,
Father Remington has been asked

68
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,583
to investigate the
whereabouts of the Apostles,

69
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,250
beginning with Joshua.

70
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,750
In the meantime, I'll be
placing you on common duty,

71
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,833
so you have time to cool off
that hot head of yours!

72
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,458
[ROSETTE] Jeez! Why is she
always so hard-headed?

73
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,250
And why'd she have
to be like that?

74
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,500
She never
understands anything!

75
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:57,750
[CHRONO] Wait for me, Rosette!

76
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,166
[ROSETTE]
Get a wiggle on, slowpoke.

77
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,000
[AZMARIA] Oh! Um, Rosette!

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,500
Oh, Azmaria,
sorry about that!

79
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,333
Silly me!

80
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,875
[ROSETTE laughs]

81
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,500
[AZMARIA chuckles]

82
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,791
[AZMARIA] You two
are always so busy.

83
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,750
[ROSETTE] Well, yeah,
that's because there are

84
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,291
always devils causing
trouble someplace.

85
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,500
[CHRONO] So, um,
how's the choir?

86
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,541
Oh, I'm really
enjoying it!

87
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,875
And in our next recital,
I'll have a solo!

88
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,958
It's good to see
you smiling, now.

89
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,750
You really had the two
of us worried for a bit.

90
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,833
Well, everything's
changed for the better.

91
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,291
[ROSETTE] That's funny,

92
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:44,125
I've changed a lot
since I came here, too.

93
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,708
And I've learned a lot
of different things.

94
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,083
I've grown up a lot,

95
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,916
and this place has kinda
been like a school.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,083
Hm.

97
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,583
But now there's nothing
left for me to learn here!

98
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,000
--[CHRONO] Huh?
--It's time! To leave!

99
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,083
[CHRONO and AZMARIA] Huh?

100
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,500
Didn't Sister Kate
say that I'd end up

101
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,333
not even seeing what's in front
of me if things don't change?

102
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,291
If I stay here,
I'll go blind!

103
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,750
I don't think that's
what she meant!

104
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,583
[ROSETTE] There's no use
trying to stop me,

105
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,875
I'm going to find
Joshua on my own.

106
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,833
Wa, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!

107
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,833
Ahhhh!

108
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,833
[thud]

109
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:17,958
Ow!

110
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,875
Um, are you all right, Rosette?

111
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,208
Chrono, we're going!

112
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,583
What, right now?

113
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,083
[ROSETTE] Of course, right now!

114
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,541
There's no time like the present
when there's a job to be done!

115
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,583
So, I'm getting gone
as fast as I can!

116
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,750
I think this is a
bad idea, Rosette.

117
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,708
It's fine! I've decided,
and that's that.

118
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,750
[REMINGTON]
And what did you decide?

119
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,458
[ROSETTE] Huh?

120
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,208
Wah! Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-

121
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,083
Fa-Father Remington!

122
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,291
I thought you
might come here.

123
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,333
I-I'm really sorry,
Father, sir.

124
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,916
But I just want to
find my brother, Joshua!

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,333
Have you considered
joining the militia?

126
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,625
[ROSETTE] Huh? The militia?
The First Class?

127
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,666
Yes. As you no doubt know,

128
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,458
that class have been
granted certain privileges,

129
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,666
including the right to conduct
their own investigations.

130
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,875
In fact, several militia
have been investigating

131
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,583
their own private cases
for quite some time.

132
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,666
That would be a perfect
fit for you right now.

133
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,916
But, how could I...

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,583
Sister Kate must be convinced
of your own ability to fight...

135
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,958
at that level.

136
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,541
I get it.
Show her my abilities!

137
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,791
[CHRONO] Uhh...

138
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,375
Well, what's your beef?!

139
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,333
Uh, nothing at all!

140
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,875
[KATE] Here you are. I added an
extra helping of milk and sugar.

141
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,625
[AZMARIA] Um, thanks.

142
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:50,875
This is good!

143
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,708
Isn't it? It's a special
blend of black tea leaves

144
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,500
I received as a gift!

145
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,208
Now then, what did you want?

146
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:01,000
And... you won't laugh?

147
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,291
Of course not.

148
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,208
Listening to the problems
of others is part of our work.

149
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,375
Even if what I want is to
become more like Rosette?

150
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,958
[KATE coughs]

151
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,250
I want to become a
distinguished exorcist like her

152
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:17,083
and devote the rest of my life
to helping people in trouble!

153
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,583
Is that so strange?

154
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,666
[KATE] Well, I'm afraid
that allowing someone

155
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,666
to follow her lead is...

156
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,583
[AZMARIA] I hated it...
this power.

157
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,375
I even hated myself,

158
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,916
and how I made the people
around me unhappy.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But...

160
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,625
Rosette never, ever gave up.

161
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,625
And I... never want
to give up again!

162
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:50,666
I want to do things for
others just like she does!

163
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,083
Azmaria...

164
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:59,250
[footsteps]

165
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,000
It's cold because
the room's temperature

166
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,916
is regulated to maintain
the spirit energy.

167
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,500
This is where Rosette did
all of her training as well.

168
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,666
Oh, my!

169
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,291
[KATE] It was invented
by the Elder,

170
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,666
to project energy
formation fields,

171
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,583
and uses mock spirit form
containment units.

172
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,250
To put it simply, this is
our exorcist training area.

173
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,875
The targets are
artificial poltergeists.

174
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,166
By using this system,

175
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,583
we can simulate indoor
and outdoor battles

176
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,750
with all kinds of monsters,
under any conditions.

177
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,750
Real monsters?

178
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,750
[KATE chuckles]

179
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,083
Oh, relax, my dear.

180
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,958
The spirit energy is controlled
for training purposes.

181
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,791
We won't make a novice
deal with too much.

182
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,916
Now, just go down these
stairs and wait, child.

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,625
I'll give you more
detailed instructions

184
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,958
from the control room.

185
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,541
[AZMARIA] Right.

186
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,833
[CHRONO] Do you remember...
when you and I first came here?

187
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,833
[door opens]

188
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,666
[REMINGTON] Have you
prepared yourself?

189
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,791
[ROSETTE] Yes, sir.

190
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,833
Incidentally, Chrono's
staying here with me.

191
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,125
[CHRONO] Huh?

192
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,000
It's "why," not "huh."

193
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,166
If you were to go with her,

194
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,208
it wouldn't be much
of a test, would it?

195
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,125
Now, Rosette, would
you please hand over

196
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,958
that little watch of yours?

197
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,833
[ROSETTE] So,
where's Sister Kate?

198
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,333
She'll be informed later.

199
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,416
She'll be informed later?

200
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,708
If we get the right results,

201
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,708
I'll find a way to explain
it to her afterwards.

202
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,708
[ROSETTE] Oh.

203
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,041
[REMINGTON chuckles]

204
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,958
[REMINGTON] Are you ready
to start, Rosette?

205
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,750
[ROSETTE] Yes, you can
start whenever you want!

206
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:40,958
[REMINGTON]
Level twenty's the one used

207
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,750
by the most advanced class.

208
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,041
[CHRONO] Right, Father.

209
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,791
Initiate spiritual
energy field.

210
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,083
[AZMARIA] Huh?

211
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,125
[REMINGTON] Release the targets!

212
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,916
[CHRONO] Right.

213
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,791
[REMINGTON] Beginning recording.

214
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,166
The condition for
passing this test

215
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,250
is the extermination of
all targets within one hour.

216
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:09,041
[REMINGTON] Very well,
then. Good luck.

217
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,416
[ROSETTE] Yes, sir!

218
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,416
[CHRONO gasps]

219
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,875
I sense something evil!

220
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,791
[REMINGTON] Oh, yes, that.

221
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,416
Actually, I released
a real monster down there.

222
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,041
It was one of the
most powerful spirits

223
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,500
we had sealed in storage.

224
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,583
What?! But why?!

225
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,875
She has to see what
she's really up against.

226
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,875
If she can't clear her way

227
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,583
through a simple
problem like this,

228
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,708
she won't ever be able
to convince Sister Kate.

229
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,791
[KATE] What was
that you just said?

230
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,125
Gah!

231
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,625
Huh? Ah.

232
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,666
What is going on here!?

233
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,708
[AZMARIA] Sister Kate?

234
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,666
Where are you?

235
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:07,666
[AZMARIA] Ah!

236
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,458
[INSTRUCTOR] You're too slow!

237
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,875
How many times do
I have to tell you?

238
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,083
[AZMARIA] Huh?

239
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,416
[AZMARIA] Uh...

240
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:45,916
[AZMARIA screams]

241
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,041
[REMINGTON]
It's natural to be scared.

242
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,583
Your opponents are
monsters, after all.

243
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,916
But the important
thing comes after that.

244
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,541
Taking one step forward,

245
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,791
no matter how
frightened you are.

246
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,458
[REMINGTON] Rosette,
can you hear me?

247
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,875
Yes.

248
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,458
There's been an accident.

249
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,583
I'm sorry, but we
must stop the test.

250
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,958
[ROSETTE] What? Why?
Tell me the reason!

251
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:16,833
Azmaria is down there,
and we can't contact her.

252
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,541
What? Azmaria!

253
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,583
[REMINGTON] And, there's a real
devil on the loose down there.

254
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,250
What, but how?

255
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,875
Well, I released it,
in order to test your strength.

256
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,875
But I never thought there would
be someone there before you.

257
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,333
What did you just say?!

258
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,583
You shouldn't have been
here in the first place!

259
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,250
[ROSETTE] Gah! Sister Kate!

260
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,000
[KATE] Rosette,
come back right now.

261
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,041
We'll take care of
the rest of this,

262
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,666
do you understand me?

263
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,833
What about Azmaria?

264
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,291
She'll be all right.

265
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,666
We'll rescue her right now,
so don't worry.

266
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,041
Is that understood, Rosette?

267
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,000
[ROSETTE] Father Remington.

268
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,666
[REMINGTON] Huh?

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,166
[ROSETTE] Please, sir,
I'm begging you,

270
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,000
give me permission to go
and rescue Azmaria.

271
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,791
Are you out of your mind?!

272
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,666
Please, Rosette, we're dealing
with a Mind Eater, here.

273
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,125
It possesses you, reads your
mind, and then impersonates you.

274
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,500
This particular one was
responsible for over

275
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,083
fifty murders during
the Civil War.

276
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,583
This isn't something
you can handle, Rosette.

277
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,500
Let the militia deal with this!

278
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,958
[ROSETTE] But ma'am...

279
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,958
--[static]
--Huh? Rosette! Rosette!

280
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:27,041
Answer us, Rosette!
Is something wrong?

281
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:29,958
[ROSETTE] Father?
Father Remington?

282
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:34,833
[distant laughter]

283
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,666
[ROSETTE yells]

284
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,125
Don't scare me
like that, Azmaria!

285
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,291
[laughter]

286
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,916
Rosette!

287
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,833
[ROSETTE groans]

288
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:09,125
[laughter]

289
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,416
This body possesses power!

290
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,416
Wonderful power!

291
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,083
[ROSETTE] Azmaria!
Get a hold of yourself!

292
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:34,375
Azmaria! Azmaria!

293
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,000
[MIND EATER screams]

294
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:58,625
[MIND EATER screams]

295
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,208
I gotta help Rosette!

296
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,750
[REMINGTON] Wait!

297
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,958
Wait for what, Father?

298
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,083
We can't just stand
here and watch them die!

299
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:15,166
[REMINGTON] This is the moment
of truth for Rosette.

300
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,458
You don't mean--

301
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,208
Do you know
what you're saying?

302
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,416
That thing down there is going
to eat their hearts and souls!

303
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,791
If you were to save her now,
nothing is gained at all.

304
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,583
And under these circumstances,
she has only one option left.

305
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:36,416
You want Rosette to perform
a soul exorcism... alone?

306
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,166
[KATE] Your little test could
cost Rosette dearly.

307
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,166
[REMINGTON] Yet not
everything can be solved

308
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,083
by pulling the trigger of a gun.

309
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,416
But if there's trouble,
then I'm going in.

310
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,458
All we can do now is pray.

311
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:58,166
Pray that Azmaria's causality
won't overtly influence Rosette.

312
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,208
Causality...

313
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,083
Of course, honestly,
I'm not very good at diving.

314
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,166
Here I go!

315
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,208
Azmaria! Look over
here, Azmaria!

316
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,541
If you don't fight back,

317
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,708
your soul is going
to be taken over!

318
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,750
[MIND EATER] It's no use.

319
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,625
You're the Mind Eater.

320
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,458
That child... will
never move again.

321
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,916
Do you see those
graves there?

322
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,750
Her mother and father's,

323
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:46,750
the orchestra members
that cared for her...

324
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,750
her powers were the
cause of all their deaths.

325
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,791
God has entrusted
her with a great power,

326
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,250
yet her heart
fears any use of it.

327
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,250
Azmaria.

328
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,208
[KATE] Those entrusted
with the power of God,

329
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,583
are always burdened
with the cross

330
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,958
of an equally great causality.

331
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:07,250
[REMINGTON] Not unlike our Lord.

332
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,958
They are considered
macabre by the ignorant,

333
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:14,333
and when they finally find
peace, it is all taken away.

334
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,083
[MIND EATER] I can hear her,

335
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:19,083
"If only I didn't
have this power..."

336
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,625
Joshua.

337
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,375
[MIND EATER]
Loneliness, fear, anxiety,

338
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,958
and, more than
anything else, power.

339
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:33,250
Quite a comfortable
place. Oh yes.

340
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,291
Shut up, you fiend. I came
here to rescue Azmaria,

341
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,291
not listen to you!

342
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,833
[AZMARIA] Huh?

343
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,541
[ROSETTE] What? What is this?

344
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,416
Azmaria, can you hear me?

345
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,125
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid!

346
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:55,708
But keeping those fears to
yourself won't solve anything!

347
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,166
[MIND EATER] Keep your
mouth shut, nasty girl.

348
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,916
[ROSETTE grunts]

349
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,916
Listen, Azmaria, you don't have
to be afraid of your power!

350
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,291
You have to fight back!
You're not alone in this world!

351
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,125
I'm here for you!
Chrono is too!

352
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,125
We'll be by your side!

353
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,375
[AZMARIA gasps]

354
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:20,375
[MIND EATER] Shut up!

355
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,875
The important thing is...

356
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:26,333
even when you're
scared, taking it in stride,

357
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,416
and taking a step
forward anyways.

358
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,541
[ROSETTE screams]

359
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,375
Rosette!

360
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:38,458
[AZMARIA] No!
Don't take Rosette away!

361
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,041
[CHRONO]
Rosette! Rosette!

362
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:12,416
[ROSETTE] Chrono...?

363
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,166
Jeepers, I can't believe you
actually fought with causality.

364
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,333
[ROSETTE] Chrono,
where's Azmaria?

365
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,875
[CHRONO chuckles]

366
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,375
Azmaria!

367
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,416
Thank you, Rosette.

368
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,458
Thank you.

369
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,250
[AZMARIA giggles]

370
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,291
[AZMARIA] Rosette,
I saw something.

371
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,750
[ROSETTE] Yeah, I saw it too.

372
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,166
[AZMARIA] Chrono, you're
completely different from

373
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,375
what I thought a devil
would be like, aren't you?

374
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,125
[CHRONO] Yeah, I get that a lot.

375
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:30,166
[AZMARIA] You always do what
Rosette tells you to do,

376
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,375
you get involved in
difficult situations,

377
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:34,500
and you burden yourself
with other people's troubles.

378
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,208
You don't seem
like a devil at all.

379
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,791
[CHRONO] Yeah,
I get that a lot, too.

380
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,208
[AZMARIA] I love you for
being that way, Chrono!

381
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,541
[SATELLA] Next episode,
"Jewel Witch."

382
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:44,875
[CHRONO] Hold on!

383
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,458
[AZMARIA] Who was that?
