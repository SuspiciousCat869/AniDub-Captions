[DETECTIVE] Three days.

11
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,375
This calamity has occurred
in just three days.

12
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,416
First it was the
Jayrock gang...

13
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,541
and yesterday
the Bogard family.

14
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,333
That's two Mafia clans...

15
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,291
completely slaughtered
by the same creature,

16
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,000
and all the survivors
say that the attacker

17
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,208
was some kind of
enormous hound...

18
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,458
a dog with
glowing blue eyes.

19
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,041
Did you just say blue eyes?

20
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,416
That's right.
And it's not something

21
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,375
that our officers can
possibly fight, Sister.

22
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:03,375
Tell me, do you know what
kind of creature this is?

23
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:07,750
This black dog...
is not of this world.

24
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,541
Relax, Detective. It's fine.

25
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,708
The Magdalene Order
is taking action,

26
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,458
even as we speak.

27
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,458
Geez! This is
totally ridiculous!

28
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,375
We're going over fifty,
and we still can't catch it!

29
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,500
Hold on!

30
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,208

Can't this heap go any faster?

[CHRONO] Right!

35
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,208
I missed! But how?

36
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,375
I think the bullets
passed right through it.

37
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:23,458
[ROSETTE] Huh?

38
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,208
Ahhh!

39
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:39,375
Ahh!

40
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,500
Ahhh!

41
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:41,916
Rosette!

42
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,416
Cut him to pieces,
my brave May!

43
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,541
Mutigster!

44
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,708
[SATELLA] It's getting much
closer to becoming corporeal.

45
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,333
I should be able
to finish it off...

46
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:20,958
...next time.

47
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,333
Satella...

48
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,791
Hey, what's that German
Jezebel doing here?

49
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,208
[CHRONO] Oh, for
crying out loud,

50
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,666
just turn the gas
down, all right?

51
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,833
Ands-hay Off-ay.

52
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,666
I wanna know
what she's up to!

53
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,541
Rosette!

54
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:40,166
[groaning]

55
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,583
I'll call for a medic while you
handle the survivor, all right?

56
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,125
[ROSETTE] Right!

57
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:02,500
Hold on! Just hold on
a little longer!

58
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:07,625
No, hold on!
Don't give up!

59
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,958
Please!

60
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,333
[ROSETTE sobs]

61
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,041
[KATE] Now then, militia,

62
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,791
the true identity
of the creature

63
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:27,166
Sister Rosette encountered
in Manhattan last night

64
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,791
has been revealed via evidence
found at another crime scene.

65
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:35,583
[REMINGTON] Bianca Winger.
Female. Age twenty-two.

66
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,791
Using black magic, she
appears to have sacrificed

67
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,541
her own life in order
to summon a hellhound,

68
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,583
for the purpose of slaughtering
New York's Cosa Nostra--

69
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,041
the Mafia.

70
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:49,083
This gruesome trail of carnage
appears to be all her doing.

71
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,000
But why?!

72
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,625
Vengeance, of course.

73
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,375
Or, more concisely, for love.

74
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,791
What we have learned so far
is that about six months ago,

75
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:02,583
a Richard Smith,
Bianca's fiancé, was caught

76
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,583
in a gun battle between
the Mafia and the police,

77
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,375
and was killed
in the crossfire.

78
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,500
[whispered]
Her fiancé...

79
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,625
Such is the heart that
sometimes the greatest of loves

80
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,333
can be transformed
into purest hate.

81
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,208
[KATE sighs]

82
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,166
I feel such pity for her,

83
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,625
and for the pain
that she had to bear.

84
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,208
Our problem now is that
the creature she summoned

85
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,333
happens to be an Astral spirit.

86
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,041
It has been created from
Bianca's negative emotions,

87
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,708
her sadness,
hatred, and despair.

88
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,791
And as such, its existence is
like an arrow without substance.

89
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,375
So you're saying we can't
attack it with standard weapons

90
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,833
or imprison it
with our barriers.

91
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,000
And as the creature continues
to consume more victims,

92
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:55,416
its body will grow larger
and more corporeal.

93
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,541
[GOTTI laughs]

94
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,416
[GOTTI]
You know, I gotta say

95
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,166
this hellhound is turnin'
out to be the berries!

96
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,166
Really? You're glad a monster
is trying to kill you?

97
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,666
Well you see,

98
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,500
thanks to the Jayrock and
Bogard gangs being bumped off,

99
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,375
this town's gonna be
a lot easier to work in.

100
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,875
[SATELLA] Heh.

101
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:22,583
But still, you ought to be
worried about your own safety.

102
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:26,333
Don't forget... if that
hellhound does become corporeal,

103
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,750
my presence may not
save you, Don Gotti.

104
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,958
It will require more
than some token offerings

105
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,875
if you want to
sleep peacefully,

106
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:38,625
and not with the fishes,
so to speak.

107
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,000
But that is why you
are here, jewel witch.

108
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,625
You are my body guard,
Satella Harvenheit!

109
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,083
As for offerings, I'll
make as many as are needed.

110
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,875
Ice in your veins, eh?

111
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,416
But I suppose that's
part of being a Godfather.

112
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,125
Heh. Miss Satella,
there are some times

113
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,125
when a man must make
choices, tough choices,

114
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,583
for the sake
of his family.

115
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,333
For family. How quaint.

116
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,208
[GOTTI] In order to
protect something,

117
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:10,166
certain sacrifices
are inevitable.

118
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,458
Do you capisce?

119
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,250
I can't say I disagree,

120
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,750
not with your way of
thinking anyway.

121
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,666
[GOTTI] I bet you don't.

122
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,375
[GOTTI guffaws]

123
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,375
[ROSETTE] I'm sorry,
but this whole plan

124
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,250
just rubs me the wrong way.

125
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,458
We can't delay our attack

126
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,791
until the black dog
completely materializes!

127
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,625
It's as if you're
telling us to sit back

128
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,708
and watch people get
killed until then!

129
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,833
Tell me, exactly
what alternatives

130
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,666
do we have in this situation,
Sister Rosette?

131
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,625
How do you propose
to fight a creature

132
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,125
that can run eighty miles an
hour and has no physical body.

133
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,666
Well, I didn't say I had an
answer to the problem just yet!

134
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,625
But, I just can't
stand back and watch!

135
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,708
Even when they're
all gangsters,

136
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,791
I just can't stand by
silently and watch

137
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,958
as they're all
slaughtered like this.

138
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,875
I'm sorry, I just
can't do that!

139
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:21,416
As it stands, this is
our only viable option.

140
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
The matter has been
decided in council

141
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,625
by the leaders of
the Magdalene Order.

142
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,541
[ROSETTE] Well that's
just not good enough!

143
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,791
Excuse me, please.

144
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,750
Uh, wait a minute,
Sister Rosette!

145
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,875
This discussion
hasn't been completed!

146
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,041
[door closes]

147
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,041
[KATE] Uh.

148
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,208
[sighs]

149
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,666
That girl is seriously...

150
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,958
Oh, she's certainly learned
to speak up, hasn't she?

151
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,416
I'm sure that
sense of justice...

152
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,833
comes from her belief in
the values we represent.

153
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,083
[ROSETTE]
Wow, now that is darb!

154
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,583
[ELDER] It's a super
high-speed transport!

155
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,541
I call it the Elder's
"Gabriel Hound."

156
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,833
[ROSETTE]
Woo! Ha, ha, ha!

157
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,500
We've been waiting on
you to fix our car,

158
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,291
and when I realized we
hadn't seen you in a while,

159
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,916
I figured we ought to
come over and take a peep.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,875
But who would have
expected something like this?

161

this sweetheart's engine pump?

from Harley as a base,

[ELDER]
That's right!

192
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,333
The black beast turned
the whole Gotti family

into veal scaloppini

did it split?!

Well, it should
have been solid,

everything they're
getting now and more.

Can you deny this is
their just reward?

And so what?

Even if these are people
who have committed crimes,

no one deserves to die.

these vermin know
nothing of your God.

To put their quarrels aside

262
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,875
and love their enemy is
beyond their measure.

263

it doesn't matter who

you're willing to risk your

But I expect that
from you Sisters.

00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,166
One should think
about oneself

before one thinks
about others, I say.

00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,541
Hey! Haven't you
forgotten somebody?

323
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:47,083
Hello? I'm talking about me!

324
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,125
You have forgotten me,
haven't you?

325
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,541
[MARY] Christmas!
Christmas! Christmas!

326
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,541
It only comes once a year!

327
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:23,750
Isn't it great?

328
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,583
[ANNA] Azmaria's the lead
in this year's Nativity play.

329
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,000
It's so exciting!

330
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,500
[CLAIRE] But it looks like
Rosette and the others

331
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,166
are planning something.

332
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,250
[ANNA] Could it be that
the tree will blow up?

333
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,500
[MARY] Maybe a devil will pop
out of one of our presents!

334
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,708
[CLAIRE] Let's pray
that we'll be able

335
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,125
to usher in Christmas
safely this year.

336
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,875
[ANNA and MARY]
Heaven help us!

337
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,208
[ANNA] Next episode,
"Holy Night."

338
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,833
[MARY] Come what may,
it's Christmas!
