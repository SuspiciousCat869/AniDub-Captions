00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:34,000
A town, at sunset, is one of
my favorite things to see.

163
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,416
The lights of life...

164
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,958
each and every one of them
represents an individual,

165
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,958
or a family...

166
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,958
Proof that life exists...

167
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:51,125
and yet not all proofs
are created equal.

168
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:55,833
Stigmata.

169
00:12:55,916 --> 00:13:00,708
Yes. They are the mark
of those chosen by God.

170
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,708
From the moment they
were carved into my body,

171
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,041
I have known the
future and the past.

172
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,583
My mind is full of memories,

173
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:15,291
events from throughout
time overlap one another.

174
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:19,333
I remember nothing
of my childhood.

175
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,375
Not even my own parents.

176
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:29,416
Dreams of happy weddings and the
nightmares of horrible deaths...

177
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,958
I carry them all as sensations

178
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,416
that are no different
from reality.

179
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,833
All events that will
occur on this planet

180
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,750
were engraved upon my memory.

181
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,000
So very many of
them I'm afraid,

182
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,000
that my true self was
somehow lost along the way.

183
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,166
An empty vessel that can
be filled with anything,

184
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,208
yet contains nothing...

185
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,375
...that is what I am.

186
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,750
Although, there is one thing...

187
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,875
a dream I've had countless
times since I was small...

188
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,875
a dream that is
for me alone.

189
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,000
Inside my cloistered, indistinct
self is one certain thing.

190
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:17,000
It's my past and future
and belongs only to me.

191
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:19,083
It's a dream of you.

192
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,583
Of me?

193
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,666
[MAGDALENE] Yes.

194
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,041
You are Chrono, the one
who'll take away my life.

195
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:27,958
[CHRONO gasps]

196
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,041
[CHRONO]
Take away your life?

197
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,625
Me?

198
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,458
Yes.

199
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,041
[CHRONO] You came
here knowing that?

200
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,000
But why would you...?

201
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:42,000
Because I'm empty
and you will fill me.

202
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:46,041
How can you be so
calm about this?

203
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,041
Because I'm here
with you, Chrono.

204
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,791
Truly, you're a most
unusual woman.

205
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,250
Chrono, I can see
you're wavering

206
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:02,833
between your role in
this and who you are.

207
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,458
But your dream is doomed
to fail in the end.

208
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,333
Because you will try to
avoid hurting anyone.

209
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,875
Be cautious of
the one called Aion,

210
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:16,750
for even though you
regard him as a friend,

211
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,833
he does not return
that feeling.

212
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,125
[CHRONO gasps]

213
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:26,916
[SHADER chuckles]

214
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,833
It's ready!

215
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,291
But where's the head
of Pandemonium?

216
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,000
[AION]
We're not doing it today.

217
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,916
[RIZEL]
We're not? But why?

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,875
[SHADER] But according to
the stars, this is the time!

219
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,875
We have the Holy Woman
who bears stigmata

220
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,500
and the head
of Pandemonium!

221
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,083
We were going to
begin a revolution

222
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,875
to make complete
that which is not.

223
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,125
We can't let
this chance go!

224
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:57,666
The holy Magdalene is
nothing more than a decoy.

225
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,833
A decoy?

226
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,208
[AION] It seems Magdalene
was sent by God

227
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,708
to make our plans fail.

228
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:08,000
However, she told Chrono
about the future,

229
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,916
and thanks to that, our
choices have just increased.

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,541
Chrono, kill the Holy Woman.

231
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,666
[CHRONO gasps]

232
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,291
[AION] Kill her and
fulfill your role.

233
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,083
[CHRONO] You knew
this would happen...

234
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:31,166
Why did you come?
Why didn't you fight?

235
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,583
None of us have the power
to change our destinies.

236
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,750
Yet, I could not
resist the chance

237
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:42,291
to know the one who
would take my life.

238
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:47,916
Chrono, I could not resist
because I fell in love with you.

239
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,250
[CHRONO snivels]

240
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,916
[AION] Ahhh!

241
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,750
[CHRONO groans]

242
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,833
[CHRONO yells]

243
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,708
[CHRONO weakly] It's you.

244
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,125
Please, you mustn't give up.

245
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,500
[CHRONO]
Your vision of the future

246
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,291
was a little bit off
this time. Sorry.

247
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:34,666
[MAGDALENE]
No, I won't let you die!

248
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,708
These wounds are serious,
and I no longer have my horns.

249
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,375
So I don't have the
power to heal them.

250
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,791
You won't need your horns.

251
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,000
Use this.

252
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,458
[CHRONO] Huh?

253
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,375
It's a contract.

254
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,125
It exchanges my life for yours.

255
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,458
[CHRONO] You can't.

256
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,375
You must live.

257
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,083
Now I know the reason
for your tears,

258
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,833
and why it is that
you will be the one

259
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,041
who takes my life from me.

260
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:12,208
Now it is clear
with this contract

261
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,291
the two of us, you and I,
will soon become one.

262
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,375
My blood mingled
with yours...

263
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,875
forever bound by
the threads of time.

264
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:34,125
[CHRONO sobs]

265
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,583
[CHRONO] It's you.

266
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:51,250
[MAGDALENE] You're in love with
Rosette Christopher, aren't you?

267
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,208
Yes.

268
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,958
[MAGDALENE] You are
the one who is fighting

269
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:58,208
with destiny, Chrono.

270
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,208
In order to save her,

271
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,583
one day you will be forced
to kill the friends

272
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,208
with whom you once
shared a dream.

273
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:11,083
Is that the unavoidable
harm you spoke of?

274
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,875
[MAGDALENE] Are you
prepared to do this?

275
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:17,791
[CHRONO] I want to
protect Rosette.

276
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,791
So much that it covers
your part of my heart.

277
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:26,250
[MAGDALENE] Chrono,
you must live. It's time.

278
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,833
Chrono...

279
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:39,166
Ahh! Ahhhh! Ahhh!

280
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,625
Hmm. So, he's moving.

281
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,583
Come along now, my dear,
your sin awaits you.

282
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,083
[AION] Hm?

283
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,458
[ELDER] Hm? Chrono!
You're not...

284
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,291
Who are... you?

285
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:03,208
[CHRONO gasps]

286
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,875
[REMINGTON]
He doesn't remember.

287
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,625
All his powers... and his
memory have disappeared.

288
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,541
Even the ones of Rosette?

289
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,666
[REMINGTON] Mm.

290
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,125
[KATE]
Remington, wait.

291
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,375
I know it's not proper
to question these things,

292
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,708
but don't you think that
the cross that they must bear

293
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,083
is too large?

294
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,625
[REMINGTON]
Your faith is wavering.

295
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,958
Is that what you wish to say?

296
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:36,041
I doubt that I could bear
this if I did not believe.

297
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:43,375
Release her now.
There is no escape!

298
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:46,125
[AION chuckles]

299
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,125
You did insist.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,083
[screaming]

301
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,208
[DUFFAU]
Gurio! Damn you, Aion.

302
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,083
I'll make you pay.

303
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,083
[laughter]

304
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,333
You bastard!

305
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:09,375
What did you do
to the Holy Woman?

306
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,166
[DUFFAU screams]

307
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,541
[SATELLA] Well, a devil
offering a prayer...

308
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,166
I'm going to go
with you, Chrono.

309
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,541
I intend to get revenge
for my older sister.

310
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,375
All those years...

311
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,500
it took ten years
to finally find her,

312
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,500
but what I found was...

313
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,208
[GURIO groans]

314
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,333
Chrono...

315
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,041
Gurio, what happened?

316
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,791
Duffau's dead. I saw it.

317
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,416
He was killed by that
partner of yours.

318
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,583
[CHRONO gasps]

319
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,416
[GURIO] Beware of the
Holy Woman's blood!

320
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,208
Ahhh!

321
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,833
[REMINGTON] A bond
has been severed.

322
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,208
Does she brandish her weapon

323
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,583
because she was
gripped by darkness,

324
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,583
or does she harbor
a fervent desire?

325
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:32,458
Searching for answers to
her ten years of wandering,

326
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,666
Satella confronts her sister.

327
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,916
When that voice turns
toward the sky and screams,

328
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,750
her journey will end.

329
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,500
Next episode, "Goodbye."

330
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:46,083
Lord, please bless
these injured souls.
