00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:19,041
[computer beeps]

2
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,458
[SHADER chuckles]

3
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,750
And with that,
the only thing left to do

4
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,250
is to put in the final key!

5
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,625
Yay! Praise me, praise me!

6
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,541
Come on...

7
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,583
[GENAI] Whatever. We're leaving.

8
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,166
Oh, what are you going to do?

9
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,041
Are you going to get the final
Apostle and bring her back here?

10
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,250
[GENAI] Those Magdalene bastards
have been a pain too long.

11
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,833
[VIEDE] Not to mention the
devils that are helping them.

12
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,208
You two can
just stay here

13
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,833
and play with your toys
as much as you like.

14
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:03,208
[VIEDE] On the other
hand... we're going.

15
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,541
Oh well, I just hope they
don't go too berserk this time.

16
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,208
[AION] The time
has come at last...

17
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,583
that fateful moment

18
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,291
when all those who
would be your servants...

19
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,666
the prophets and the Apostles,
the meek and the great,

20
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,250
all who fear your name
will be rewarded,

21
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,666
and those who would
destroy the earth, be destroyed.

22
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,916
Heh.

23
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,708
Did you know your
sister's still alive?

24
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,916
[gasps]

25
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:21,458
[clock ticks]

26
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,333
[STEINER] I believe
it's almost ready.

27
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,333
[ROSETTE] Okay.

28
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:37,916
[stirring sound]

29
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,958
[STEINER] You know,
it's quite miraculous

30
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,500
that this alone survived.

31
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,166
[ROSETTE] Huh?

32
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,416
[ROSETTE]
You mean the teacup?

33
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,458
Indeed.

34
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,333
That the whole mansion
was destroyed,

35
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,166
yet such a fragile
thing was spared...

36
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,666
[STEINER] I fear...
that I am powerless,

37
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,208
and I lack even
your kind of strength.

38
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,583
But Steiner, you've
always stood by her side.

39
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,500
[ROSETTE] Sometimes,
just being there

40
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:23,583
is the best way you
can help someone.

41
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,458
That's why... I'm sure
Satella has always

42
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,291
thought of you as
her greatest asset.

43
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:32,333
Heh. Did that sound
a little too preachy?

44
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,458
[STEINER sighs]

45
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,208
Heh, heh!

46
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
[REMINGTON]
The situation is changing.

47
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,791
It appears that the
San Francisco branch

48
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:51,791
has begun to take serious action
using their own discretion.

49
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,708
[KATE] I wonder...
Do you think the fact that

50
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,750
the Sinner Aion destroyed
the jewel witch's family

51
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,333
might have had some kind
of influence on this case?

52
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,333
It does seem that we're
always one step behind,

53
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,000
never catching up.

54
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,750
And this time, we cannot allow
them to do whatever they wish.

55
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,708
That is the only
reason we have broken

56
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,958
our own rules and allied
ourselves with devils.

57
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,541
It would appear that all of
the causality is gathering

58
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,583
in San Francisco.

59
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,208
The west coast Astral Line

60
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,250
has started to show
the effects of that.

61
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,375
I've heard the same
thing from the Elder.

62
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,416
We're considering
dispatching scout planes.

63
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,250
Hmm, you mean without seeking
the permission of the council?

64
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,708
I rather doubt the
up-highs will approve.

65
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,416
I'll just pretend that
I can't hear them.

66
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,125
[KATE laughs]

67
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,333
[REMINGTON chuckles]

68
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,583
Sometimes I wonder if the Lord

69
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,291
is ever going to smile
upon their future.

70
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,083
[knocking]

71
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,500
[door opens]

72
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,250
[ROSETTE]
So, how are you feeling?

73
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,666
[door closes]

74
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,250
[ROSETTE sighs]

75
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,125
[ROSETTE] We could use some
fresh air. I'll get the doors!

76
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,125
[birds chirp]

77
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,625
Ahh. It's a beautiful day.

78
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,791
Why don't you come outside
for a change of scenery?

79
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,708
You're always so
cheerful, aren't you?

80
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,250
[CHRONO] Um... Satella?

81
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,500
[AZMARIA] It's not...

82
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,666
Heh. The brilliance
won't come back.

83
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,541
It's just like me.

84
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,958
[CHRONO sighs]

85
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,166
[ROSETTE winces]

86
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,916
Rosette!

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,625
Rosette, is something
the matter?

88
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,041
Look, it's nothing
to make a fuss over.

89
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,250
Huh?

90
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,750
Everything's jake.

91
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,458
I was just being a dumb dora
and I hit my head a minute ago,

92
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:17,958
but I'll be
just fine, really.

93
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,583
[AZMARIA] But you can't
tell us not to worry!

94
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,416
Please, let me look at it!

95
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,125
[ROSETTE] I'm telling you...

96
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,375
Rosette!

97
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,791
[gasps]

98
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,416
[gasps]

99
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,458
But why?

100
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,125
[AZMARIA] I'll go get some
bandages and antiseptic.

101
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,250
I've finished
with the bandages,

102
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,333
but it doesn't seem to be
making the bleeding stop.

103
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:17,958
It'll be all right.
It's really not a big deal.

104
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,000
You've seen this,
haven't you?

105
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,375
Tell us... what they are.

106
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:31,250
[CHRONO]
They're stigmata.

107
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,333
Stigmata?

108
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,250
They appear in the same places

109
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,750
where Jesus Christ was wounded
when he was crucified.

110
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,333
They're marks of God.

111
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,833
[ROSETTE sighs]

112
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:43,541
[CHRONO] They're proof that
she's been chosen by Him...

113
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,791
as God's own.

114
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,166
[knocking]

115
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,208
Lady Rosette, there is
an urgent call for you

116
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,083
from the Magdalene Order.

117
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:03,791
[murmuring]

118
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,708
[DUFFAU] A devil's misconduct
must be dealt with...

119
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,750
by one of his own kind.

120
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,583
[GILLIAM] Duffau and the
others will be in charge

121
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,208
of storming the hideout.

122
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,583
Rosette and Chrono
will join them there.

123
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,500
We will provide backup.

124
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,583
At that time, we'll
use crucifix barriers

125
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,333
to seal off the Sinners.

126
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,250
Whatever happens,

127
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,708
we cannot let them
escape to the city.

128
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:28,833
One hundred and twenty

129
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,041
Principatus crucifix
barriers are set.

130
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,708
Forty Powers have
now been set up.

131
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:38,166
Setup for three Sacred machine
guns has almost been completed.

132
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,250
They've located the
Sinners' hideout

133
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,708
on a beach on the outskirts
of San Francisco!

134
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,875
We're attacking at noon!

135
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,875
Azmaria, take care of Satella!

136
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:50,666
Huh?

137
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,625
[SATELLA] What?

138
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,375
Exactly what do
you mean by that?

139
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,833
I'm going to fight
alongside you!

140
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,958
It would be impossible for you
to fight a devil right now.

141
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,833
I would think that you would
know that better than anyone.

142
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,416
[SATELLA sighs]

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,791
Just stay here, okay?

144
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,916
We'll cover your part of
the fighting, so don't worry.

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,958
We'll-- [winces]

146
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,791
I'm all right, I'm all right!

147
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,291
I've been feeling a whole lot
better since Azmaria treated me!

148
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:22,375
Besides, I've got this
little present from the Elder,

149
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,333
so it's all jake.

150
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:27,416
Now then, we're gonna be late
if we don't get a wiggle on.

151
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,166
Time stops for
no one, you know?

152
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,291
Azmaria, take good
care of Satella.

153
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,333
That's a really
important job, too.

154
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,875
[gasps] Right!

155

00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,250
Right!

00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,666
Please be careful.

00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,625
[GURIO] They got away!

163
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:32,500
[explosion]

164
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:33,791
Huh?!

165
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,416
[GENAI] We knew you'd come!

166
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,833
Now it's time to die!

167
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,666
Aaaahhh!

168
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,666
[yelling]

169
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,583
[roaring]

170
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,666
[screaming]

171
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,708
Ahhh!

172
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:24,250
Huh?

173
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,583
[ROSETTE] Heads up!

174
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,750
[CLAIRE] Rosette!

175
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:27,708
Are you all right?

176
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:28,708
Yes.

177
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,458
[GURIO] Let us
take care of this!

178
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,375
Back up, huh?

179
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,541
Ahhh!

180
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,000
Duffau!

181
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,333
[DUFFAU] Sinner Viede,
Sinner Genai...

182
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,625
In the name of Pandemonium,

183
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,375
I sentence both of
you to be punished.

184
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,750
[GENAI] Traitor!

185
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,416
Listen to what I'm
saying to you, boy!

186
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,125
[GENAI yells]

187
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,250
[GENAI screams]

188
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,291
[GILLIAM] Dammit. At this rate,
all we are is a liability.

189
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,750
Why are you saying that?
This battle isn't over yet!

190
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,666
[GILLIAM sighs]

191
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,166
You're right.

192
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,166
Evacuate the wounded.

193
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,458
Anyone who can keep fighting,
back up Duffau and the others.

194
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,041
[MILITIA] Yes, sir!

195
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,291
[ROSETTE sighs]

196
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,666
[CHRONO] No, Rosette.

197
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,916
[ROSETTE gasps]

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,833
You can't.

199
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,916
And why not?

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,250
Because I'm not going to
take any more of your life

201
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,416
away from you!

202
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,833
Chrono.

203
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,041
[VIEDE] Traitor!

204
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,083
Ah!

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,166
Take up my sword, Chrono!

206
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,958
[GENAI] Don't look away!

207
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,583
Chrono, you'd better
throw away that silly toy

208
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,958
and fight us in
your original form.

209
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,041
He killed one hundred million.

210
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:28,041
We cannot allow that
kind of power to be set free!

211
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,000
[GENAI] You coward!

212
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,916
[VIEDE] You bastard!

213
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,208
[GENAI yells]

214
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,916
[GENAI] This is
getting annoying!

215
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,916
[MILITIA] Ahh!

216
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,875
[CARV yells]

217
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,583
[CARV] Don't make me
do this too many times.

218
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,041
Even a slowpoke's got limits!

219
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:22,375
Uh, Mr. Carv.
Thank you, sir!

220
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,208
[CARV laughs]

221
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,083
[GURIO] There are
a lot of wounded.

222
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,666
You should fall back at once.

223
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,500
So it would seem.

224
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,041
All available militia units,

225
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,125
protect the wounded and fall
back to the rear position.

226
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,166
[MILITIA] Yes, sir!

227
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,083
Promise that you'll
be careful, Rosette!

228
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,541
I'll be all right.
Leave the rest to me.

229
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,416
Promise that you and
Chrono will come back.

230
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,833
A promise you're going
to keep, all right?

231
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,625
[ROSETTE]
Mm.

232
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,666
Ha! And this is the killer
of one hundred million?

233
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,166
[ROSETTE] Chrono!

234
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,791
[GENAI yells]

235
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,666
[GENAI] The bullet
that killed Rizel.

236
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,916
Enough!

237
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,041
Using devils in order to get
the better of even worse devils.

238
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,125
I have to wonder if our decision
was truly the correct one.

239
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,750
[ANNA] Reverend Gilliam!

240
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,875
The setup for the Dominions
wide-area barrier is complete.

241
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,583
All right.
Activate the barrier!

242
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,416
Duffau, how long do you
think you can hold out?

243
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
[DUFFAU] Silence, fool!

244
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,666
[GENAI] This is the end!

245
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,916
[GENAI screams]

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,541
[VIEDE] Genai!

247
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,333
Damn it!
You've really done it now!

248
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,375
[CHRONO] Ahhh!

249
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,958
Chrono!

250
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,000
[GENAI] Duffau!

251
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:29,250
A-Aaaahhh!

252
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,125
[DUFFAU] So, it's begun.

253
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,791
[yelling]

254
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,083
Rosette, now!

255
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,416
Ahhhh!

256
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,291
[VIEDE] Die!

257
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,750
[CARV yells]

258
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,541
[CARV] Blimey, there ain't no
end to takin' care of humans.

259
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,375
Right, Chrono?

260
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,125
Aaaahhh!

261
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,458
Aaaahhh!

262
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,416
[CARV] I'm takin' you with me!

263
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:22,083
[CHRONO] Carv!

264
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,541
[GENAI] Viede!

265
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,916
No mercy.

266
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,083
No mercy! You bastards!

267
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,166
[GENAI] Damn it! Damn it!

268
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:59,250
Viede died right
before my eyes!

269
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,250
Son of a bitch!

270
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,833
[footsteps]

271
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,458
Whoa, it sounds like you were
pretty soundly beaten back, huh?

272
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,166
That's why it would have been
best if you hadn't gone at all.

273
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,916
Oh well, your
auto-regeneration

274
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,583
will be able to handle
injuries like that in no time.

275
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:13,791
[GENAI] Shut up.

276
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,083
[AION] What about Chrono?

277
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,791
[GENAI]
That fool was pathetic.

278
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:22,291
Maybe it's because that stupid
girl was hurt or something,

279
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:26,250
but he refused to change
back into his original form.

280
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,208
[AION] Hurt?

281
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,375
How interesting.

282
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:37,791
That means He's finally
decided to advance his pawns.

283
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,375
I have good news, Joshua.

284
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,291
[FIORE] Lord Aion...

285
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,750
What is it?

286
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,166
Big Sister?

287
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,250
Where are you, Big Sister?

288
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,875
[FIORE] Lord Joshua,
I'm right here.

289
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,791
[JOSHUA] My big sister,
where is she?

290
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,000
Joshua, your beloved big sister

291
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:19,375
will be coming to
visit you very soon.

292
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,166
She's coming here?

293
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,833
[AION] That's right.
Isn't that nice?

294
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,833
Sister...

295
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah... I've been so
looking forward to it.

296
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,250
Come, let's light
the candles

297
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,916
and raise a toast to
her imminent arrival.

298
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,916
We'll give her a warm
welcome indeed.

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,208
Tomorrow is the carnival.
Won't it be such fun?

300
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,625
[AZMARIA] Hey! Hey!
Hey, everyone!

301
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,041
Are you doing okay?

302
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,958
[ROSETTE] Huh? What's with you?

303
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,333
[AZMARIA] There are
a lot of painful things,

304
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,291
but let's cheer up
and do our best!

305
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,833
So hold your head
up high and smile!

306
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,375
When it's time to
have fun, have fun!

307
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,333
[ROSETTE] Hold on, Azmaria!
You sound a little screwy.

308
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:36,250
[CHRONO] It looks like
the heavy mood around here

309
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,916
has become too much
for her to bear.

310
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,458
[AZMARIA]
Tomorrow is a fun festival!

311
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,458
[ROSETTE]
That poor girl...

312
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,791
[AZMARIA]
Next episode, "Four People!"

313
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,375
Let's dance the night away!
