[GILLIAM] Nothing as of yet.

reminds me of something.

319
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,375
I remember seeing a view
like this a long time ago.

320
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,416
That's what's so
unfair about you.

321
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,791
What do you mean?

322
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,291
You've lived all these years

323
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,708
with no sign of a
wrinkle or a gray hair.

324
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:14,291
You've always looked the same,
and you always will, too.

325
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,208
And I'm sure that
even after I die...

326
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,791
No, Rosette...

327
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:23,833
When you die, I'll cease
to exist in this world.

328
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,833
Because I have no intention
of living longer than you.

329
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,083
But why would you...?
I mean, I...

330
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,541
[CHRONO]
I want to change things.

331
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:39,666
I want to believe that
anything can be changed.

332
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,250
[ROSETTE] Chrono.

333
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,541
[CHRONO] The moment I met you,
a new world opened up for me.

334
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,500
You see, after wandering in
the darkness for so long,

335
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,250
a light brought me happiness.

336
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,916
It's all thanks to you.

337
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's not true.
I feel the same way.

338
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:04,125
But, I've taken so much away.

339
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,291
It's because my time is limited
that I don't have any doubts.

340
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,208
It's all thanks... to this.

341
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,750
That's why I can
walk straight ahead.

342
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,083
It's why I can
always keep going,

343
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,958
because I have you with me.

344
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:29,416
[CHRONO] I won't let you die,
no matter what.

345
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,125
No matter what it
takes, I won't.

[SHADER] All right!
Our time has finally come!

356
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,416
We've waited so long,
right Genai?

357
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
[GENAI]
Ugh. Calm down will you?

358
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,916
[SHADER]
You're such a killjoy.

It's a festival, so smile!
Dance! Meow! Like this!

[GENAI] Ugh, this is stupid.
I'm out of here.

361
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,625
[SHADER] Oh, Genai,
you're such a disappointment.

362
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,791
Oh well, I'm gonna go berserk!
