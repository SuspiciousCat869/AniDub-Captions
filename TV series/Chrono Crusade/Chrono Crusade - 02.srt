1
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,541
[REMINGTON]
The roaring twenties.

2
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,458
An age of gold...

3
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,375
A time when great evils
still walked the night,

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,000
hidden in the shroud
of darkness.

5
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,750
A time when a new
continent reveled

6
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,083
in the spring after
the last war,

7
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,333
ready to achieve an
age of unprecedented

8
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,250
economic development.

9
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,333
But that which moves men
moves other things as well.

10
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,333
And when change
comes too quickly,

11
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,125
the inhuman things that
writhe beneath the earth

12
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,041
may be drawn to the surface
from the abysmal depths.

13
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,125
[JOSHUA] Ah...

14
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,416
[JOSHUA gasps]

15
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,333
Who are you?

16
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,250
First tell us who
and what you are.

17
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,500
My name is Chrono.

18
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:25,250
And what I am is what
your people call a devil.

19
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,041
What do you mean
by a "devil"?

20
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,541
Just what I said.

21
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,291
One of the beings
that you humans fear.

22
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,625
[CHRONO yelps]

23
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,958
[ROSETTE] Sir,
are you all right?

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,458
You're looking awful weak.

25
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:46,125
You should eat something.

26
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,375
Here! Help yourself!

27
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,666
[CHRONO] Huh?

28
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,458
Um, thank you?

29
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,041
My name is Rosette,

30
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,333
and my brother is Joshua.

31
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,458
This is great!

32
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,416
Could... Could I shake
your hand? Please?

33
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,625
[CHRONO] Uh...

34
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,500
You're really... a devil?

35
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,708
Wow! A devil!

36
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,791
This is so swell.

37
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,583
Aion!

38
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:30,166
Joshua, no! Stay away!

39
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,666
[ROSETTE] Ah!

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,875
Joshua...

41
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,458
--Hey, Rosette.
--Huh?

42
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,250
Just how do you
feel about Chrono?

43
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,250
[ROSETTE] Huh?

44
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,250
Well, you are
always together.

45
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,333
And get this, Claire was
saying that she wants to

46
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,333
work with Chrono, too.

47
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, Anna, Anna.

48
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,416
All I said was that I thought he
was very nice, and that's all.

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,958
So, how do you
really feel?

50
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:27,916
How do...? It's not
an easy thing to...

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,416
Oh! You don't mean
you think that...

52
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,458
[KATE] Shh! Ahem!

53
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,791
I've been bad.

54
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:43,083
Chrono! Good morning!

55
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,583
[CHRONO yawns]

56
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,958
There you are, Rosette,
good morning.

57
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,125
Where's the Elder?

58
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,250
Where he always is...
in his workshop.

59
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,541
And I'm afraid the old coot's

60
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,250
been pulling another
all-nighter.

61
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,208
Oh, Sister Rosette.

62
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,541
All night and this
is all you made?

63
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,958
[ELDER] Yes, indeed!

64
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,125
I call it a "Spirit."

65
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,833
A Spirit, huh?

66
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,458
I'd appreciate it if
you could deliver it

67
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,541
to Sister Kate for me.

68
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,125
Sure thing!

69
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,416
Make sure it gets there!

70
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,208
Hey, what are you saying?
I've got sticky fingers?

71
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,916
You're one to talk,
Mister "Filched the Gospel

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,416
and made me promise
not to tell."

73
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,416
Goink.

74
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
[ELDER] Hm...

75
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,250
Well, to be honest,

76
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,541
I'd be much more at ease
if Chrono delivered it,

77
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,583
but given how much the
good Sister dislikes him...

78
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,458
It can't be helped,
sir. I mean I am a...

79
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,625
Oh bushwa and
horsefeathers!

80
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,375
What kind of devil
could be so charming

81
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,375
morning, noon, and night?

82
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,291
Not to mention one that
will do the cooking,

83
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,541
cleaning, and sometimes
even the windows?

84
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,583
But the fact is,
I frighten people.

85
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,583
Except for Rosette, that is.

86
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,666
So, what do you have
stuffed in here?

87
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,541
Oh, a teensy weensy devil.

88
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,000
--[ELDER laughs]
--[CHRONO] Huh?

89
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,500
[ROSETTE] Huh?

90
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:16,416
You see, at the moment of
impact, the devil is released,

91
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,541
producing an enormous
bolt of mystical energy

92
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,416
that strikes your enemy!

93
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,291
And what about the devil?

94
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,583
It's transformed into
a spiritual energy,

95
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,583
hence the name.

96
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,416
When that energy is
released, it goes "boom!"

97
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,625
and is annihilated.

98
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:35,291
I think... it would be
best not to use those.

99
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,541
Because there's
a devil inside?

100
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,375
[CHRONO] Mm.

101
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,750
Well, sympathy for the devil
aside, I'm sure the Elder

102
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,500
wouldn't make it if it was
dangerous. Right, sir?

103
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:45,541
[ELDER laughs]

104
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,375
Maybe I should
fire a test round.

105
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,375
[CHRONO] Rosette, a new case!
We've got marching orders!

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,958
[ROSETTE chuckles]

107
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,291
What a monster!

108
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,083
In the nick of time!

109
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,583
The Order of Magdalene,
we deliver!

110
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,916
Ah!

111
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,083
Give a girl some room, please.

112
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,750
Not you two again!

113
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,875
Rosette, if you
aim for the horn,

114
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,791
one of the Sacreds ought to be
strong enough to break it off!

115
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,416
Ah! I think all that
did was make it angrier!

116
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,458
Try to hit the
same spot again!

117
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,083
Well, this ought to finish it.

118
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,208
Ah! Rosette, that's
not a good idea!

119
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,541
Oh, don't worry.
Everything's jake.

120
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,375
It's the same plan
as before, remember?

121
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,458
Ah!

122
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,500
Ah!

123
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,333
Huh? How could losing
its horn do that?

124
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,666
[CHRONO gasps]

125
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,666
[CHRONO] What is this?
What am I sensing?

126
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,750
[footsteps]

127
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,458
[DETECTIVE] Well,
as I said last time,

128
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,208
the two of you are really
something unique,

129
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,333
but at least this time
there's less damage.

130
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,666
[ROSETTE] Oh, it's not here!

131
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,958
[CHRONO] Then that can
only mean one thing!

132
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,708
What?

133
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,500
That it's not here.

134
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,833
Maybe we should try
searching a wider area.

135
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,458
That gun was loaded
with a Spirit, wasn't it?

136
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,083
[ROSETTE] Mm.

137
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,333
But why?

138
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:45,166
I just... thought that since
the one in the ship worked,

139
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,458
it wouldn't hurt to
have one just in case.

140
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:07,416
[growl]

141
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,625
So that's all, then?

142
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,375
It sounds exactly
like your last case.

143
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,708
[ROSETTE]
Well, we think this host

144
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,125
was a devil worshipper, too.

145
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:41,083
[KATE] I see.
A devil worshipper...

146
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,666
I'll prepare a report,
a very detailed one, ma'am.

147
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,208
And what became of
the devil's horn?

148
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,625
We submitted it
to the Elder, sir.

149
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,750
A very appropriate decision.

150
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,791
Oh, this is most
oddly disappointing.

151
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,208
Ma'am?

152
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,708
I believe this
was the first time

153
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,291
while hearing one of
your debriefings,

154
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,791
that I haven't shouted at you.

155
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:08,500
It's very nice, Sister,
very nice indeed.

156
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,416
Thank you very much, ma'am.

157
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Yes, excellent work, Rosette.

158
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,250
I hope that you'll try
to make a habit of this.

159
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,500
[ROSETTE] Uh, yes, ma'am.
May I be excused?

160
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:30,750
Oh, why, why did
I lie to her?

161
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,750
Please, Lord, forgive me.

162
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:40,833
Huh?

163
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,833
It's Rosette.

164
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,250
[ELDER] Huh?

165
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,458
Hey, Rosette! The Elder
thinks he can make a detector

166
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,958
that will locate the Spirit
by its mystical aura.

167
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,875
I'm sorry, Elder.

168
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,333
Don't be so grummy,
it's not like you.

169
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,916
[ELDER] Oh, Remington!

170
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,750
So now I understand
what really happened.

171
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,791
[ROSETTE] I'm a bad girl.

172
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,333
Yes, from the way you were
acting around Sister Kate,

173
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,208
I thought something was wrong.

174
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,708
I can't lie to you,
Father Remington, can I?

175
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,125
No, but fortunately for
you, I can keep a secret.

176
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,291
So, how might I be of aid?

177
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,500
[POSSESSED] Who is there?

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,375
[POSSESSED] Hmm. Is it this?

179
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,041
The voice of the
hornless one...

180
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,166
I can hear it inside.

181
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,708
Children! It's done!

182
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:24,666
Mm-hmm. Ain't it
the gnat's whistle?

183
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,125
Do you really think
that thing's gonna work?

184
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,541
Perhaps there might
be a more reliable--

185
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,958
[ELDER] Such impertinence!

186
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,875
I gave it my seal of approval!

187
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,333
Switch, on!

188
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,750
Oh!

189
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,291
Elder?

190
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:46,583
Uh, it would seem that it's
much closer than we thought.

191
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:47,916
You don't think...

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,250
[ROSETTE] Mm.

193
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,916
[alarm bell rings]

194
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,791
[MILITIA MAN] Halt!

195
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,166
A man?

196
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,125
Proceed no further!
Identify yourself!

197
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,791
Where have you been?

198
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,250
[ROSETTE] We're sorry, sir.

199
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:34,000
An unnaturally thick aura of
evil surrounds that man, Sister.

200
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,250
Have your men
flank the intruder.

201
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,333
Lock and load with
Sacred rounds.

202
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,166
Make sure they know to
use only the Sacred type.

203
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,750
Right!

204
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,916
Class three and higher exorcists
support the militia's fire!

205
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,333
Right!

206
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,750
He's got an exorcist
special .45?

207
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,458
How could that gun be...?

208
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,833
Stop it! No!

209
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:07,125
--[REMINGTON] Ah!
--[CHRONO] Ah!

210
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,416
--[KATE] Ah!
--[ROSETTE] Ah!

211
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,833
Him again!

212
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,083
Yeah, the devil we
fought this afternoon!

213
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,458
Permission granted
to open fire!

214
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,625
No! Somehow, that
demon's absorbing

215
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,000
the power of the Spirit!

216
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,208
[ROSETTE] Huh?

217
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,666
He's used it to replace
the power of his broken horn!

218
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,458
Keep firing!

219
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
[CHRONO] Hey, you big eggplant!

220
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:18,250
Are you looking for
this ___? Come on!

221
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,833
Steady!
Concentrate your fire!

222
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:25,000
No, wait!

223
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:26,166
I'll take care of this, sir.

224
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,125
Rosette, come back here!

225
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,541
[ROSETTE] I've got you now!

226
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,125
Uh?

227
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,000
Uh?!

228
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,041
Rosette!

229
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,083
Ah!

230
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,875
[CHRONO screams]

231
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,583
[CHRONO] What have you done,
lowest of the low?

232
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:05,375
You so beneath my contempt,
you have not even a name!

233
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,708
You dare touch
my contractor?

234
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,625
You dare hurt what's mine?

235
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,541
Chrono...

236
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,666
Something's happening...
he's changing!

237
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,916
[KATE] Prepare to use Gospels!

238
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,458
But if Chrono and
Rosette are too close,

239
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,250
then using something as
powerful as a Gospel could...

240
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,041
[KATE] We cannot let
the seal be broken!

241
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:31,666
Don't forget what Chrono is!

242
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,541
No, Sister! At least wait
until Chrono's pulled back.

243
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:38,000
He no longer
possesses reason.

244
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,625
At this point,
he's a danger to us all.

245
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:51,666
And he's the most powerful
devil we've ever faced.

246
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,291
A devil?

247
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,750
If it... If it comes
to that, I swear I'll...

248
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:16,041
[ROSETTE] Come back, Chrono!
I'm all right! I'm all right!

249
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,041
[KATE] How can she trust
that creature so?

250
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,166
[ELDER] Ah, but Rosette doesn't

251
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,625
think of Chrono
as a devil, Sister.

252
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,708
But, how else
could one see it?

253
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,958
Just look. If you watch them,
I believe you'll understand.

254
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:55,791
I'm afraid all we can
do now is watch over them.

255
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,416
It's beginning.

256
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,583
[FIORE] Lord Joshua.

257
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,375
Ah, Fiore.

258
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,583
Lord Aion left a message
for you just now.

259
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,625
He said that he
would call again later.

260
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,041
You could have
called me, you know.

261
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,416
We seek Aion,
the Sinner!

262
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,166
I, the Viscount Borzo,
shall kill him myself!

263
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,416
I shall smash him with
one righteous blow!

264
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,375
[FIORE] You should go, please.

265
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:44,500
[FIORE] Hmm?

266
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,416
Not this time, my dear.

267
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,000
But, Lord Joshua...

268
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,208
Why don't you go
prepare the coffee?

269
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,583
I'll handle this trifle.

270
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,541
Still thy tongue!

271
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,958
It's not possible.

272
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:11,291
How can such power be?
What are you?

273
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,375
Have you injured
yourself, my Lord?

274
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,083
Ha! Oh, just a little nick.

275
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,875
[ANNA] Psst. Hey, did you hear?

276
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,541
Rosette and Chrono are
going on a trip together!

277
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,166
[MARY] What? I want to go!

278
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,625
[ANNA] I heard they're
going to a casino,

279
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,458
and they get to see
an opera, too!

280
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,583
[MARY] What? I want to do that!

281
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,166
[ANNA] And to top it all off,

282
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,416
they're going to stay at a ritzy
high class hotel... together!

283
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,916
[MARY] It's not fair!
Why only Rosette?

284
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,541
[CLAIRE] Oh, Rosette,
incarnation of destruction,

285
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,625
please, try not to
destroy anything.

286
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,458
[ANNA] Next episode, "Apostle."

287
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,458
[MARY] Oh, applesauce!

288
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:47,333
Another town's going
to vanish, isn't it?
