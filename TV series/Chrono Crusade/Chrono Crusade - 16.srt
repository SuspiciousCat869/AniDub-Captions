163
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,041
[ROSETTE] So all
of those people...

164
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,250
didn't just disappear, did they?

165
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,791
It's more likely they
were sacrifices.

166
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,541
I'm afraid some
devils function

167
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,583
by using the human life
force as their nourishment.

168
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,500
But... why would she
do that to other people?

169
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,791
[DUFFAU] That's human nature.

170
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,750
You're greedy and proud
and self-centered.

171
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:09,708
You calmly sacrifice others
just to satisfy your desires.

172
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,666
Selling out your own
kind comes with ease.

173
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,958
But I thought
you would already

174
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:16,708
have a clear
understanding of that...

175
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:19,041
right, Servant of Fatima?

176
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,375
You haven't
come this far

177
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,666
without using your power
for personal interests...

178
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,916
Of course, that
can't be helped.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,125
The measure of your
power is probably

180
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,125
equal to that of hundreds
of people combined.

181
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,541
No, thousands...
Certainly more than enough

182
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:38,291
to make both humans
and devils covet you.

183
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,791
I think you should
leave the room, Azmaria.

184

[AZMARIA] But, I...

185

work while you're that upset.

protect yourself.

187

you calm down.

00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,125
So basically, you're suggesting
that human misconduct

192
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,125
should be dealt with
by humans, right?

193
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,791
[DUFFAU]
You could say that.

194
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,833
But let me assure you,

to do with it this time.

There's no doubt
that you should

197

consider this to be
the work of the Sinners.

Long ago, in a land
of black forests,

there lived a very
powerful family...

But they were wiped out,
all too easily.

00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,625
They were attacked
by a lone devil,

and there was nothing
they could do.

[SATELLA gasps]

322
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,250
[FIORE]
Please don't cry, Satella.

323
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:54,375
I want you to love the jewels,
even more than I love them.

324
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,208
Oh, that face.
What a delight.

325
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,041
Lord Aion, can't we deal
with this rude woman quickly?

326
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,416
I'll kill you!

327
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,250
[AION] Will you really?

328
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:10,875
How interesting.
With no allies and no jewels?

329
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,000
And just what do
you propose to do,

330
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,541
now that you've been disarmed?

331
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,000
I will kill you.

332
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,791
Did you know your
sister's still alive?

333
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,208
[gasps]

334
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,625
[AION chuckles]

335
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,166
You really are cute,
aren't you?

336
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,958
So honest.

337
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,541
Dearest Lord Aion, I'm
begging you to stop this.

338
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,125
Please stop it now!

339
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:37,958
Please get away from that woman!

340
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,000
You're nothing
but filth!

341
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,083
How dare you
trick Lord Aion.

342
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,250
I'll kill you!

343
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,333
Be quiet!

344
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,958
[ELIZA screams]

345
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,375
Rest in peace, Eliza.

346
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,916
[SATELLA'S MOM] Perhaps
you're just too different

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,375
from your older sister.

348
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:04,000
[AION] Poor little
Satella Harvenheit...

349
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,375
You fought for
such a long time,

350
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:10,208
but your power
can't help you now.

351
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,208
Will you pray to God,

352
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,875
even though you know
he won't answer?

353
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:17,375
No!

354
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,208
[gunfire]

355
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,125
[ROSETTE] That's enough!

356
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,208
Now get away
from Satella!

357
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:29,833
Well, well... if it isn't Mary
of Magdalene and her lapdog.

358
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,291
What a pity the
Apostle isn't here.

359
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:33,416
[ROSETTE] Unfortunately for you

360
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,916
things aren't going to
go the way you think.

361
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,291
What'd you do to her?

362
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,291
We talked about old times...
did a little reminiscing...

363
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,416
about a time when
a whole family

364
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,708
of jewel summoners
was destroyed.

365
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,333
You mean... that you...

366
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,041
You killed...
Satella's family?

367
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,125
And next time,

368
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:54,375
I'd like to talk with you,
Rosette Christopher.

369
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:54,916
Rosette!

370
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,750
Bad dog.

371
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,333
[CHRONO] Ahh!

372
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,208
[ROSETTE] Chrono!

373
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,500
[AION] Hm. Ah yes,
this time you'll shoot.

374
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm going to let you hear
the sound of my Gospel.

375
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,875
Amen!

376
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,541
Sorry, not this time.

377
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,250
It looks like God's voice
doesn't reach devils.

378
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:33,333
However, it was
a brave effort,

379
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:36,166
and we'll be
meeting again soon.

380
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,083
[AION laughs]

381
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,291
[SATELLA] I was... helpless.

382
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,375
All these years... for nothing.

383
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,000
Satella.

384
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,375
[CHRONO] I'm sorry.

385
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,875
[SATELLA sobs]

386
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:09,375
[SATELLA screams]

387
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,166
[ROSETTE winces]

388
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,666
[VIEDE] That collaborator...
I trust you took care of her?

389
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,000
[AION] Yes, and it
was very amusing.

390
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,833
We've got to be
going now. It's time.

391
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,333
Yeah. Let's go
teach those idiots

392
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,041
from Pandemonium
what real power is.

393
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:40,958
[AION] Just how much further
are you willing to go, Chrono?

394
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,416
First humans,
now the pursuers.

395
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,208
I wonder...

396
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:24,333
[AION] Tell me, our Lord
and Savior in Heaven...

397
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,000
Will you still
maintain your silence?

398
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,916
[CHRONO] Aion, I have
a promise to keep.

399
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,083
I'm going to get
back what was taken!

400
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,208
[AION chuckles]

401
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,625
[AION] Is it for her sake?

402
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:38,291
You're the ones who will be
sacrificed... and betrayed.

403
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,875
[CHRONO]
Next episode, "Accomplices."

404
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,375
[AION] I wonder who it will be.

405
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:46,958
Which one will live
to see the end?
